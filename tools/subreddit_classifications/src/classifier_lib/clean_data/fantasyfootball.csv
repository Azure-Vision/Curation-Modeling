fantasyfootball,removed,racism is alive in the nfl cover da whiteboi ya right
fantasyfootball,removed,next year first games for points game soft tissue sprain with no ir weeks average points week when everybody has benched him he goes off for points week injured on second possession moved to ir calling it now
fantasyfootball,removed,once again reread man youre a fuckif idiot i said he would take his targets not have more than him or do better then together cancelled each other out so thanks for further proving my point that youre an idiot lmao
fantasyfootball,removed,i honestly dont believe you one bit
fantasyfootball,removed,so why complain i already won so go suck a dick
fantasyfootball,removed,going through the same thing i dont have an answer
fantasyfootball,removed,i mean hes got millions of dollars so i dont think hell steal your measly bucks
fantasyfootball,removed,last year we went to the del mar racetrack and the person that got last was assigned the favorite and so on
fantasyfootball,removed,we just pick billiard balls out of a bag as people arrive nothing fancy but a little more fun than random
fantasyfootball,removed,my league does the nfl playoff fantasy challenge then we go in order by the final standings and people pick their draft positions one week prior to the draft each person gets hour to make their pick or they get best available
fantasyfootball,removed,i think inverse order of the final standings so instead of in drafting
fantasyfootball,removed,gotta say because if you say lt people might think your about to smoke crack and rape some year olds
fantasyfootball,removed,not sure why this is being automodded there were like posts all day yesterday can we not have some draft target discussion i think this is a perfectly valid discussion topic
fantasyfootball,removed,ugh just made the decision to start marvin jones over michael floyd in my flex now cmike enters the picture in a half point ppr league what would you guys do
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr vets would you go cmike or gio in the flex my first season with this scoring system
fantasyfootball,removed,do you think he will be a better option this year than vance macdonald
fantasyfootball,removed,rawls worth a flex play over diggsshepherd
fantasyfootball,removed,can someone weigh in on l murray or cmike in my flex please its ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,green jesse james or clive
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start him over desean jackson at flex
fantasyfootball,removed,who do i start standard at flex moncrieffgorecmichealjbrowngordon my stud rbs are ap and l miller my opponent started cj
fantasyfootball,removed,the real question jared cook or martellus bennett
fantasyfootball,removed,so who do i pickup when i drop theo riddick for a new tight end full point ppr help a brother out
fantasyfootball,removed,dwayne allen or bennett
fantasyfootball,removed,so walker or bennett
fantasyfootball,removed,ertz bennett or walford
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop either duke johnson jr or matt jones for c mike standard man
fantasyfootball,removed,i have rawls cmike and gore should i just play gore until all this blows over ideally after a week or two either rawls or cmike will come out as the man to have and i can play one of them
fantasyfootball,removed,this sub has shitty mods they got butthurt when a guy made a prediction and said hed eat his goldfish if it didnt work out yet they fully supported and actively encouraged the gordon circlejerk to the point where it was essentially impossible to have an intelligent discussion the week gordon came back from suspension
fantasyfootball,removed,gore or cmike
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start michael over baldwin in my flex ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys rate him higher then julius thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,i need a replacement for gronk eifert witten gates cook cameron gillmore jesse james and walford all available thinking wittengates are proven and will get the targets ppr but some of those other guys especially walford might have better upside its also a keeper league and if whoever i grab goes off they could be nice trade bait or even stay on my roster as potential round draft picks next year thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,i agree i think riddick is set for a good year and he just got dropped in my ppr league considering dropping charles sims or torrey smith for him what do you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,i added him today but i also have martelluswhat do i do
fantasyfootball,removed,considering dropping fuller for dvpany thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,do you guys like him over eron for week and rest of reason as well
fantasyfootball,removed,lmao already picked up mah boi aaron hernandez watch out league
fantasyfootball,removed,ive been trying to figure out how to dig myself it of the eifertsized hole i dug myself would you take him over julius thomas this week for multiple weeks
fantasyfootball,removed,serious question in a league with roster moves all year not counting trades is it worth dropping duke johnson for him
fantasyfootball,removed,christine michael matt forte or michael floyd flex starters are amari cooper dez bryant adrian peterson mark ingram really didnt know where else to turn to ask here
fantasyfootball,removed,marvin vs moncrief idk what to do if only i didnt start dt
fantasyfootball,removed,fuckso should i start doug baldwin or cmike in my flex ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,gordon engage
fantasyfootball,removed,would you play duke johnson or cmike in a ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,i have keenan allen cmike and ware who should i start
fantasyfootball,removed,i like whichever side is getting arob forte
fantasyfootball,removed,do not give away robinson and forte whoever is receiving them is getting the better end of this deal
fantasyfootball,removed,robinsonjeffery fortewilliams
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start christine michael or jordan matthews
fantasyfootball,removed,no no no no no if you get williams he has zero value when bell returns
fantasyfootball,removed,what do you think guys should i start cmike over jeremy hill
fantasyfootball,removed,wdis in the flex langford cmike or lockett
fantasyfootball,removed,bilal powell or alfred morris
fantasyfootball,removed,rank them riddick gio duke johnson frank gore alfmo go
fantasyfootball,removed,bennettwalfordmiller thomas or cook
fantasyfootball,removed,some chronic downvoter with a case of butthurt itt
fantasyfootball,removed,so whats the thoughts on tate vs rawls for a flex im not buying into the cmike hype but this might be too good of an opportunity to pass on
fantasyfootball,removed,in a point ppr league what two would you start james white theo gio or duke with gronk out maybe james white gets a little more love duke returning kick offs worries me any thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,is sims worth playing in standard scoring if im light on rbs
fantasyfootball,removed,give me wilson a better qb and dolphins defense is no good either
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start coates over moncrief
fantasyfootball,removed,jesse james is going to blow up like world trade
fantasyfootball,removed,ypc as a stat is overly responsive to a couple of anomalous long runs which favors coleman as a volatile running back freeman does a better job of putting the offense into favorable down positions freeman also had a higher dvoa which accounts for situationie freeman got more work in short yardage situations which brings down the expected yards per carry and opponent
fantasyfootball,removed,had a kid in league who made it no fun him and his roommate were stacking his team with all their good players i accused him publicly when we were all hanging out and he got really defensive and nasty it killed my attitude towards fantasy that year so i said if the commissioner doesnt do anything i was done for the year was in a playoff push so it wouldve made it boring he sent me a trade offer his worst player for jamal charles saying i heard youre a bitch and cant handle i have the best team so you might as well finish stacking it note the date and the year i gave the and receiver for the but he threw in benjamin who was serviceable his rookie year and a guy named leveon bell note the date and go look at his game log he had touchdown on the season before this with his stacking his team was stafford arian demarcotop rb antonio calvin demaryius julius thomas we made the championship and that team dropped whole points on me i won the league and he and his roommate wasnt invited back the next year
fantasyfootball,removed,oh man now i need to consider benching julius thomas for jesse james decisions decisions
fantasyfootball,removed,guys do i start jesse james or eric ebron
fantasyfootball,removed,drop him for michael thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,james or jared cook also allen is available on the waiver wire as well thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,walford or jesse james
fantasyfootball,removed,jason witten or that james guy
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,sure the upsides there its possible but horribly unsafe
fantasyfootball,removed,better option than graham i dont really trust graham and have been debating on dropping him for another te to back up gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,im a gronk owner so i had to find someone this week to fill in of course martellus is already taken so i had the choice between allen and julius thomas i ended up going with thomas my thoughts are we have already seen how the colts use allen and i wasnt impressed but julius has a lot of upside with the jags
fantasyfootball,removed,zach miller for sure
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks man in my case i do have a te jimmy g and eric ebron hard decision but on any case ai think ebron has a clearer path to produce these kind of situations can be headache if you follow hype trains
fantasyfootball,removed,so in my case i have tes jimmy g and eric ebron i think i definitely need to look into that just to keep one of them that keeps me from jumping on a hype train comfortably
fantasyfootball,removed,would choose him over javorius allen as a flex for this week im thinking ill roll with yeldon if ivory doesnt play
fantasyfootball,removed,this is what i figured i have matt forte im guessing i should roll with him over yeldon its not a ppr league btw
fantasyfootball,removed,its like a scratch off where the prize is always another scratch off
fantasyfootball,removed,i like shepards matchup against the cowboys i think you are getting too cute thinking about eli rogers plus after wheaton gets healthy you wouldnt start rogers over lockett or shepard lockett also has the advantage of gives you a chance to get a kickoff punt return td he returned two last year
fantasyfootball,removed,is his upside that good i have a flex spot to fill in a ppr league my choices are yeldon snead vs oak aiken vs buff and pryor vs phil btw not jokes about pryor someone has to catch the ball for cleveland plus there might be some trick plays for him
fantasyfootball,removed,id stash if youve got the space
fantasyfootball,removed,i drafted gio over hill gio in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,i agree gio over hill in ppr without a doubt standard league id still go with gio over hill jets have a history of a stout d line and strong against the run specifically power backs like hill less passing targets for dalton with sanu marvin jones and eiffert out which means more rb drop offs out of the backfield for gio perhaps a red zone receiving td isnt out of the equation
fantasyfootball,removed,when up against a strong run defense start gio when up against a weak run defense start jeremy hill in ppr i tend to prefer gio regardless
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,should i pick up wentz or bradford
fantasyfootball,removed,who the fuck is this guy in at rb now
fantasyfootball,removed,i mean to be fair we all heard he hurt his foot and left the game not like were going to be intensely watching the rest of the lions game hoping he makes it back in we just all switched over to other games where we knew we had players in it
fantasyfootball,removed,i love these but i liked them more when you said how many points the team would have gained you the previous week
fantasyfootball,removed,keep dixon for sure your call on powell personally im keeping washington on my bench for this week then seeing how he does the next week
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,odell diggs had to combine for less than pts it happened odell broke a game streak with or more targets and had the worst game of his entire career i cant believe it ps the vikings d is so fun to watch
fantasyfootball,removed,dont do that
fantasyfootball,removed,bad
fantasyfootball,removed,use the trade thread also if you dont know the answer to that you are legit the biggest taco ever
fantasyfootball,removed,i have brady and prescott in a standard league and really need help in the rb position and wr division i have zeke but lost woodhead foster and currently starting sims but he will lose his starting role very soon i need help in rb position and it feels like brady is my only true asset i lose watkins and gordon and need help in the wr position as the only starting wr i have are diggs tate robinson and shepard who have all been shitting the bed and arnt going to score enough to take me to playoffs my tight end is julius thomas the jaguars offense is not good enough to win games i need at least quality starters a running back and a wide receiver what is bradys value i could get crabtree and lamar miller for him but i think brady is worth more than that am i wrong
fantasyfootball,removed,ok let me address some things you have down there an and a are more than enough for tom brady additionally i dont know if youre trying to say crabtree is a here because thats probably an overreaction right now and finally qbs have lower trade value than other positions due to high replacement value so if youre trading brady expect to get in return maybe like frank gore and sterling shepard
fantasyfootball,removed,lol full of idiots in here
fantasyfootball,removed,hey thanks for the response i agree that valuable workhorse rbs are hard to come by so far this season i have been starting arobenunwacobbtyrell combination and its just not been effective arob also goes on bye so i felt the need to make a trade for a wr would you say that id leave it as is then id love to trade fosterrawlsrmat but none of these guys have name or production value as of yet waiting for them to break out in an upcoming game in hopes of sending them off for others also my league is flex for context
fantasyfootball,removed,there are specific trade threads daily to use instead of making a post i would try to get anything i could for latavius but it may be too late
fantasyfootball,removed,i have a dilemma right now nflcom league standard points and i am i got proposed a trade for jordy nelson straight up for isaiah crowell do i take it if i accept i am left with lamar miller devonta freeman and kenneth dixon rb i can hope and pray to pick up terrance west temporarily and try and work some trade magic for a stud rb as for wr i currently have mike evans michael crabtree jamison crowder quincy enunwa
fantasyfootball,removed,hey do you still drive like a selfish miserable piece of shit
fantasyfootball,removed,youre definitely not going to get more value for snead than hopkins
fantasyfootball,removed,if you dont take that trade please quit fantasy
fantasyfootball,removed,take it and run
fantasyfootball,removed,just linked this thread to my friend who has dehop and i have snead so everyone be nice and say its fair
fantasyfootball,removed,you take that offer and run hopkins was not a first round pick for no reason he has another tough match up this week and has denver in week but his schedule gets a lot easier
fantasyfootball,removed,are you serious right now
fantasyfootball,removed,why are you typing on reddit instead of breaking your mouse by clicking accept so many times
fantasyfootball,removed,im so irrationally angry that you thought this was a trade that needed contemplation
fantasyfootball,removed,im not sure what to think of snead guy in my league outright dropped him i picked him up and he put up an amazing helping contribute to my first loss i talked to the guy who dropped him saturday before sundays game why he would do that and his reasoning was that the saints spread the ball around too much for snead to be worth anything appears he was right
fantasyfootball,removed,week
fantasyfootball,removed,ne vs philly ros
fantasyfootball,removed,he just played the vikings if he was a hold before this week hes still a hold
fantasyfootball,removed,i dropped him for kirk cousins not looking back
fantasyfootball,removed,id rather have gurley and evans so no great trade
fantasyfootball,removed,absolute steal for you
fantasyfootball,removed,how is he still on the ww
fantasyfootball,removed,how is he even on the waiver two man league
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr greg olsen hypothetical trade offer to start emmanuel sanders frank gore and eric ebron
fantasyfootball,removed,emmanuel sanders ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,a fitzgeraldlacy package
fantasyfootball,removed,how much should an owner who has leveon bell but not deangelo williams be willing to give up for deangelo
fantasyfootball,removed,julio jones need an rb
fantasyfootball,removed,i just got antonio brown for marshall coleman and crabtree team is now luck johnson jennings obj brown reed fitz broncos d gano how did i do any how have i put up the most points overall yet not one a single matchup 🤕
fantasyfootball,removed,dez bryant ppr am i crazy or is having him overall amongst wrs way too low like dave richards did in his fantasy trade chart that just came out
fantasyfootball,removed,larry fitzgerald and forte
fantasyfootball,removed,im a rawls owner and was offered cmike for jordy i quickly rejected
fantasyfootball,removed,i was just offered deandre hopkins and would be giving up dt seems like a home run right
fantasyfootball,removed,if you need an rb for weeks cmike will probably be decent after that who knows
fantasyfootball,removed,marshall has seasons of yards crabtree has
fantasyfootball,removed,marshall because hes the greater talent and will have more opportunities crabtree isnt the best receiver on his own team he will come back down to earth
fantasyfootball,removed,got to stick with marshall crabtree just had a great week
fantasyfootball,removed,jamaal charles standard
fantasyfootball,removed,reputation and past results they are both highend right now
fantasyfootball,removed,marshall but crabtree is always underrated
fantasyfootball,removed,people are sleeping on crabtree thats all im seeing he is being written off because he is the perceived on his own team which i dont think is the case carr and del rio obviously have the utmost faith in him week crabtree was the one and done read for the game winning pt conversion sure it might not last but this has been happening since last year maybe crabtree has just finally found himself in a good offense
fantasyfootball,removed,allen robinson i have a guy inquiring with jeffrey but not sure what the plus should be
fantasyfootball,removed,crabtree is my pick offense looks more fluid than nyj qb more capable tbh it comes down to qb play for me and carr is miles ahead of fitz on that matter
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr bortles arob landry bell mckinnon sssrr pitta cantazaro houston cobb eifert alf dwill enuwa dropped langford moncreif
fantasyfootball,removed,matt jones ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,leveon bell in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,cooper has not looked like the man to me this year but you are not going to find a much better back than murray if you believe in cooper then this is a good trade overalll i personally am worried about cooper the problem with trading for cooper is he still has that name brand value regardless of performance
fantasyfootball,removed,derek carr
fantasyfootball,removed,delanie walker for willie sneads person standard
fantasyfootball,removed,derek carr
fantasyfootball,removed,take it
fantasyfootball,removed,i have cooper and got offered pryor straight up would you do it
fantasyfootball,removed,take gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,looking to trade melvin gordon for mike evens in team standard starting wr but then got offered cook for mckinnon my wrs consist of kelvin diggs and alshon so i have to make a move
fantasyfootball,removed,i traded giovani bernard straight up and got back doug martin just today feels good
fantasyfootball,removed,andrew luck league
fantasyfootball,removed,bite me
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone do this trade i give up jordy l murray barnidge i get hopkins g olsen m wallace a foster
fantasyfootball,removed,im downvoting because you whined about it
fantasyfootball,removed,i just traded sterling shepard and carlos hyde for ingram straight up in a ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,trade thread also dont do it
fantasyfootball,removed,there is a dedicated thread for these trade questions also that trade is horrible
fantasyfootball,removed,i like the idea of selling alshon i wouldnt trade ingram for latavius though latavius is losing touches every week you may be able to pay less for latavius
fantasyfootball,removed,do it
fantasyfootball,removed,latavius murray is going to lose his job to a rbbc of rookies ingram has had to back to back good games and i think the saints realized that hes very important to their success so i think he remains a viable option after the bye week latavius murray is going to be one of the biggest busts of the season ty is probably better than alshon but i just dont even see the need to make this trade
fantasyfootball,removed,obgay haha got him
fantasyfootball,removed,christine michael and alshon jeffery
fantasyfootball,removed,my name is osweiler and im in denial i havent earned a penny of my check in a while i drive everybody nuts by throwing my ducks but i got paid already and dont give any fucks

fantasyfootball,removed,you dumb bitch arguing with me just for doubting cousins a bit panthers pass d is only so lowly ranked because brees and matty ice torched them dumbass
fantasyfootball,removed,same thing happened to me i was in now its all gone because of that fumble
fantasyfootball,removed,im going with team since brown isnt i hate team leagues tho
fantasyfootball,removed,how do you feel about not posting shit
fantasyfootball,removed,pick ppr per pt pts yrds rec td pts return td in the championship game sanders kc cooper vs ind tyreek hill vs denver shepard philly landry buffalo garcon chicago
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start ty mo over ware or howard
fantasyfootball,removed,its called a support thread dickhead
fantasyfootball,removed,well at this point in time i have the option of cam matt moore of kaep id say if you can find a more consistent passer with a better matchup then dont start him atlanta defense is soft against qbs but this is a divisional game as is the ravens vs steelers in this situation id go cam
fantasyfootball,removed,do i play montgomery over ajayi this week
fantasyfootball,removed,thank god it didnt its the only reason im in the championship im starting him this week because theyre up against the bears who are ranked in yards allowed to receivers carolina was ranked second so theoretically he should have had a good game but carolinas defense is known for showing up big like they did last night i doubt chicago will do the same only reason i would pull crowder is if its snowing in chicago when they play
fantasyfootball,removed,im having a real hard time choosing between the giants and gb gb is thriving off interceptions while bradford doesnt throw many the giants d has been playing great but its a thursday night game which scares me eli could flop and put the defense in bad situations
fantasyfootball,removed,team team
fantasyfootball,removed,ty yes hightower fuck no
fantasyfootball,removed,i still wonder if ingram might get a surprise benching this week after his antics last game if there are signs that might happen before the game id feel safe playing hightower but otherwise i wouldnt roll the dice
fantasyfootball,removed,keep your kicker
fantasyfootball,removed,kicker should be fine imo probably could use a different defense id check and see which defenses available are ranked best there

fantasyfootball,removed,would you value him above rawls or martin ros
fantasyfootball,removed,yea i have rawls martin and ajayi i like martins schedule the most both rawls and ajayi are tough i dont know who to trade off out of them
fantasyfootball,removed,you can drop him he is now a healthy scratch two weeks in a row kelly has been looking good no major fumbles and just came up from a huge game this week he will get cut by the skins i can almost assure u
fantasyfootball,removed,hahahaha yeah drop him and pick up kenneth farrow
fantasyfootball,removed,completely not your fault its more just an example of how there are unexpected results every week and i have a good track record of making the wrong moves really appreciated your input anyway just glad to see some action on the idp thread
fantasyfootball,removed,kenneth dixon
fantasyfootball,removed,well idk whose on waivers in your league but ivory powell and smallwood are all under owned ivory could be great ros depending on yeldons injury smallwood should dominate touches for the next few weeks because of mathews and sproles injuries powell is alive
fantasyfootball,removed,cmike totally going to knile davis his way back to the hawks just you wait the fools who doubt the hype will have regret for dropping dont though in all seriousness this is for adddrop thread with more details no one has any idea of knowing what your situation is or who the fuck your choices are

fantasyfootball,removed,this is like that scene in game of thrones where theon thinks hes gonna have sex with those two girls in the torture chamber but instead bolton cuts his cock off
fantasyfootball,removed,i would make your decision based on qb quality and say crabtree with confidence he gets a lot of red zone looks and the secondary is going to be incredibly winded with less oxygen carr can take advantage of that i dont believe brock can
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,i know cleveland is a bad team but as the weather gets worse and their qbs suck they should be running the ball more i am not sure i would give up crow
fantasyfootball,removed,first overall pick next year imo

fantasyfootball,removed,week scores are final elias updated nfl january after scores for week have been made final is from until forever i think people are here looking for when between forever and now will we be paid httpfantasynflcomresearchstatcorrections
fantasyfootball,removed,how long they can be kept for and at what cost are important questions for keeper leagues also what your starter composition is every week and what other players are being kept and a flex vs rb wr if its the first three rounds from a snake league and you can start three rbs bell is an obvious one and i would agree with your logic on keeping freeman and howard
fantasyfootball,removed,nigga pay up
fantasyfootball,removed,couldnt agree more after all this is a team that willingly not only rosters but gives carries to andre williams who is statistically one of if not the worst running back to receive somewhat significant usage in nfl history
fantasyfootball,removed,well these are all guidelines not hard fast rules gotskowski is probably the only exception at k for me right now and i certainly would draft him if he is around once ive got all my other starting positions filled and there is not a good gamble at wrrb that is unlikely to happen though as someone is going to grab him before i would after him im not gambling on any kicker when streaming kickers does fine similarly if den def or sea is around at pick yeah im probably going to grab them i am not grabbing them where they typically go though which is many rounds ahead of them and past them i am not drafting any def before my last pick as they change too much year to year as such i have yet to draft a def early there are exceptions to other ones too but hopefully this helps clarify my intent
fantasyfootball,removed,i just told you i have the highest scoring team in the league my last three losses were to the lowest scoring team in the league in a team standard average score is like i had a late first i didnt really like the wrs available and i was really high on allenmurraygordon so i took what i thought was going to be a consistently aboveaverage qb and grabbed a stud wr on the turnaround obviously those picks didnt work for me but most of my draft did even with allen tearing his acl if cam and marshall performed like they were projected to id have a juggernaut
fantasyfootball,removed,i was referring to marshall but if you dont recognize how good keenan allen is on the field i think that says something too all im getting at here is dont give me that im not surprised youre because of one pick i made fuck off
fantasyfootball,removed,giving crabtree for josh brown woulda gave me a good punch with ray rice whose been on my ir spot for years but someone beat me to it also they abuse women
fantasyfootball,removed,thoo
fantasyfootball,removed,ok buddy phenomenal hindsight
fantasyfootball,removed,jeezus when it rains it pours i had matt ryan mike evans odell britt melvin gordon leveon meh in ppr ebron and latavius with davante adams on the bench have like in ppr lol gonna put up like next week i bet
fantasyfootball,removed,hope you played ingram like i suggested
fantasyfootball,removed,go whine by yourself dude
fantasyfootball,removed,damn bro you having a bad week in fantasy or real life
fantasyfootball,removed,httpgamesespncomfflresourceshelpcontentnamescoringsettingsstandard
fantasyfootball,removed,you buttraped that guy even if the vikes d played like the bears ros
fantasyfootball,removed,espn has it listed as pass rush for a total where are you seeing
fantasyfootball,removed,bullshit having used espn nfl and yahoo last season espn is clearly better than the other two yahoos draft app and browser gui are complete garbage and looks as if the developer allowed his year old child to lay it out
fantasyfootball,removed,completely agree the guy is made of fucking glass i will never draft this fool again id rather draft anyotjer rbs handcuff before this joker
fantasyfootball,removed,if i had to choose one id say miller
fantasyfootball,removed,viperep points days ago they are the clear top dst this year id rather not get rid of them
fantasyfootball,removed,espn got it after the game
fantasyfootball,removed,they will both get you one point
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont think you can go wrong i would personally go with the seahawks since theyre at home
fantasyfootball,removed,you cant go wrong with either but i would definitely pick the seahawks seattle has done well fantasy wise against much better offenses this year
fantasyfootball,removed,seahawks at home for sure
fantasyfootball,removed,youre saying you have a narrow lead and your opponent opponent has no one left to play just dont start anyone
fantasyfootball,removed,sea home and it is not even remotely close endthread
fantasyfootball,removed,i need yards or a touchdown from jimmy graham to tie
fantasyfootball,removed,frank the floor gore
fantasyfootball,removed,gordon was still completely unproven now take his cock and balls out of your mouth
fantasyfootball,removed,what is your go to porn
fantasyfootball,removed,first gordon for evans isnt crazy just send somebody forte murray cmike and booker for like hilton or cooper
fantasyfootball,removed,dude your league sucks leave or dont and accept it those are your options
fantasyfootball,removed,got it lemme get an opinion would you drop enunwa or gillislee for jj nelson i am not the shady owner keeping him so that the owner cant have him basically and lotto ticket
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop enunwa for jj
fantasyfootball,removed,maybe try to sell high on latavius gordon for evans is an okay trade i suppose if you really need the wr id be a little worried about rb depth if you lose gordon i think cmike booker and forte might be on the downswing ive had a similar problem with trades because everytime i go to make a trade the guy i want to trade is coming off a bad week i was in bye week hell this week and had a trade lined up this upcoming week to trade landry but even though he has been getting tons of targets nobody in my league wants him since he only put up points yesterday
fantasyfootball,removed,got it would you drop gillislee or enunwa for jj nelson i do not own shady just keeping gill as a lotto
fantasyfootball,removed,ok youre just fucking dense then
fantasyfootball,removed,i need less than between c mike and hausch to scrape a win
fantasyfootball,removed,im so conflicted i only need pts to win i have a flex spot open my opponent is done i have gill goodwin and lockett and the option to grab kearse from waivers leaning to starting lockett because gill is the backup and goodwin is only a deep threat what would you do
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start baldwin or mccoy in the flex
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt give up much maybe a wr around the tier of golden tate or edelman if that hes throw too many picks his first two seasons and i dont think hell be putting up the elite stats for at least another seasons if he does then that means i dont know if hes more than a bench player for a while and im hoping he becomes more than a low to mid which is far from guaranteed at the id be happy taking a wr mike williams or corey davis arent at the amari cooperaj green level of prospect but theyre just a bit below that
fantasyfootball,removed,finished the regular season won the position on points bell and zeke carried me through cooper falling off a cliff eifert hurting and my constant decision between rivers and russell bell killed it in the first round while my opponent was not getting ben and browns points bell and zeke came through huge in week but clay won me the day handcuff deangelo williams was huge today small decisions made a huge difference at the end of the season fuck yeah
fantasyfootball,removed,high fucking five
fantasyfootball,removed,i finished i had the same seeding fucking slayed
fantasyfootball,removed,i picked him up in a trade early in the season had bell on the bench due to suspension and mark ingrahm starting traded ingrahm and tyler boyd for doug baldwin and deangelo williams that trade was huge for me and was the pairing i needed with zeke to pull this championship off
fantasyfootball,removed,can you be my personal fantasy advisor next season
fantasyfootball,removed,rodgers gill if shady is for sure out and cmike
fantasyfootball,removed,i would recommend gurley and jquizz i would also reccomend to use the right thread wdis
fantasyfootball,removed,in order to not have this sub flooded by these requests please use the wdis threads next time
fantasyfootball,removed,all you did was disagree with me while providing no substance cause youre a moron with bad ideas this bad idea that you presented the class is particularly stupid because its wholly unnecessary if you want to be able to combine any two rbs points all you would have to do is add another rb starting spot in the league the result would be the same as this stupid half point split bullshit idea you suggested now shut up
fantasyfootball,removed,gurley michaels quizz i like gilislee but quizz is going to get all he can handle vs the worst run defense in the league
fantasyfootball,removed,carlos hyde is banged up but id like to think you could get a lot more for brady alone than those two id talk to both owners but i cant really see a situation where anyone would legitimately accept this trade
fantasyfootball,removed,everyone who has a better option
fantasyfootball,removed,i am thinking about benching him for gillislee
fantasyfootball,removed,i have jaquizz and demarco murray so no
fantasyfootball,removed,pick up josh brownhell definitely help you beat your opponent
fantasyfootball,removed,im a skins fan and you sound like an idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard im with a soso team theyre with a crap team my luck alshon mckinnon their zeke
fantasyfootball,removed,and then fuck rape yo bitch
fantasyfootball,removed,i always wear this fuckin hat you idiot because it matches my shoes youre acting like a little butthurt baby just because my fuckin cousin wants to roll with us
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck off
fantasyfootball,removed,put it this way i wish my opponent was sitting him
fantasyfootball,removed,im so torn bell is the reason im here now who do i play when zeke is getting possibly series i had deangelo riding my bench all year threw in rawls grabbed blue and toussaint now i have no clue who to play
fantasyfootball,removed,benched for rawls im unsure about my bell backup however toussaint or williams i may have a better matchup elsewhere but im struggling to see it
fantasyfootball,removed,tough choice detroit needs this game and stafford will work the field ebron did well last week and i see a similar week this week probably a td chargers have little to play for other than pride rivers and gates are tight and will want to go out on a good note of course rivers will look to force gates the ball in the red zone most likely probably results in scores with a pick in there too kc locks down the wr which helps gates just my thoughts if you are looking g for high floor id say ebron as a safety valve for stafford high ceiling is gates who rivers may want to feed
fantasyfootball,removed,i would roll with clay one hit and reed will be limited dude is glasstalented as shit but glass the qb change in buffalo does concern me a bit but maybe clay having a good few weeks is because he knew rex was on his way out and wanted to shine
fantasyfootball,removed,steelers miami offense is much better than cleveland miami wants to win cleveland needs the draft pick
fantasyfootball,removed,denver qb change in oakland throws off the timing and the denver secondary is too good not to take advantage of it
fantasyfootball,removed,huge hawks fan herei would agree kaep will get rushing yards and challenge the sea defense la just sucks only other thought is that the only team with something to play for is seattle may encourage a good performance against an unmotivated opponent
fantasyfootball,removed,in the same boat as you i am rolling with pitt as of right now tough to pick against a team facing cle as a hawks fan i am wondering if they are going to play hard for the second seed against an unmotivated sf team this is hard
fantasyfootball,removed,good luck
fantasyfootball,removed,who is your other option he gets hit once and hes going to be hurt super talented but very fragile
fantasyfootball,removed,id roll with buffalo brandon marshall was ruled out and the jets are a mess vikings spirit is broken
fantasyfootball,removed,jared cook vs det or clay vs jets
fantasyfootball,removed,murray burkhead toussaint
fantasyfootball,removed,mccoy ride or die with my guy if im you quizz for the volume rawls vs murray is tough defense is bad but denver is terrible at stopping the run as well if the hawks want to put it on sf which pete may elect to do rawls is a great choice if denver defense is checked out murray could play well however washington will get carries too i would roll with rawls for the higher floor between the two
fantasyfootball,removed,i would agree with you i cant trust mcfadden plus he has been ill this week and im not talking about the beastie boys
fantasyfootball,removed,ryan hands down
fantasyfootball,removed,ryan would be my choice high floor and high ceiling bortles and smith have decent ceilings but low floors
fantasyfootball,removed,starting lineup has deangelo williams as the starter thats who im going to play
fantasyfootball,removed,blue with the volume for a high floor
fantasyfootball,removed,ajayi will be watched carefully with his shoulder miami isnt moving with a win and they want to be healthy on the playoffs
fantasyfootball,removed,i was between him and d thomas but i think im gonna go hill likely they dont start til so i can see how my players are doing hahaha
fantasyfootball,removed,is blue benched
fantasyfootball,removed,o shut the fuck up reddit you buncha flip switchin bandwagon hoppin downvotin motherfuckers you all had the same opinion that he sucked on the rams you didnt like my nickname sammy slangshot and i told you he was gonna shit all over this sub keep acting like you all knew all along
fantasyfootball,removed,ive been debating moving down from to in my team standard league just so i can grab someone like lamar and arobbmarsh just hate the fact that im picking at the turn of that most studs are gone and im left reaching for guys i like
fantasyfootball,removed,i am keeping him in the not even worried about it
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got the pick in a rushing yards ppr league assuming the big receivers ap dj and gurley plus a quarterback guys in my league love their qbs lamar is my pick right idk if thats crazy or not i need someone to talk me into or out of it thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,the texans just need to come up with a compromise at this point call it something catchy like the compromise or something
fantasyfootball,removed,number in a ppram i crazy to take him either miller mccoy or charles will be there
fantasyfootball,removed,i thought this was a black joke at first glance
fantasyfootball,removed,do it according to httpwwwfootballguyscompickvaluehtm you will improve
fantasyfootball,removed,im in a keeper league where we pick keepers my keeper is between jones and abdullahwhich direction would you go i already got marriota kevin white cooks and walker
fantasyfootball,removed,i have the pick in a standard would you recommend taking him on the way back up overall
fantasyfootball,removed,gurley or miller
fantasyfootball,removed,in a ppr leauge with dez being my keeperwould you rather draft hopkins or miller at zeke isnt suspended and goes
fantasyfootball,removed,im right there with ya man im having trouble deciding i can keep langford matt jones dion lewis or josh gordon for the same price in a ppr league can keep out of those between langford and jones i think id go with langford at this point
fantasyfootball,removed,okay so do i keep him as a firstrounder our draft order is determined after the keeper deadline so he could end up being the pick or the pick or anywhere in between deadlines the so i still have time to get confirmation of the reduced suspension
fantasyfootball,removed,this makes my decision of keeping bell with the last pick in the vs lamar miller with the first pick in the that much harder
fantasyfootball,removed,should i take him at overall in a league nonppr or wait to see if hes there at overall
fantasyfootball,removed,worth keeping him for or cut my losses and spend a bit more and get a stud that will be ready for week
fantasyfootball,removed,doesnt make my decision to keep him over dj or lamar any easier
fantasyfootball,removed,guess that means i can keep him now was debating him or amari cooper
fantasyfootball,removed,cool thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr where would you feel confident taking him now
fantasyfootball,removed,dude youre an idiot and making this way harder than it actually is you obviously dont know anything about the patriots or football in general good luck with fantasy this year youll need it
fantasyfootball,removed,simple as the fact that he turns this year and is coming off of a major knee surgery
fantasyfootball,removed,miller and wilson imo thats too much for freeman unless this is a ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,good bye jews
fantasyfootball,removed,should i keep bell or martin in a team ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,i have mckinnon should o trade for dwill
fantasyfootball,removed,i have dwill as a keeper crazy to take bell at was thinking of doing that and the getting charles with my rounder yesno
fantasyfootball,removed,downvote for complaining about downvotes
fantasyfootball,removed,cooks over cooper
fantasyfootball,removed,i was going to use a round keeper for him but i could use a round keeper for bcooks instead what do you all think
fantasyfootball,removed,this what i was referring to
fantasyfootball,removed,👍
fantasyfootball,removed,yes those were literally your only two options
fantasyfootball,removed,i also have mike evans brandon marshall marvin jones and tajae sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,id roll with shep browns qb sit is too iffy
fantasyfootball,removed,i really wasnt high on mark ingram at the beginning of the year because no never really respects the run and ingram seems to be a lock to miss time every year at this point what can i expect to get for him and would i be better off to ship him away at a low price or sit on him and pray for something to come around ive got crowell and mathews sitting behind him and they look infinitely more attractive then he does looking for any advice on this as anyone i ask is really unsure
fantasyfootball,removed,to echo the other comments averaged points per game means they would have scored points total so far or an average of points in each of weeks and needs to say either points total or an average of points per game just for clarity when other people start seeing this
fantasyfootball,removed,no thats way too much and rudolph is getting targets
fantasyfootball,removed,nah
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr team my a rob for d johnson ive got but only cja and d freeman as rbs
fantasyfootball,removed,i hope you die
fantasyfootball,removed,enunwa or tyrell
fantasyfootball,removed,both dorsett and enunwa are fa in my league and i cant decide which one i want to pick up i only have one spot available who is the better add i like enunwa here but i dont know if he can keep up his current production each week
fantasyfootball,removed,in a league with shallow benches would you guys rather have sims or jeremy hill the next few weeks
fantasyfootball,removed,who should i pick up theo riddick or dwayne washington
fantasyfootball,removed,grabbed washington from waivers and dropped asiata good move
fantasyfootball,removed,mckinnon or washington and why
fantasyfootball,removed,is rawls droppable for d wash
fantasyfootball,removed,would verden or ajayi possibly be a better pick up than washington martin foster abdullah owner here
fantasyfootball,removed,drop abdullah for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,i am in standardscoring league should i also grab d washington even though i already have theo riddick
fantasyfootball,removed,dwayne or asiata
fantasyfootball,removed,man down i have been holding deon lewis in ir slot should i drop and put abdullah in there
fantasyfootball,removed,drop b powell for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop powell for washington i have marshall so even if forte went down i would be afraid of having too many eggs in one basket

fantasyfootball,removed,drop ajayi for him
fantasyfootball,removed,so i have a cap on rb slots i have rawls cmike ware and ryan mathews is there any of the i can realistically drop to take a chance on dwayne or is this a backfield i should stay away from
fantasyfootball,removed,drop d funchess for d washington
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop spencer ware for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,im assuming ware ivory or sharpe would be worth dropping for him at least not right now
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm if i already own riddick worth picking up washington tempted to try my hand at mccluster instead
fantasyfootball,removed,only droppable backs are gore sims or crowell have to stash ap and can only have backs thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,just did this couldnt decide between morris torry smith fozzy or vereen i am leaning toward morris because i doubt he ever fully takes over dallas
fantasyfootball,removed,would you rather have fozzy or dwash
fantasyfootball,removed,drop bilal powell
fantasyfootball,removed,drop yeldon for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,with both abduallah and martin going down who are you picking up theo washington or sims
fantasyfootball,removed,drop sproles for washington in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,worth dropping yeldongore for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,as a martin owner should i pick us sims or is coleman the better option
fantasyfootball,removed,can only roster rbs lacy forte rawls and foster am i crazy to drop foster for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,drop arian foster for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,in standard league should i pick up washington riddick or sims
fantasyfootball,removed,who should i drop out of these three dwayne allen jacob tamme antonio gates
fantasyfootball,removed,is sims worth rostering over snead
fantasyfootball,removed,sims and riddick are both available in my league who should i pickup
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop tyler lockett for washington in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,grabbed washington and dropped my defense doubt i will be able to keep him though ill offer him up to the abdullah owner maybe the only other candidate i have to drop is morris
fantasyfootball,removed,is he better than mckinnon
fantasyfootball,removed,sims riddick and washington are available in my league who should i pickup
fantasyfootball,removed,riddick and washington both available washington the better longterm add
fantasyfootball,removed,only player i can drop for him is riddick worth it in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,worth dropping either cmike or gio for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,cut gurley for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,washington has a better chance at being as high as an imo
fantasyfootball,removed,you dont plan on needing a rb until week the ffb gods smile upon thee
fantasyfootball,removed,should i grab dwayne over mccluster in a ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,anyone like kenyon drake over washington
fantasyfootball,removed,drop funchess for him or rob kelley or drop both and pick up miata as well
fantasyfootball,removed,drop duke johnson for washington have riddick

fantasyfootball,removed,can i drop barnidge for washington i have julius thomas as my other te
fantasyfootball,removed,who to drop out of martellus bennett james white victor cruz and jay ajayi or stick with what ive got
fantasyfootball,removed,drop cap for dwayne

fantasyfootball,removed,would you start sims or riddick
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,dwayne or deandre washington
fantasyfootball,removed,drop forsett for dwayne washington i already have riddick
fantasyfootball,removed,youre fine sharpe is the clear wr on ten and will be seeing the ball a lot this week vs oak i would have made the same move actually dropped matthews this week as well
fantasyfootball,removed,only droppable options for me are henry and langford but neither seem like a good choice for a waiver lottery ticket lions seem like pass first anyways would anyone drop either of them for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,drop chris hogan for dwayne washington
fantasyfootball,removed,droppable eifert enunwa or cmike for dwayne
fantasyfootball,removed,drop crowell for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,probably not
fantasyfootball,removed,id rather own matthews than fuller proven commodity vs rookie who should decline two weeks of stellar play might want to try to trade him before cutting though he is a darling right now
fantasyfootball,removed,id grab mckinnon yes
fantasyfootball,removed,drop alfred morris for him team league dont own zeke
fantasyfootball,removed,i think ajayi has marginally more upside than drake
fantasyfootball,removed,no if youve held gordon this long i wouldnt cut him yet
fantasyfootball,removed,one week play i like tamme
fantasyfootball,removed,i would hold riddick here
fantasyfootball,removed,pick up washington and drop james white

fantasyfootball,removed,yes there is and its idiotic

fantasyfootball,removed,rbs devonta freeman tevin coleman charles sims jerick mckinnon and spencer ware wrs larry fitzgerald ty hilton randall cobb quincy enunwa tyrell williams and willie snead
fantasyfootball,removed,heres the link check reverse order option
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr no flex small bench drop sims for riddick
fantasyfootball,removed,think sims against a vicious rams dst is a better play than edelman with a rookie qb against another strong houston dst im legit torn
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop bennett for this kid i already have pitta
fantasyfootball,removed,i have cousins and flacco is cousins droppable for washington my other rbs on the ropes are matt joneshe sucks but at least starts and alfred morris
fantasyfootball,removed,ok legit need help been holding dixon do i drop him for washington and see how it pans out or keep dixon
fantasyfootball,removed,but to drop matt jones for washington 🤔
fantasyfootball,removed,i was just offered isaiah crowell for theo riddick straight up ppr leaguewhat do you all think
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop sharpe or williams for dwayne washington i have lots of wrs but have less rbs or should i wait for sharpe or williams to go off and try to sell high for a trade
fantasyfootball,removed,so if you already have theo still take washington just in case
fantasyfootball,removed,drop sanu for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,drop abdullah for mccluster no ir spots
fantasyfootball,removed,i could use some advice about my situation right now im starting jcware own both and riddick at rb with t williams at flex i have ap and warejc on my bench gore sims and washington are fa questions should i drop alex smith for one of them which one should i start one of them this week gore v sd and sims v la have much better matchups than either of the kc backs v nyj im thinking yes sims and maybe sims over riddick but id love some other opinions
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop john brown for him ive got a lot of benched wrs and need a backup rb desperately
fantasyfootball,removed,drop derrick henry for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,who should i drop to pick him up alfred morris or duke johnson
fantasyfootball,removed,i cant decide who to pick up between him and kenneth dixon both are speculative adds less competition in detroit but dixon clearly more talented thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,drop ajayi for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,is it worth dropping fleener to pick up washington i have pitta to take over at te
fantasyfootball,removed,drop corey coleman emmanuel sanders duke johnson justin forsett or shane vereen for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,drop sims for dwayne
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys drop dorsett for washington

fantasyfootball,removed,drop starks for washington uneasy about it since i have lacy
fantasyfootball,removed,drop duke johnson or ware for washington
fantasyfootball,removed,drop him for washington can only roster backs and i have cj gore ap crowell and sims
fantasyfootball,removed,i pretty much have to start him in my ppr league due to injuries but am honestly still debating vereen or james white over him i think hes going to have a brutal week
fantasyfootball,removed,sorry to hijack this but someone dropped ivory in my league would you guys consider using a dropping sproles ww spot for him
fantasyfootball,removed,rashad jennings or chris ivory
fantasyfootball,removed,no bud doesnt work like that give me your examples obj randy moss anquan boldin were exceptions
fantasyfootball,removed,the jamaalcalypse begins

fantasyfootball,removed,someone dropped him to pick up jalen richard so hes on waivers until saturday i have the position so i have to give it a go and drop starks for him right my rbs eddie lacy rashad jennings jonathan stewart deangelo williams james starks alfred morris problem is ill be struggling to roster two running backs next week with lacy on bye and d will back on the bench assuming stewart is still out i need someone respectable to pair with jennings im afraid of waiting to hear back about ivory and missing kenyan drake matt asiata or jordan howard already missed out on dwayne washington because i saw the news minutes later than the abdullah owner
fantasyfootball,removed,are you in my narffl league httpiimgurcomqrpvpzapng
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt want to play in your league this trade is fair
fantasyfootball,removed,pick up dorsett for sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,is he droppable
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr drop moncrief for dorsett
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop him for dorsett or pick up tyrell williams
fantasyfootball,removed,sanu or dorsett
fantasyfootball,removed,team man bench would you drop him
fantasyfootball,removed,damn so tough for me to decide between dorsett tyrell sanu and coco i already have ajg evans and floyd with j gordon waiting in the wings
fantasyfootball,removed,he can still work out its a shoulder injury not something that prevents him from staying fit imo
fantasyfootball,removed,so i have hilton and dorsett worth keeping dorsett and starting him alongside hilton in favorable matchups im nervous i wont get fair value for dorsett if i try to trade him and hilton is a protected player so i cant move him
fantasyfootball,removed,drop floyd for dorsett floyds production has been awful even while getting targets but that could improve
fantasyfootball,removed,man this sucks i have him in a man bench keeper league hed only cost me a rounder next year do i keep him on my bench
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trade moncrief and ware for jordan mathews and powell in a ppr league forte owner i have dorsett so losing moncrief isnt a huge blow since he was on my bench anyway
fantasyfootball,removed,john brown what to do with him
fantasyfootball,removed,drop one for dorsett t sharpe or t lockett
fantasyfootball,removed,you shouldnt carry tes so yes
fantasyfootball,removed,drop corey coleman how about will fuller
fantasyfootball,removed,drop for enunwa
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard is is better long term tyrell williams dorsett or sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,either one of these gentlemen worth picking up and starting over tcoleman
fantasyfootball,removed,explain this
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys start mckinnon over sims
fantasyfootball,removed,my running backs are elliot jamaal charles gore yeldon and coleman in the order i drafted him starting him this week but benching him most hopefully

fantasyfootball,removed,im no expert but dwayne seems like he has a lot more upside than either panther back
fantasyfootball,removed,its not about the projections idiot its the fact that if they have him at they dont expect him to play makes me wonder what news came out to make them change them from to i couldnt find anything
fantasyfootball,removed,enunwa wont draw double coverages will usually matchup with slower linebackers and smaller corners
fantasyfootball,removed,dorsett
fantasyfootball,removed,enunwa of those choices is dorsett available
fantasyfootball,removed,this isnt him though just some bitch whose thirsty and looking for an easy target hopefully the situation plays out like drose and she wont be able to make false accusations under the guise of anonymity

fantasyfootball,removed,i will say russel peters has an excellent bit about this getting offended on behalf of others is far more racist and insensitive than making jokes
fantasyfootball,removed,for those of us who missed it what was the original title
fantasyfootball,removed,thats cause youre low iq

fantasyfootball,removed,zeke is fat and looks like hes running in quick sand he lacks vision due to his multiple chins he most definitely has jiggle but lacks the appropriate amount of wiggle one might confuse him for eddie fat asthma lacey if he wasnt wearing a cowboys jersey
fantasyfootball,removed,i was just offered a trade of my demaryius thomas and eifert for his brandin cooks should i bite
fantasyfootball,removed,i just traded to get him im just wondering what everyones thoughts are moving forward i think hell turn it around
fantasyfootball,removed,you think i lost the trade
fantasyfootball,removed,drop fozzy cameron has the start but i wouldnt be excited to start either him or fozzy
fantasyfootball,removed,i already did it dwayne train choo choo motherfuckers
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah thats the issue im facing right now i am thin at rb forsett rawls or cmike will be my but really like the idea of buying low but at i need to make moves to win games now to even make the playoffs
fantasyfootball,removed,should i trade away langford for him
fantasyfootball,removed,fair to trade stewart and baldwin for him

fantasyfootball,removed,worth it to try and trade spencer ware and baldwin for maclin and doig martin
fantasyfootball,removed,thats trade rape right there a fourth or fifth round pick for a first round pick you can stream tes to an extent youre fucked if you dont have solid rbs tho
fantasyfootball,removed,what do people here think would be a fair trade to get martin would matt jones sterling shepard be an offensive offer
fantasyfootball,removed,lol
fantasyfootball,removed,are you starting edelman
fantasyfootball,removed,id absolutely take it
fantasyfootball,removed,demarco is gonna keep doing his thing all season if healthy hes a special back
fantasyfootball,removed,absolutely take bell for murray bell is one of the few down workhorses in the league and will put up consistent numbers as long as hes healthynot suspended
fantasyfootball,removed,he will for weeks before he gets injured
fantasyfootball,removed,i would do that trade murray might fade as the season progresses henry went from percent of the snaps week to percent
fantasyfootball,removed,take the trade
fantasyfootball,removed,what if you own kelce and hes a fa in a teamer
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks for the shut post
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trade mckinnon for ivory who has more upside
fantasyfootball,removed,lamar miller
fantasyfootball,removed,what happened to the nazi post
fantasyfootball,removed,hopkins hill matthews
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,rams
fantasyfootball,removed,ajayi or lamar miller
fantasyfootball,removed,try the wdis thread
fantasyfootball,removed,deazley
fantasyfootball,removed,there are threads for this
fantasyfootball,removed,beasley is not comparable to decker at all
fantasyfootball,removed,edit sorry if i upset anyone thinking that this specifically pertains to my team i really just wanted to start a discussion on these two as i think its something that should be done not only for this game but for all others lolwut the two arent even comparable
fantasyfootball,removed,you should just talk about the dallas passing attack as a whole or people are gonna flame you that being said beasley is on the down swing dez is the target and witten has been drawing targets beasley is nothing more than a flex at this point in the season every other receiver not previously mention doesnt matter
fantasyfootball,removed,i do have theo riddick in a ppr league what do you think about that
fantasyfootball,removed,a proper way to word it would have been discussion dallas passcatchers going forward this allows for a discussion including all aspects of the passing game you asked specifically about two players in dez and cole
fantasyfootball,removed,levbell martin hyde and ajayi this is basically a first world problem for me every week
fantasyfootball,removed,would you play him over ware blount and latavius murray this week
fantasyfootball,removed,i have jenningsrawls and dlewis i already started stewart
fantasyfootball,removed,going mccoy dj ware and leaving ajayi rawls lewis on the bench this week
fantasyfootball,removed,pick three lamar miller vs oak frank gore vs ten im pretty much locked on these two this mostly about my flex but if anyone has strong objections ill listen flex rawls or prosise vs phi jordan howard vs nyg robert kelly vs gb thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,both starks and forsett are going to be td dependent because they wont get enough volume start whoever you think has a higher chance of scoring each week
fantasyfootball,removed,i think we have seen the most of starks production for this season green bay is done with him not being productive with his touches especially with being a passfirst offense cmike kind of fell off as the season went on as well but is a bit better than starks if you can grab forsett and have a droppable wr i would get him
fantasyfootball,removed,youre fucked ripkowski seeing goal line work and the packers reverting back to ty montgomery in the backfield after starks and michael flop around for a few series the on the other hand you want to drop one of them for forsett who isnt going to do shit with the broncos against the titans chiefs and patriots if i were you id drop one of em for marshawn lynch or john kuhn and go out like a boss not giving a fuck
fantasyfootball,removed,it was also a very different weather situation last time for carr chiefs are dead last in fantasy points for receivers and oakland is a passing team although on a short week tough choice but id say carr if its snowing in gb
fantasyfootball,removed,as a packer fan i advise you to stay away last week i predicted ripkowski would outgain starks and it somehow came true however i understand that team leagues have basically nothing on the waivers so stick with starks rather than the guy who has been on like teams this year
fantasyfootball,removed,who are the top rbs on your waiver wire
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,id dump starks for forsett starks sucks and played of snaps last week forsett sucks too but he might play more
fantasyfootball,removed,considering you didnt use your waiver wire id naturally assume your pick ups had to be fas
fantasyfootball,removed,commissioner should add them back and lock their team
fantasyfootball,removed,must be a public league
fantasyfootball,removed,same now id give obj for a solid defense and kicker every day of the week
fantasyfootball,removed,im going with houston hosting jax week and sd vs cleveland week
fantasyfootball,removed,may sound weird but the best trade i made all season was not trading ajayi or howard
fantasyfootball,removed,p
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck well there are only teams left i put in a waiver request for him well see if i get him back if i do who would you roll with we get wrs and a flex i have fitzgerald cooks marvin jones willie snead desean jackson
fantasyfootball,removed,cucks
fantasyfootball,removed,wdis thread
fantasyfootball,removed,i see what you did there
fantasyfootball,removed,you got banned unbanned then came back to comment on my post all because i didnt like lamar miller who by the way put up another stinker just let it go dude lol
fantasyfootball,removed,big ben or winston
fantasyfootball,removed,funny you mention this because your mom just blew me for
fantasyfootball,removed,if you get this before the post is deleted which is will probably be i think theres a good chance that gio puts up at least his numbers last year probably more with eifert out
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah next time be sure to put this question in the proper lineup thread gio is said to get more slot time with eifert out keep in mind too no jones and sanu sure they have boyd and lafell but i could see dalton going to him a lot as a trustworthy target
fantasyfootball,removed,because charles believes in god
fantasyfootball,removed,went with ryan matthews over him in my draft tonight the only decision ill probably regret but i have to take that freaking upside when i am very content with my first picks stay healthy glass
fantasyfootball,removed,good thing that cancer is doing its job
fantasyfootball,removed,no too much competition for touches between hopkins strong and whoever else
fantasyfootball,removed,oh absolutely if foster beats the odds and manages to stay healthy all season i fully expect similar numbers to forte last year thats completely plausible now hes just gotta beat those odds and stay healthy
fantasyfootball,removed,id stay away from john brown too many weapons on offense you never know who palmer likes better that day
fantasyfootball,removed,brown over benjamin for me thinking months down the line would much rather have him than travis benjamin assuming the health gets good as the season starts no question
fantasyfootball,removed,c
fantasyfootball,removed,my ball zach ertz
fantasyfootball,removed,trade him if somebody is dumb enough to trade for him in this nfl climate you can pick up a reliable starter off the ww every week
fantasyfootball,removed,i would wait to trade him once he is back in the lineup and tearing it up youll be able to get more for him than you would if you traded him now
fantasyfootball,removed,down syndrome
fantasyfootball,removed,i think that when going wrwrwr all we are looking for is a solid floor rb would you pair murray with murray i wanted to grab gore but have heard bad things about the ol
fantasyfootball,removed,cincinnati sand huskys
fantasyfootball,removed,walker in the and i pretty much cry tears if i cant get him idc who is around to answer ur question virgil
fantasyfootball,removed,zach miller jared cook eric ebron virgil green
fantasyfootball,removed,eric ebron got him in the round detroit will be throwing a lot and hes a big redzone target
fantasyfootball,removed,assuming you mean late late as in often time not drafted at all or the last couple of rounds charles clay kyle rudolph dwayne allen and eric ebron no particular order
fantasyfootball,removed,take my siemien or get lynched
fantasyfootball,removed,adrian beathison
fantasyfootball,removed,who do you guys think is better siemian or cutler for fantasy
fantasyfootball,removed,ask jackson about autism
fantasyfootball,removed,funchess for the lotto upside aiken can only go down also his usage in preseason with flacco was concerning also steve smith and perry coming back
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,bill cosbys koolaid
fantasyfootball,removed,the washington racial slurs and sanduskys kids
fantasyfootball,removed,i drafted him in the but the eagles fan in our league is trying trade me josh gordon for him i am conflicted
fantasyfootball,removed,im pretty sure i heard today that julio has only missed one game in the last two years id probably go julio especially in ppr everyone seems a little too confident in the giants offensive prowess it makes me nervous
fantasyfootball,removed,cosbys pharmacy
fantasyfootball,removed,i have a rob cooks cobb as my my rbs are pretty weak with demarco murray matt jones and ameer abdullah so i was gonna look for help there but im probably leaning closer to accepting it because his ceiling is a top wr
fantasyfootball,removed,adrian penisons
fantasyfootball,removed,rgordon
fantasyfootball,removed,still wasnt that fantasy relevant even after week had a good week an amazing week and was good in weeks and other than that he was pretty meh fantasy wise after week in half ppr fantasy points opponent gb ind kc chi ne sd missed the oakland game pit cin sd
fantasyfootball,removed,is it cause he converted to being a sand nigga
fantasyfootball,removed,matthews or jeremy hill keeper league
fantasyfootball,removed,id rather keep antonio brown personally
fantasyfootball,removed,nah i wouldnt brown is an amazing player but personally i like to spread risk a bit getting l murraygreennuk both have higher chances of busting or getting injured but it lowers your risk a bit
fantasyfootball,removed,eh depends on how much you wantvalue brown personally i wouldnt want to give up a for with both picks in the first rounds i think youll want that value from the round pick over the difference in value from brown and the overall pick
fantasyfootball,removed,well how did that work out
fantasyfootball,removed,looks like someone was little wrong
fantasyfootball,removed,im in to last place but i think im about to have the best team of the past four weeks lol
fantasyfootball,removed,seahawks niners championship game comes to mind ended up working out pretty well
fantasyfootball,removed,someone tell me the name of piano song in the amazon one click commerical with the priest and other dude i wanna play that on my piano
fantasyfootball,removed,if edelman finishes with points ill rim myself with a dildo
fantasyfootball,removed,damn the ravens have all the golden oldies sss weddle and hester
fantasyfootball,removed,definitely not gay but i wont hate it if i enjoy it
fantasyfootball,removed,what is the name of the song bitch
fantasyfootball,removed,alright i can guarantee that tom brady will not throw more than second half touchdown i am so confident that if im wrong i will do whatever the top comment says to do
fantasyfootball,removed,i actually did use google right after i posted this and lo and behold seconds after i posted this i had a better answer than the first two google links and i didnt even have to read through and stats sometimes google isnt the answer you inefficient fuck
fantasyfootball,removed,lol thanks i actually found it myself but i appreciate it nonetheless
fantasyfootball,removed,dude you cant really be this dumb of course it relies on perriman outscoring mitchell if perriman doesnt outscore mitchell then he certainly doesnt outscore brady but for the fucking time dipshit its not about thinking perriman will outscore mitchell its that if mitchell outscores perriman op cant fucking win anyways
fantasyfootball,removed,your opinion is fucking stupid because youre fucking stupid theres no realistic scenario where mitchell outscores brady by points unless brady is injured theres one realistic scenario where perriman outscores brady the pats doing nothing on offense against one of the best defenses in the league obviously neither of those scenarios happened so neither longshot would have done op any good
fantasyfootball,removed,no you fucking idiot theres literally difference between losing by and losing by either one gets you out of the playoffs
fantasyfootball,removed,of their blurbs are cut and dry this one was fun relax dude
fantasyfootball,removed,i would roll with rawls only because i think the seahawks will smash the rams and game flow will be in his favor
fantasyfootball,removed,thielan has a higher floor and jeffery has a higher ceiling i like thielan for to points every weem
fantasyfootball,removed,i went with cosby pills and smash this year and last year it was beats by ray
fantasyfootball,removed,its the semis heres bradys career and playoff stats against denver
fantasyfootball,removed,youve gotta go matty ice with that matchup
fantasyfootball,removed,denver d scares me too i got brady this week or should i play cousins vs carolina
fantasyfootball,removed,how about you shut the fuck up
fantasyfootball,removed,maybe not bc fuck quickonthedrawls stupid fucking blog and youre just cherry picking the only positive thing he said fact is he still has them in the third tier and projected under a dozen other teams given the matchup and his genius algorithm
fantasyfootball,removed,i read the fucking article you nig
fantasyfootball,removed,you should shove that ring pop and smug condescension up your ass you liberal cunt
fantasyfootball,removed,you set your lineup with any players on rosters in your league and then your opponent sets your lineup week with any players on roster or same scenario but for your opponent and you start your normal lineup
fantasyfootball,removed,you choose whether you or your opponent gets the unusual rules for his lineup and its not dumb if you actually think about it if you could have set your lineup last week with these rules youd probably have well over points it might be better if you choose from players in starting lineups but still isnt such an easy choice
fantasyfootball,removed,standard scoring i have two open bench spots dropped marshall and hopkins let someone else get their points a week qb cam dak rb murray gordon miller coleman wr diggs tyreek crowder te graham ladarius green dst sd pit playoffs k tucker my waiver priority right now tyrod inman thielen gabriel miami dst farrow would you change the priority order at all should i drop green to pick up another one of these guys
fantasyfootball,removed,i traded denver before the deadline because i wasnt going to use them in the playoffs if you make the championship do your potential opponent have a better play than den kc then drop them
fantasyfootball,removed,id probably bank on tevin coleman vs sf this week and expect melvin back vs cle
fantasyfootball,removed,fuckin home run cocksucker
fantasyfootball,removed,got evans for hopkins in week
fantasyfootball,removed,im about to trade him for jarvis moncrief or crowder or corey coleman thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,i would possibly take a flyer on hime by trading somebody like lacy decker woodhead etc
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,i traded away ingram for doug martin last week so far so good
fantasyfootball,removed,thoughts on ingram for allen robinson
fantasyfootball,removed,brate or hooper
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck off
fantasyfootball,removed,talk about salty whats wrong mate you
fantasyfootball,removed,which defense would you recommend playing week out of the following atlanta d tampa bay green bay d vs indy san diego d vs tennessee pittsburgh baltimore
fantasyfootball,removed,jewlio turned his ankle early that helped sanu as jones was a decoy monitor the situation this week but i think he remains inconsistent regardless of what happens with julio
fantasyfootball,removed,thoughts on jeremy hill
fantasyfootball,removed,everyones gonna be an asshole but its jeffery and asiata pretty easily for me cutlers guy is alshon and i dont want any part of that chicago backfield
fantasyfootball,removed,asiata based on workload and jeffery based on talent and cutler being back
fantasyfootball,removed,youre not seeing the fucking trees for the forest youre hopeless if you dont understand a simple wr analogy you immediately jump to but but dez isnt as good well no fucking shit you fucking buffoon hes still the cowboys wr jesus christ its not even worth the time anymore
fantasyfootball,removed,guy in rfantasyfootball knows more than belichick lol shut up you idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,waiver wired my whole team makes no sense
fantasyfootball,removed,yes lets cherry pick out some hall of fame exceptions and try to apply them to a career string change of pace back
fantasyfootball,removed,this is what happens when you let blacks play football a white sport people invest millions in fake fantasy imaginary fairy tale bs and lose their money all because we elected a black man as president
fantasyfootball,removed,douche
fantasyfootball,removed,trying to send bmarsh and amari for mike evans think thats fair value
fantasyfootball,removed,remove all the stuff about your own league and ill reapprove it
fantasyfootball,removed,crowder because of yours wr ye you are pretty much stack on rb already
fantasyfootball,removed,im desperate
fantasyfootball,removed,may god have mercy on you
fantasyfootball,removed,its between smith and barber it could also be an rbbc personally im leaning toward barber if rodgers is definitely out the argument for smith is that he knows the system better however he seems like the worse runner of the two and had a costly fumble sunday
fantasyfootball,removed,koetter is familiar with smith from his atlanta days and out snapped barber when rodgers left the game smith also has a smaller build than barber and is better suited for a passing down role which against this atlanta offense will likely be fantasy productive
fantasyfootball,removed,but mike james was the backup to martin a few years back wasnt he im having flashbacks to the year i drafted martin then had to start james if i remember correctly i got two great games out of james before he got injured then i finally ended up with rainey without turning this into a wdia thread im considering picking up james
fantasyfootball,removed,use the search function
fantasyfootball,removed,barber
fantasyfootball,removed,everyone seems to be saying antone smith will be the guy after he got the bulk of the carries when jacquizz went out but i think it will be barber peyton barber was the clear reliever two weeks and he killed it he looked great antone smith is a scat back style veteran and he was literally signed like weeks ago i think when jacquizz went out koetter realized it could be serious so he put in antone to protect his last usable between the tackles runner in barber and because he didnt need a rb to go in and win the game he just needed one that wouldnt lose it i believe that he thought antone smith being a vet would be less likely to fumble well we all know what happened there tldr i think antone went in as a veteran to protect the ball and to preserve barber since they knew he would have to be the next man up add in the costly smith fumble and i think its gonna be majority barber this week with antone on third downs and change of pace
fantasyfootball,removed,im adding smith because everyone else is hyping up barber and this sub is usually wrong this sub tends to create a narrative of what they want to happen rather than what is most likely to happen
fantasyfootball,removed,knile davis
fantasyfootball,removed,bucs likely to use rb committee vs falcons
fantasyfootball,removed,barber on early downs and short yardage smith on look at their stats smith is a passing back barber is a grinder
fantasyfootball,removed,agree hate the rbs but if williams does anything close to last season with bell being suspended again you should be looking good
fantasyfootball,removed,brown in the fourteenth larry could retire this year and then you set yourself up for next season
fantasyfootball,removed,i will be keeping ingram and dion as well does this answer the question
fantasyfootball,removed,investing in your own handcuffs doesnt make your team better getting other peoples handcuffs makes your roster stronger if your guy gets hurt the replacement isnt going to make your team better but if someone elses player gets hurt your team gets better while his gets worse
fantasyfootball,removed,have to go with brown there is no uncertainty that he is an undisputed top player in fantasy target monster racks up yards in bunches and can get you double digit touchdowns i love freeman but theres a little bit of skepticism to see if he can repeat last years performance and fend off tevin coleman all year
fantasyfootball,removed,im saying brownand its not even close in my eyes best wr in the league in a proven system also wr tend to be less injury prone then rbs take brown and newton dont look back
fantasyfootball,removed,arguably the best wr in the league or a rb in a rbbc whos value is somewhat high if its ppr i doubt ab is sitting at i havent seen a mock that he doesnt go top
fantasyfootball,removed,brown and not close

fantasyfootball,removed,hey bro hows that research treating you right now
fantasyfootball,removed,if youre not gonna contribute dont reply
fantasyfootball,removed,you play in a league with people who have down syndrome
fantasyfootball,removed,na i read it right just felt like making people like you angry
fantasyfootball,removed,edelman or tyrell williams
fantasyfootball,removed,i agree i dont think its in bad taste or that big of a deal but he should realize that he did make a huge impact in the game he made them plan around his talent forced them to use guys to cover let the rest of the team get open and put up huge amounts of points he probably made the biggest impact on the offense simply in the fact that la was afraid of him i understand his frustration because he just wants to make the big plays but he did his job and should get paid for it i dont know how players are valuated
fantasyfootball,removed,trying to figure out who to start at dst this weekend while tennessee is on bye i already have a playoff spot but i can eliminate the a rodgersobj owner with a win my options are as follows chicago san francisco washington tampa bay atlanta new york giants jacksonville indianapolis new orleans los angeles detroit none of these are inspiring options chicago and san francisco are the best options on paper but i bet against the chicago offense last week and it didnt pay off while the san francisco offense is looking pretty good under kaep washington and tampa seem like ok options but i feel weird starting a defense against my rbs i have dj and gordon i dont trust atlanta especially after kc did pretty well against the broncos dst and its hard to buy into the giants who face a highpowered steelers offense playing at home the jacksonville new orleans and detroit defenses dont deserve to be rostered im intrigued by indianapolis facing the nyj but theres not much evidence theyll be able to produce la would normally be a halfway decent option but they draw the patriots this week strangely im leaning towards indianapolis and los angeles this week the colts are fighting for a playoff spot and are facing a troubled and mistakeprone jets team which has upside los angeles is also a decent defense looking to make up for their failures last week and new england is dealing with a lot of personnel issues te injuries how to handle the rb time share etc which makes them intriguing what does everyone else think
fantasyfootball,removed,nope
fantasyfootball,removed,how is this ducking guy still undroppable
fantasyfootball,removed,calling the stat line now tj yeldon carried yards receptions yards no touchdowns
fantasyfootball,removed,do you not know how to read im not talking about tes in general i know davis is good im talking about playing tes against arizona they arent going to force it to their te against the best defense against tes i dont know how thats so hard to comprehend
fantasyfootball,removed,exact reason why i am taking over lm duties in my main league lm right now lets owners get away with too much teams have paid the lone team that hasnt paid is playoff bound completely unfair
fantasyfootball,removed,when was that exactly
fantasyfootball,removed,that was dumb
fantasyfootball,removed,dude they have excelled at attacking defenses with ty in the backfield at this point its clear youre salty as fuck that you didnt get him
fantasyfootball,removed,why is it ok with you for espn to push their ultra liberal political agendas but not this guy
fantasyfootball,removed,maclin
fantasyfootball,removed,could he kill himself instead
fantasyfootball,removed,thank god i dont have to see your lies directed at me anymore fuck man you packers fans are garbage human beings
fantasyfootball,removed,hey man no need to get upset that youre fucking way wrong i am not delusional i actually happen to be very well informed due to my past life experiences including professional football why am i hell bent on ty dude hes their starting rb to stay until further notice injury or severe lack of production why am i hellbent on ty and unsure of true value of what i could get i have nfl gamepass and grade my players using my old college game grading system for every single play that they also compare backups are in and potential replacements on the waiver andor on other teams if gb wide receiving corps stays health tys production will fall off a cliff wtf thats the most asinine thing ive read on rff sincewell ever that is fucking stupid and you should be ashamed of yourself for making a statement like that further reasons why im hellbent on ty i have former teammates and friends that play on the packers former college teammates former training partners and former high school all star friends and teammates you really couldnt be more wrong as i have conversed about the very topic with them its funny you call me kid and designate yourself a grown up for having a very well informed opinion especially when its more than likely ill forget more football than youll ever know that includes my potential for having cte if grownup is dismissing an opinion because it doesnt agree with yours then by all means you can fuck right off with your puny lack of football knowledge based off your speculation that ty will drop because of the health of gbs wide receiving corps come back when you have years of playing experience starting at age in essence youre fucking wrong pal
fantasyfootball,removed,do i play adams over michael thomas vs seatle in my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,hey fuck you

fantasyfootball,removed,i humbly beg your thoughts wise men ive read espn cbs sports rotowire multiple tweets and still have no clear idea ppr league do i flex in davis jackson janis leaning janis since gb will probably have to throw a lot but davis could take advantage of this opportunity and go off or jackson could get most of the carries and snaps in pass protection if davis isnt up to speed on the playbook im lost and then some thoughts in this hour of need
fantasyfootball,removed,i think theyll have to throw a lot so im leaning janis as well but im freaking out davis or jackson will go off since atls run defense is weak theyre all available i need a flex and this is driving me crazy lol
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks for responding i appreciate it since ive only seen gb games this year and dont know much about jackson
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,dang i forgot about jacksons hand good point on the jet sweeps rolling with janis as well good luck utrusttheprocesss
fantasyfootball,removed,quizz is injured
fantasyfootball,removed,quizz booker ty and ty for me then
fantasyfootball,removed,if booker goes for over yards today ill eat my goldfish
fantasyfootball,removed,hey fuck you buddy at the game and that was scary
fantasyfootball,removed,i was offered this is it too little for mccoy
fantasyfootball,removed,start chester taylor and dont look back
fantasyfootball,removed,is thielen out there he may be a better bet or beasley for tonight
fantasyfootball,removed,traded him in ppr last weak for cole beasley playing the dude who traded me and loving it
fantasyfootball,removed,im stuck on the toilet with no tp
fantasyfootball,removed,i love people like you in my leagues
fantasyfootball,removed,in my keeper league my team is always tanqueray and chronic in redraft i change it every year den swedish hit show butterscotch boss heman woman hitters club ray rice year romosexual tendencies this year im going with trumps cabinet
fantasyfootball,removed,im with you on last year think youre being a bit short sighted though are you considering all the waiver rbs that were major misses are you considering the fact that the fantasy landscape and injury ravaged rb position was historically unprecedented are you considering the fact that as this shiny new zero rb approach because the strategy equivalent of christine michael hype trains and that youre going to be fighting against many more teams to hopefully acquire the few worthwhile waiver darlings banking on these things is inherently more risky than taking a swing at a down back in a nice situation in the early rounds
fantasyfootball,removed,i mean we all knew he was a bruising runner but dang
fantasyfootball,removed,breaking news dallas cowboys release ezekiel elliott so they can sign him
fantasyfootball,removed,if she did try to set him up send her ass to jail fuck them hoes their pussy is the only claim to fame but even then it aint that good
fantasyfootball,removed,shes a woman so no
fantasyfootball,removed,leveon
fantasyfootball,removed,david johnson i havent looked though is he getting an adp of round
fantasyfootball,removed,david johnson i havent looked though is he getting an adp of round
fantasyfootball,removed,johnson in the theyre both first rounders and you know dj will be playing the first weeks thats awesome value at
fantasyfootball,removed,the ppr adp from fantasy football calculator for the overall picks lacy hilton landry mccoy thomas martin cobb edelman watkins benjamin forte i think if lacy hilton or landry fall or anybody with adp before for that matter those are easy picks of the other guys i like thomas cobb and watkins id stay away from benjamin and edelman because of their bust factors but would still try for wrwrwr and get those pass catching backs in the middle rounds
fantasyfootball,removed,ok this is the first year we have allowed keeper and draft picking trading in our league we allow offensive and defensiveidp for each team trading draft picks for straight up draft picks is quite easy but a recent trade that happened was team a trades the overall pick to team b for the rights to his keeper and his round pick so at this point team a should be able to keep a player on his team and a player on team b and team b only gets his defensive keeper so we the teams try to make this trade team b sends the player he was going to keep along with the draft pick to team a but now team a cant keep a player his team does anyone know how to get around this or do we have to manual draft the players and process the trade after the draft i tried to post this and the mod kept killing it

fantasyfootball,removed,lost the fucking championship because i got cute and started the lions d over the cardinals
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,not so sure about that especially with brady coming back next week id rather have parker as long as i had a decent replacement
fantasyfootball,removed,i might start crabtree over him this week but id rather have parker ros
fantasyfootball,removed,idk i love both
fantasyfootball,removed,this is one of the most glaring signs of an lc post if you see a nickname youre not getting analysis this is one of the most enduring trends ive seen here unequivocally
fantasyfootball,removed,like you can drop cmike now dunce
fantasyfootball,removed,i dropped bortles for him yesterday all aboard the wentz hype train woo woo motherfucker
fantasyfootball,removed,i traded blount for landry in standard last week aim higher
fantasyfootball,removed,i know its the wrong thread but is picking him up off waivers worth dropping rawls or dorsett
fantasyfootball,removed,in standard league hurns and crowder in standard league landry fitzgerald and watkins podcast talked up parker all preseason so i was happy when i grabbed him in both leagues
fantasyfootball,removed,i would silva mentioned how well cincy plays slot receivers so im expecting a soso game from landry and a solid game from parker that said you probably cant go wrong with either choice
fantasyfootball,removed,mckinnon
fantasyfootball,removed,in a standard team league where wr and te are used interchangeably for total starting spots who would you start of these evans jordan reed emmanuel sanders devante parker extra difficultywe only get points for yardage if they go over yds
fantasyfootball,removed,flex parker or jordan howard
fantasyfootball,removed,man ppr have rb m gordon t gurley j hill o darkwa have wr d bryant t lockett t boyd m sanu t smith q enunwa my t gurley for his d thomas k dixon i think i want it since my wr are shit and gurley is spotty
fantasyfootball,removed,starting him over e decker t sharpe m wallace
fantasyfootball,removed,are you retarded
fantasyfootball,removed,i have julio baldwin sanders pryor in my lineup but i really want to play devante parker would you switch out any of these guys for parker
fantasyfootball,removed,i would roll with dalton on this one best offense out of the
fantasyfootball,removed,im facing the decision of washington or latavius however i dont know that i have that much faith in caldwell to not just try to do the same thing all over again with riddick
fantasyfootball,removed,do you guys like landry or parker ros
fantasyfootball,removed,debating whether to be bold enough to start howard over gurley i have gurley in my flex this week because k als have d murray and mccoy
fantasyfootball,removed,i got simms c mike washington not sure who to start at because head says simmsawakening but pants say the rock washington
fantasyfootball,removed,cant decide if i should play crabtree or fuller
fantasyfootball,removed,sims or howard for my
fantasyfootball,removed,derek carr or carson wentz and for this week spencer ware or dwayne washington
fantasyfootball,removed,real these guys for me i can start three bmarsh marvin jones d thomas t williams hurns pryor
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start washington over reddick though jn half ppr i watched the week game and agree with the general consensus on theo being ineffective between the tackleshowever his coach is still blaming it on the line so he should still be seeing a lot of carries
fantasyfootball,removed,ugh mike evans or amari cooper my wr core is stacked hopkins hilton evans cooper but that denver secondary scares me shitless despite evans high output so far
fantasyfootball,removed,it says start tyrell williams but would anyone start him over travis benjamin if you had both
fantasyfootball,removed,cant decide if i sit lat murray for ware if charles is out or michael thomas for crowder in my flex ppr im leaning towards ware and crowder but well see what happens with jamaal and if snead is a fullgo
fantasyfootball,removed,start you were sarcastic for a minute i cant believe they posted an entire article of boombusts in the starts crazy but if theyre right then suppose its a win
fantasyfootball,removed,who are your other receivers
fantasyfootball,removed,cobb and matthews on bye dez hurt jennings hurts spots on benchkill me
fantasyfootball,removed,im wondering the same thing ive got him eating a valuable bench spot while ive had stafford starting since week been going back and forth about whether or not to drop him
fantasyfootball,removed,id say there are better options he is more of a match up favorable start he can either give you or give you a game i think you can almost stream qbs this year
fantasyfootball,removed,dropable in all formats
fantasyfootball,removed,if you can leave him on your bench id do that hes got a bye week next week and should be close to after that
fantasyfootball,removed,pick two for me for this week sims vs denver gore vs jacksonville or howard vs detroit
fantasyfootball,removed,he was a bust on draft night and has been ever since dont be sad its ok retard
fantasyfootball,removed,im considering dropping him for crowder or enunwafor enunwa im banking on the lingering injuries of decker and marshall
fantasyfootball,removed,eric ebron or gronk my thoughts gronk was used as a decoy last week got no action is playing with a string qb still coming off his injury so we dont know if he is facing buffalo who has not given many points away to tes this season although they are playing home at least ebron has been playing pretty solid but only td in week hasnt been getting a ton of yards but has been targeted a decent amount will be playing a rivalry game in chicago might be the safer option
fantasyfootball,removed,what are you smoking everyone but sss is definitely better than sharpe in both production and situation
fantasyfootball,removed,no i picked him up after ad went down because im desperate at rb my backs right now are melvin gordon jerick mckinnon dwayne washington and jordan howard
fantasyfootball,removed,drop sharpe for pryor
fantasyfootball,removed,any concerns playing him against the bengals defense they were pretty good last year and i cant really find how theyre doing this year wrs are fuller evans landry t williams sd and marvin jones
fantasyfootball,removed,i have marshall ty hilton cooks and demaryius thomas have no clue who to start this week
fantasyfootball,removed,too lazy to go to wdis but steve smith or beasley
fantasyfootball,removed,for the guy getting gordon his stock has risen with the chargers injuries
fantasyfootball,removed,if youre giving decker and getting gordon accept that trade immediately
fantasyfootball,removed,are you receiving gordon if so then take it and run
fantasyfootball,removed,use the trade thread melvin is an ros
fantasyfootball,removed,yes if your getting gordon i have no idea why the gordon owner would agree to that though
fantasyfootball,removed,sharpe crowder or beasley i have sammy watkins and dez bryant so need to start one of those guys
fantasyfootball,removed,send him now if youre getting gordon now
fantasyfootball,removed,brandon marshall kelvin benjamin amari cooper start sit what should i do
fantasyfootball,removed,i have brandon marshall in leagues and was considering sitting him in both in the first standard scoring yahoo league im playing jlandry esanders and dthomas over him in the second ppr league im playing obj jedelman and twilliams over him
fantasyfootball,removed,my team qb bortles wr antonio brown ty hilton alshon jeffery desean jackson jamison crowder rb lesean mccoy lagarette blount jordan howard dwayne washington chris ivory te witten tamme dst kc streaming so im set at wr pretty much but could use a boost at maybe qb and te right now blount is a very serviceable but im hoping washingtonhoward can fill that need and i can unload blount id love to trade alshon but im clueless about his current value what rb tier is comparable here also there is a guy desperate for rb help think i could get jstew edelman for blount and then flip jeffery for an rb to even out my team or am i solid now
fantasyfootball,removed,tbh i would take that now with the dez rumors
fantasyfootball,removed,who will have higher game landry or t benjamin in standard i usually hate thursday night games if weather is bad today i may consider sitting landry down
fantasyfootball,removed,advice on a trade proposed i get leveon bell randall cobb i give antonio brown league ppr roster roethlisberger cooks d murray bernard olsen snead t williams deangelo williams j white devante adams b lafell eebron w smallwood need the depth at rb with deangelo riding the pine but tough to part with brown
fantasyfootball,removed,you are hopeless if you agree with him as well i would not be surprised if im arguing with some guys playing in for their first time in a public league
fantasyfootball,removed,i think this helps you crabtree is doing alright but giving up maclin leaves you pretty thin at wr ingram bumps your whole rb corps up a level though and i think its a toss up between dixonwashington detroit is happy to pass it and washington doesnt have a ton going for him on that offense but the potential dixonforsettwest committee could be a headache too i think there is more to like about dixons potential though so if you can package washington thats what id do
fantasyfootball,removed,i cannot decide between marshall or desean jackson now one is a banged up stud playing a great secondary the other is a boom or bust playing cleveland
fantasyfootball,removed,i currently have landry starting as my cooper is my is it safe to bench landry today for the likes of fuller diggs tyrell williams or crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,what do i do with randall cobb im lost on this guy
fantasyfootball,removed,is he a good start against the giants this week
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop julius for him
fantasyfootball,removed,well fuck me im choosing between winston and wilson
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck it sorry beasley im starting bmarsh i tried
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys start cooks or desean jackson this week my other receivers are beckham and fitz
fantasyfootball,removed,fuckers in this sub telling me obj aint bout this obj aint bout that my boy a bd on fucking lamron and them he he they say that dude dont be putting in no work shut the fuck up yall aint know shit all ya motherfuckers talk about obj aint no hitta obj aint this obj a fake shut the fuck up yall dont live with that dude yall know obj got caught with a ratchet shootin at the police and shit he been on probation since fuckin i dont know when motherfuckers stop fuckin playin him like that them dudes savages out there if i catch another motherfucker talking sweet about obj im fucking beating they ass im not fucking playing no more you know those niggas role with lil reese and them
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks to everyone in here for the advice i was offered jc for diggs and was really unsure if i would regret trading diggs away this thread made me feel a lot better about that decision
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop julius thomas for brate
fantasyfootball,removed,cousins or big ben
fantasyfootball,removed,should i trade eric ebron for watkins my other te is julius thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,t benjamin and crowder with juicy matchups just screaming at marshall to sub in
fantasyfootball,removed,flex charles sims or jamison crowder i really like charles sims came up big for me last week but i dont like him so much against the broncos right now i have him on the bench and have jamison crowder in at flex i feel like this is a gamble but he might come up large against cleveland any thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,could pick up jets for giants and novak for hopkins
fantasyfootball,removed,shit brate hunter henry
fantasyfootball,removed,matt forte or dwayne washington amari cooper or tyrell williams
fantasyfootball,removed,pick crowder enunwa beasley
fantasyfootball,removed,who are your other wrs
fantasyfootball,removed,as someone who has stafford and palmer im confident i wont be able to choose who to start
fantasyfootball,removed,if you had to choose do you start flacco or cousins i have both
fantasyfootball,removed,sit forte for crowell thats kind of gutsy i think
fantasyfootball,removed,so pitta or zach miller
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm should i start matt jones or dwayne washington
fantasyfootball,removed,so mike evans or travis benjamin
fantasyfootball,removed,this suggests i should bench brandon marshall for philip dorsett i dont know if i can bring myself to do that should i do this
fantasyfootball,removed,still have no idea whether i start him or diggs this week fantasy football is so hard sometimes
fantasyfootball,removed,one says start derek carr the other two say sit derek carr if majority are saying start joe flacco then most likely raiders are going to be playing from behind so derek carr is a start correct or does dak prescott look better than carr
fantasyfootball,removed,arghh need to setup an alarm on sunday morning now who do i add for jt i have gary barnidge brate jesse james and hunter henry on ww
fantasyfootball,removed,these people seem high on siemian i cant decide between him and carr vs bal this week any help
fantasyfootball,removed,would you sell high on blount guy in my league jas gurley deangelo williams and lamar miller needing receivers would you trade lamar miller for kelvin benjamin and legarratte blount i have hopkins marvin jones willie snead k benjamin travis benjamin at wr blount carlos hyde christine michael charles sims tevin coleman chris ivory and gio bernard at rb deep at wr and rb want lamar miller what do i package
fantasyfootball,removed,anyone picking up boykin
fantasyfootball,removed,its tough for me because i have mckinnon matt jones jordan howard and chris ivory on my bench and i dont know how to rank them ros
fantasyfootball,removed,so you guys still like him for tonight even though its a thursday game on the road i have him on my bench with k benjamin cooks in
fantasyfootball,removed,ive been wondering the same thing would love to package him someone else for zeke elliot just not sure the zeke owner will bite im looking good at rb ros with ingram martinsims jstew dixon dwashington wrs julio shepard enunwa pryor john brown i think ill try to package ingram john brown to see if he bites will the long term idea of locking down morris as a handcuff and then shipping out jstew for another wr later in the year good or bad idea
fantasyfootball,removed,is it a bad move to start jeremy hill tonight
fantasyfootball,removed,doyle or brate for backup just in case im thinking doyle
fantasyfootball,removed,well now i dont know who to start between ryan and bortles
fantasyfootball,removed,started dwayne washington over matt jones against cleveland
fantasyfootball,removed,with that would charles ware for marshall or fitzgerald latavius be a good move
fantasyfootball,removed,need zeke gordon mccoy hill coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,how many teams are in your league thats the real question
fantasyfootball,removed,theres a trade thread in the stickied index for future reference but to answer your question the broncos d would not be able to fetch a starting runing back unless youre in a league with a bunch of tacos
fantasyfootball,removed,start of k benjamin b marshall or marvin jones such a tough decision for me
fantasyfootball,removed,your best back is in a person rbbc you have a guy playing behind demarco murrayand rawls is going to be out for a long time gio isnt going to help unless youre in a ppr most likely is washington or drake or howard available in your league i really hope your wrs are stellar
fantasyfootball,removed,landry mike evans or marvin jones i need to pick
fantasyfootball,removed,benching him for kevin white i need big plays and i dont think marshall can deliver am i dumb
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start marshall over sanders or diggs in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,i have jarvis and diggs fighting for my flex spot who do you choose
fantasyfootball,removed,user zveroshka said most hardcore hype train ever likely to see upticks building confidence have to start him this week optimistic for situation boom hype train choo choo
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop rawls for him if hes available
fantasyfootball,removed,id play gurley
fantasyfootball,removed,coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,im torn between starting witten graham and barnidge
fantasyfootball,removed,kys
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard need a flex c artispayne atl t kelce pit p dorsett jax d parker cin f gore jax
fantasyfootball,removed,hypre train derailed just like the one in nj
fantasyfootball,removed,it was the josh gordon of times and it was the josh gordon of times
fantasyfootball,removed,📈
fantasyfootball,removed,what a fucking joke
fantasyfootball,removed,he probably had a random drug test coming his way and he knew he was going to fail probably agreed to enter rehab instead of failing another drug test
fantasyfootball,removed,keeping him on my bench to honor our lord
fantasyfootball,removed,if you got gronk you ripped him off
fantasyfootball,removed,man i would tell you to gtfo and go to the trade thread but dayummmmmm you robbed him or her pc
fantasyfootball,removed,i have both freeman and coleman i need a cooks and robinson arent doing it for me i want to trade both or one of the two
fantasyfootball,removed,trade threads man come on also you hosed the guy
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,you know what they say you can take the nig out the hood but cant take the hood out the nig
fantasyfootball,removed,cool heres my team you can tell i went deep with rbs and wrs team standard qb rb wr te flex qb j winston flacco streaming him this week rb d johnson l murray m gordon dwayne washington wr m evans e decker j matthews d parker d moncrief stashing him te dennis pitta dst jets meh k mason crosby
fantasyfootball,removed,great timing not the offseason or any week hes suspendedwaits until days before his return to fuck my team in the ass
fantasyfootball,removed,opponent just posed this interesting one to me receive give dez bryant carlos hyde sammy watkins standard teams i know that theyre both injured currently im superstacked at running back i could bench carlos hyde this week i also have leveon bell demarco murray melvin gordon matt forte deangelo williams and christine michael im pretty poor at wide receiver my only starting options are mike wallace jamison crowder phillip dorsett and quincy enunwa would you do this trade
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck you
fantasyfootball,removed,drop d wash or mckinnon for him in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,e
fantasyfootball,removed,cool story bro
fantasyfootball,removed,cant decide whether to start him as flex or desean jackson
fantasyfootball,removed,standard espn league dropped gordon best available wrs are hurns enunwa beasley steve smith ive got a claim in for enunwa already but im thinking maybe i just pick up hurns
fantasyfootball,removed,flex deciding between ivory dez hurt tate sucks sss old jennings hurt darkwa unproven
fantasyfootball,removed,ivory or dwayne washington
fantasyfootball,removed,figured whats the source on that quote
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck that nigha
fantasyfootball,removed,dont bench mike evans bench sanders
fantasyfootball,removed,im being offered cardinals or vikings defense for pryor thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,skipped right over it my bad
fantasyfootball,removed,hell no go pick up ravens
fantasyfootball,removed,haha im not i debated starting him over blount but im keeping blount in
fantasyfootball,removed,my wrs are decimated i have watkins crowder beasley and parker im playing parker right move over beasleywhat do you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got hopkins diggs crowder and parker but everything ive checked so far says to start the first three over parker that being said i still kinda want to
fantasyfootball,removed,crabtree over parker and jordan howard for me
fantasyfootball,removed,quick do i play landry tonight or sanders instead
fantasyfootball,removed,am i nuts for starting parker over cooks cooks has been under performing since that first game
fantasyfootball,removed,i cant decide between parker or gio in my flex what you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,do i play him or emmanuel sanders
fantasyfootball,removed,jeremy hill or dwayne washington i think aj green will have a big game and itll be a shoot out leaves hill with maybe a td and whatever left dwaybe washington has a good matchup and he could explode
fantasyfootball,removed,should i bench snead for parker
fantasyfootball,removed,should i go with him or crowell against washington
fantasyfootball,removed,your already loaded at wr i think it would be smart to grab ingramalthough you could just go for the kill and take robinson and have the best wr group in the league
fantasyfootball,removed,choo choo
fantasyfootball,removed,gordon gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,justify why its a retarded move ill wait yeah im sure my likely opponent benching leveon bell or demarco murray for a limited melvin gordon if he plays would bite me in the ass big time terrific logic probably why youre left playing charles sims in the playoffs i dropped him not to play kenneth dixon but to prevent my opponent from playing dixon over booker he cannot play gordon this week because he wont be fucking active
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start mccoy gilli flex or mccoy crowder flex thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,k just making sure thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,watkins vs adams for flex both have plus matchups but either one could explode and theres no way to tell which one
fantasyfootball,removed,could it be worth starting desean or edelman over baldwin
fantasyfootball,removed,other bench options are desean jackson and julian edelman jackson is up against carolina whose corners are terrible but i dont know if i trust him edelman is against denver secondary so thats iffy for obvious reasons
fantasyfootball,removed,positive is that theyre playing at home and if you end up with a dud from baldwin it can help make your sunday decisions on whether you need more boom djax or a steady score edelman
fantasyfootball,removed,stick to lurking
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start him or sammy against cle
fantasyfootball,removed,im having the same dilemma i think winston has a safer floor but i am projected to win by like ugh i feel like ill make the wrong choice lol
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,i agreewinston instead
fantasyfootball,removed,youre welcome
fantasyfootball,removed,my best recommendation is that if you commute to work listen to a podcast on the way within like a week you will be all caught up and just as competitive as anyone else in the league best of luck and hope you crush your husband
fantasyfootball,removed,if were starting with the basics heres a few tips that most ff players unanimously abide by dont draft a kicker until the last round unless you want to get made fun of wait until a very late round to get a dst i personally draft one in the to last round just before my kicker and then stream throughout the season but some people will take one a couple rounds early if they think its an elite defense you should probably wait to draft a qb probably at least rounds personally i like to wait until the round range possibly even later depending on how the draft shakes out and some strategies that some people employ in ff drafting a rb then later on drafting his backup this is called handcuffing with the backup acting as an insurance policy to the starter should he get injured streaming qbs and dst as said before streaming is where you use the fa pool and make pickups to plug and play depending on matchups for instance streaming a dst playing against the browns may be wise other than that its really up to personal preference this year a lot of wrs are going in the first round thats fine but personally if im picking outside the top or ill be picking a rb just because of the lack of depth at the position but again it comes down to personal preference hope this helped good luck
fantasyfootball,removed,in order of preference ingrammartincjhydeforte
fantasyfootball,removed,well i do have julio jones and odell beckam jr as my keepers plus rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,no this is the krusty krab
fantasyfootball,removed,always kkk
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah and position have already been taken which would have been my top choices
fantasyfootball,removed,agreed so whats your preference
fantasyfootball,removed,oh ive been preparing for the last months im just trying to get some extra last minute tips
fantasyfootball,removed,what is the condition of your keepers
fantasyfootball,removed,if ppr keep landry if standard murray
fantasyfootball,removed,retard i live in the east coast im also over ten years old so i have no problem staying up to watch playoff sports also how much playoff and prime time football did dj play you guys are all missing the point of course late games are better on the west coast and times are better for them for almost every sport but only the nfl has such a high percentage of games at one time slot the o clock games in the nfl accounted for well over half of djs playing time holy shit its a simple concept to understand
fantasyfootball,removed,yep im sure he was just outright lying i bet he watches every single game and is laughing his ass off because he fooled everyone into thinking he doesnt watch anything its a secret long con
fantasyfootball,removed,umookiemookie look at this guy clearly just a problem user who cant take a warning from the mods
fantasyfootball,removed,are you stupid
fantasyfootball,removed,youre making my morning so please keep posting
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt bet on dropping carr so many wr weapons kaep could bust any moment maybe not though they play from behind a lot which is good for qb points
fantasyfootball,removed,there is a whole thread for this but no dont drop carr but definitely add kaepernick for someone else
fantasyfootball,removed,simply no
fantasyfootball,removed,i literally just did this as i have winston for week
fantasyfootball,removed,benched ajayi during not one but both of his games i still somehow managed to win both weeks but it fucked up my points for
fantasyfootball,removed,said it this year and ill say it again i aint touching him with a foot stick
fantasyfootball,removed,wdis but if u had room id pick up cincy san diego and buffalo to stream against cleveland but thats for
fantasyfootball,removed,benglas
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck you
fantasyfootball,removed,nigga i got lumbar stenosis shit aint gonna stop me from playing disc golf gronks a pussy s about gronk being a pussy
fantasyfootball,removed,thats some real analysis right there he can be good or possibly be bad he is boom or bust he has upside relative to your unknown roster he is on your bench
fantasyfootball,removed,week have gronk at te and olsen at flex no better options at that point in time on team olsen plays thursday night so locked in gronk is out so i have to find a te grabbed a dud for points lose by guys on bench go over week leave manning in at qb lose by carr on bench with on manning crowell on bench and outscores both running backs one by and flex week leave manning in at qb lose by carr on bench outscores manning by also started cruz over crowder based on week numbers cruz crowder struggled at wr all year week drop manning and start carr in place manning goes for carr goes for lose by also left crowder on bench with e sanderssnead who combined for to crowders week starting team scores points bench scores opponent scores starting anybody on my bench over anyone in their position even the kicker would have won me the game also this week im leading my opponent with seconds left in the monday night game by points minnesota is down so no chance to win bradford throws a yard screen to patterson who catches and runs for yards patterson breaks a tackle to gain an extra yards all sorts of bullshit in that last seconds or anyone on my bench could have won that game by far my biggest disappointment of the year week win my game but drop crowder leading up to the weekend since hes on a bye and no one in the league is making waiver moves figure i can get him back gone after the weekend has outscored at least one if not two of my wrs every week since week cousins cant be hot again especially against a divisional opponent so i sit him and play carr points there also bench ingram as all reports i read indicated limited usage rbs plus rb at flex combine for ingram scores lose game by points even without that ill bitch about the nelson offensive pi that wasnt called to give rodgers an extra and carr taking yards on kneel downs instead of the standard i would have expected i think im the taco and should have wins even with some of the garbage up there and winning the league instead i sit in and will probably autopick the browns next year
fantasyfootball,removed,hogan got banged up is the main reason
fantasyfootball,removed,cutlers accuracy is not the issue its his awful decision making which usually ends up being fuck it im throwing it to my stud receiver so fuck off with this stupid fucking logic
fantasyfootball,removed,no nigga
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,choo choo
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr team league pick diggs ty hilton b marsh lamar miller gore
fantasyfootball,removed,butbut he didnt need a lung now youre just down lung
fantasyfootball,removed,this seems premature
fantasyfootball,removed,sucks for you bitch
fantasyfootball,removed,is matthew stafford worth picking up and playing over dak or russel
fantasyfootball,removed,i could get golsen for lmiller have dj booker dmartin lmurray and rawls in the back my te is kelce do it team standard
fantasyfootball,removed,i wonder if osweilers sickle cell will be an issue s
fantasyfootball,removed,lamar miller
fantasyfootball,removed,ajayi full ppr for wr
fantasyfootball,removed,stefon diggs preferred full ppr but in general is fine
fantasyfootball,removed,thomas rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,dion lewis ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,deandre hopkins
fantasyfootball,removed,deandre hopkins
fantasyfootball,removed,ive had and dropped both this season id recommend looking elsewhere either could go off but not predictably look out for injuries though since luck does keep the te involved doyle was decent while allen was out for instance
fantasyfootball,removed,amari cooper
fantasyfootball,removed,jarvis landry
fantasyfootball,removed,allen is their better and string te when healthy which he should be after a bye they normally use a te set in the red zone though so either could score a td
fantasyfootball,removed,rob kelley
fantasyfootball,removed,im thinking about trading fitzgerald for gurley for rb depth and gurleys championship week schedule against sf is this paying too much
fantasyfootball,removed,how should i feel about rob being my ros im being offered antonio brown and corey coleman for blount booker and michael thomas im very tempted my rbs would be jordan howard rob kelley and cj prosise if i do this julio ab moncrief as my wr can i trust fat rob enough to pull this trigger
fantasyfootball,removed,jarvis landry
fantasyfootball,removed,what would the trade value of sanders dion in a ppr league be
fantasyfootball,removed,jimmy graham standard
fantasyfootball,removed,trying to trade hopkins and blount for mike evans or obj the owners are both kinda weak at rb can i pull these off
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk and graham ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,so basically in my league the commissioner added extra weeks in the middle of the season and it messed the entire schedule up and people were threatening to quit he tried to fix the problem since we had no way to prove who was supposed to play who and he reset the schedule on espn when he did this it changed the entire season and previous results is there anyway to fix this or is the entire league screwed yes this is for money sadly
fantasyfootball,removed,i just trade requested for davante adams and i would give devontae booker you guys think thats fair
fantasyfootball,removed,gotta pick him up to fill in fingers crossed he may get better end of season he actually did good against vikings
fantasyfootball,removed,gotta drop one for bye week should i do corey coleman or morris those are the two lowest player in my bench after sammy
fantasyfootball,removed,is is still worth holding number one waiver i really wanna use it in miami defense and cousins for ryan fill in my roster looks good and hate to miss out on something like that please dont send me to wdis thread thank you
fantasyfootball,removed,is it worth holding baltimore defense for ros
fantasyfootball,removed,thank you so much quick i have good roaster and holding baltimore defense i been saving number one waiver and havent used it should i go ahead stash miami with number hate to burn it but it thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,the dude somehow has demarco murray and matt forte also
fantasyfootball,removed,standard i traded ware booker arob for obj
fantasyfootball,removed,lol in all honesty i have left and vikings d considering on miami should i be considering spending more than that
fantasyfootball,removed,ajayi
fantasyfootball,removed,standard dynasty qb derek carr bryce petty rb lamar miller rashad jennings james white jerick mckinnon kenneth farrow wr brandin cooks jarvis landry sterling shepard jj nelson bryce treggs te jimmy graham zach miller k sebastian janikowski roberto aguayo
fantasyfootball,removed,amari cooper
fantasyfootball,removed,dion lewis
fantasyfootball,removed,i pee on you
fantasyfootball,removed,yikes rare that a def deserves top waiver spot but if you can use them multiple weeks and you dont need any positional players ps time to switch to faab
fantasyfootball,removed,really on a defense is your league that deep or your team that stacked that you need to use it on a defense i wouldnt ever recommend using a waiver on a defense unless it was last year and the broncos defense was sitting on the waiver just wake up early and add them
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck
fantasyfootball,removed,arob just got yd a td and a over them brock is worse then bortles tho
fantasyfootball,removed,jimmy graham
fantasyfootball,removed,i would if i didnt have tucker
fantasyfootball,removed,haha i have rawls prosise and mathews sproles and have to pick for and flex this week i will chose wrong
fantasyfootball,removed,absolutely not
fantasyfootball,removed,hes still a kicker and had two down weeks before the bye i think with moncrief and allen back they will finish off more drives and he wont be as great as he was earlier
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah waiver wire is thin this late in the year if anyone can be considered the david johnson this year i think hes been picked up and his name is prosise might as well use your waiver now
fantasyfootball,removed,nah
fantasyfootball,removed,i would reread the rule of thumb
fantasyfootball,removed,im probably targeting him gonna spend about on him dropping winston to get him since i have brady apart from the lions game anytime mathews gets carries or more the eagles win coincidence or he gives them run game wise i think he is talented and his only issue was the fumbling if he gets that under control he will be solid
fantasyfootball,removed,not sure about yahoo but im fairly certain espn in purchasing mnf rights and the right to air nfl highlights has the use of player likenesses included
fantasyfootball,removed,to the assholes who told me i was wrong about cmike up yours
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,unpopular opinion tyreek is wicked fast but i cant bring myself to root for someone who beat and choked his pregnant girlfriend some things are bigger than the few hundred bucks i win in a championship game
fantasyfootball,removed,gloat how the fuck do you gloat to people you dont play against your mother jerks off pigs she gets down on her knees and crawls through the pigpiss mud slop and snuggles up to the pig her fingers tracing along its belly until she finds its cock she begins tugging and stroking as her twat moistens her breasts swelling and her nipples begin to stick out like erasers on a fresh pencil she grunts with satisfaction as the pig begins eagerly thrusting into her hand her grip now tightening to maintain control of the pigs greasy corkscrew cock she lowers her head to watch the cock work in her hand groans with satisfaction and begins working her clit with her other muddy hand her hips gyrating with the rhythm of the pigs thrusting oh fucking jesus god yes she gasps she changes positions still maintaining control of the feverishly thrusting cock as the pigs squealing intensifies she leans forward and with her lips almost touching the pigs ear she whispers your name and begins to shudder she turns her attention again to the pigs swollen member rocking in her hand she presses it between her hand and her face the pig thrusting it against her cheeks as she drools with a massive grunt and a high pitched squeal the pigs balls explode beginning a massive shower of hot sour pig jizz you mother cups one hand under the fountain of steaming genetic material gathering it in her hand as the thrusting comes to an end the pig shudders and begins to walk to the trough of slop in the corner of its pen but your mother tackles it to the ground she lifts its tail and smears the handful of pig load into the pigs own fetid butthole turning flakes of crusty pig shit into a pigshitpigjizz mud slop on the pigs ass now she tilts her head to the sky and screams your name not once not twice but three times she slams her face full force into the pigs butthole and its wreath of shitsemen pudding her tongue machine gun flicking the rim and then burying itself to the hilt inside the pigs hot colon your mother works her tongue around the inside of the pigs ass and then as a few incoherent syllables escaped her now brown lips spurts of female ejaculate spurt from her pulsating cunt exhausted she collapses in the mud rolls over onto her back and lights a cigarette she takes one long drag looks again to the sky and speaks your name one last time before she drifts off to sleep thats your mom your mom does that
fantasyfootball,removed,im up by and have golden tate he has elliot half point ppr i hope its close at least
fantasyfootball,removed,murray
fantasyfootball,removed,who won
fantasyfootball,removed,go fuck yourself just trying to make people aware i dont even have dj you cunt
fantasyfootball,removed,oh man what a shitpost nothing would make me happier than ee crapping all over your team tonight but seriously who posts an appreciation hours before the game what a loser
fantasyfootball,removed,yall call everything a taco league lol zeke bell dj obj mccoy gordon man maybe even murray could all go in front of him and i wouldnt call anyone who drafted them tacos you just come off as an overconfident fool saying shit like this
fantasyfootball,removed,youre come off as a huge douche
fantasyfootball,removed,shut the fuck up
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,im playing someone who has ben and antonio brown thanks kc pretty sure the jv high school team could have played the same level of defense
fantasyfootball,removed,prayer obj sent
fantasyfootball,removed,you suck go away fucking loser
fantasyfootball,removed,ive added you to my downvote script youre done now
fantasyfootball,removed,i suck fat dicks
fantasyfootball,removed,smallwood
fantasyfootball,removed,if its ppr sproles is not bad at all
fantasyfootball,removed,smallwood is their guy kenjon barner is a good runner but the fact that the coaches drafted smallwood anyways and made it a point to give him the carries when mathews went out against the steeler is a testament that hes the favored back after mathews sproles essentially has the same role he did before as the pass catching rb
fantasyfootball,removed,i think mathews will be getting the bulk of the carries if his ankle is better with sproles being the pass catching back if mathews cant go next week or misses a significant amount of time smallwood should take over his role based on what we saw last week when mathews went out
fantasyfootball,removed,i think its time to be extremely worried about hopkins i took him overall and cant afford to have this high of a pick do so poorly i believe us owners are fucked brock sucks and doesnt want to target hopkins the only way i see for hopkins to return as a is if the coaches make it a point to target hopkins or if brock gets injured i would absolutely trade him but there is no way anyone will give the value necessary who would yall target in a trade as a side note i made a post last week with the intention to start discussion on hopkins his trade value and the number of targets he had received if the mods hadnt removed the post and then gave no explaination why some of us might not be in this situation now
fantasyfootball,removed,i would keep eli and drop flacco
fantasyfootball,removed,dude eli is my starter lol keep him
fantasyfootball,removed,his stats are likely deflated since beckham hasnt found the end zone id probably sit him this week vs minn and then start him with confidence the rest of the way
fantasyfootball,removed,ive earned points so far but my opponent scored so i need kyle rudolph to score points ha
fantasyfootball,removed,as a bailey owner in three leagues thanks for the fucking heads up you assholes
fantasyfootball,removed,httplmgtfycom
fantasyfootball,removed,i think i might grab him to replace tamme and eifert to replace j thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,wheres that guy who made the hogan post and harassed everyone that made comments opposing his opinion
fantasyfootball,removed,drop ryan mathews for him i have rudolph at te and charles bell ware elliot mckinnon and gio
fantasyfootball,removed,wish i hadnt taken him in the first
fantasyfootball,removed,train choo choo
fantasyfootball,removed,at flex i have darkwa starting i might switch him out with mckinnon i need points to win i also have vikings d starting too help me out fam who should i flex
fantasyfootball,removed,this would be exactly what i need for the win this week this pls
fantasyfootball,removed,clever coming from someone with a uga education
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard and this is probably a stupid question i was about to drop josh gordon because im and dont have the time to wait to see if he gets out of rehab picked up by another team and actual plays a down this season before i did i mentioned jokingly with the guy currently winning that id be willing to trade him if he was interested and he said he actually was because he had a spare bench spot and was enjoying the soap opera i should literally take anything for gordon right theres no point in trying to get any kind of value for him because he doesnt have much left correct
fantasyfootball,removed,shitty settings
fantasyfootball,removed,so you think i should stick with him for this week and see how he does
fantasyfootball,removed,i have spencer ware mccoy lacy hyde lol
fantasyfootball,removed,tell us more about your close week matchup we all are really curious but in all seriousness you suck and hopefully you lose
fantasyfootball,removed,a wrong opinion do you think before you comment
fantasyfootball,removed,depends on your team and settings but was seeing his worth
fantasyfootball,removed,i would start dak glenn would probably be your best bet
fantasyfootball,removed,probably voted for hilary
fantasyfootball,removed,coleman train chooo chooo
fantasyfootball,removed,rnflstreams
fantasyfootball,removed,dont like any but id go for a possible boom with rishard
fantasyfootball,removed,either him or coates i cant decide
fantasyfootball,removed,nailed it they payed off
fantasyfootball,removed,more targets especially of the rz variety martellus is an odd case because he isnt the te on the team
fantasyfootball,removed,tom brady said bennett is going off this weekend and if we know one thing its that the patriots never lie also fyi wdis would love to have you post there
fantasyfootball,removed,my devontae booker for todd gurley
fantasyfootball,removed,jordy and obj
fantasyfootball,removed,id go with obj alshon as well
fantasyfootball,removed,marshall and arob
fantasyfootball,removed,landry
fantasyfootball,removed,dez and arob
fantasyfootball,removed,gordon and booker
fantasyfootball,removed,jj
fantasyfootball,removed,dez beasley adams
fantasyfootball,removed,ware
fantasyfootball,removed,howard
fantasyfootball,removed,williams and crowder chowder
fantasyfootball,removed,freeman for sure
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont see why this trade is needed as well however if rawls does come back and take some of cmikes snaps then go ahead
fantasyfootball,removed,diggs
fantasyfootball,removed,a rob and dez losing all hope for hopkins personally
fantasyfootball,removed,terrible
fantasyfootball,removed,adams
fantasyfootball,removed,diggs
fantasyfootball,removed,hopkins and dez
fantasyfootball,removed,diggs
fantasyfootball,removed,dez
fantasyfootball,removed,marshall
fantasyfootball,removed,based on starting more wr being ppr and knowing that hes definitely still in his prime id go with green peterson was a beast and will probably continue to be a beast this year but he just doesnt catch the ball much and only starting one rb devalues him further
fantasyfootball,removed,aj pretty easy decision imo its only rb there is no longer scarcity at the position
fantasyfootball,removed,going straight to hell for this one bill cosbys sleeper picks
fantasyfootball,removed,im considering benching dez and sammy this week overreaction i have snead k benjamin j matthews and doug baldwin available all had great week ones
fantasyfootball,removed,jail
fantasyfootball,removed,why would you sit nfc defensive player of the week
fantasyfootball,removed,its lopsided in his favor but not tremendously i would not make the trade myself
fantasyfootball,removed,youre giving good players for tier one and some junkstore items i would hit reject
fantasyfootball,removed,guy getting diggs wins
fantasyfootball,removed,might be close to even on paper but thats insulting no chance
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldntve done it
fantasyfootball,removed,you can try but doubt he takes that
fantasyfootball,removed,ajayi is junkstore
fantasyfootball,removed,how many wrs do you start if you may want to consider it im a jc owner in multiple leagues and am lamenting that fact that said you can probably get more if you want to unload him
fantasyfootball,removed,ingram is worth more than yeldon imo id hold evans but would be tempted to take the first trade
fantasyfootball,removed,dont do it barring injury dj is poised to be rb this year uncontested its a sellers market if youre unloading him
fantasyfootball,removed,san francisco opens the season chandler catanzaro shakes off awful first week with fgs ezekiel elliott is outrushed by alfred morris despite half the touches opening inevitable rbbc dialog
fantasyfootball,removed,doyle rules
fantasyfootball,removed,if i had obj i wouldnt move him for anything short of julio or package lamarsnead or similar
fantasyfootball,removed,someone posted forsett in her butt in a similar thread a while back so i rocked with that one
fantasyfootball,removed,adrian beaterson
fantasyfootball,removed,the cosby sleepers
fantasyfootball,removed,nfl sun edt entry spots filled and top paid
fantasyfootball,removed,what are your other qb options
fantasyfootball,removed,im rollin with him til brady comes back in one league the other im stuck was thinking about picking up matt ryan and in my indecision on figuring out who to drop someone scooped him i think i might have to run with him one more week before i start sending numerous trades
fantasyfootball,removed,sharpe has a higher floor but tyrell has the higher ceiling its whichever you prefer i like sharpe more because i dont think their realistic ceilings are that far apart
fantasyfootball,removed,as you said sharpe is probably a safer pick higher floor but tyrell has more upside higher ceiling it kind of depends on what your team looks like
fantasyfootball,removed,hard for anyone to say right now both guys are still a mystery in my opinion sharpe has much more trade value right now no one even put in a claim for williams easy snag off fa beyond that its difficult to guess their ros value with only one week
fantasyfootball,removed,id play about guys before him but no more than that tough run matchup watkins questionable but hes still much better than probably half the options in the league
fantasyfootball,removed,sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,tyrell because i picked him up after losing allen
fantasyfootball,removed,he could be talking about seasonlong this is a worthwhile discussion as both of these guys are available in a lot of leagues
fantasyfootball,removed,if you bench him he should break out for points so please help the rest of the sub out
fantasyfootball,removed,if im so shallow at wr that i need sharpes high floor im probably taking both of them to be honest williams is much more intriguing to me
fantasyfootball,removed,find a qb to start and keep tt on the bench for a bit if his game doesnt improve drop him
fantasyfootball,removed,gotta decide between him and rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,wish i had that luxury my other choices are tavon austin or rishard matthews
fantasyfootball,removed,i cant decide if i want to play him over latavius in my league such a tough call
fantasyfootball,removed,jets fan i would be hesitant about starting him you hit all the major points however all that being said ive seen shady outright kill the jets i think rex knows how to attack that defense who are your other options
fantasyfootball,removed,im actually thinking of sitting him for rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,probably going to bench him for either tate diggs or sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,im thinking of playing marvin jones over him is that crazy other wrs are julio and ty little afraid to play ty against broncos too
fantasyfootball,removed,watkins or maclin
fantasyfootball,removed,i have lamar miller and ware at my rb positions only spot for mccoy would be my flex its between him and doug baldwin
fantasyfootball,removed,nervous as heck i have jennings who is going against no but im not sure if i want to start him over mccoy thankfully ive also got miller who should get his on sunday
fantasyfootball,removed,im between him tonight and langford on monday in my flex spot i typically dont like starting players in thurs games in my flex but im not sure i trust langford enough yet to opt in on him over shady
fantasyfootball,removed,i would start allen over graham he looked like shit last week but so did the entire offense
fantasyfootball,removed,i am thinking of starting demarco and tj over shady in my league i think jets will come full of motivation due to last years loss and the loss to bengals also sammy looks hurt a little this might complicate shadys life therefore bench shady
fantasyfootball,removed,im being offered dez bryant and mccoy for my o beckham my current rbs are doug martin giovani bernard carlos hyde derrick henry james starks should i make the trade
fantasyfootball,removed,trying to decide on starting him in over ware or demarco cja is my and im at a loss over if i should put in a rb against a stacked box with cordy glenn out on a thursday night game every gut feeling i have says sit him but still its mccoy
fantasyfootball,removed,rawls owner in my full ppr league is offering me rawls if i give him theo riddick im torn because riddick is a ppr machine relevant info i have duke johnson as my starting rb but leveon and charles waiting on the bench
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,should i sit him for desean or mike wallace hmm
fantasyfootball,removed,prob
fantasyfootball,removed,buh bye cleveland trash
fantasyfootball,removed,id give miller one more week i like the tes you listed in reverse order
fantasyfootball,removed,gio
fantasyfootball,removed,tough one gordon probably
fantasyfootball,removed,am i crazy to start him over one of stewart lacy or ware
fantasyfootball,removed,well do i start mccoy vs jets or lacy vs vikings
fantasyfootball,removed,that sounds like theyre trying to make loan collusion legit i would not allow it myself
fantasyfootball,removed,collusion sharing benches case closed nothing more to see
fantasyfootball,removed,watkins tate desean jackson who would you go with
fantasyfootball,removed,yes this is a good move
fantasyfootball,removed,mccoy was my first rb picked in the draft but i almost got burned last week by not listening to my gut and this week my gut is telling me to bench him everything about this game makes me feel like this will be a bust week for mccoy probably the only week i sit him sitting him for latavius murray woodhead ppr league and either ryan mathews or jennings in my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,team league with position caps yes do it
fantasyfootball,removed,im starting him tonight i know its not ideal but he should see the ball a ton just based on sheer volume hell have a decent chance to score plus if watkins is healthy he could free up the run a little bit
fantasyfootball,removed,presumably he timed the drop so no one could add for tnf savvy owners will do this system design
fantasyfootball,removed,bad trades are part of fantasy welcome to ffl
fantasyfootball,removed,im starting him tonight but mostly due to lack of options on my bench my league runs rbs wrs and flex starting cooper watkins moncrief and djax only other flex options would be john brown c hogan crowell sproles and powell
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont think id pull the trigger
fantasyfootball,removed,if i were him might accept for woodhead but not for mccoy or forte
fantasyfootball,removed,sammy watkins or rashad jennings against saints feel like the giants are going to exploit the secondary rather than run it
fantasyfootball,removed,all day
fantasyfootball,removed,i have him and ap but i also have woodhead halp d
fantasyfootball,removed,riddick is not a ppr beast unless the matchup favors take rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,b wins
fantasyfootball,removed,fire sale eh
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start jennings or abdulah over shady
fantasyfootball,removed,i might not start shady anyone have any advice i need to pick players out of these guys shady woodhead ware sanders and snead currently i am starting carr arob maclin forte and jesse james at te
fantasyfootball,removed,im sitting him behind david johnson cja and ware gotta play match ups with this stable i think
fantasyfootball,removed,sit him for will fuller or lockett
fantasyfootball,removed,pretty even trade id think
fantasyfootball,removed,yes all day
fantasyfootball,removed,gates
fantasyfootball,removed,ebron
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,watkins sanu fuller pryor kevin white wdis
fantasyfootball,removed,why on earth are you carrying tes trade that away or hit the waiver wire i like them gatesebronfleener
fantasyfootball,removed,jets jets jets jets
fantasyfootball,removed,start watkins tonight or hilton vs the broncos
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got floyd and crabtree ready to step into my and flex spots any reason to start watkins over them im feeling a little gunshy on sammy after last weeks game and this weeks news
fantasyfootball,removed,i wanna start him so bad but im just gonna bench him in favor of ware
fantasyfootball,removed,watkins gio or tyrell williams
fantasyfootball,removed,im sitting shady for matt jones at dallas i know but my gut my gut
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got lamar miller ware and langford im gonna sit shady this week
fantasyfootball,removed,think im playing the old man
fantasyfootball,removed,marcus in da house
fantasyfootball,removed,big ben man
fantasyfootball,removed,why isnt tyrod on waivers winston for sure
fantasyfootball,removed,stafford is the safer pick but im liking bortles of beer this week
fantasyfootball,removed,either id probably lean palmer but the difference should be negligible
fantasyfootball,removed,fitz
fantasyfootball,removed,watkins will play but the junk store called re tyrod
fantasyfootball,removed,winston
fantasyfootball,removed,i need to choose of watkins hurns or floyd so far i have hurns and floyd starting but i keep reading that the watkins situation is not as bad as it seems and that revis got destroyed last week keep floyd and hurns or take one out for watkins
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got the luxury of having two of my late picks williams and ware producing like so im sitting him this week
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont like carrying qbs but think this is the right move
fantasyfootball,removed,is this a real question tyrod is trash
fantasyfootball,removed,bortles of beer
fantasyfootball,removed,dont get cute you didnt draft cam to sit him
fantasyfootball,removed,what about the opposite for mr forte im still deciding to put him as flex in my standard league or roll with doug baldwin
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got to pick between mccoywarewilliams and cooks get to start and has to sit i dont think im crazy for sitting mccoy he has the worst outlook of the
fantasyfootball,removed,i guess i never understood how people can not start their stars what kind of depth do you have where you really feel another player is going to outscore your no matter the matchup
fantasyfootball,removed,langford foster or shady
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr shady or woodhead leaning towards woodhead because im a jets fan need some unbiased opinions
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start forte over him at flex in a standard league other wrs are alshon and larry fitz
fantasyfootball,removed,so for standard would you start mike wallace over sammy
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah im on the fence between him and edelman in my flex in a ppr edelman just has such a nice matchup in comparison
fantasyfootball,removed,ice ice baby
fantasyfootball,removed,i didnt see a wdis thread yet i have mccoy vs jets yeldon sd d murray det and j stewart vs sf thoughts im personally leaning murray stewart mccoy yeldon
fantasyfootball,removed,winston
fantasyfootball,removed,not necessarily
fantasyfootball,removed,i think im going to start decker over sammy
fantasyfootball,removed,if its not collusion trades should go through this seems fair enough to me your league just needs to deal with it
fantasyfootball,removed,luck rhymes with yuck but youre playing him here
fantasyfootball,removed,youre right theyre wrong idk how to change their minds though veto needs to be stressed for collusion only
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah thats bullshit after last week i can see someone being high on decker and low on dez its not collusion it shouldnt be vetoed
fantasyfootball,removed,it is bs this is why you have to play in lm leagues so jelly leaguemates cant veto trades
fantasyfootball,removed,thats the mentality if they dont get anything out of it why let the trade happen its horse shit and ive threatened to leave leagues ive been in for years because of it
fantasyfootball,removed,the only reason to veto a trade is collusion period
fantasyfootball,removed,might have to fight a vato
fantasyfootball,removed,need to choose from watkins decker maclin benjamin most upside is watkinsdecker but injury concerns
fantasyfootball,removed,if the option to vote to veto is there then they can vote to veto its just part of how things go petition to change the rules to lm veto only
fantasyfootball,removed,its sad cause they dont even analyze the trade all theyre doing is seeing the name dez bryant compared to eric decker they need to analyze the trade themselves looking at each players situation injuries targets qb situation production in last x games etc once this thread gets enough comments you should send it to them
fantasyfootball,removed,sims or freeman or crowell this week or should i trade freeman for rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,trade rules should be one of the first things agreed upon when setting up a league ive been in and enjoyed leagues where collusion was the only valid reason to veto ive also been in and enjoyed leagues where trades have also been vetoed for competitive balance there are pros for both but you need to establish going in what the rule is
fantasyfootball,removed,not lopsided at all no guarantee dez has a good year at all without romo while decker is in the same offense that had him leading the league in redzone targets last year
fantasyfootball,removed,you need to convince the lm that the veto system is not the way to go it is an awful system all trades should go through no matter how bad they are unless there is suspected collusion
fantasyfootball,removed,people were questioning him for some reason because he suffered an ankle injury last year and had to miss most of camp would earn the starting job never made much sense to me personally
fantasyfootball,removed,veto is total bullshit tell you friends to keep their emotions for their weekly book club people that bitch about trades are probably the same people that never ask about trading for players no way he would ever trade dez well did you even ask on your side completely here
fantasyfootball,removed,just curious for those who have watkins are you playing him or if you have other options snead diggs etc are you sitting watkins
fantasyfootball,removed,should i sit ingram for him
fantasyfootball,removed,snead or watkinsi dont know advice
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt want to send obj to the antonio owner
fantasyfootball,removed,playing him in my flex over s shepard v jackson and tajae sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,i think rex ryan isnt gonna pull any punches it may be a low scoring contest but shadys gonna get his i have freeman as my rb mccoy l murray rb and wood head on my bench
fantasyfootball,removed,im starting langford over shady this week langford at home vs philly is hopefully a higherscoring game than mccoys matchup at home vs the jets my rbs are shady cja langford woodhead frank gore im starting woodhead at the flex
fantasyfootball,removed,im debating going sharpe over watkins this week ppr figure detroit should score meaning titans need to keep up basically pick of watkinsmoncriefsharpefuller rip keenan allen
fantasyfootball,removed,i need to decide whether to flex sammy demarco or moncrief and ive never been more confused
fantasyfootball,removed,i did the opposite of you i took fitz because his route running and hands for a guy like palmer thats the important thing when you need a down or a score palmers always gonna be looking fitz because he trusts him floyds nice but he seems to be more of the big play down the sideline threat floyd might have the bigger day but over the course of a season if theyre both healthy i dont see how fitz isnt the more consistent scoring option
fantasyfootball,removed,im sitting shady in favor of dangelo williams and cj anderson two juicy matchups if you have the depth to not play shady today do it
fantasyfootball,removed,was offered jamaal cobb and travis benjiman for dougie my palms have been sweating thinking about what to do
fantasyfootball,removed,sit him even if he plays he probably wont be at full health and russell wilson with no mobility isnt even close to as good plus the rams always play the hawks tough
fantasyfootball,removed,the guy with mccoy offered him to me what is an acceptable response for reference my current rbwr lineup looks like spencer ware carlos hyde aj green allen robinson jordy jeremy hill flexon my bench i have bernard jamaal charles tajae sharpe frank gore john brown
fantasyfootball,removed,torn start watkins shepard or tajae sharpe in
fantasyfootball,removed,pick two s watkins t benjamin s diggs t williams
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr team looking for advice on who to start mccoy jennings or foster
fantasyfootball,removed,debating on starting shady or do i go woodhead
fantasyfootball,removed,who would you pick between martin and latavious murray in a ppr league ive been going back and forth all week
fantasyfootball,removed,watkins or wallace
fantasyfootball,removed,in my team league i am starting forte and shady tonight while i wait for jamaal to get healthy
fantasyfootball,removed,in a ppr league my other wr are cooks and j matthews and i really dont have anyone else on the bench or available that i think will offer a better upside than sammy i have lafell and funchess on my bench and the best options available as free agents are beasley and kerley not the most appealing options i might just roll with sammy and hope my other wrs and rbs d johnson ware and jennings carry the load thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr wdis in my flex sammy watkins vs njy maybe playing tonight would have been no doubt starter without injury concern allen hurns sd mike wallace cleveland matt jones vs dallas frank gore denver sssr cleveland
fantasyfootball,removed,loved all the targets he got week should i start him or mike evans arizona not crazy about evans matchup and like the idea of benjamin at home with the having to travel to the opposite coast
fantasyfootball,removed,between martin blount demarco murray i can pick flex with gurley at which am should i be rolling with
fantasyfootball,removed,sammy watkins or golden tate or stefon diggs
fantasyfootball,removed,shaddy ware or lativius murray start
fantasyfootball,removed,i gotta roll watkins duke johnson gore or forsett in my flex gore is a definite no vs broncos i didnt get to see cleveland or baltimore play thoughts on forsett or djjr over watkins
fantasyfootball,removed,im so torn on sammy right now i got hogan sanu coleman and kerley on my bench
fantasyfootball,removed,im thinking about sitting him for miller and jennings with shepard in flex it feels like a gamble either way though because rashad in a good matchup might not be much better than shady in an iffy one
fantasyfootball,removed,tate or watkins ppr im split atm might go conservative and play test both flex options
fantasyfootball,removed,i got gurley foster and gore at the rb and nelson watkins and benjamin receivers thinking foster and gurley with nelson and watkins with benjamin at the flex
fantasyfootball,removed,needing some advice on who i should start over watkins fuller or diggs any help is greatly appreciated
fantasyfootball,removed,puts up a stinker there are multiple reports of significant pain qb and line looked terrible short week against an above average defense and on a thursday night im sitting him i really like watkins and im reluctantly starting mccoy tonight but i need to see how watkins plays before giving him anything other than a flex position even if he has a huge night theres just too much going against him for me
fantasyfootball,removed,if you had to choose who would you start this week watkins sanu or agholar
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone start yeldon over mccoy this week
fantasyfootball,removed,not a single player im contemplating starting or sitting is on these lists except jameis winston was really hoping for a starsit on devonta freeman or willie snead
fantasyfootball,removed,watkins or crabtree in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,it sucks for me be i have shady and forte im def starting forte but im on the fence about mccoy someone tell me what to do hahah fml
fantasyfootball,removed,choose of watkins landry moncrief diggs and marvin jones standard scoring watkins could go off tonight im leaning towards playing him
fantasyfootball,removed,start cooks over cooper in my flex pt ppr trufant has been solid
fantasyfootball,removed,you think this is a good time to throw a flier on fuller over watkins or do i have to start frank gore in the flex
fantasyfootball,removed,ughhh watkins or coleman in the flex both are dicey
fantasyfootball,removed,got forte warecharles and demarco right now im starting forteware thinking bout plugging into demarco for forte thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,so im super stacked at rb in one league gurley shady mccoy deangelo williamslevon bell spencer ware and latavius murray i gotta start dwill and i think i gotta start ware if hes a full go so basically i gotta choose between gurley mccoy and l murray obviously gurleys my dude but hes goin up against seatle and after wat happened last week i may be ch him frankly im thinkin l murray over gurley and mccoy because of matchups am i crazy
fantasyfootball,removed,would you rather start him or latavius murrayrandall cobb
fantasyfootball,removed,which should i start sharpe diggs watkins in ppr currently i have diggs and sharpe i am not feeling watkins on thurs night and against revis
fantasyfootball,removed,watkins smith ar sharpe and carlos hdye for outs and a flex who to pick
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks i needed someone to talk me down from that my rbs just seem so weak right now
fantasyfootball,removed,im debating about sitting mccoy for foster vs ne leaning towards shady but after seeing what david johnson did against the pats i can see foster having a big day ingram is my other starting rb
fantasyfootball,removed,pick out of these wr to start this is a and flex spot maclin dt snead m jones fuller
fantasyfootball,removed,watkins or ty williams decision time
fantasyfootball,removed,duke over julian e this week in the flex
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah i got brandon marshall forte and jets defense along with mccoy im fucked if this games a dud
fantasyfootball,removed,i have shady and d johnson but my only other rbs are riddick and abdullah i think its a nobrainer to start shady agree
fantasyfootball,removed,man this is making my wr choices difficult between decker vs buf watkins vs jets moncrief vs den dez vs was diggs vs gb and sharpe vs det im at a loss on who to play in my two wr slots this week sharpe and diggs has a nice ring to it eh
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start shady vincent jackson foster or marvin jones in my flex spot
fantasyfootball,removed,i drafted him in the second round i cant just sit him based on matchups and start bilal powell or some shit lol
fantasyfootball,removed,is woodhead a decent option in place of mccoy
fantasyfootball,removed,im normal in the dontbenchyourstuds camp but youre probably right
fantasyfootball,removed,still stuck on whether im going to start him or arian foster in my league stewart is in the much better offense that moves the ball but he gets goal line vultured by cam all the time and they dont really utilize him at all in the passing game while arian is in the much worse offense but they utilize him more and more in the passing game decisions
fantasyfootball,removed,is it worth starting diggs or fitz over watkins this week
fantasyfootball,removed,i have ap mccoy and deangelo rb no flex which sucks considering starting d williams over mccoy but the bills fan in me will probably start mccoy at least i know that if i go with mccoy he will see lots of touches and a healthy shady is usually a beast no matter the opponent
fantasyfootball,removed,i got offered a trade in my team ppr dynasty league guy is offering diggs and zeke for amari cooper do i take this trade
fantasyfootball,removed,paywall text from article for yall this column is dedicated to the grind of the fantasy football season in which hardworking owners are constantly thinking about possible waiver pickups andor trades to make all in the name of turning fake teams into very real moments of glory with that in mind here are the biggest questions for week with games loosely ranked from the most to least fantasy intrigue jaguars at chargers sunday pm key question who benefits most from keenan allens injury weve had the first major seasonending injury — see you next year in a distinctly lower draft round keenan — and its time to get a sense of how this target monsters targets get divvied up depending on what fantasy site you checked this week you saw pitches for travis benjamin tyrell williams and dontrelle inman as the biggest beneficiary the latter two are still widely available so if either appears to be the apple of philip riverss eye hed be well worth an add but what if its not so much any of those guys picking up the pieces but players already established as favored passcatchers im talking specifically about danny woodhead and antonio gates both of whom should get at least in extra look or two and maybe much more meanwhile riverss numbers dropped sharply last season in the eight games allen missed so this could be much ado about a crippled offense woodhead carries for yards last week also bears monitoring for his share of the rb workload with melvin gordon yards on carries chris ivory is out of the hospital but still unlikely to play much for the jags if at all giving tj yeldon a shot at improving upon his dreadful week rushing performance carries for yards if yeldon continues to look the other kind of jag say it with me now just a guy ivory would be a nice buylow target as jacksonville will likely want to feature him when he returns to full health saints at giants sunday pm key question is coby fleener an actual part of his offense folks who drafted fleener as a topsix te were expecting to see him in the end zone not on the side of a milk carton his one catch for six yards was one of the biggest fantasy duds and not the delicious milk kind of week that did however substantiate preseason talk that the offseason acquisition was not on the same page as drew brees and another disappearing act should have owners scrambling for a replacement if not cutting fleener outright willie snead didnt just look he was on the same page with brees in the opener — he was completing the qbs sentences turning nine targets into nine catches for yards and a score that moved him from interesting bench guy to solid flex play this week and more of that will have him in the mix those in need of an rb in deepish ppr leagues will want to keep an eye on travaris cadet owned in just percent of espn leagues who got seven targets last week and whose job security was greatly enhanced by the teams release of cj spiller last year new orleans trotted out the worst defense since it wasnt me and it didnt look much better in week new york with odell beckham jr has the potential to light up any unit but another saints sieve would confirm they are a group to target especially in dfs as for the battle for second in the giants wr pecking order sterling shepard and victor cruz essentially reached a stalemate last week so look to see if one pulls ahead in the teams home opener oh and did someone just request it wasnt me you got it cowboys at redskins sunday pm key question can dak prescott get the ball to dez bryant news of tony romos weekslong injury was seen as clear bad news for bryant but prescotts sparkling preseason play kept the stud wr from falling too far past the first round in most drafts then came week and now bryants owners are wondering if hes fallen and cant get up after he came away with a fleeneresque one catch for eight yards bryant did see five targets and almost caught a touchdown and a few more looks may be all it takes to right the ship on the other hand prescott may simply not be prepared to look far enough downfield to find bryant and if he continues to shower targets on jason witten targets and cole beasley that obviously boosts their values at least until romo returns ezekiel elliott owners would prefer that he receive more than just two targets converted last week into one catch for one yard and they certainly hope to see him do more with carries than yards although theyll take a touchdown every time matt jones owners just want to see him do anything and the cowboys who were the sixthmost generous fantasy defense for rbs last year present a great opportunity following a rough night versus the stingy steelers of course it will help if kirk cousins can look more like the version than what his owners were horrified to see last week and another ineffectual outing by him could put the qb in the let me see what else is out there zone titans at lions sunday pm key question did week tell us much about detroits offense with the lions scoring the most points in week there were plenty of interesting stat lines to ponder but it remained unclear what it all meant it doesnt help that the uproar came against the colts defense which looks to be among the leagues lamest and there is still some sorting out it would appear of roles the first order of business though is to see if the rb duo of ameer abdullah and theo riddick can be as effective as they were in indy or at least if one of them can beyond that there is more to be gleaned from the distribution of targets to those two plus the likes of marvin jones golden tate eric ebron and anquan boldin falcons at raiders sunday pm key question is devonta freeman stuck in a timeshare with tevin coleman for so much of the offseason the falcons talked up coleman and for so much of fantasy draft season so few of us listened figuring that sure freeman wouldnt necessarily get all the looks but hed get most of them right wrong at least for one week not only did coleman see nearly as many snaps and targets against the bucs he racked up many more yards most notably through the air thought to be freemans fantasy firewall now the two men or mans in their case take their act to oakland where freeman will attempt to restore the faith in him seahawks at rams sunday pm key question is todd gurley doomed by his teams ineptitude gurley ran in to a steady stream of eight and even nineman fronts en route to yards on carries as the rams put the la in laughable his task gets no easier against the seahawks but gurley did go for yards and a score at seattle in week last year also of note will be the distribution of work between seattles thomas rawls set to reclaim his topback status and christine michael who outplayed him against the dolphins at panthers sunday pm key question does carlos hyde have a followup this time sure he went off in week but hyde did the same last year and then had owners seeking other options for carolina kelvin benjamin tries to keep being cams key cog while devin funchess and ted ginn jr one catch each in week fight for relevance packers at vikings sunday pm key question that was just a blip right adrian peterson his owners were expecting something like carries but just yards on them was not supposed to be part of the ap curriculum wait — thats his age right hmmm colts at broncos sunday pm key question will trevor siemian carve up the colts the injuryriddled indianapolis secondary is there for the taking and the fantasy community owners of demaryius thomas if hes healthy and emmanuel sanders in particular want to know if siemian has what it takes to take advantage or if hell even be allowed to by conservative coach gary kubiak eagles at bears monday pm key question can carson wentz keep it up philadelphia bet on a good performance right out of the gate from its rookie qb and from wentz it came oops poor grammar fcs products who missed most of the preseason arent supposed to play that precociously but now he must do it on the road ravens at browns sunday pm key question will josh mccown restore gary barnidges value we should have known that rgcle would be a shortlived whatwerewethinking trend when he showed up for week with a man bun griffin helped barnidge drop a bagel in that game but mccown is down with his te offering renewed optimism buccaneers at cardinals sunday pm key question how little will john brown produce hobbled by concussioninduced headaches in the preseason the arizona wr fell way behind larry fitzgerald and michael floyd and it showed in week one catch for eight yards another statstarved game could make brown a prime buylow target as many had him ultimately leading the pack of cards bengals at steelers sunday pm key question who is pittsburghs no wr antonio brown reigns supreme in pittsburgh and pretty much in all of fantasy at the moment but markus wheaton who missed the opener should be back to give eli rogers a run for his runnerup money or will sammie coates rack up numbers jets at bills thursday pm key question can tyrod taylor bounce back thursday games are notoriously offenseaverse and the buffalo qb facing a gang green squad that sacked andy dalton seven times has a tall order in making up for a dismal debut and justifying the draftseason hype
fantasyfootball,removed,so would it be smart to bench maclin move baldwin from my flex in my spot and then flex travis benjamin
fantasyfootball,removed,man ppr pick larry fitzgerald ty hilton kelvin benjamin michael crabtree ty
fantasyfootball,removed,dez nearly had tds last week youre over tinkering
fantasyfootball,removed,unpopular opinion for sure but id do it its only week if fuller had made that deep catch everyone would be at least flexing him dak seems to prefer witten
fantasyfootball,removed,im seriously considering benching maclin for the first time in a while of having him on a ff team my only options are dt or gates for his spot any thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,can only start between ware williams forte and mccoy help think im rolling with forte on the bench but thats risking it since charles could possibly play thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,i have maclin evans crabtree wallace baldwin tyree williams and hurns should i be benching maclin
fantasyfootball,removed,ive been offered diggs for carlos hyde this seems like a crazy offer but i could probably have my choice of langford or efron in a counter offer is that too crazy i feel like hyde is much more valuable than that
fantasyfootball,removed,im really stuck on whether to start him need out of watkins ab nelson larry fitzgerald and sanders im leaning towards ab nelson and watkins
fantasyfootball,removed,my only options are evans watkins dt benjamin and tajae sharpe gotta start and no rbs worth starting at flex obviously starting evans and dt but would you go with benjamin or sharpe over watkins
fantasyfootball,removed,theres a notifier my team team settings fantasy football preview emails no idea how frequently this runs but if triggered at nightly batch would be pretty easy to create an ifttt recipe from this will play around with this tonight i agree would like to see this function
fantasyfootball,removed,post question here freeman is not
fantasyfootball,removed,shady or decker im playing woodhead either way full ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,maclin still over m floyd
fantasyfootball,removed,carlos hyde or duke johnson
fantasyfootball,removed,need your help folks who do i start at flex landry or j matthews rb lat murray or blount
fantasyfootball,removed,at this point would you play watkins or marvin jones in a full ppr man league
fantasyfootball,removed,id think youd have to go ware both are tough starts though
fantasyfootball,removed,i just traded cmike and sterling shepard for yeldon and sanuim feeling good about it
fantasyfootball,removed,thinking about now starting jordan matthews over maclin at the flex in standard thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,not sure if this should be going here but this is the closest i could get man league someone just dropped chris ivory and i have a man bench i have tyrell williams demarco murray jeremy hill gary barnidge and tajae sharpe do i drop any of these guys for chris ivory
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,theres nothing wrong with dalton he will be fine this season john brown may be worth the add if youre streaming this week probably joey g
fantasyfootball,removed,hopefully my jeremy maclin and morris for cooks and duke doesnt backfire lmao
fantasyfootball,removed,cadet has sleeper ppr value he had targets week which was more than ingramhightower combined mckinnon is a pure handcuff and injury play im holding here unless youre dropping ginn
fantasyfootball,removed,jeez youre playing with some dopes all should be owned but not sure what youre cutting i would try for some trades to free up some roster room first stewartsandersgordon for this weeks adds
fantasyfootball,removed,if the rams get to the goal line he will probably get the td im starting him keenum and gurley played the seahawks week last year and won keenum isnt that bad ok yea he is but im starting gurley
fantasyfootball,removed,sorry im tired of talking people around here out of idiotic moves go ahead sit your top pick in favor of your rounder in week good luck
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt rush morris should likely be rostered but youve got a think roster as it is
fantasyfootball,removed,i like wallaces outlook this season much more than jones im assuming no one will touch him with a pole so if youre flipping youre dumping the skin
fantasyfootball,removed,yup
fantasyfootball,removed,i probably would sss will never start for you and has minimal trade appeal morris will play into a timeshare soon
fantasyfootball,removed,any chance morris would be someone good to pick up im struggling at rb and could maybe trade my melvin gordon for him
fantasyfootball,removed,under performing wrs and tes cost me week i need to bench him and watkins for a safer floor id suggest others do the same sadly im starting diggs and maclin or cruz over watkins and dt
fantasyfootball,removed,jets jets jets jets
fantasyfootball,removed,bungles
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start him over yeldon in standard if ivory is out again
fantasyfootball,removed,allen
fantasyfootball,removed,kelce
fantasyfootball,removed,kelce
fantasyfootball,removed,sit tight pats will beat the tar out of the fish
fantasyfootball,removed,ebron by a mile
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got julio fitz and demaryius had keenan only have eli rogers on the bench available free agents beasley agholor dorsett hogan coleman etc who do i start as my ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,yes i am benching maclin this week as i have much better options at wr green evans and flex langford
fantasyfootball,removed,so i put crabtree in for my spot but i could replace him with g tate edelman or tyrell williams i think theyre all relatively the same as far as projections who would you fill in for
fantasyfootball,removed,is this where i ask for trade advice guy in my league needs rb i just lost keenan allen im thinking of giving him jamal charles i have charles leveon bell latavius murray theo riddick forsett jennings and crowell who would be a good trade he has marvin jones edelman maclin desean jackson and vincent jackson ppr league with keepers thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,hes currently sitting in waivers someone dropped him in my league im hearing hes being dropped en masse bad move or no
fantasyfootball,removed,need help should i start coby fleener or jason witten this week
fantasyfootball,removed,question for all you alfred owners lets say the plan is for him to play one series each quarter thats twice what he got last week touches optimistically is that enough for you to consider starting him as a flex maybe in team leagues but not in inquiring minds want to know
fantasyfootball,removed,dont get too cute wilson
fantasyfootball,removed,you cant sit brees right now
fantasyfootball,removed,i like big ben
fantasyfootball,removed,i think rivers is sunk this year but i feel this will be high scoring and woodheadgates will keep rivers relevant im playing the old man
fantasyfootball,removed,why you havent cut tyrod yet is beyond me
fantasyfootball,removed,im torn on my flex position between jennings and rawls heres my proscons for both jennings pros saints defense gave up td and yards vs rb last week saints run defense aint no good cons will eli throw the ball a lot limiting carries to jennings rawls pros rams gave up tds and over yards last week to rbs rams d line looked like swiss cheese httpsshibbolethidpcollegenetcomidpauthnuserpassword cons will cmike get more carries extra info im in a ppr league with ap and ware as my and im leaning towards jennings what do you all think
fantasyfootball,removed,winston is likely projected higher but im not sitting luck for anything not in top tier
fantasyfootball,removed,brees
fantasyfootball,removed,wilson
fantasyfootball,removed,breezy
fantasyfootball,removed,wilson
fantasyfootball,removed,dont see alex having a good day but understand your trepidation i hate multiple players going on tnf still i feel fitz is safer play than smith
fantasyfootball,removed,ice ice baby
fantasyfootball,removed,bortles of beer on the wall
fantasyfootball,removed,ick cousins but not loving either
fantasyfootball,removed,carr probably cut taylor for a dst or k dude is junk store trash
fantasyfootball,removed,winston
fantasyfootball,removed,luck
fantasyfootball,removed,im leaning palmer
fantasyfootball,removed,ryan
fantasyfootball,removed,gore
fantasyfootball,removed,stewart
fantasyfootball,removed,blount
fantasyfootball,removed,dmurray mathews
fantasyfootball,removed,sitting the hamster
fantasyfootball,removed,pick probably langford
fantasyfootball,removed,gore
fantasyfootball,removed,i feel you safe play is to sit gurley but so hard to justify that emotionally on the other hand i hate multiple players in tnf i might buck logic and start gurley ive got a similar dilemma in one league but not the tnf headache on top of it
fantasyfootball,removed,bad problem to have adfortemurrayware for me i might sit ware with the sprained toe but if you dont trust dmurray to stay engaged in the passing game no one will fault you
fantasyfootball,removed,i like rawls as a bounce back too in your flex depending on other bench options
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,im sitting the hamster here
fantasyfootball,removed,i think you have it right
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone start demarco over lesean tonight
fantasyfootball,removed,oh yeah its a team ppr question is would you blow your waiver for him
fantasyfootball,removed,sitting yeldon
fantasyfootball,removed,hitting yeldon
fantasyfootball,removed,if you dont have keenan allen anymore are you more inclined to take a shot with tyrell williams or dev parker
fantasyfootball,removed,riddle me this you have david johnson as you start j stewart over langford woodhead or yeldon in a ppr i have a flex spot as well j stewart is a constant dilemma
fantasyfootball,removed,if you had matt ryan andy dalton matt stafford and eli manning all available this week how would you rank them and who would you start
fantasyfootball,removed,mine was a sw reference toojust not a good one i guess haha ben kenobi obiwan kenobi obiwan now thats a name ive not heard in a long time a long time luke skywalker i think my uncle knows him he said he was dead ben kenobi oh hes not dead well not yet luke skywalker so you know him ben kenobi well of course i know him hes me
fantasyfootball,removed,have all of those players minus sterling and im feeling the same way
fantasyfootball,removed,demarco murray for travis bejamin
fantasyfootball,removed,been struggling with this decision i think i have to start wrs this week with one in my flex i currently have demaryius thomas jeremy maclin and jordan matthews starting my other options are michael crabtree travis benjamin and tajae sharpe depending on thomas status which would you start in thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,maclin landry gore diggs who sits im leaning towards sitting landry because he didnt show up last week and didnt show up against the pats last year
fantasyfootball,removed,the stats against dez are not favorable now im back on the side of starting watkins and sitting dez fuck
fantasyfootball,removed,would it make sense for me to start both latavius murray and rashad jennings this week over mccoy
fantasyfootball,removed,it would depend on whether watkins plays if not i go forte if hes active think you have to start shady
fantasyfootball,removed,drop mcmanus for gano
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start tate over him in ppr other options are eli rogers and corey coleman have dez too but hes sitting for sure maclin seems safest
fantasyfootball,removed,hauschka or brown this week and long term
fantasyfootball,removed,am currently debating whether to move diggs currently in my flex to over maclin and move jeremy hill to my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,maclin or sharpe this week i assume titans will be behind and throwing a lot but maclin is usually that steady presence
fantasyfootball,removed,some leagues dont use pks
fantasyfootball,removed,si
fantasyfootball,removed,sproles for the consistency in snaps
fantasyfootball,removed,im starting deangelo and matt forte but im considering him for the flex other options could be sharp coleman fuller or sanu
fantasyfootball,removed,blount or duke in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,i think im going to roll out snead aye but when i do maclin will put up yds with td
fantasyfootball,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
fantasyfootball,removed,its between maclin and sammy watkins for me higher upside for watkins but a much bigger gamble with he injury just dont see macklin scoring more than or points both could be a compete flop
fantasyfootball,removed,abandon league all ye who enter
fantasyfootball,removed,im considering playing tj yeldon over gurley if ivory is out for the gameis this lunacy
fantasyfootball,removed,check out umuffdivingsaturdays stuff
fantasyfootball,removed,whos on your waiver wire
fantasyfootball,removed,ive been flipflopping playing him or tajae sharpe all week and this just makes it harded
fantasyfootball,removed,deal
fantasyfootball,removed,remindme hours did tyrod bust again
fantasyfootball,removed,where are the notifications is it the little video clips
fantasyfootball,removed,im struggling with who to start between delaney walker and antonio gates this week any input
fantasyfootball,removed,cleats are hung up
fantasyfootball,removed,how cruel can the fantasy football gods be in week i already lost k allen and now you want another sacrifice in the form of hilton please no
fantasyfootball,removed,point ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont like it i dont believe in murray enough to trade a lot for him thats a lot for him
fantasyfootball,removed,dont do it
fantasyfootball,removed,z
fantasyfootball,removed,its tough to say considering gordon could be amazing or he could be very less than amazing
fantasyfootball,removed,please dont do this to us invest your time you keep spending posting about politics into ff and ill vote for gary johnson
fantasyfootball,removed,trade thread but seriously dont do it
fantasyfootball,removed,terrible idea
fantasyfootball,removed,eric decker if youre looking for a decent floor hes mr consistent snead if youre looking for a high ceiling that game looks like it could be a shootout
fantasyfootball,removed,looking for some rb advice i have rb slots and have mccoy stewart blount and mathews right now im leaning on starting mccoy and stewart but heavily considering switching mccoy out for blount what do you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,yup real fun to have this problem week tajae sharpe or tyrell williams who do you think has a better week
fantasyfootball,removed,i tried but i couldnt remember his name or what he titles the posts sheriff dick
fantasyfootball,removed,im sitting elliot vswas in favor of mccoy vsbuf dwilliams vscin and rjennings vsnosomeone please tell me im not crazy
fantasyfootball,removed,it took all of seconds to get the answer from sheriff asshat so whats the difference which method i used theres more than one way to do things moron
fantasyfootball,removed,i really am worried to start him i have snead dt and sharp starting rn over him

fantasyfootball,removed,im torn between banged up miller or martin in my flex leaning toward miller thp but he throws so many duds as of late i keep thinking d martin is gona be my savior of fantasy
fantasyfootball,removed,if you think this reasoning is worth a shot why not start tate and moncrief and sit sammy
fantasyfootball,removed,joe booger
fantasyfootball,removed,i think he gets better bradford has no problem airing it out and hes got a decent midrange ball too diggs will be fine
fantasyfootball,removed,how much of faab would you spend on him if allen was your assuming you dont have much depth
fantasyfootball,removed,are you a fucking retard
fantasyfootball,removed,it appears im not the only one that thinks youre a fucking retard its not even halftime of the first fucking game of the season and your feeling some regret drafting palmer you are fucking stupid and you need to hear it fuck your parents telling you you are a special snowflake no you are dumb
fantasyfootball,removed,wow look at that a td are still regretting drafting a top qb fuck you you are stupid you need to know that you are stupid

fantasyfootball,removed,as a zeke owner i would tell you that its week one and to relax hes gonna end up scoring significantly more points than alfred
fantasyfootball,removed,im debating offering ap for charles right now
fantasyfootball,removed,nope
fantasyfootball,removed,i did play with him but was older
fantasyfootball,removed,leveon bell owner just offered his bell for my woodhead and decker in both are on my bench so i think its a good trade thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,man i got offered kelvin benjamin for arian foster thats not a bad trade buy high
fantasyfootball,removed,use the trade thread but i would rather have dez right now
fantasyfootball,removed,you obviously drafted dez much higher than sanders what has changed one bad game
fantasyfootball,removed,i really like johnson i mean who doesnt but still and have alot of depth at wr i have julio and brandin cook so i dont need larry fitz who doesnt appear to be slowing down the guy who has johnson just lost keenan allen ware and fitz for johnson
fantasyfootball,removed,stefon diggs is sitting on my leagues waiver wire for some reason try to pick him up or wait and move up the pecking order
fantasyfootball,removed,meant more on the high of his draft positioin before we see he doesnt have the value it commended
fantasyfootball,removed,i didnt watch the whole game so didnt see the red zone targets have a guy that is interested in marshall and demarco murray and would give me jarvis landry and matt forte ppr wondering if i should see if he still wants to do that after the week
fantasyfootball,removed,have a guy that is interested in marshall and demarco murray and would give me jarvis landry and matt forte ppr wondering if i should see if he still wants to do that after the week
fantasyfootball,removed,is woodhead a must start next week against jacksonville im in a ppr league and i made the mistake of starting gore over him i also have abdullah on my bench so now the question becomes woodhead or abdullah next week
fantasyfootball,removed,im a diehard cowboys fan but part of me wants to trade off dez and zeke watching these games with fantasy on the mind just makes it even worse when its a loss and they dont put up much stats
fantasyfootball,removed,i mean statistically they are safer sure its not working out in these cases but looking at results instead of process is a dangerous way of thinking
fantasyfootball,removed,im assuming this is discussion for next season i feel spots is too few even with an ir though i dislike the ir concept in ffl in general i would personally leave roster alone one other option would be to collapse into a single rbwr flex we do this in my eliminator ffl which starts at teams and it works out well
fantasyfootball,removed,🔥🔥🔥
fantasyfootball,removed,because i drafted freeman at the beginning of the round
fantasyfootball,removed,im a steelers fan through and through you could probably cut me and id bleed black and gold if i wanted kids id name my son primanti and my daughter monongahela that being said i wanted to see rgiii turn the corner around even if it meant the browns were good i loved watching this kid for baylor and ever since hes come to the league hes gotten the shaft yeah he has had his shortcomings fucking slide but goddamn he was nice to watch when he was good my hearts out for him right now because i feel his career was over before it even began
fantasyfootball,removed,cry a river and then go drown yourself and then when your at the bottom about to see the light a devontae freeman will pick you up and bring you back to life seriously stfu and cry like a baby back bitch
fantasyfootball,removed,httpsimgurcomgallerymftfv ap watkins barnidge dthomas not too worried tho bell gordon brady bout to tapin after a few weeks of getting raped
fantasyfootball,removed,believe it recasts everything
fantasyfootball,removed,you guys think i should drop fleener and pick up gates or too soon
fantasyfootball,removed,spread out over my teams keenan watkins tyrod charles demaryius fleener gonna be a long year
fantasyfootball,removed,i stipulate in our constitution commissioner roster assistance provided you inform the commissioner before the players game has started eg voicemail email etc well try to fix anything to match your intent late adds will only be done prior to game time and incur a faab penalty i dont remember the rationale on the but its been there for a few years my feeling in your case if he didnt stipulate anything specific about his roster its tough titties you cant manipulate now and keep the integrity of the league intact spell out your conditions for making changes somewhere and make sure the other owners are aware of the process
fantasyfootball,removed,man they sure looked like shit i have them in at least half of my leagues and im likely moving on after that week i would probably flip for nyj the matchup with the bills is more appealing than chiefs houston
fantasyfootball,removed,take jones
fantasyfootball,removed,winston
fantasyfootball,removed,thats tough with what does the rest of your rb lineup look like hes definitely got the upside and played great i would probably pull the trigger but if last week is any indication its going to be a bloody year with plenty of adds coming

fantasyfootball,removed,how did i lose w green and anderson in my line up oh ill tell you how by going up against ware brees and starting fleener that little fucker goddamn i am saltee
fantasyfootball,removed,you shoulda fuck offa
fantasyfootball,removed,fuller i think sharpe will have a kendall wright type season of decent amount of receptions but no huge games points each game fuller is going to have a few big games and is the bigger talent
fantasyfootball,removed,my opinion is that sharpe will be more consistent a poor mans landry while fuller will be more up and down i think fuller ends with more points in standard and pretty close in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,fuller as long as he can catch the ball and not have dropping issues he will be the best guy in my eyes he can create a play from nothing into something he showed that on his td score this past week against chi
fantasyfootball,removed,i expect both to be good this year sharpe obviously will be less boom or bust fuller will win you a couple of games though
fantasyfootball,removed,d
fantasyfootball,removed,someone dropped john brown and i have coates any suggestions
fantasyfootball,removed,he will get the bulk of carries but its still a passing offense so his carries will likely max out around per game he also wont get any goal line work so youd be hoping for him to break a big run or catch i think he is a serviceable replacement until charles comes back especially in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,is abdullah a worthy start until hopefully charles comes back and fills the void yes he should be ok he wont carry your team but he wont sink it either
fantasyfootball,removed,hes gonna be playing according to himself so i wouldnt take that bad of an offer
fantasyfootball,removed,they just said sammys gonna be playing the season through injury no dice if it was me

fantasyfootball,removed,its been my experience that the stacked team scenario still provides for plenty of dramatic action week to week injuries will occur to thin out the elite players a bit though you do run the risk of having one team get lucky injury wise and then being a superpower if youre dead set against adding more teams maybe look into lowering your bench slots to crazy low i know but it would go towards keeping the superpower scenario from playing out and it gives everyone more incentive to pay attention to the waiver wire hope this helps im still only a third year commissioner myself
fantasyfootball,removed,jonathan stewart yes someone dropped him how high do i go
fantasyfootball,removed,you think people have to pay behind the scenes for kids that dont belong to them you have no fucking clue what you are talking about i didnt say anything about whether or not the kid is his or not obviously i have no knowledge about that what i do know about is the way the law works maybe you are so sure about the kid not being his because youre all on his dick like that in your comments so you know where its been
fantasyfootball,removed,i think were looking at it
fantasyfootball,removed,thirsty hoes shared alert via espn browns josh gordons arrest warrant withdrawn after he took a dna test was unaware until wed that he had to take testvia espn app httpespnapp
fantasyfootball,removed,hes a clear right now just traded him for melvin gordon in ppr now get back to rpolitics before ctr finds out you are wasting their money posting about fantasy football
fantasyfootball,removed,lol you absolutely can ever notice how half the claims against athletes end in payouts its because they dont want to be forced to stand trial publicly waste their time and money and harm their reputation its easier to pay the claimant and have them withdraw the case also yall sucked down that kool aid hard as i said shared alert via espn browns josh gordons arrest warrant withdrawn after he took a dna test was unaware until wed that he had to take testvia espn app httpespnapp
fantasyfootball,removed,youre just an idiot in general for benching benjamin and decker
fantasyfootball,removed,needs the gif to be effective
fantasyfootball,removed,start edelman over benjamin or decker
fantasyfootball,removed,i have gronk and bennett for te who do i start help
fantasyfootball,removed,if hes not out if the gates is in does twills value drop significantly i might play jmatthews at flex instead but i want to play tyrell cause i just want him to succeed thoughts anybodyanybodybueller
fantasyfootball,removed,whats wrong with him like the d i bet hell be riding high on that d all weekend hoping the browns take it hard
fantasyfootball,removed,you gotta have better options than starting him its too big of a gamble especially with an unknown rookie qb throwing to him
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr league i need wr alshon jeffery dal willie snead vs atl jeremy maclin vs nyj sterling shepard vs was kelvin benjamin vs min randall cobb vs det i need rb todd gurley tb demarco murray vs oak legarrette blount vs hou i also have ap but he is out ouch and i need flex
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah no shit read the edit fuckhead
fantasyfootball,removed,people really got offended by that
fantasyfootball,removed,id rather be starting edelman than yeldon the gameplan with brissett will likely involve him getting the ball out of his hands quickly which should benefit edelman
fantasyfootball,removed,seeing how i had allen woodhead and coleman i have no other choice
fantasyfootball,removed,i have no choice and unless it comes out that hes sitting because hes the back up i am starting him workload isnt the concern
fantasyfootball,removed,missing pieces tend to cause sharp falloff wanna back this up with some facts clark cause ive seen this statement literally every year since welker left
fantasyfootball,removed,pitta over dwayne allen though
fantasyfootball,removed,drafted gronkcharles allen 😐
fantasyfootball,removed,he is currently in my flex but having second thoughts and thinking diggs or d parker could be a better option
fantasyfootball,removed,im starting him as my flex well technically ive moved him to my wr and placed jordy into the flex spot since i dont want to lock flex on a thurs for tonights game what i am debating is do i start blount as an rb or swap him with riddick
fantasyfootball,removed,as of this moment he is my im still considering wallace ty williams or even floyd i like all of their matchups this week more than fullers i may stick with him there though and flex one of the others over riddick still
fantasyfootball,removed,diggs fuller shepard pick two standard league
fantasyfootball,removed,matty ice that oline is looking pretty good and he has weapons in julio sanu tamme freeman coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,winston for his playoff schedule
fantasyfootball,removed,matt ryan i was talking him up predraft and this sub shit itself laughing at me probably going to be a top if not qb this season
fantasyfootball,removed,i amthough i cant decide whos spot hell take golden tate or hurns
fantasyfootball,removed,if he doesnt go im gonna have to start tate or tsharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,team fullpoint ppr league i need wr a jeffery dal w snead vs atl j maclin vs nyj s shepard vs was k benjamin vs min r cobb vs det i need rb t gurley tb d murray vs oak l blount vs hou i also have ap but of course he is out ouch and i need flex
fantasyfootball,removed,nice job with the join the nazi party post title yesterday guys jesus christ
fantasyfootball,removed,conflicted if i shootouts go will fuller or wait first marshall other receivers for my flex would be lockette or white any advice
fantasyfootball,removed,enunwa or travis benjamin
fantasyfootball,removed,would you rather have pitta or tamme pitta did have a good week but tamme has gotten targets in both games plus atl is playing no in what could be a shootout im torn on who to start especially because im probably starting ryan
fantasyfootball,removed,pitta over kelce a good idea
fantasyfootball,removed,idk whether to start ivory or enunwa
fantasyfootball,removed,should i wait for marshall or start tyrell williams
fantasyfootball,removed,enuwa over dt diggs
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start ivory or crowell this week
fantasyfootball,removed,the trade would be pushed to tuesday if fuller is in the other guys lineup question because im on the topic about to trade theo riddick and randall cobb i can choose between jarvis landry or jordan mathews thoughts im eyeing mathews other guy is so hurt for rbs he drafted ap and abdulla
fantasyfootball,removed,choo choo
fantasyfootball,removed,in all honesty though the hype train on washington is almost entirely based on his measurables despite the fact that we have no clue what his vision is like but do know he fumbles drops passes didnt really start in college didnt majorly produce in college and is a rookie who was late to the start of camp simply stated zenner is a better football player with similar measureables and to ignore that fact is concerning for a website that is supposed to be spitting out reliable fantasy analysis
fantasyfootball,removed,i have been to matthew berrys house before i know where he lives
fantasyfootball,removed,ironically enough one of the first google results for dad dicking was a reddit thread referring to lebron dad dicking teams
fantasyfootball,removed,team fullpoint ppr league i need wr a jeffery dal w snead vs atl j maclin vs nyj s shepard vs was k benjamin vs min r cobb vs det i need rb t gurley tb d murray vs oak l blount vs hou i also have ap but of course he is out ouch and i need flex
fantasyfootball,removed,haha u angry fucks i was actually looking for that thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,i didnt like what i saw from sims last game but he might just turn it around and be a ppr monster atlanta backfield is weird but coleman has put up respectable back to back fps i feel like he is edging out freeman and atlanta is tailoring his skill set around their game scheme more so than freeman i am personally starting coleman as he has been consistently accruing points on my bench
fantasyfootball,removed,choo choo fuck you
fantasyfootball,removed,you can read up uphoecesbrowns methodology eg high ou scores big favorites heavy run teams favorable kickers
fantasyfootball,removed,you dont care because it doesnt fit your shitty narrative did this guy steal your girlfriend
fantasyfootball,removed,tes were a bit overrated post gronk imo i know all we care about is scoring but a lot of those guys were taken high because people were looking for high scoring te duos its subsided somewhat at this point i compare henry to a guy like witten a complete elite te te stock has dropped like rbs but i still think this guy is the real deal best te out in years type of player
fantasyfootball,removed,henry burton or james this week im in a league so it gets thin at te
fantasyfootball,removed,agreed but if sanu was your only alternate option pryor is worth starting correct
fantasyfootball,removed,i have enunwa tyrell and fuller who should i start at flex i am concerned about starting fuller when i am already starting hopkins
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah im still gonna bench him for barnidge i know small league i would probably still bench him for anybody top
fantasyfootball,removed,would love to start enunwa but just cant choose him over sharpe or matt jones even though its a ppr league am i being dumb
fantasyfootball,removed,i kind of wish he wasnt i cant figure out whether to roll with gronk or stick with pitta to make matters worse i have to decide between blount and edelman at flex damn you and your unpredictability bb
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start gronk or tamme at te does gronk start over d murray in the flex if tamme is worth the nod at te
fantasyfootball,removed,the dindu nuffins will probably still be asleep at anyway
fantasyfootball,removed,am i dumb for sitting him and playing reed instead figure wallace at jax makes a better flex play than gronk with a string qb vs houston
fantasyfootball,removed,starting marty b
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont know what to do pitta has a sexy matchup vs jax and gronk might just be a decoy
fantasyfootball,removed,i have gronk or pitta pitta was solid last week why are thursdays like this last week it was watkins this week gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk vs hou or dwayne allen vs sd
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck i dont know if i roll with him or witten the whole situation hes in right now worries me immensely someone calm my nerves about him
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk or witten
fantasyfootball,removed,gronkowski or tamme
fantasyfootball,removed,wdis gronk tajae sharpe or demaryius thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,elliot mccoy ware cmike
fantasyfootball,removed,no doubt houston dst is staying in my lineup but do i bench gronk for ebron
fantasyfootball,removed,pitta
fantasyfootball,removed,i would pick up gronk man
fantasyfootball,removed,pitta
fantasyfootball,removed,seems like a fair trade if you need a wr more then its fine although sproles hasnt be doing great lately so i imagine that ryan will get even more touches and keep in mind that once ertz is healed up itll probably take away from some of jordans touches source am an eagles fan
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk vs houston cruz vs washington or forsett jacksonville
fantasyfootball,removed,damn gronk or julius thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,jordan reed or gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,i have ware on the bench now how does everyone feel about picking up ivory instead i know ware will likely be the guy if charles were to go down but ivory has a better shot of being the starter in jax
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk or zach miller miller has been sorta kinda decent for me so far but gronk is gronk what to do what to do
fantasyfootball,removed,do i sit walford for gronk he was decent last week
fantasyfootball,removed,seeing everyone saying they are starting him over wittenpitta but i have delanie walker with a very juicy matchup this week im lost on what to do put gronk in but having doubts any thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,its illogical because god isnt real
fantasyfootball,removed,yes im playing gronk over tamme no
fantasyfootball,removed,should i play miami instead of texans now
fantasyfootball,removed,someone dropped ivory on wednesday in my league team ppr how much faab would you put
fantasyfootball,removed,serious though i have gronk and was savvy enough to pick up pitta before season started pitta has been solid and wonder if he will be better vs jacksonville than gronk tonight who would you start gronk or pitta
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk or pitta
fantasyfootball,removed,i have pitta going against jacksonville its not that im worried about gronk im worried about his qb
fantasyfootball,removed,crap dont know if i should play gronk or gates now
fantasyfootball,removed,any thoughts on this trade receiving gronk sending ezekiel elliot and julian edelman
fantasyfootball,removed,have ebron as other te what to do
fantasyfootball,removed,anddddd i am not sure if i should start him or pitta
fantasyfootball,removed,i have bennett and gronk oh the decisions reasoning start gronk gronk is gronk does gronk things gronkily start bennett gronk may not play qb situation favors bennett as he worked with the team all week bennett has been doing well in gronk absence i still think i want to start gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,by some weird situation in my draft i have greg olsen as my other te should i keep him in or bench him for gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,start him over witten or over fuller in my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,so does that mean i start blount and sit l murray o
fantasyfootball,removed,tamme vs new orleans or gronk against houston
fantasyfootball,removed,would you play both reed and gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk or a gates
fantasyfootball,removed,this is kind of relevant to discussion so i think it merits asking here instead of wdis but is he back healthy enough to start over bennet for those who chose to handcuff
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop bennett for either dwayne allen or tamme
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys start reed and gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,i replaced my tight end who was injured with martellus bennet bad idea
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk or witten
fantasyfootball,removed,still going with witten against the bears
fantasyfootball,removed,drafted gronk but picked up walford on waivers whos the better start this week
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start him over josh gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk or pitta please somebody im about to go into a physics exam and need to update my roster
fantasyfootball,removed,we did it we beat racism what a world we live in
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk or barnidge
fantasyfootball,removed,start gronk tonight or vance macdonald sunday
fantasyfootball,removed,rnflstreams
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk or tamme httpiimgurcombzzbchlgif
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start him over a questionable delaine walker
fantasyfootball,removed,help jacob tamme or gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,i have gronk edelman and blount on my roster depending on how gronk does this could be magical i also have pitta however and im on the fence about this gronk starting could honestly be a scare tactic he might not get much play time he might get hurt again but i feel obligated to gronk not just because im in new england but because gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk or crabtree
fantasyfootball,removed,am i stupid for starting tamme saints over him this weekend i really feel like this is the more solid play until brady gets back especially tonight thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk or pitta ppr im leaning towards pitta but its gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,martellus bennett or kelce
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk or tamme
fantasyfootball,removed,welp guess im benching bennett and starting kelce
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk or walker
fantasyfootball,removed,do i play bennet hmmmm
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk or rudolph rudolph seems like a really solid play on his own
fantasyfootball,removed,i can do things and stuff
fantasyfootball,removed,im in a situation where i have hill and gio and a person in my league wants to trade freeman for gio and i have no idea on whether its a good trade or not
fantasyfootball,removed,lets pick players from teams with bye weeks that sounds logical i bet you brady elliott edelman and the pats def score a wooping this week dumb fuck
fantasyfootball,removed,holy shit i never claimed to be a mod every time its brought up it gets downvoted to hell and someone says that those questionsdiscussions should be taken to rdfsports most of the articles and posts about daily fantasy that survived the downvotes were complaining about its advertising and discussions about it being made illegal so in short no we cant really talk about it i suppose i could have been a little more clear about that but good lord calm down
fantasyfootball,removed,and play him in my flex my bench is stacked with unsure rbs dixon jennings dwayne train c michael on bye
fantasyfootball,removed,hey man whens gordon coming back to play hope you are starting him this week
fantasyfootball,removed,again i respectfully disagree the browns running game has been trending in the right direction its just hard when your gameplan gets hurt on the second drive each game this week baring nobody breaks another ankle they should look efficient seattles line is terrible for the run block this year no worse off than detroit
fantasyfootball,removed,someone dropped him should i drop ab for him
fantasyfootball,removed,thats what they call cutlers kid on the league
fantasyfootball,removed,dont do it
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,lewis or coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,hey man its been a week wondering if i should drop him yet
fantasyfootball,removed,ok hotshot
fantasyfootball,removed,he dead
fantasyfootball,removed,full ppr woods la crowder baltimore humphries carolina im currently starting woods like his targetsgame these last weeks not high on crowder after last week same could be said about humphries but carolina is out cbs so their secondary could be prime for the abusing and besides evans who else is winston throwing to
fantasyfootball,removed,would you play carbtree instead of kb
fantasyfootball,removed,for what its worth i just dropped powell for the quizz and going to roll with him on monday night
fantasyfootball,removed,have palmer benched lynch vs falcons or cousins vs ravens
fantasyfootball,removed,lynch or cousins heelllpp
fantasyfootball,removed,fair enough another league hoyer or lynch
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,lynch or tyrod
fantasyfootball,removed,lynch or buc fucker anderson
fantasyfootball,removed,im in a qb league pick up this guy or roll with houernas my
fantasyfootball,removed,pick one hoyer vs indianapolis or lynch vs atlanta
fantasyfootball,removed,with this news would bennett still be a good play this week or would you guys go with making america brate again
fantasyfootball,removed,im torn on this dude or ertz this week 😢
fantasyfootball,removed,depends what receivers are on the wire if there isnt anyone great then hope your boys can pull out a good weekend
fantasyfootball,removed,drop kicker then if you need a few more to catch the win pick up the buccaneers kicker for monday night or sunday night kicker
fantasyfootball,removed,what kind of waivers do you play with
fantasyfootball,removed,lynch in im in half ppr dt or pryor what do you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,randy moss is a generational talent that you see possibly once in a lifetime you cant even begin to compare the two and he wasnt coming off an acl tear in
fantasyfootball,removed,i understand playing for the best matchup and there are rbs that are sitting on most wires that i believe could instantly make matthews droppable should the teams starter become hurt similar to this situation but r kelly is a udfa who has never handled more than carries and is no guarantee hell have a lead role this week like i said above matthews isnt going to win you many games but if he stays healthy hes isnt going to lose you any either r kelly is a lotto ticket right now similar to what kenny dixon and dwayne washington were at one point this season no chance id give up my safety net in matthews for a lotto ticket
fantasyfootball,removed,why is this game so important last weeks win put me overall in points my opponent this week always beats me over a year span its always brutal too year one i went before losing the championship to him i was up by and all he had was jamaal charles cue the jamaalocaust when he put up fantasy pts on tds this year we are both in bye week misery however he gets to start cole beasley and jacquizz rodgers at my expense as i dropped both players two weeks ago and am now killing myself over it i want this w i want it so bad early projections had him winning g but due to some injury updates and his d doing poorly on thurs its at in his favor
fantasyfootball,removed,yahoo sucks get pihole
fantasyfootball,removed,devantae booker zeke lamar miller spencer ware who do i start
fantasyfootball,removed,i got offered arob lamar miller for dt and golden tate in pt ppr where i still have bookerware but my wrs are arobtyrell williams cole beasley
fantasyfootball,removed,im playing cam newton i picked up bryan hoyer two weeks ago when it wasnt clear if cam was going to play though i guess what im saying is sit him as a chargers fan his ceiling is like points this week
fantasyfootball,removed,i am a bot on behalf of reddit i would like to thank you for your honesty we live in harried times honesty is in short supply thats why when you go out of your way to assure the reddit community that your comment is honest i honestlybot have made it my mission to thank you
fantasyfootball,removed,and this year only catch for yards against buf i have and edelman flex issue this week edelman kelvin j white or gillislee
fantasyfootball,removed,that was dumb
fantasyfootball,removed,damn i think powell gets a good workload but i dont know if he gets tds miller should be a good bet for at least one touchdown limited work or not
fantasyfootball,removed,that guy fucks
fantasyfootball,removed,leveon bell vs jamaal charles in ppr has been killing me

fantasyfootball,removed,cool appreciate the feedback
fantasyfootball,removed,eifert was out last year and he wasnt a target monster who the fuck is fuller and b miller you expect them to take away targets from one of the best wrs in football great analysis cupcake get back in the kitchen and make yourself useful because you have no idea wtf youre talking about
fantasyfootball,removed,so i am in a keeper league this is the third year of it there is an imbalance in the league that being said jordy got taken overall and by the third round rolled around cobb was the best pick on the board so i grabbed him today i wake up and i see a trade request they want cobb and theyre offering jordy so my options are to have faith in cobb who is and i could keep as a third round pick for the next three years or i could go with jordy who costs a second round pick anyone have any opinions on that i feel like jordy has a higher ceiling but cobb will be more reliable week in and week out
fantasyfootball,removed,reague
fantasyfootball,removed,well you didnt use the percentages at all and just went with across the board so
fantasyfootball,removed,i posted this almost verbatim in a jordy thread nearing the end of its viewing life cycle was hoping i could get some feedback from folks thanks in advance for your cents so i am in a keeper league this is the third year of it there is an imbalance in the league that being said jordy got taken overall and by the third round rolled around cobb was the best pick on the board so i grabbed him today i wake up and i see a trade request they want cobb and theyre offering jordy so my options are to have faith in cobb who is and i could keep as a third round pick for the next three years or i could go with jordy who is and costs a second round pick anyone have any opinions on that i feel like jordy has a higher ceiling but cobb will be more reliable week in and week out jordy also hasnt played any snaps yet and not having those reps in yet worries me about the trade
fantasyfootball,removed,nailed it
fantasyfootball,removed,sammy watkins but thats unlikely
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck your title
fantasyfootball,removed,wrong thread but either if you can swing it
fantasyfootball,removed,well you should try to get either cause they are getting ripped off if its a for
fantasyfootball,removed,i feel comfortable with langfordgio at the lowest just want to see what the community thinks thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,im in a league and i have no bench qb as of right now i have a cut throat waiver wire so first come first serve literally only backups available is shaun hill the most likely starter if bridgewater is out
fantasyfootball,removed,well i would definitely vote a strong no on drafting bell and gordon unless youre comfortable losing your first or games at i think it depends on who the first teams pick zekehopkinsdj could be there and you might be able to get miller or bell or marshall or jordy in the really depends on your league i was able to get keenan in the
fantasyfootball,removed,dj no question
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,im about sign up looks we could both benefit from a friend code if anyone has one pm me and ill use it
fantasyfootball,removed,green owner just offered me randall cobb for martellus bennett and rashad jenningsits ppri like jennings this year though
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont have wareworth to get west
fantasyfootball,removed,t smith or dwayne allen have d walker
fantasyfootball,removed,taco leagues can be anywhere
fantasyfootball,removed,taco league
fantasyfootball,removed,i got him in the beginning of the round in a team ppr league round team ppr taco league
fantasyfootball,removed,for where you are now i would hold those two guys should get decent carries whereas someone like morris is a clear backup just watch waivers and maybe try to find a deal we dont know your team composition or who else is on waivers so its hard to give good advice
fantasyfootball,removed,thats not too bad i have doug martin and matt jones in my man
fantasyfootball,removed,tj if alfred steps into the starting roll for any reason at any point this year id consider him a top fantasy rb with romo and top with dak
fantasyfootball,removed,depending on your roster you can pick up some backup rbs deandre washington oak derrick henry tenn both have a shot at becoming the starter due to injury or lackluster play
fantasyfootball,removed,he dropped to the end of the in our league team ppr round ppr httpswwwfantasyproscomnfladprandallcobbphp taco league
fantasyfootball,removed,lol came here to say this
fantasyfootball,removed,julio in all formats

fantasyfootball,removed,maclin due for a breakout charles is back which will help open things up and oakland is terrible against the pass dont trust jstew coming back off an injury yet
fantasyfootball,removed,add a defense drop one of tyler lockett enunwa dwayne wash deandre wash dion lewis julius thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,man standard espn pt td russell wilson vs atlanta in the storm hoyer vs jacksonville alex smith vs raiders in the wind
fantasyfootball,removed,what are your thoughts on one those guys for the flex spot assuming coates is out i think ill go ahead and drop dwash
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks man and yeah its standard my first reaction was enunwa but he has yet to live up to the hype i think its between him deandre or someone from the waiver wire i need this win bad so hope it works out lol
fantasyfootball,removed,im still waiting for an admission that you were wrong after your extremely condescending and incorrect responses to me whats is that bad did i break it
fantasyfootball,removed,as someone who just traded way carr id still go with him palmer hasnt shown that hes close to repeating his career year last year and carr had been so consistent so far so i think you stick with him
fantasyfootball,removed,wilson vs atlanta hoyer vs jax alex smith vs oakland
fantasyfootball,removed,one flex team standard decimal scoring deandre washington vs kansas city coates q miami enunwa arizona lockett vs atlanta or a waiver wire pickup beasley woods terrane williams etc
fantasyfootball,removed,deandre is uninjured think youre confusing him for dwayne
fantasyfootball,removed,id go jmatt
fantasyfootball,removed,thoughts on starting cobb in flex other options are coates risky with finger cameron meredith mark ingram
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop maclin or crabtree to add cobb to throw into flex
fantasyfootball,removed,sooo i originally had amari cooper julian edelman as my wrs today with legerrette blount in the flex thinking of now putting cobb instead of cooper and its a ppr league what do you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,maclin or cobb at ppr flex this week
fantasyfootball,removed,so against a pit defense trust or bust
fantasyfootball,removed,ahh now begins the hour and minute deliberation over whether i should start him over the kc rbs or not
fantasyfootball,removed,should i go with him or bobby rainey or forsett as
fantasyfootball,removed,now i have to decide if i want to play him over coleman i am not sure if i trust foster coming back from an injury so i will probably stick with coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,cobb over b powell in flex ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,who are you debating between i dropped parker last week in my man and want to give him one last chance i like his talent and speed but the dolphins have been atrocious and im deeply concerned about his target counts
fantasyfootball,removed,your sarcasm detectorbrain is broken retard
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr i just need one mike wallace at nyg jeremy kerley at buf eddie royal vs jac or tyrell williams vs den

fantasyfootball,removed,my dst has more touchdowns than the rest of my team
fantasyfootball,removed,wtf adam gase
fantasyfootball,removed,pathetic charles owners down voting anyone whos happy about ware lmao its common fucking sense that theyre gonna ease charles back in cant believe people expected like carries this week
fantasyfootball,removed,stay losing pussy
fantasyfootball,removed,hopefully charles gets like carries all game so all his owners in here cry a little bit more
fantasyfootball,removed,how much does your life suck that a football players stats matter enough to you that you actually consider it as a misfortune in your life
fantasyfootball,removed,picked up texans d while vikes are on bye looks like i can drop the defense and want to pick up a fa needs to be game or later since im on espn choices are floyd maybe has a get right game andre ellington david johnson handcuff adam thielen maybe diggs is banged up tyler ervinalfred blue lamar miller handcuff any ideas
fantasyfootball,removed,well fuck i need every point possible fuller or enunwa in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,so will fuller or matt forte fullers matchup is incredibly nice but could have lingering issues
fantasyfootball,removed,great now i need to decide between him enunwa or brown
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck you op tagged
fantasyfootball,removed,sent cj anderson j thomas and decker for gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,i have a chance to swap him out with brown at flex should i
fantasyfootball,removed,to screw us murray owners

fantasyfootball,removed,what a block
fantasyfootball,removed,just watched walking dead rip abraham
fantasyfootball,removed,whats ridiculous is i targeted bortles in my drafts thankfully have rid myself of him in all leagues

fantasyfootball,removed,team standard pick cobb atl thomas vs sea crowder cin jeffery vs min meredith vs min moncrief vs kc
fantasyfootball,removed,cooper thomas and brown if he plays

fantasyfootball,removed,not missing much from here
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck yourself nub
fantasyfootball,removed,add tucker or lambo i dont need a kicker this week or i can pick one up after the sunday afternoon games
fantasyfootball,removed,murray gordon miller trade for blount cmike replaced twest coleman fa woodhead naturally my receivers suck
fantasyfootball,removed,even without the two te situation drop fleener you cant be sitting there going i dont know ive got jordan howard

fantasyfootball,removed,rick
fantasyfootball,removed,spencer ware vs indy devontae booker vs san diego
fantasyfootball,removed,good that fucking pimp got me points keep doing you bortal kombat
fantasyfootball,removed,same
fantasyfootball,removed,meanwhile youre fucking reatrded do you not know what an anomaly is jesus kid quit acting tough hoping murray got hurt when its clear hes leaps and bounds better than cjs bum ass do you even know what an anomaly is cj getting hurt and playing through a torn ligament is an anomaly at all comparing him to demarco is downright idiotic and pathetic case closed there you have it
fantasyfootball,removed,this is crazy false take a better look at the data
fantasyfootball,removed,certainly worth the stash and i agree that he needs to be talked about a little more ben loves the check down to the te especially for quick yard dumps rz hes looking for his biggest man and thats usually the te now jj has done a fine job while green has been out but lets not forget that pittsburgh acquired green to be the guy and hes much more of a dynamic playmaker at his size than jj is i believe hes like and ran close to a thats insane anyway you put it green is a physical freak that should stretch the field and if you look at his stats he has decent yards per reception i believe it was around yards or so but dont quote me on that so basically he gets downfield often and makes the most of it due to the speed this is a guy to be excited about when hes back and ben is too
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr already have booker locked in as with bell on bye and mccoy looking to sit start james white mike gillislee robert kelley jordan howard
fantasyfootball,removed,terrible nickname stopped reading after that
fantasyfootball,removed,pick one jimmy graham no lavatius murray tb
fantasyfootball,removed,if he does i would still rather have lewis
fantasyfootball,removed,lol the coleman role
fantasyfootball,removed,herny as fuck
fantasyfootball,removed,miller or gillislee
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop him to stash dion lewis i havent used him yet i have bell ware and cmike
fantasyfootball,removed,if shadys out gileselle or ty
fantasyfootball,removed,hunter or martellus this week
fantasyfootball,removed,pretty please tryna decide between jordy and cooks
fantasyfootball,removed,id take forte or jaquizz for thomas in a heart beat its a waste land for starting bell cow rbs jaquizz is more of a risk because of the possibility of martin returning but if martin doesnt return that playoff schedule is juicy
fantasyfootball,removed,should i play benjamin or kelley over him
fantasyfootball,removed,henry or doyle then
fantasyfootball,removed,jordy please how worried should we be about trufant in coverage i can see this and cobb news cutting both ways less mouths to feed for arod or less weapons atls gotta worry about
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys start diggs or enunwa over cobb i feel like cobb might be used as a decoy herethanks
fantasyfootball,removed,didnt get a chance to see the matchup last week but who did trufant cover in the sd game seems like sd was able to move the ball through the air and tyrell william and kelvin benjamin were able to rack up some yards
fantasyfootball,removed,i can slot pryor in for cobb and start lat murray as my flex would you recommend murraycobb
fantasyfootball,removed,if he cant do it somebody else probably can in whats looking like a possible shootout vs atl thats how the song goes right
fantasyfootball,removed,jordy atl trufant vs cooks vs sea legion of boom
fantasyfootball,removed,trade cobb for crowell hurting for rbs
fantasyfootball,removed,accepted this trade today thoughts standard scoring give marvin jones patriots dst get brandon marshall broncos dst
fantasyfootball,removed,team pt ppr i get jordan reed i give jacquizz rogers
fantasyfootball,removed,qb winston wrs evans hopkins cobb moncrief ty montgomery hes also rb rb forte ware gio gore booker rawls dion lewis te gronk defense seattle feel like im in great position for a for dont know who to target though and who to give up long term doesnt make sense to own both cobb and montgomery really only want to target elite players at this point but thats tough to do what do
fantasyfootball,removed,sup errybody so im gonna have to roll with of these guys this week and at least has to be a wr suggestions wr dez alshon michael thomas rb miller booker asiata
fantasyfootball,removed,high stakes league man standard scoring my bookeramari cooper for his julio my team qb big ben cousins rb david johnson hyde booker jacquizz mckinnon wr jordy amari corey coleman te kelce my wrs are already the leagues best and i believe i have the best team so do i use my great bench to get the top wr it hinges on the health of hyde as my do i make the deal and get off the booker hype train or stay put
fantasyfootball,removed,friday night fun fest recommendations can i drop cory coleman for hunter henry ros ppr wrs a rob dt crabtree moncrief coleman tes eifert
fantasyfootball,removed,marvin and will
fantasyfootball,removed,mean like josh brown beats his wife mean or
fantasyfootball,removed,i have rawls but dion lewis is available should i make the switch also corey coleman could be an option because im pretty set at rb with dj booker quizz hyde and stewart wrs are evans hopkins sanders tyrell and diggs thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,average like josh browns an average kicker who beats his wife
fantasyfootball,removed,so kind of like josh browns wife wishes shed married a chicken sandwich because it wouldnt beat her
fantasyfootball,removed,oh god i have too many packer receiving shares what do i do pick of dt michael thomas adams cobb pick of ty adams beasley gillislee
fantasyfootball,removed,fleener or doyle or gates
fantasyfootball,removed,over graham
fantasyfootball,removed,its totally terrible but it puts a lot of weight on finding waiver guys or draft guys and then keeping them for life i have benefitted a lot from the rules including two titles others think its terrible for the market
fantasyfootball,removed,sanders
fantasyfootball,removed,to the top with you
fantasyfootball,removed,thinking about picking up jacquizz and dropping howard is that a bad ros move i also have bell stewart gore and lewis
fantasyfootball,removed,sorry if this is the wrong place to ask but as a shady owner do i drop either of will fuller or mckinnon for gillislee
fantasyfootball,removed,standard pick or if you think i should flex over gore ten jeffrey gb meredith gb cobb vs chi crowder det
fantasyfootball,removed,in the league not second in depth chart
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr give zeke elliot get allen robinson and jordan howard from offer or amari cooper and terrance west from offer my other wr brandon marshall jordan matthews chris hogan corey coleman my other rb shady mccoy and yes i picked up gillislee jeremy hill isaiah crowell sitting at wondering if i should make a mix up
fantasyfootball,removed,im thinking of trading him for cmike does that seem fair
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,play howard or montgomery at flex
fantasyfootball,removed,what if i moved jordan howard out of my rb slot put him to the bench move blount out of my flex and start cobb at my flex so i would start both cobb and montgomery
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck off
fantasyfootball,removed,someone posted this snapchat of him from last week dude is thick but definitely not pudgy like last season
fantasyfootball,removed,hill but use the threads this will be gone soon
fantasyfootball,removed,if riddick is out im flexing hill and you should too hill will get at least td book it
fantasyfootball,removed,i am leaning slightly towards hill jets are terribad and i can see bengals taking an early lead and not giving it up second choice would be wallace assuming flacco will play due to the targets hes been getting and like you said sssr potentially being out
fantasyfootball,removed,wtf does child comment mean
fantasyfootball,removed,i would start meredith vs green bay this is the game that maclin has to shine but i feel like andy reid is going to force the run game down nos throat and it wont be quite the gunslingfest most are expecting
fantasyfootball,removed,cameron meredith
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard pick two maclin vs no montgomery vs chi james white vs pit diggs vs phi mathews vs min im leaning towards montgomery and white because they should have fairly high floors and im starting alex smith and travis kelce for kc already which makes me nervous to start maclin
fantasyfootball,removed,marvin jones the uo on the nokc game is about pts but i think kc will try to beat them on the ground i would definitely start cooks over maclin just because i feel like no will have the ball in the air a lot more
fantasyfootball,removed,its between him and white imo i think they have similar outlooks but the montgomery play is a lot more fun and entertaining which is what this is all about
fantasyfootball,removed,no way dont get trade raped
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont like any wr against the broncos so it comes down to ty or white for me i think they have similar outlooks if you can play ty as a wr and keep your flex open i would play him and allow his scoring tonight to dictate the rest of your lineup for this weekend ie keep it safe or go for boombust
fantasyfootball,removed,safest play would be cobb montgomery since you cover both the low and high ou scenarios the biggest boom bust would be cobb bernard
fantasyfootball,removed,you start meredith until proven otherwise chicago will have to throw this game although it seems they want to run in the red zone
fantasyfootball,removed,i think ware and charles will split but that kc will run a lot more than experts are predicting against no you cant bench jordy against chi that would be criminal the nyj situation is unproven at this point so i could see the reasoning in wanting to bench marshall for ware this week its a pretty close call ware has a much higher floor with a similar ceiling as marshall i would probably go ware
fantasyfootball,removed,cooper and jordy
fantasyfootball,removed,meredith no question they are going to throw like crazy and you had to start him anyways until he proves otherwise
fantasyfootball,removed,i would go with ingram should be a lot of points on the board but with no controlling the game can chicago get to the goalline against gb i dont think so coleman is a good play i dont like any wr against den pryor is an ok play but i just like ingram better here
fantasyfootball,removed,i would flex sanu albeit its a risky move who knows what will happen with the nyjs maybe enunwa becomes genos favorite target but i would wait and see if that happense first asiata just doesnt do it for me sanu has shown some flashes ryan like to look for him and the game should have a lot of points
fantasyfootball,removed,pryor or montgomery i hate hamstring injuries so i would go with montgomery at wr try to flex someone else based on his performance tonight its the fun play
fantasyfootball,removed,i would go with britt for the high ceiling there are strong arguments against the other two this week
fantasyfootball,removed,ingram should get a lot of work against kc
fantasyfootball,removed,depends on the competitiveness of the league in friendly leagues the alltradesgounlesscollusion sucks because the experienced players prey on the noobs and it creates a lopsided league thats no fun for anyone in competitive leagues the veto sucks because teams end up vetoing mutually beneficial trades because a mutually beneficial trade for other teams makes their team comparatively weaker as a byproduct
fantasyfootball,removed,take jennings for the longterm unless your rbs are stacked and healthy hes undervalued especially in team and enunwa is a big ole questionmark with geno at qb
fantasyfootball,removed,i like kelce versus no reid will let smith throw but only enough for a first down
fantasyfootball,removed,its very close i think playing ty as a wr tonight allows you to adjust the rest of your roster based on his performance if he goes off you can go conservativeif he busts you can go with high ceiling players on sundaymonday
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm drop pitta for him
fantasyfootball,removed,i would go with thomas im not convinced chicago will spend much time in the redzone this week
fantasyfootball,removed,jaquizz rogers over cja a good play or am i thinking too muchmy other rbs are ware and jc and im playing both of them
fantasyfootball,removed,in a league i have brees kc rodgersvs chi and staffordvs was im thinking of benching rodgers this week based on matchups and his overall recent lousy performance who would you bench
fantasyfootball,removed,mariota or winston this week at the moment im rolling with marcus to continue his hot streak
fantasyfootball,removed,play miller or eifert this week
fantasyfootball,removed,thats not an opponent
fantasyfootball,removed,chase kelce
fantasyfootball,removed,is there any reason certainly his name is geno
fantasyfootball,removed,i didnt realize that it would take the rest of the season to recover from liposuction fateddieforever
fantasyfootball,removed,drop dion for knile
fantasyfootball,removed,duke or kniles
fantasyfootball,removed,same here i have zeke but cuck the fowboys
fantasyfootball,removed,choo chooo hype train
fantasyfootball,removed,gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,even when his play was limited he had near catches in the endzone a catchrun knocked out at the two yd line and multiple yard gains negated by penalties his official stats dont represent his growing role
fantasyfootball,removed,in a league i have brees kc rodgersvs chi and staffordvs was im thinking of benching rodgers this week based on matchups and his overall recent lousy performance who would you bench
fantasyfootball,removed,damn hes on pace for tds and bilal powell is getting all the down work jeeeeeeeeeeez you were wrong werent you
fantasyfootball,removed,hyped y p e d
fantasyfootball,removed,turn gilly up to
fantasyfootball,removed,httpswwwredditcomrdirtymindbots tykulton brought me here
fantasyfootball,removed,pick gillislee gore ware
fantasyfootball,removed,wdis thread and no you start gillislee
fantasyfootball,removed,w
fantasyfootball,removed,i like mckinnon over howard this week if you believe the hype rodgers will tee off and the bears wont be able to establish the run playing catchup
fantasyfootball,removed,i go gilli and quizz
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard league the mccoy martin owner also owns cam newton and matt ryan i want one of them preferably cam my team qb eli ugh rb lemar miller melvin gordon cmike jizz rog gillis dion lewis wr obj ty hilton kelvin benjamin will fuller te hunter henry kyle rudolph his team qb matt ryan cam newton rb mccoy martin tomas rawls deandre washington tj yeldon d williams k dixon wr l fitz a cooper s coates te pitta i feel like i have a solid team although i have lost many close games by less than point and am at i need an upgrade at qb and the ww is donkey crap what is a fair trade here that could help us both he is one of the better players so no taco trade rapes the starting point is i give gillis and jizz i receive cam newton i guess i need to offer something more
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard im hurting at options are mckinnon arian foster or the gb backfield just got offered christine michael for alshon jeffry and i have cameron meredith on my bench mike evans and odb as my starting receivers thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,even in the jaquizi
fantasyfootball,removed,jordan howard or mike gills
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard give alshon jeffrey get christine michael current rb gurley mckinnon foster dion lewis current wr odb mike evans meredith alshon corey coleman thanks in advance
fantasyfootball,removed,😤
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,fleener or zach
fantasyfootball,removed,cant blame this on the russians
fantasyfootball,removed,time for ty starting him as my whos with me
fantasyfootball,removed,because kickers are already volatile and unpredictable bs negative points only increases the volatility
fantasyfootball,removed,you played a thursday night player in your flex rookie
fantasyfootball,removed,aw shit i read february as january
fantasyfootball,removed,he was hispanic
fantasyfootball,removed,cobb moncriefs return will likely take away some of hiltons yardstds
fantasyfootball,removed,drop matthews for langford
fantasyfootball,removed,i would never trust insider but id for sure consider droping don jack for barnidge and make consider starting him depending on the health of henry and mccown
fantasyfootball,removed,just made this trade in a team ppr dynasty league some of the owners are a little upset the other owner and i think its fair as it helps both of our teams i gave objhyde i got antonio brown
fantasyfootball,removed,how about between asiata and montgomery
fantasyfootball,removed,use a trade thread you can find them in the index stickied on the front page that being said i think i would prefer monciref cooks and lewis especially if ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,looks like cooks is the only active healthy player right now idk if you expect everyone in this trade to come out healthy but thats a dangerous assumption to make id takethe site with lewis moncrief and cooks since it has players slotted to play this week im not sure whats going on with dez honestly but next time use the daily threads
fantasyfootball,removed,matt ryan underrated ever week on rankings and puts up monster numbers most weeks
fantasyfootball,removed,who out of this list do you think has the biggest dick
fantasyfootball,removed,anderson is out for a few weeks possibly has a season ending injury
fantasyfootball,removed,trade jordy nelson for booker now a fair trade
fantasyfootball,removed,i want to get off of cjas wild ride and book it out of here
fantasyfootball,removed,cj owner here was offered to trade my dez for booker would you do it ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,hulk hogan we coming for you nigga
fantasyfootball,removed,he died
fantasyfootball,removed,add justin frimmel
fantasyfootball,removed,standard scoring pick stefon diggs vs chi ty montgomery vs atl brandin cooks vs sea kelvin benjamin vs ari
fantasyfootball,removed,start jordy
fantasyfootball,removed,these are all very close i think indy is finally going to force kc to throw i think eagles will go to the air vs a stout dal dline adams was cornered by a literal nobody last week thats why he went off like he did i would expect his production to shift back to jordy go with matthews and maclin
fantasyfootball,removed,enunwa for the better floor
fantasyfootball,removed,crabtree marshall jones start your studs
fantasyfootball,removed,i would go with sanders and ty based on the matchups alone no verrett in sd and gbatl will be a high scoring affair
fantasyfootball,removed,cobb they are going to throw a lot
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont like the thomas start here i would go with jeffery or arob
fantasyfootball,removed,moncrief
fantasyfootball,removed,derrick henry or chris thompson havent decided how i wanna bury my grave for the week
fantasyfootball,removed,they are all good options i would go with cobb baldwin and crabtree because tb is going to put a lot of pressure on siemian
fantasyfootball,removed,alfred blue or tj yeldon
fantasyfootball,removed,is jerick is hurt i need to choose between russell shepard or c pat for flex
fantasyfootball,removed,knile davis or dwayne washington
fantasyfootball,removed,blake bortles either him or trevor siemian i really dont want to start bortles but on the other hand i really dont want to start siemian
fantasyfootball,removed,one of either dwayne washingtoncordarrelle patterson
fantasyfootball,removed,gillislee enunwa stafford choose anyone
fantasyfootball,removed,ugh do i drop cam meredith for dlew or nah
fantasyfootball,removed,hes still on waiver dont know if i should drop t west or not for him
fantasyfootball,removed,drop gillislee for dion i also have gurley booker and jacquizz and can only roster rbs
fantasyfootball,removed,if he is out would asiata be a better start than crowell kill me
fantasyfootball,removed,less the matchup more the game flow i see this game being played between the

fantasyfootball,removed,your mom gave us all sexually transmitted downs syndrome
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,why are you trying so hard to pick a fight are you worried your dick will fall off if youre not right about everything because i have one and let me tell ya that things fixed on there pretty good
fantasyfootball,removed,pick for my flex spots team league ppr corradelle patterson vs bears devante adams vs falcons russell shepard vs raiders cameron merideth vs vikings already starting wilson green arob because i hate myself and he will score td the first week i sit him freeman gore janikowski chiefs d bench rawls ajayi dixon all bye or out

fantasyfootball,removed,youre retarded then congrats
fantasyfootball,removed,the nile runs deep
fantasyfootball,removed,you sound like a bitch whos
fantasyfootball,removed,im sure there are better examples but i strongly disagree nyj fan here btw our gm is trash winston mariota carr luck newton dalton stafford ryan
fantasyfootball,removed,are you being stupid on purpose those good games was because kevin white got injured and he got moved to the main target on the team the one bad game after was when hoyer broke his arm do you just take numbers without any context and assume it tells the story
fantasyfootball,removed,lol i see what you did there
fantasyfootball,removed,😐
fantasyfootball,removed,shut your filthy whore mouth
fantasyfootball,removed,worth starting theo over maclin at flex pretty much a battle between disappointing season vs a guy coming back from injury hmmmm
fantasyfootball,removed,start him over snead in flex
fantasyfootball,removed,start him or stewart
fantasyfootball,removed,k
fantasyfootball,removed,lets talk about sex
fantasyfootball,removed,no i have him on my bench already starting dmarco and cmike with gio as my next best im trying to find some vikings fans with decent knowledge of this ros hes been out scoring mckinnon the pat weeks
fantasyfootball,removed,asiata or gil
fantasyfootball,removed,asiata freeman forte murray ware all on your roster who do you startwho do you flexwho do you bench thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,would any of you trade hopkins for say frank gore i lost cj and im down a running back and the kid that owns booker wont budge
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys go bennett over thomas this week
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,absolutely drop all bears players
fantasyfootball,removed,agreed
fantasyfootball,removed,so would you start him or bortles
fantasyfootball,removed,lol no he wasnt shut the fuck up did you even watch football last year dj was wholly unimpressive until the later half of the season no one said quizz is going to take dougs job but given dougs continuous health concerns and the fact that quizz has proven that he can crack a yards a game which is no small feat its perfectly reasonable to question your investment in doug also the size of a contract guarantees nothing about player usage look at ivory got a mil contract health concerns dictate usage not price go learn how sports works
fantasyfootball,removed,as somebody who has held onto alf morris since draft dayplease let this blow up
fantasyfootball,removed,how does him being and having torn acls strengthen the argument that he probably wont get hurt again
fantasyfootball,removed,a statistical post is more useful than most of the topics and posts on here fuck off
fantasyfootball,removed,play jamaal and dont look back hes healthy and is a fantasy god
fantasyfootball,removed,hey guys ppr was offered doug martin for my tevin coleman im sitting at and my backs arent the best melvin gordon both jags rbs and devontae booker i only have to start however i am thinking more future playoffs with doug martin but his oline doesnt look good
fantasyfootball,removed,took him at the draft
fantasyfootball,removed,wow top tos thats a bit high dont you think would you drop gates for him him and pitta are my only options unless my gatesenunwa for rudolph trade finally gets accepted
fantasyfootball,removed,you dont have a decent team youre stacked at every position your league mates must be awful if you got an early enough draft position i dont see how you got both jordy and charles at the end of round of round and forte and landry at the end of round of round wth
fantasyfootball,removed,first year ever playing ff came into the draft with a list my coworker made for me to target during the draft ended up making a mistake on the fourth and took an ir guy after heavy researching and many waiver wire pickups and trades ive ended up with man standard wentz and luck dj and mccoy julio arob evans landry fuller coates ertz and eifert hopkins k eagles d in the process of flipping fuller and luck for a backup rb pretty proud of the progress ive made
fantasyfootball,removed,standard pick jeffrey vs jax meredith vs jax cobb vs dallas parker vs pitt crowder vs phi
fantasyfootball,removed,man ppr my dwill will fuller and arian foster his c hyde b powell d funchess hes the bell owner hes in last place and his team is not good this year i proposed this trade and hes gonna think on it one of my fantasy flaws has always been overvaluing my own players and not offering great trades so id love to get some feedback on this
fantasyfootball,removed,stop being an idiot if people were speaking out then the top comments wouldnt be filled with people protate if it was truly even youd see more criticizing comments or less upvoted not that hard to comprehend
fantasyfootball,removed,coming from a dolphin fancoates our secondary is going to get torched this weekend
fantasyfootball,removed,overpay my ass
fantasyfootball,removed,he was just dropped in my yahoo man standard league i currently have the pick on the wire he worth the pick comes off on the current wrs are d thomas m jones jr j nelson and w snead
fantasyfootball,removed,same for corey coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,j stew or d sproles both have good match ups
fantasyfootball,removed,julius vs ertz
fantasyfootball,removed,chances jesse james outscores jt
fantasyfootball,removed,nice although i could use some backup for my decision to leave jstew on the bench for crowell freeman or christine michael good idea right
fantasyfootball,removed,is royal droppable for him then
fantasyfootball,removed,stewart or gio
fantasyfootball,removed,im done with golden tateshould i drop him for lockett
fantasyfootball,removed,just picked up allen hurns but someone dropped lockett not sure what to do
fantasyfootball,removed,i just picked up stewart from the waivers would you guys start stewart or freeman i am torn
fantasyfootball,removed,so youd bench forte and play stew
fantasyfootball,removed,kuuuuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhnnnnnnn
fantasyfootball,removed,drop reed for eifert yes eifert is still available
fantasyfootball,removed,is michael thomas still flex worthy with snead healthy
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont trust a snead see last week i need i cant believe i am having to decide between him and hogan
fantasyfootball,removed,coates is playing for sure and wont really be limited by the cast plus dolphins defense can try all they want to stop antonio and bell and im pretty sure it still wont be enough
fantasyfootball,removed,did uoneleven actually say this i love uoneleven but what a terrible response hes the one choosing to pass up the quick karma comments that should be a staple of his comment history and instead rolling out of his comfort zone to try to make a crappy response of the time the rfantasyfootball community has been incredible this year and not just in this thread with uquickonthedrawl back the servers running well and a post uoneleven cant really blame anyone but himself and maybe his mom
fantasyfootball,removed,hey bro make sure you use the wdis threads for something like this that said start dt and coates
fantasyfootball,removed,cobb and dt coates has lacerated finger will be harder to catch
fantasyfootball,removed,but i have to chose between antonio gates and hunter henry
fantasyfootball,removed,can we get matchups matter stickied here or is it somewhere else
fantasyfootball,removed,choo choo
fantasyfootball,removed,yes they are but i will no longer be providing info here to prevent doxing
fantasyfootball,removed,probably bell
fantasyfootball,removed,standard he has ertz for te and has baldwin matthews cooper brown decker for wrs im interested in either cooper or baldwin and have the following players to trade t eifert m bennett d parker c meredith j crowder would bennett parker be fair enough for either of them or would i need to add on meredithcrowder as well
fantasyfootball,removed,if sammie coates is a nobody youre an ant on the bottom of my shoe now eat that dirt son
fantasyfootball,removed,while i have you in a thread going nowhere i have devin funchess and thinking about taking will fuller or thomas would you dump year funchess for a rookie in thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,i just got screwed i drafted thomas rawls and i have charles sims and demarco murray on my bench who do i start
fantasyfootball,removed,crabtree or marvin jones in my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,damnshould i sit duke johnson so i can put rashad jennings and frank gore as my and flex
fantasyfootball,removed,langford rawls or marvin jones langfird is listed as a sit rawls status seems murky and jones is listed as start normally i wouldnt consider jones here but the situations for those rbs are questionable
fantasyfootball,removed,full ppr moncrief or landry
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah i think he has a safer floor but i think moncrief has a higher ceiling tough choice anyone else have thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr pryor maclin coleman wr
fantasyfootball,removed,moncrief or tate in my flex ppr what do you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,im starting marvin jones over larry fitzgerald and ameer abdullah in my ppr league flex spot
fantasyfootball,removed,flex cooks jones or landry
fantasyfootball,removed,so im start lockett over edelman according to this
fantasyfootball,removed,moncrief or michael floyd week
fantasyfootball,removed,am i crazy or should i bench cam for stafford colts dont have vontae davis and it will be a shootout probably while sb rematch will be another defensive grind
fantasyfootball,removed,i wanna put snead in my starting lineup but i have robinson cooper and floyd and i dont feel comfortable sitting any of them
fantasyfootball,removed,have white riddick and abdullah cant decide who to play think i am going to flip a three sided coin
fantasyfootball,removed,i have crabtree and vincent jackson is it worth starting any of them over brandon marshall ty hilton or randall cobb also jason witten is on waviors in my league im not big on my own te julius thomas jax vs gb but is it worth picking jason up with dak at the helm
fantasyfootball,removed,edelman or snead in flex i have edelman in right now thinking higher floor but uneasy about it
fantasyfootball,removed,i can only start two out of these guys ryan matthews spencer ware brandin cooks melvin gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,how do people feel about witten vs ivory at a flex spot
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start ware instead of lacy or mccoy also starting deangelo
fantasyfootball,removed,please someone talk me off the ledge of starting winston over cam thats crazy right
fantasyfootball,removed,barnidge or witten standard league
fantasyfootball,removed,i have jennings and jones but i have decker in my flex and i dont know what i should do
fantasyfootball,removed,so stafford over rivers then why do i feel so hesitant
fantasyfootball,removed,this just makes me even more unsure about whether i should start bortles or winston standard
fantasyfootball,removed,now i have no idea do i start jameis winston or dak prescott
fantasyfootball,removed,pick latavius murray ryan mathews spencer ware
fantasyfootball,removed,out of these receivers who do you like starting pick ppr demarius maclin fitz marvin jones sanu
fantasyfootball,removed,soo should i start stafford over newton
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start desean jackson or tyler lockett
fantasyfootball,removed,really tempted to start one of my bench rbs jenningsabdullahcmike over maclin in the flex this week
fantasyfootball,removed,damn i have abdullah maclin and floyd as flex options in currently rolling with maclin but not too sure
fantasyfootball,removed,im guessing i should sit rawls and add jenning
fantasyfootball,removed,tj yeldon as a sleeper pick and emmanuel sanders as the sit me pick who to start in the flex half ppr hmm kinda feeling giving yeldon a chance
fantasyfootball,removed,im deciding between fitz floyd or jennings in flex any recommendations
fantasyfootball,removed,demarco murray or j stewart standard league i dont think stewart will get too many yards against the broncos run stoppers i also dont know if hercules is going to vulture murrays td work in the red zone
fantasyfootball,removed,ware or cj anderson in my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start jordy nelson ive got wheaton and emmanuel sanders on my bench to switch him out
fantasyfootball,removed,first of all use the wdis thread to answer your question i think the safer play is definitely carr
fantasyfootball,removed,carr or pretty much any quarterback no
fantasyfootball,removed,start crabtree over ty
fantasyfootball,removed,im in the same boat if charles is definitely out the matchup is too good to bench ware
fantasyfootball,removed,thomas rawls or spencer ware
fantasyfootball,removed,jordy is good bengals d is probably replacement level and jimmy graham may never be any good again the other side is startable players
fantasyfootball,removed,i need to start each of rb and wr with one flex option any help appreciated rb latavius murray matt forte spencer ware christine michael chris ivory wr odell beckham jr allen robinson keenan allen donte moncrief
fantasyfootball,removed,great breakdown still after al that im not sure who to flex this week in half ppr jarvis landry or golden tate
fantasyfootball,removed,so all my rbs and wrs are trusts mccoy ware hyde fitzgerald julio one reasonable return decker which player would you guys bench out of these in a standard league
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard espn scoring qb luck rb elliot j charles l murray sproles c west d washington wr b marshall a hurns k white torrey smith te j reed a gates t eifert def seahawks k cairo santos
fantasyfootball,removed,im getting mixed reports from everywhere which two should i roll with standard scoring mike evans keenan allen ty hilton
fantasyfootball,removed,cant decide who to drop for michael m jones crowell or b powell
fantasyfootball,removed,you would bench fitzgerald too huh thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,according to them my wr spot decision is between two bustsjordan matthews maclin i think matthews will be fine as the browns cbs outside of haden are really bad considering that it even says there that matthews scored of his points from the slot last year he should be ok
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got bell charles on the bench my rb starters for week are langford and then choose one foster abdullah crowell any suggestions im positive whoever i chose will stink and whoever i bench will do great
fantasyfootball,removed,how do you guys feel about replacing maclin bust with gio bernard trust in the flex
fantasyfootball,removed,im considering starting moncrief over rawls in flex
fantasyfootball,removed,if you own both cmike and rawls who do you go with im leaning cmike since it should be a blow out and i see them grinding the clock out with him
fantasyfootball,removed,surprised u ranked rawls higher than cmike since they r resting rawls im debating if i should start rashad jennings over rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,would you flex him over the likes of michael floyd and cj anderson
fantasyfootball,removed,crap do i switch out crabtree for evans that sounds dumb
fantasyfootball,removed,i really dont have great options in the league where i drafted rawls its either rawls or foster and so far im leaning foster despite the poor matchup
fantasyfootball,removed,also debating its rawls vs foster for mefml
fantasyfootball,removed,this week rawls or abdullah
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start moncrief or keenan allen this week
fantasyfootball,removed,welp mike evans is a bust go figure would you bench evans and gore and start cmike and rashad jennings one at flex obviously
fantasyfootball,removed,literally deciding between abdullah riddick and white and they are listed all next to each other back to back to back on tiers and rankings
fantasyfootball,removed,hm im getting conflicting feelings on who to start between this and beersheets at wr my receivers are maclin m floyd fitzgerald and j matthews i really dont want to play matthews so im trying to figure out who my starting receivers should be i have spencer ware at flex im leaning towards maclin and floyd but according to this i should be considering floydfitz what do you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,lewis im from mass so maybe im biased but the guy fit so well into the ne offense tom bradys back by the time lewis is and i cant wait to see tom feed him even if it is weeks i have him in a couple of my leagues
fantasyfootball,removed,great now i dont know if i should play big ben or if i should play carson
fantasyfootball,removed,now im in a pickle decker is my i also have moncrief on my bench i feel like decker is the safer play but moncrief has more upside thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,so as a begrudging rawls owner that hasnt been paying attention would i be better off just sitting him for woodhead or gio this week
fantasyfootball,removed,man he is still on waivers in one of my leagues but i really dont have anyone to drop him for tyler lockett i really dont know how the charles owner hasnt scooped him up yet
fantasyfootball,removed,im rolling with gio instead in both leagues that i have rawls as well waiting it out this week
fantasyfootball,removed,what is a reasonable faab bid if ware is still on waivers budget
fantasyfootball,removed,im starting jordan matthews over kelvin week i would go marvin jones for sure if i were you
fantasyfootball,removed,sitting him for emmanuel sanders on my team if i were you id sit him for marvin jones until i see how he plays w killa cam
fantasyfootball,removed,if i were you id be on the look out for a running back your starters seem kind of weak
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start langford over rawls my other rb is lamar and wrs are obj bmarsh watkins
fantasyfootball,removed,well shit last wr spot to fill e sanders vs car j brown vs ne or j maclin vs sd
fantasyfootball,removed,you should be starting langford
fantasyfootball,removed,so kelley is droppable now
fantasyfootball,removed,i would start langford
fantasyfootball,removed,drop zach miller for him
fantasyfootball,removed,youre dumb
fantasyfootball,removed,ryan matthews or cj anderson ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,women amiright
fantasyfootball,removed,my rb depth is doug martin atl thomas rawls vs mia charcandrick west vs sd matt jones vs pit and cameron artispayne den martin is the only obvious choice who else do i start
fantasyfootball,removed,those threads need to stop not be encouragedimproved
fantasyfootball,removed,hey man guessing your new on the front page of this sub theres a index thread use that and the wdis rb link on that thread to ask your question next time but trust cja
fantasyfootball,removed,this belongs in wdis thread but if charles doesnt play like hes expected not to then ware is your guy
fantasyfootball,removed,id go for the rookie unless youre in a very deep league we know what to expect out of garcon and it isnt that great
fantasyfootball,removed,cmike or tajae sharp in flex
fantasyfootball,removed,cant make up my mind on what back ups to keep my rbs are anderson charles and foster with powell morris and kelley on my bench but thinking about dropping kelley for booker
fantasyfootball,removed,so would you recommend starting cmike or demarco murray week
fantasyfootball,removed,flex pick two cmike foster benjamin v jackson ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,funchess or tate
fantasyfootball,removed,snaps rushing attempts forsett will handle of early down snaps buck allen will take passing downs
fantasyfootball,removed,john brown or jeremy langford in the flex
fantasyfootball,removed,espn man standard pick qb tyrod taylor rb lamar miller rb eddie lacy wr julio jones wr amari cooper te greg olson flx deangelo williams dst texans k blair walsh b arian foster randal cobb demarco murray tom brady matt jones allen hurns josh gordan its my first time drafting solo i apologize if the quality of my team might be obvious in one way or another i just want to know how i did
fantasyfootball,removed,i think you should start rawls and find out seattles at home and a huge favorite against a crappy dolphins team and you think this is coach speak
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,this is a terrible post you absolutely have to consider your quality of opponent if youre matched up against someone with a dominant starting lineup very possible in auction leagues with owners who take a stars and scrubs approach and your best player is on a bye week youre often at a clear disadvantage in these cases do you fill your flex position with someone like emmanuel sanders who nets fairly consistent week to week points but rarely if ever has a hammer week or do you sub in a guy like tyler lockett with a solid matchup someone who can drop haymakers when hes more heavily involved in the game plan decisions like that need to be made every week and the strength of your opponents lineup that week absolutely factors into how much risk you take on in your own starting lineup this is no psa its lecturing other people on how to make debatable lineup decisions based on your own preference fantasy football is the least predictable of the major fantasy sports so suggesting people go for the highest scorers is a fools errand your choice comes down to probability of performance and the amount of risk you take on is relative to what probable performance level your opponent will produce

fantasyfootball,removed,real question iswill cobb and adams continue the domination against dallas this weekend
fantasyfootball,removed,nah i wouldnt tip him he had an equal chance of winning the pool as well ive been commissioner of my fantasy league and do all the work collecting the dues and payouts and i dont expect any tip for doing so we do it because we like it if you want buy him dinner or some beers but a tip isnt necessary

fantasyfootball,removed,david johnson by far i know a lot of folks are very high on aj this year but i dont quite get it david johnson might have the highest upside of any player and has a very projectable safe floor
fantasyfootball,removed,probably dj he could be the number player or possibly bust though hes not the safest of players but hes in a good spot to succeed this year
fantasyfootball,removed,david johnson not many bell cow rbs this year plus he catches the ball and hes a better keeper for the long run if you can keep him year after year

fantasyfootball,removed,wrong thread jackass
fantasyfootball,removed,you are the cunt dont make new threads for your shit team

fantasyfootball,removed,you dont think jordy will be almost just as good as those guys or possibly better allen robinson dez bryant
fantasyfootball,removed,snead
fantasyfootball,removed,shepard based on qb opportunity not as many mouths to feed and cowboys giants is usually high scoring i would monitor if peterson will shadow gronk though that could change things
fantasyfootball,removed,in the past few years i have taken wrs super early not because i planned to but because i value them highly as reliable picks and i took best available this year i went into my first two drafts with my rankings done out the same way very high on wrs with my top all being wrs rbs mixed in there qbs faded a bit tes faded a bit i fully expected to be the guy to take the top wrs early and then pick scrappy rbs later and fill in qbs and tight ends towards the end even with these exact same rankings wrs flew so hard off the board that i almost had no choice to take guys i normally wouldnt take based on best available in a man i ended up with guys i would never have like adrian peterson arian rodgers travis kelce etc because i simply could not justify taking anyone else over them at the spots where they were in the end instead of forcing wrs i stuck by my rule of best available and i love my team yea my isnt as good but i forgot how nice it was to have a qb a te and some rbs that you can be excited bout going into the season rather than wondering how you are gunna scrape something together qb rodgers wr allen robinson wr demaryius thomas wr john brown rb adrian peterson rb thomas rawls te travis kelce
fantasyfootball,removed,there is a thread for this marshall and dj though
fantasyfootball,removed,code
fantasyfootball,removed,are you playing in a team league how would either of these two end up your or flex
fantasyfootball,removed,i need some real luck guys i need enunwa to score more than fitz he also has to magically replace sammy coates in my flex spot
fantasyfootball,removed,if you had fitzpatrick as your starting qb shut up and get out of this sub
fantasyfootball,removed,he most certainly did then he went in all three of my lineups only to lose two one by points awesome just awesome matthew berry if youre reading this a personal fuck you to you my man
fantasyfootball,removed,thats only qbs there are starting qbs in the nfl leaving more for this asshat to choose from yet he chose the worst qb in the league why
fantasyfootball,removed,everyone except this idiot apparently unless he does have one on his bench but chose to play fitzpatrick instead just stop and think for a second this person made a conscious decision to play ryan fitzpatrick on his fantasy team youre walking around the same planet as this guy breathing the same air are not disturbed by these facts this person chose to start ryan fitzpatrick and youre defending him this person does not deserve a defense this person is a fuckin caveman
fantasyfootball,removed,he could have joe fuckin montana on a bye it still doesnt excuse rostering ryan fitzpatrick you fuckin a apologist this person chose to keep ryan fitzpatrick as either his starting qb or his bye week filler and thats unacceptable theres nothing good about who ryan fitzpatrick is or what he does on a football field
fantasyfootball,removed,i think having something called ryan fitzpatrick on a roster has confused you that should never happen but i understand morons like to stick with morons and back each other up
fantasyfootball,removed,my choice is not to roster two qbs with the same bye week in a qb league where there will be no other qbs left to play for that week are you still confused guy
fantasyfootball,removed,where did i say he had a bye this week all i remember saying is how fuckin dumb you are for having ryan fitzpatrick as your starting qb friend im not surprised you dont understand that
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck you palmer more points and you go out
fantasyfootball,removed,this is my very attainable team that somehow scored in my standard espn league tom brady christine michael james white julio jones jarvis landry greg olsen cameron meredith eagles dst dustin hopkins
fantasyfootball,removed,even in dynasty luckily i picked up the eagles a few weeks ago so im considering it
fantasyfootball,removed,would any of you consider dropping kc def for pats defense
fantasyfootball,removed,i was just offered ab for my demario murray in a team standard im a nervous wreck right now but im leaning towards going for it
fantasyfootball,removed,i was offered ab for cmike and jarvis and am currently a wreck over it any advise would be appreciated leaning towards declining but im imagining my team come playoff time with dion lewis returning goddamn it
fantasyfootball,removed,pick eddie lacy cj anderson jordan howard matt jones
fantasyfootball,removed,were talking about fantasy football do you want me to site a peerreviewed article its all fucking conjecture and opinion when it comes to ff i think i have watched him in person more than probably anyone on this subreddit and to me that is a pretty relevant source of information its just an opinion you whiny little douche
fantasyfootball,removed,jordan howard jimmy graham
fantasyfootball,removed,just offered jordan howard tevin coleman and alex smith for brady in a standard league
fantasyfootball,removed,been offered aj green and melvin gordon for hopkins and doug martin should i do it
fantasyfootball,removed,i was offered lamar miller and round pick for my mark ingram and round its man league ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard pick jeffrey gb meredith gb cobb vs chi crowder det britt vs nyg
fantasyfootball,removed,thinking about offering cmicheal for kelvin benjamin in a man ppr league thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,zeke far outweighs evans in my opinion what if i offered lamar for evans straight up in half ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,dont believe anything bill says believe in everything he doesnt
fantasyfootball,removed,randell cobb vs spencer ware i get cobbseems like cobb value is increasing going forward other rbs i own elliotfreemanmckinnon
fantasyfootball,removed,ware traded for cobb in my team ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,but this sub loses all its fun when i cant circlejerk around meaningless statistics
fantasyfootball,removed,im not spewing shit ive only relayed what little news we have and statistical information supporting the commonly held belief that lewis will likely be good to go by the fantasy playoffs and there is no reliable source that has even implied otherwise
fantasyfootball,removed,you could read into it as he is more efficient per target but that would be a very autistic way of analyzing stats
fantasyfootball,removed,jordan howard and jordan matthews package deal
fantasyfootball,removed,still waiting bud
fantasyfootball,removed,seems scary as hell to add keenum
fantasyfootball,removed,seems scary as hell to add keenum

fantasyfootball,removed,i have leveon melvin spencer ware howard and coleman who do i trade away
fantasyfootball,removed,im in ppr james white t cole and blount who do i start
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start ingram or blount this week if i posted in the rb wdis thread
fantasyfootball,removed,love michael thomas but id give him to get ware in a second
fantasyfootball,removed,youre an idiot or a troll aka an annoying idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,in weeks wen they start working him in if he quickly outplays white sure maybe he takes over before he went down last year he was averaging ppr white is averaging the same since brady if he continues that if it aint broke bellicheck wont fix it
fantasyfootball,removed,i was offered sterling shepard for isaiah crowell ppr keeper league round and below so ill be able to use him as a keeper next year if id like to cro has been riding my bench with lamar and gio as my along i also have james white who ive been using in one of the flex spots good trade or what
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start quizz over tevin coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah he desperately needed a rb he also had freeman
fantasyfootball,removed,obviously biased but we suggest you check us out at httpstwittercomdreamteamblog
fantasyfootball,removed,i just made a post about gronk had him as my keeper for years but sending him back into the pool this next year
fantasyfootball,removed,he is destined for stardom and i would go with him over gronk in a keeper league he is cheaper and younger but the price difference isnt much in your situation so its a closer call but i like your logic
fantasyfootball,removed,personally i would go gronk just a little extra and you get the hands down best te in football then spend a late pick on bennett and your set at te for the whole year
fantasyfootball,removed,the only wide receiver in nfl history who had a better year old season than amari cooper was randy moss cooper is elite
fantasyfootball,removed,obj for isnt your pick
fantasyfootball,removed,qb m ryan rb l bell d murray m gordon s ware t coleman wr j crowder t williams t hill m thomas te d walker a gates k j tucker dst miami
fantasyfootball,removed,you said duck i say quack im a bot i love ducks im created by
fantasyfootball,removed,i traded for him in midoctober thinking hed rebound but was able to flip him a few days later for latavius murray bullet dodged
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm tyrell or moncrief
fantasyfootball,removed,if youre asking which one would look better in a tasteful evening gown id go hightower
fantasyfootball,removed,im putting in hightower over gurley this week
fantasyfootball,removed,you should post in the wdis thread but personally id go with gurley
fantasyfootball,removed,cobb or starks ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,any t hill and tyrell owners out there with the news that maclin is out do you start hill over a questionable tyrell
fantasyfootball,removed,im thinking about it in my ppr league over crabtree or kb
fantasyfootball,removed,michael thomas or tyrell this week im win and in this list game so i cant really afford a dud here
fantasyfootball,removed,i already agonized over him and decided i was starting him over moncrief and malcom mitchell why are you trying to stir up more doubt op
fantasyfootball,removed,who are your wr
fantasyfootball,removed,who
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,theres a thread at the top of the hot section which is an index in it youll find multiple wdis as in who do i start threads post in the proper thread and also answer some other peoples
fantasyfootball,removed,if you can get him edelman would be your best bet there otherwise id target eric decker above kelvin and baldwin i would say his targets are probably repeatable with fitzpatrick starting and as a bonus hes targeted in the red zone
fantasyfootball,removed,well what draft picks do you have to give up to keep them
fantasyfootball,removed,theres a daily for these you should probably also include some league settings and keeperspecific rules that being said maclin is toss up between yeldon diggs bortles after that really depends on positional scarcity in your league
fantasyfootball,removed,new brows regime hit it with this pick hes an athlete who was elite at scoring tds in college you could do worse than taking a chance on him hasnt even played a fucking snap you fools are gushing over him
fantasyfootball,removed,like a reasonable person one that understands you dont draft on upside alone before round
fantasyfootball,removed,also calm assertion isnt stop fucking gushing over them you fools doesnt seem too calm to me well here is a perfect example of what i was talking about you are some random nobody with zero credibility and an opinion based on your feelings so i can comfortably not give one shit about what you think
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah because anyone that uses a swear word must be mad right not just flabbergasted or exhausted or cynical mad is the only option also i love all the stupid fucks on reddit that think people would be as rude to people that matter to them as they are to selfimportant twits on the internet
fantasyfootball,removed,considering brandon marshall had eleven better games than that one and browns suck i dont think you can say he had a really good game not everyone can be on seattle or arizona like sherman or peterson f off dude
fantasyfootball,removed,theres a thread for this but evans no doubt
fantasyfootball,removed,in your league i would keep evans and not draft another rb until extremely late you only need to start one so start gurley every week and the rest fill with wrs

fantasyfootball,removed,you are a fucking idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah wtf were you saying again im an illiterate moron shes a thirsty bitch tell me again about all that keep replying again to me running your mouth like the knuckle dragging poster child for late term abortion that you are
fantasyfootball,removed,lane adkins of the orange and brown report is the source obviously just a rumour but hes been right about things in the past next couple of days will be telling
fantasyfootball,removed,the people who drafted wilson manning rivers bortles etc almost definitely wish they had a qb upgrade if you feel that strongly about stafford try to trade cam for a legit starter
fantasyfootball,removed,cam
fantasyfootball,removed,listen to your head start cam
fantasyfootball,removed,im in the same position i havent actually played stafford and have had him on my bench all season regretted that last week obviously however they both have favorable matchups cams played the broncos and vikings which are arguably the two best defenses around the one non elite defense he played he scored points cam gets shut down against elite defenses shows last season as well but anything below elite hes a monster im trusting cam this week
fantasyfootball,removed,robert woods sammy watkins is messed up and has stated that he would like to see robert have a bigger role on the team
fantasyfootball,removed,have brees dj coleman tucker and ari feels good to be
fantasyfootball,removed,y
fantasyfootball,removed,i imagine the skins and every other nfl will be keying in on pryor moving forward his ceilingfloor is the widest spread between the but lets not forget this is the brownsbmarsh without decker should get the ball absolutely fed to him and r fitz wont have another brutal game like last week
fantasyfootball,removed,matt ryan is on the free agent list on my league should i get him i have luck and cousins tho
fantasyfootball,removed,maybe go fuck yourself
fantasyfootball,removed,hype train derailed harder than at hoboken too soon
fantasyfootball,removed,if i could only keep him or howard who should i keep
fantasyfootball,removed,agree with the other comment forte and washington howard could be the real deal but that bears team is just not good enough to project solid rushing numbers on an anywhere near consistent basis
fantasyfootball,removed,quit reddit
fantasyfootball,removed,i would never bench obj
fantasyfootball,removed,the only week you bench obj is his bye week
fantasyfootball,removed,never bench obj
fantasyfootball,removed,really im not benching him if he is active
fantasyfootball,removed,drop him and pick up beasly beasly obj ros
fantasyfootball,removed,not until you hear something about his health
fantasyfootball,removed,i would rather have gates on my bench than bennett at least i would feel confident choosing between thomas and gates based on matchup then trying to guess when bennett is going to have a routerunning te game and extralineman te game
fantasyfootball,removed,why do you have martellus bennett
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont own two tes unless i have a hurt gronkreed who i cant drop drop bennett for an rbwr
fantasyfootball,removed,i might ive got sammy watkins dez and rashad jennings all hurt and i need a flex play desperately i hate it its either that or maybe marqise lee
fantasyfootball,removed,i have a bell and my wrs arent too strong floyd crabtree green thats it i have bell miller charles coleman sims and others what two wrs could i get for bell or should i stay put
fantasyfootball,removed,bradley enunwa crowder can only start ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,wondering if i should instead grab enunwa over crowder in my ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,my bench watkins allan decker colleman ertz dixion just fuck me up
fantasyfootball,removed,how much is his value raised asj is there now and decker is a very different receiver than enunwa im trying to decide if i should burn my waiver priority on him
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start marshall over crowder seattle hasnt exactly played any receiver of high caliber landry the highest thus far but theyve only allowed points to wrs in weeks
fantasyfootball,removed,beasley enunwa crowder can only start ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,u think i drop julius thomas for him i have rudolph sick of roster ingredients tes
fantasyfootball,removed,over dorsett
fantasyfootball,removed,decker dez and gordon fuck my life brah
fantasyfootball,removed,im considering it where do we rank him amongst the likes of crowder dorsett devante tyrell fuller sterling wallace etc i like that the opportunity for him will be there but that abysmal performance last week by the jets makes me wary
fantasyfootball,removed,over wallace
fantasyfootball,removed,does this give enunwa more value than crowder im thinking yes but its close i have him in all leagues but one and in that one he is still on waivers crowder would be my drop
fantasyfootball,removed,have to ingot julio diggs and marvin but i lost decker the choices in fa are kinda barren my rb choices for flex position are jennings jamaal and rawls 😥
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm wondering if i drop sharpe for hoyer this week i have russell wilson and only other available guys really are alex smith d
fantasyfootball,removed,worth trying to trade coleman for marshall to a team in desperate need of rbs
fantasyfootball,removed,i dumped hurns in mine he hasnt done anything and im pretty strong on receivers though i was thinking of grabbing him or floyd as a fa just in case snead is hurt again this week
fantasyfootball,removed,use the search function you special snowflake
fantasyfootball,removed,well at least we know that much i guess makes me feel better knowing i can sit him seriously though who is the better pickup stash if he is out multiple weeks williams or beasley
fantasyfootball,removed,well crapwest is outdoes this mean i start ware or charles
fantasyfootball,removed,i have enunwa and i hope hes a stud with decker out but i cant play him against the seahawks i think i have to start greentatesteve smith sr instead yeah i know it sucks
fantasyfootball,removed,so am i starting charles sims
fantasyfootball,removed,just ask your question and see what happens
fantasyfootball,removed,what a loser
fantasyfootball,removed,i would do this in a heartbeat but use the trade thread next time
fantasyfootball,removed,wheres the rest of the offer
fantasyfootball,removed,no trades im in a league snake order i drafted got dj and miller at the turn bell was still available in the third round and i couldnt resist
fantasyfootball,removed,in a league of women idiots maybe
fantasyfootball,removed,youre supposed to post in the general who do i start threads but by the way id go with rudolph people get up in arms here when people make mistakes for no reason so dont worry about everyone acting like a dick
fantasyfootball,removed,whos on your bench this guy could be a game changer and totally worth a stash now just in case
fantasyfootball,removed,as a more personal aside i currently am being offered my jordan howard and eric decker for his tevin coleman and will fuller ppr league and i own dfreeman do i pull the trigger
fantasyfootball,removed,i would take charles for landry allllllll day long with that said there is a trade thread for this and you are a piece of shit
fantasyfootball,removed,there is a trade thread for this and you are a piece of shit
fantasyfootball,removed,lets say this is true i am currently starting flacco against oakland my opponent has edelman and gronk strategically is it wise for me to start garoppollo
fantasyfootball,removed,would you stream him or hoyer
fantasyfootball,removed,quit making posts like this please
fantasyfootball,removed,wilson or garapollo
fantasyfootball,removed,jimmy g or gabbert league rodgers on bye
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck i was planning on sitting edelman for snead tyrell and crowder but now i gotta choose between tyrell and crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,woods does not have watkins speed big play ability i wouldnt trust him in that passing attack at all
fantasyfootball,removed,i have been looking but im in a team and only start able qbs left on waivers are seimian bradford and wentz who do you suggest
fantasyfootball,removed,im in a team also i think im gonna roll with dak bradford is available too who would you go with
fantasyfootball,removed,okay definitely starting edelman what you guys think about jimmy g versus another waiver qb for this week flacco dak
fantasyfootball,removed,in a leagueim stuck with tyrod and winstonwhich one should i drop for jimmy
fantasyfootball,removed,youre about years too late
fantasyfootball,removed,use the wdis threads but start fucking brandin cooks dont be an idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,with bortles on bye next week i need a qb maybe for more than next week if he doesnt pick it up wentz off the bye week vs detroit or siemian vs atlanta
fantasyfootball,removed,would u start steve smith or quincy enunwa this week
fantasyfootball,removed,edelman or crabtree for
fantasyfootball,removed,better start than siemian this week
fantasyfootball,removed,thats great gladys how did he do after those two seasons in a pathetic division in which won the division a nice regress once he shipped off all the talented players the other coaches brought in lets also not forget the powerhouse division he coached in that record is really powerful when you get to beat up on the nfc least go and actually look at the teams they beat in they managed to beat the jags the rams the nfc least times tennessee their best win that season was against the panthers where they sacked cam newton times ha glad that records mean everything
fantasyfootball,removed,what pick do you have and what is your goal with your first
fantasyfootball,removed,eifert is my starter with a gates as backup would you rather go with gates or witten in a team witten is currently on the waivers and i have ted ginn to drop for someone
fantasyfootball,removed,it is a but he could have gotten ap or gurley and there was a good chance cam would have been there on the wrap around the variance between the qb and qb is much smaller than the variance between the rb and rb historically speaking so he was really reaching he actually ended up with a fairly decent draft but no one was expecting that move
fantasyfootball,removed,gfys
fantasyfootball,removed,but i still see your point the only issue is they are so important that an injury to one of them even for a few weeks can ruin a season completely agree with the consistency in points though
fantasyfootball,removed,no because kelvin and maclin are have similar value
fantasyfootball,removed,damn remember when i verbally abused you
fantasyfootball,removed,worth dropping willie snead for sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,i plan to draft leveon at if is not available
fantasyfootball,removed,he should be a serviceable because he doesnt have much of a time share and should get plenty of touches i would be more concerned about mathews as my cause the dude is brittle
fantasyfootball,removed,hes going to lose his job to jordan howard
fantasyfootball,removed,adam levitan and evan silva are high on langford
fantasyfootball,removed,jeremy langford is the kinda coolkinda not buddy of yours who ends up being your wingman after your other buddies bailed surprise whats that jl rolls up in with shades and a few bottles of bourbon and bumping biggie smalls its gonna be a good night afterall tldr jeremy langford is your new fav wingman
fantasyfootball,removed,rawlsjl throw bmarsh back and redraft him if youre still sad
fantasyfootball,removed,apparently he has played something like of the preseason snaps where the first team offense was out there so that bodes well
fantasyfootball,removed,why not cobb
fantasyfootball,removed,k i see whats happening will be fixed in the version posted tomorrow morning
fantasyfootball,removed,no way rivers is going up against oakland he should feast
fantasyfootball,removed,should i pick up zach zenner
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr league wr slots wrt slot qwrt slot my wrs are a jeffery k benjamin j maclin w snead s shepard r cobb his wrs are aj green l fitzgerald d bryant d jackson c coleman im thinking of offering j maclin and r cobb in order to receive l fitzgerald do you think this is a reasonably fair trade is there a better one that might be accepted i can also include the rest of myhis roster if it would be helpful first season of fantasy football and never done a trade before so any help is appreciated
fantasyfootball,removed,did someone call me
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck off and die david johnson you fegget
fantasyfootball,removed,whatever team gets kerely wins this trade and its not even fucking close
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck you too
fantasyfootball,removed,i have fitz not playing johnson i hope your family dies in a house fire bitch
fantasyfootball,removed,no williams is not the cowboy i would want
fantasyfootball,removed,take kerley consistency will be a problem but hes the most targeted guy on this offense williams comes in after beasley dez and a healthy witten
fantasyfootball,removed,dude go eli could be a shootout im only starting hoyer over stafford because lions have no run game and eagles can do what the bears did and drop extra coverage and still get pressure without blitzing
fantasyfootball,removed,david johnson carted off to locker room
fantasyfootball,removed,keep his value is low
fantasyfootball,removed,jackson and riddick
fantasyfootball,removed,if you do trade him which is not recommended i would look for an underachieving wr like jeffrey dez or cobb packaged with a later round pick with big upside like a mckinnon for eg would really depend on your needs too
fantasyfootball,removed,im thinking about offering gurley or lmiller for him if i could get a decent low or with it in standard scoring
fantasyfootball,removed,i have dj hyde and matt jones my receiving unit needs an overhaul though im and have scored the most point in my man standard league twice ive got jordy cooks baldwin coates dorsett and moncrief as my wr should i try and deal dj or hyde for a and a decent replacement back please help its my first time playing fantasy and if i get last place this season i have to use in a shake weight in class for minutes
fantasyfootball,removed,nah bro just cause you dont give a shit doesnt mean all of us dont give a shit
fantasyfootball,removed,as a packer fan i think you need to start cruz and im sitting crowell but i might start him over simms
fantasyfootball,removed,dont sit crowell thatd be fucking stupid sit simms and wallace and this should be in wdis
fantasyfootball,removed,take a ride in the slam sedan and start the crow d you can be a fellow c r o w h o e and post caw caw on game day the life of a crow starter feelsgoodman
fantasyfootball,removed,kinda wanted to start shepard over him is this a good idea
fantasyfootball,removed,question right there
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop crosby for hopkins
fantasyfootball,removed,someone in my league dropped gostcowskido i drop hopkins for him
fantasyfootball,removed,they say hes due for a breakout any game now
fantasyfootball,removed,im personally going walker this week he sees the most targets and the matchup looks good plus i think hes back to full health this week so a healthy walker is always a must start to me
fantasyfootball,removed,or he was talking about john brown
fantasyfootball,removed,walker for sure
fantasyfootball,removed,drop bailey for mcmanus gano or boswell hmm
fantasyfootball,removed,ros crosby or haushka have both but dont feel like its worth hanging on the haushka when i could stash another player
fantasyfootball,removed,they are vulnerable to te and jameis loves te hes who im gonna roll with after hunter henry gets stuck
fantasyfootball,removed,team league standard scoring with news of foster back practicing is it worth burning my waiver on him im currently starting gore as my after i lost ap
fantasyfootball,removed,bens fantasy starter job was never in question carr is a borderline player it makes sense that carr would get mentioned as a must start while nobody feels the need to talk about ben
fantasyfootball,removed,thank you for your replies everyone at receiver i have marshall jeffrey travis benjamin moncrief and enunwaplease let me know if this changes any opinions thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,im thinking of picking up enunwa who im sure will be consistent especially while decker is out but im intrigued by coates instead lower floor higher ceiling both are fas in my league but i have a hunch coates will have a monster game and be the hot add for week
fantasyfootball,removed,i like him but i got an offer of dez for him and tyrod so i had to take that hopefully i dont regret it
fantasyfootball,removed,would trading ware to the charles owner for him in a ppr be a fair trade
fantasyfootball,removed,how much do you like him assuming latavius is out would you start him over ryan matthews or kenneth dixon
fantasyfootball,removed,who is the better pickup enunwa or royal
fantasyfootball,removed,should he be taken seriously yes should we expect this same production every game no
fantasyfootball,removed,drop tyrrell williams for him
fantasyfootball,removed,fire deandre up over sanders and landry hmmmmmm
fantasyfootball,removed,better stash enunwa or hogan having seen him play and produce i lean enunwa but with brady back i feel like theres a chance therell be a run on waiver claims for either after this weekend
fantasyfootball,removed,enunwa over parker
fantasyfootball,removed,seriously considering benching nuk for enunwa god help me and my trash roster would be starting royal enunwa and desean jackson god damnit
fantasyfootball,removed,i shouldnt be starting him over jordan matthews though right
fantasyfootball,removed,you cant do better than hoyer wentz still available in many leagues
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start him over sterling shephard
fantasyfootball,removed,enunwa vs steelers or beasley vs cinci beasley is so hard to sit because dak loves him
fantasyfootball,removed,drop tevin coleman for dwash
fantasyfootball,removed,hop on dixon for a growing package and big loads
fantasyfootball,removed,roster enunwa over tyrell williams
fantasyfootball,removed,thoughts on kelvin vs steve smith in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks for the write up i stashed him earlier in the year but had to let him go and now ive lost him im acquiring diggs in a trade package but i already have a boom or bust type of player in snead i need a te so im thinking about trading the enunwa owner my diggs or snead his enunwa and jimmy graham id rather let go of snead since brees spreads it so much but do you think hed go for either of those
fantasyfootball,removed,in an man league i have brown but am very uncertain who to start next to him with bryant unlikely to play once again my options are pryor benjamin and the mot enticing free agents enunwa sss royal wallace and crowder i am in a byeweek rb pinch with seattle and saints not playing so as of right now i have brown benjamin and pryor all playing
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start him over ryan matthews as flex
fantasyfootball,removed,on the fence foster hit the ww and enunwa and pitta are my weakest players considering dropping enunwa cause foster has a sky high ceiling
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop allen hurns to pick up enunwa
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop fleener for him i would start him at flex over devante parker i did pickup zach miller for te
fantasyfootball,removed,deandre hopkins vs mn or ryan mathews vs detroit hesitant to start hopkins after how well rhodes is playing
fantasyfootball,removed,gillislee
fantasyfootball,removed,aaaaaannd injury report
fantasyfootball,removed,ive heard some people say that they watch organized sports as an escape or a sanctuary from the goingson of the world a haven of relaxation and enjoyment some people dont issues invading that garden of eden and then having to listen to it be talked about before every game for the rest of the season
fantasyfootball,removed,does thielen benefit more than johnson
fantasyfootball,removed,its like you can protest on behalf of others imagine that
fantasyfootball,removed,rudolf bump ertz or rudolf

fantasyfootball,removed,good fuck kap usa mafuckaaaa
fantasyfootball,removed,can someone just start an anyone but kaep movement please id like them to demote that bitch to the practice squad
fantasyfootball,removed,which is why he is so impressionable and foolish that his activist dj girlfriend was able to turn him into the monster he is today what an uninformed scumbag
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck off i gave a very helpful answer my reasoning is you can choke in my cock
fantasyfootball,removed,hey guys i found all the racists
fantasyfootball,removed,he is hurt enough to the point i am giving thought to enuawa over obj this week
fantasyfootball,removed,thats not what i said i said we need to have a balanced approach and understand the entire situation
fantasyfootball,removed,who should i pick insteadtye or uzomah ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,jeez whats with all the hate and bull shit id definitely play howard

fantasyfootball,removed,dont feel too great team mehim staffordmanning millergordon landrybrown braterudolph goreshady mjjcooper
fantasyfootball,removed,i know what the call was unlike the officials on the field in this situation the league has the luxury of reviewing the video he clearly made contact with an official he should have been ejected from the game you might be the exact type of retard im describing if you think they didnt take that into account when they fined him
fantasyfootball,removed,holy fucking downvotes this thread is a repressive regime i like shephard too
fantasyfootball,removed,because coaches are a bunch of fucking cucks they only wanna see coleman shine

fantasyfootball,removed,im rolling with the rams ive considered swapping them out the last two weeks and im happy i didnt theyre a better defense than their fantasy points imo as long as the offense gives them time to breath i think theyll produce
fantasyfootball,removed,depends on the matchup id say overall the one
fantasyfootball,removed,lol
fantasyfootball,removed,i say that also being like an enormous jarvis landry fan but ill take mike evans over cooper so that kind of sways it and hopkins is obviously great
fantasyfootball,removed,holy shit i need to brag just got kelvin for matt jones and tyrell williams i sent a note saying you need a rb so let me know a counter if this isnt good and he is like yeah i hate getting rid of benjamin but seems fair what do i do with my hands

fantasyfootball,removed,is it worth dropping arizona d for minny d or should i just save the waiver and stick with ari
fantasyfootball,removed,hey man ive been streaming and the patriots were dropped this week is that an auto pickup and start even though the matchup vs the bills might not be a top that week matchup vs the browns with brady back is mouth watering
fantasyfootball,removed,are the vikings worth a waiver claim
fantasyfootball,removed,would it be worth dropping texans d for minnesota if they clear waivers tomorrow
fantasyfootball,removed,anyone playing the panthers this week with any confidence or would you rather stream someone like the redskins atlanta scares me
fantasyfootball,removed,should i scoop up baltimore over washington they have had good weeks and their upcoming schedule looks promising
fantasyfootball,removed,new england a must ownstash ros

fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop ne for the redskins this week
fantasyfootball,removed,ok i see what you mean now thanks quick question while youre here what might be a good option to grab for the next two weeks if im looking to start someone in place of seattle for this weeks bad matchup and their bye
fantasyfootball,removed,i have the arizona dst if possible would you recommend dropping them for minnesota ros or do you think arizona is the better defense to hold
fantasyfootball,removed,eagles and kc are on waivers worth stashing either one
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got seattle in both of my leagues philly and baltimore are available as well seattle is still ride outable yeah my gut says so i might snag one of the others for bye week or if the matchup is way juicier thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,same this has been a horrible start to season streaming to this algorithm
fantasyfootball,removed,skins or seahawks fitz was giving away points last week but the offense is still something to be worried about
fantasyfootball,removed,would you swap new england for washington if you were currently holding new england
fantasyfootball,removed,washington is available on ww team league std should i drop seattle and begin streaming from week forward sack interception fumble recovery touchdown safety block kick kickoff and punt return touchdowns points allowed points points allowed points points allowed points points allowed points points allowed points points allowed points points allowed points extra point returned
fantasyfootball,removed,would the jets at home be a good call or should i try and pick up baltimorephins

fantasyfootball,removed,jarvis landry
fantasyfootball,removed,fitzpatrick will never look as bad as he did last week buy lowstash until you get a game where he looks good again but i rewatched his first games last week expect more week and week he looks like the truth kc scheme well for strong tight ends and that is essentially the role enunwa plays
fantasyfootball,removed,depends is rape ok in your league what she look like bruh
fantasyfootball,removed,you are making me want to drop dorsett for crowder now
fantasyfootball,removed,need a flex bad in ppr use waiver on him
fantasyfootball,removed,already am on the crowder train im just having a hard time starting him over shadycmikeshepard even in ppr this week
fantasyfootball,removed,would it be moronic to start him over bmarsh home but vs seattle this week
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop sharpe for him
fantasyfootball,removed,so if i have a chance to pick him up should i drop michael floyd for him
fantasyfootball,removed,ingram
fantasyfootball,removed,you like him over sanu given his injury how about over a guy like cole beasley or quincy enuwa i think im ready to get rid of sanu as mostly a flash in the pan even though he was leading the team in targets before he went down last night shoulder injuries for receivers can linger all year and hes not good enough in my opinion to debate each week so yea you like crowder but do you like him over the bees in dallas and quincy in nyj
fantasyfootball,removed,crowder or beasley ppr team
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop tyrell williams for him full ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,would you recommend going for crowder over pryor a lot of people mention gordon coming back but i honestly dont feel as though a wr like pryor will just disappear as gordon returns if anything this helps pryor because now there is another talented wr to pull some of the coverage away i have waiver but i know that whichever person i dont pickup will get snagged by someone else before i get a second chance
fantasyfootball,removed,is he worth dropping fuller or hurns for
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop justin forsett for crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,if sam bradford could play well for the vikings as their qb with limited time its not unreasonable to assume a talented te could be up and running for their first game on a new team
fantasyfootball,removed,in my league crowder and desean jackson are available using a claim on desean but should i save it and pick up crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,pick up crowder and drop travis benjamin or mike wallace my other wrs are d hopkins d thomas and dez bryant
fantasyfootball,removed,terrence
fantasyfootball,removed,yea for real got burned by both sharpe and mariota this week
fantasyfootball,removed,this post is making me regret trading him now traded him and crabtree for hyde i was desperate for an rb and the person i traded with had plenty and wanted wr depth
fantasyfootball,removed,what should i pay from my faab
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop tate for him
fantasyfootball,removed,this chump or that wil fuller chump
fantasyfootball,removed,might be dumb but would you drop watkins for him
fantasyfootball,removed,i have devontae booker matt asiata and victor cruz person half ppr league terrelle pryor beasley crowder ajayi and darkwa are currently available on the ww do i drop booker and asiata and pick up ajayi and darkwa
fantasyfootball,removed,how much is he worth faab
fantasyfootball,removed,tate and moncrief i think tate is almost a lock for catches because of how the jbc offense is ran and the lack of megatron when luck was healthy last year moncrief was great and as someone who watches every colts game i think hes close to being as good if not better than ty hilton i think he takes on the reggie wayne possession receiver role and could see upwards of or even catches hes also arguably their best redzone option now as well
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah i have no sympathy for foster owners like idk what you fuckers thought was going to happen
fantasyfootball,removed,fair enough but you know whos laughing now
fantasyfootball,removed,if by current state you mean forever then yes

fantasyfootball,removed,oh my god im speaking to a retard
fantasyfootball,removed,what would you do in a team standard start bell elliott hyde stewart booker westleaning towards if hyde is healthy appreciate any input
fantasyfootball,removed,wrong threadin team standard start bell elliott hyde stewart booker westleaning towards if hyde is healthy appreciate any input
fantasyfootball,removed,before the season i said spending a round pick on charles was foolhardy as a year old rb coming off his major knee injury no matter who it is isnt worth that risk downvoted hard a few weeks in during one of the trade value threads i said people should sell charles because his value would never be higher than it would be then as suckers would think they were buying low dowvoted hard and told charles was instead a buy low candidate and id be the sucker for trading him this is the major problem with this sub and reddit in general if someone goes against the popular opinion they will be downvoted and told theyre an idiot rpolitics during bernie mania you couldnt point out that some of bernies responses were nonsensical especially with regards to foreign policy lest you be downvoted now its all about hillary point out her failings and youre downvoted even if youre right or informative rfantasyfootball was so high on charles it was ridiculous people were saying things like youre getting a round pick for the price of a rounder all you had to do was look at the face of it dont spend a high pick on a year old rb coming off a major knee surgery we all draft busts from time to time but anyone investing in charles was using his big name not actual logic it sucks that rather than listen to cold logic people responded with but charles is a special player
fantasyfootball,removed,thats stupid
fantasyfootball,removed,thats stupid
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr powell v mia jennings v phi
fantasyfootball,removed,why is this getting removed
fantasyfootball,removed,i know but more fumble and its another pts for the game i know ingram will be the starter again but that fear in the back of my mind that sean payton is a salty fucker and will bench him again without a thought
fantasyfootball,removed,interesting viewpoint should i drop cameron meredith for peyton who is a fa in my league
fantasyfootball,removed,traded him for stewart
fantasyfootball,removed,not sure if youre joking but he is known to be very careful with money i remember an article about how he would help all the other seahawks set up retirement accounts
fantasyfootball,removed,should i trade jordan howard and emmanuel sanders for ezekiel elliot
fantasyfootball,removed,i took denver just a few minutes ago on bovada im so torn on what to do its just an easier decision for me to pick up kc i know its not an option for everyone i gotta trust my gut here i feel carr is just on another level right now and you can make a case to say that the oak offense is right on par with ne right now
fantasyfootball,removed,my opponent has zeke so itd be nice if he was held out of the game this week so i dont have to deal with that haha
fantasyfootball,removed,i was lucky enough to go djshady as my first picks in ppr drafted crabtree and michael thomas late and am right now made a forteedelman trade for hopkins and now trying to package hopkins and someone for evans consider doing bookerhopkins for evans but just might keep my team as is i love having dj shady booker for my rbs
fantasyfootball,removed,i asked you what oc stood for dick i wasnt questioning your sincerity in typing the letters o and c i was asking what the fuck they meant
fantasyfootball,removed,if he was trying to make a name for himself there is a difference between making a name and career suicide just ask donald
fantasyfootball,removed,try not inserting your ignorance into a conversation that doesnt concern you dick
fantasyfootball,removed,please be out please be out please be out
fantasyfootball,removed,someone dropped allen i have fedora and clay right now only transactions left though should i use one on allen
fantasyfootball,removed,of course as soon as i trade him this comes out i swear he goes off in a repeat of last year
fantasyfootball,removed,🍇
fantasyfootball,removed,the longest pass thrown by the eagles sunday was not carson wentz my starting quarterback but josh huff
fantasyfootball,removed,i packaged him and dion for andy dalton and kenny britt i was in desperate need of a qb and i am deep at rb also think that dalton is about to tear up the second half and be a top qb owner wouldnt take dion straight up for him but offered the trade above
fantasyfootball,removed,its him asiata or gillislee in my flex gonna keep him there
fantasyfootball,removed,cant decide between marvin and britt
fantasyfootball,removed,i need a help on my team qb prescott wr julio crabtree sanders rb steward mccoy te walker flex hightower k crosby d carolina bench arob cobb gillislee blount pryor my buddy who has charcandrick west wants pryor for himwhat should i do cobb will be limited blount on bye im not sure who to start please help
fantasyfootball,removed,thats what im thinking too hes got his weapons throwing a ton of yards and his td percentage is half of what it should be so hopefully more will come even if he maintains the same stats hes averaging ppg so if thats his floor for the second half with potential for more in all likelihood ill take that
fantasyfootball,removed,as a ingram owner the saints are so bad on defense they throw a lot i picked up hightower as a safety net if you have room go for it not a fun backfield to own
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck you you make fantasy players look bad
fantasyfootball,removed,maybe not top but i like crowder and thomas the most of those guys thomas looks to be colston
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt tyrel has way more upside than mn d especially after this weekend they are suspect
fantasyfootball,removed,someone dropped mark ingram yesterday and now today someone dropped deandre hopkins i have waiver priority so should i just use it on ingram since he clears waivers first and take my chances on no one putting in a claim for hopkins i really dont need either of these guys but fuck those are guys you dont leave on the ww
fantasyfootball,removed,i mean it is a pretty stupid rule i dont think theres anything wrong with petitioning for a rule that is very dumb just because it favors one person or another also really not my fault i didnt go through every rule book and petitioned to change every unfair one before the season
fantasyfootball,removed,honestly what would you do if there was an unfair rule whose correction would benefit you what if tiebreaker was whoever had the longest team name you wouldnt petition to look it up right if it would benefit you no matter how dumb because other wise youre just complaining because it benefits you im glad you have the self awareness to realize you sound like a dick hopefully youll realize you also are one
fantasyfootball,removed,this
fantasyfootball,removed,actually i did go through the rules before the season started i sent ones that caught my eye and some got changed but because there were do many most didnt get a response anyways i brought it up before the incident happened when i first noticed it and i dont think there is anything wrong with changing a clearly unfair rule
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm maybe like i said divisions are completely arbitrary and you dont play people in your divisions more or less so if you actually had standings of the league id be higher i dont know if you follow soccer but in the premier league where every team plays the others twice it would be like having a clear and team in the standings then saying oh wait lets divide teams into two divisions of so now the team is second in the west and the team is first in the east on wait the team is better so they get second place i understand if you have actual divisions like in the nfl but again everyone played everyone in my league
fantasyfootball,removed,fair enough i guess still think its stupid lol
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard thinking of a couple trades currently my wrs are julio ty marvin michael thomas tyrell rbs mccoygills ware rawls dion hightower so with ware potentially being out my rb situation this week wouldnt be ideal i got offered jay ajayi for hilton but not sure how to feel about it also still seeing if i could get an abbooker with sending julio and shady
fantasyfootball,removed,damn dude all my fault for getting upset you just knew it was coming man if only people could have conversations without insults like that other guy and me in this same thread im sorry you get so upset at being called a dick after you preface an insult by saying you might sound like a dick how could you possibly have known this was coming very smart ps imsaid in my other comment that im not opposed to divisions if they actually are divisions and teams within the divisions played each other like divisions like the nfl otherwise it doesnt make sense sorry for your feelings getting hurt after insulting someone else shits tough man way to take the high road though looks good on you
fantasyfootball,removed,yes you are take benjamin and reed with no looks back
fantasyfootball,removed,ingram bombed the out of last games so i wouldnt say im wrong i didnt get your tell me moars the last two week when ingram sucked so really whos wrong you do realize hightower also got points and rams offence had turnovers in their side and lets be real you wouldnt ever be yelling tell me more in my face if we were in the same room and this was a face to face conversation cause id break your fucking nose nerd
fantasyfootball,removed,just looked it up at the same age austin fastest is hills is in what world are they even close to having the same acceleration
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck off and worry about yourself
fantasyfootball,removed,did someone say c m i k e
fantasyfootball,removed,❤️
fantasyfootball,removed,dt in
fantasyfootball,removed,what is brandyn cooks worth he is a make or break player each week i wanna trade him but nobody wants him but he is a player that i shouldnt be dropped
fantasyfootball,removed,sounds like youre a pussy with a frail ego i wouldnt want friends like you either
fantasyfootball,removed,im in playoffs is it worth to drop starks for peterson
fantasyfootball,removed,read what i actually said you creep i have an extra wr i dont need for starters both teams are actively seeking him tyrell williams im getting a much needed rb in return from either of them are you with me so far peabrain next im deciding to give my player to the worse of the two teams because later in the playoffs i think id have a better chance at beating him is that simple enough for you to understand not collusion its two teams competing for one spot im choosing to help the team that i can beat later on its not like im trading with a last place team to steal a good player from them get off your high horse youre absolutely dead wrong here
fantasyfootball,removed,crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,man idk i feel like he has to be owned if hes active but youd have to have grapefruit sized balls to start him in a championship game not to mention if the vikes keep losing they wont make the playoffs and hell inevitably be shut down until next year
fantasyfootball,removed,totally fair trade prevent this by having an earlier trade deadline in a keeper league
fantasyfootball,removed,its a keeper league i imagine its like a real sports league get future pieces on an off year and benefit those who are in a win now mindset if that got vetoed then i dont understand the point of being in a keeper league
fantasyfootball,removed,itd be unfair if it wasnt a keeper league
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard pick s smith sr vs miami hopkins vs gb d thomas vs jax t hill vs atl
fantasyfootball,removed,flag football lol
fantasyfootball,removed,not on topic at all but this reminded me of that time the picture of honey badgers d leaked anyone remember that lets discuss
fantasyfootball,removed,standard give fortehopkins get evans my rbs melvin ajayi forte crowell d lewis mckinnon p barber my wrs hopkins dez c coleman hurns k britt
fantasyfootball,removed,lets go indians sorry off topic but freakin excited and nervous
fantasyfootball,removed,its racist of you to think its racist
fantasyfootball,removed,well you should drop lacy for starters
fantasyfootball,removed,you can drop lacy pray for the other two
fantasyfootball,removed,the reason youre still losing is because youve held onto lacy that just tells us youre making really poor fantasy decisions why do you still have him
fantasyfootball,removed,those are horrible top picks you did it to yourself lol
fantasyfootball,removed,it is news fuckhead go suck your dads dick
fantasyfootball,removed,i tried offering cobb gill for jordy to the shady owner ah well hopefully he gets another l this week
fantasyfootball,removed,while i applaud the decision and the organization for being proactive i cant help but feel bad for the guy he is looking at a very tumultuous couple of years and i find it hard to believe he will be welcomed back into the nfl if he ends up serving time its hard enough for sub par exathletes to find a role in their new lives it will be even harder as a felon
fantasyfootball,removed,assuming mccoy doesnt play do you guys think i should start gilly or corey coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,no shit
fantasyfootball,removed,if mccoy and ware dont play should i play gill or charcandrick
fantasyfootball,removed,giants always close strong and as weve seen this year obj can put up points in one week i have faith
fantasyfootball,removed,youre an idiot if wont do that trade
fantasyfootball,removed,this is the worst post ever
fantasyfootball,removed,second half of schedule is such a cake walk
fantasyfootball,removed,hes in points per game amongst wrs in half ppr so hes on the cusp as for the trade use the index thread
fantasyfootball,removed,lol i would absolutely do that trade obj is a top tier talent crabtree is playing well no doubt but still this is a top pick we are talking about here i am of the belief that he will absolutely turn it on in the half i cant believe someone would offer you that trade but if i were you id definitely take it
fantasyfootball,removed,take that trade i got offered sanders and ajayi and ill probably turn that down obj can only go up
fantasyfootball,removed,hes still odell hes recovering from injury and said hes at himself and theyre coming off of a bye he said hes times better since their last game vs makes a difference hes got the higher ceiling and will still get the looks
fantasyfootball,removed,obj is exactly the type of player you should be buying right now and his bad season are duds solid outings and i just won you your week pretty much all of us expect the giants offense to improve going forward and their schedule gets a lot easier i cant believe you havent accepted that trade yet
fantasyfootball,removed,source
fantasyfootball,removed,im concerned about his availability this week i think theyll keep him on a snap count which will hurt his floor but right now i have on bye coleman injured dion stashed so im starting hyde and ty mont both of whom are questionable plus starks is practicing might have to pick him up but id be dropping dion so im just keeping a close eye on the situation when healthy he gets the volume
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start ryan mathews or gilly
fantasyfootball,removed,stabbed raped
fantasyfootball,removed,at this rate my gillie suit will be used even less than my exfiancees wedding dress
fantasyfootball,removed,i prefer stafford to dak
fantasyfootball,removed,dont drop staff drop someone else

fantasyfootball,removed,roll on the dice on tymo if he plays or start antone smith tonight

fantasyfootball,removed,no youre wrong you revealed yourself as someone who failed to read the article but was somehow entitled to an aggressive position and response youre likely a lowinformation voter as well who happens to be very active on facebook with inane political posts

fantasyfootball,removed,they did actually
fantasyfootball,removed,wow i hope you arent really that stupid
fantasyfootball,removed,arob
fantasyfootball,removed,wow you really are an idiot a reception doesnt accomplish anything by itself a run for yards accomplishes the same as a pass for yards yet in ppr the pass is worth double
fantasyfootball,removed,cobb and matthews
fantasyfootball,removed,are you retarded
fantasyfootball,removed,the phrase is toss up you fuckin immigrant
fantasyfootball,removed,yes if youd watch every vikings game like i have youd know they have the worst run game in the league and when the other team knows they are going to run like when they have a big lead it gets even worse look up the stats unless you just want to go by gut feelings
fantasyfootball,removed,seriously unless its a huge bench i suppose like guys

fantasyfootball,removed,dpes this make west a good play today with the turmoil of buffalos backfield im looking to fill my flex with someone with high volume its between pryor west and baldwin for my last spot
fantasyfootball,removed,then how is he their starting qb today sargeant downs are you implying theyre rolling with a qb who is missing his throwing arm is it your professional medical opinion that because adam im not a reporter but i play on one tv schefter said he couldnt lift his arm last monday morning he has a serious medical issue are you sargeant downs because you have an extra chromosome
fantasyfootball,removed,vikings dst at philadelphia or titans vs indianapolis
fantasyfootball,removed,you are responding way too ignorantly
fantasyfootball,removed,shit somebody better tell joe flacco he cant play today then im not sure he realizes that even though hes good to go the inability to life his arm over his head last monday means hes seriously injured you should change your name to dr downs not sargeant downs and thank you for saving joe flaccos life today that was a close one
fantasyfootball,removed,judging by the fact you think flaccos sore shoulder means hes dying my assumption is you either do have downs syndrome or you should be the official doctor for all sports until the end of time dont forget us little guys when youre a big timer
fantasyfootball,removed,rudolph
fantasyfootball,removed,fleenster
fantasyfootball,removed,hey guys im in a really tight spot sitting at in a team league i need a rb badly i didnt anticipate the clusterfuck that is jamaal charless situation when i drafted him my wrs are julio demaryius doug baldwin travis benjamin victor cruz and devante parker and my rbs are jamaal latavius murray isaiah crowell tj yeldon and zach zenner the ware owner just offered me doug baldwin and jamaal for ware and quincy enunwa i realize this is a better trade for him than it is for me but i think im about to be this week and i basically just need a consistent rb im also not sure that doug baldwin is going to be that great for the rest of the season considering the reemergence of graham in the past few weeks what do you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,ajayi or james white at flex standard league
fantasyfootball,removed,zenner or mccoy

fantasyfootball,removed,doubt it it was all hillman and asiata mckinnon was carted to the locker room
fantasyfootball,removed,no marshall would be miles better with geno fitz cant even reach marsh
fantasyfootball,removed,nah he barely got a hit off yet
fantasyfootball,removed,im not playing this game again
fantasyfootball,removed,its happening i can feel it
fantasyfootball,removed,youre mentally challenged fam its above you should get a job as donald trumps debate writer
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop michael thomas for sanu
fantasyfootball,removed,wdiflex maclin or sanu
fantasyfootball,removed,still taking the better dst in az
fantasyfootball,removed,yes either is an upgrade i like bos but if youre a nyg fan get the wife beater
fantasyfootball,removed,miller was invisible last week allen may be good for a score
fantasyfootball,removed,green
fantasyfootball,removed,i think youre fine with any of them i like ryancousinsflacco
fantasyfootball,removed,heres a deep qb add question background inherited a team in a league relatively big bench but also full idp roster decent team but he inexplicably drafted one qb and its quite possibly the worst starter in the pros case keenan trying to fix via trade but not shortselling rest of team for junk store trash any you guys feel especially bullish on later in the season the usual backup suspects are gone seeing lynch mccarron geno anything here have any potential
fantasyfootball,removed,not a fan personally
fantasyfootball,removed,nope
fantasyfootball,removed,seconded
fantasyfootball,removed,are you adding for trade bait id probably cut forsett or bilal
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,sure
fantasyfootball,removed,id cut lockett or sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,id just dump miller for rudolph if youre sour on boyd you can make the speculative eifert grab hold as well
fantasyfootball,removed,would you rather have crabtree or maclin in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,yep thanks i have waiver at least and while i want to blow it on a de who was just cut going to sit and hope for an injury that sounds bad
fantasyfootball,removed,i would
fantasyfootball,removed,thats fair still do you ever see a scenario where youre starting forsett kc byerawls injured maybe bilal gets elevated pretty tall if forte is run into the ground
fantasyfootball,removed,couple of additional questions do you have any running history of bids so far take a look at what other owners are paying unless your benches are very deep in a league there should be serviceable guys in free agency to some degree whos the best rb out there right now
fantasyfootball,removed,hey guys unfortunately i drafted keenan in the second round now week to week my lineup decisions arent as clear as they were prior to his injury team league with standard scoring everyone knows what theyre doing fantasy wise also so theres no depth on the ww nees to choose players one one flex to start out of derrick henry michael crabtree marvin jones donte moncrief henry will probably sit so i need to know who to bench for week between the three receivers thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,davante adams or randall cobb minnesota
fantasyfootball,removed,alllllll abbbbboard to be devastatingly let down chio choo
fantasyfootball,removed,its only illegal if you specify that in the rules you can force a minimum position in every system that im familiar with or it will result in a straight learn for next year and let it go
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,mariota
fantasyfootball,removed,morris
fantasyfootball,removed,cmike
fantasyfootball,removed,hes not going to say anything else imagine it i feel like crap i havent been able to play at all ill probably be even worse than last season that wouldnt go over well
fantasyfootball,removed,would downvote again
fantasyfootball,removed,sss
fantasyfootball,removed,was it someone who played in the jets game
fantasyfootball,removed,now im super conflicted about starting jordan matthews i feel like hell draw heavy coverage the entire night now regardless of targets would you go with langford vs phi maclin hou jennings vs no or cobb min instead ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,personal preference i like green in ppr as a safety valve for the weaker qb a bit more in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,cmike is disposable
fantasyfootball,removed,breezin for a win here
fantasyfootball,removed,henry is your most disposable
fantasyfootball,removed,no objection but bilal wont clear until next week no if youre set on dumping cmike grab the backup before sunday and use that to drop later i like riverscousinsmariota
fantasyfootball,removed,dont think i would
fantasyfootball,removed,id keep the crow if youre set on williams youre cutting fuller sharpe or forsett imo
fantasyfootball,removed,whats the rest of your lineup you probably do but wheaton will have a few games this year that will make you grimace if someone else nabs him
fantasyfootball,removed,id cut morris your rbs are solid and lafell has started the season well realistically youre probably never starting him but if he has a nice weekend hes worth trading
fantasyfootball,removed,id cut hurns
fantasyfootball,removed,are you talking about dropping either of those or just a wdis question i would neither start nor cut either of those for coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,ertz
fantasyfootball,removed,no way
fantasyfootball,removed,is this a question if youre talking starting lineup yes definitely if youre talking ros id be looking at wrrbs in free agency not a second te
fantasyfootball,removed,man that waiver wire makes me salivate but your bench is strong too i would be tempted to cut stafford maybe watkins and possibly woodhead as your scoring is standard like the hold on gordon who will be relevant come or so
fantasyfootball,removed,trash for trash but better ceiling with tyrell
fantasyfootball,removed,i like snead for another week
fantasyfootball,removed,in youll see players on ww that make you drool all season long id cut orange julius before those wrs though
fantasyfootball,removed,no reason to hold extra tes cmike is also junk store trash if you want both cut the bottom of your list
fantasyfootball,removed,id keep the crow matt jones looks like garbage
fantasyfootball,removed,trade these guys away instead of dropping
fantasyfootball,removed,selling gurley pretty cheap here
fantasyfootball,removed,no veto
fantasyfootball,removed,ertz
fantasyfootball,removed,id go for diggs but you have relatively good depth there
fantasyfootball,removed,yep
fantasyfootball,removed,how about thisim in a weird position with my wrs and flex do i start dez and sneed dez and edelman edelman and sneed d williams is currently in my wrrb flex spot what would you do im currently running sneed and dez bryant marshall was my and played and did well
fantasyfootball,removed,just got dez and marvin jones in a trade for alshon i know this doesnt mean anything but it makes me feel decent about my move
fantasyfootball,removed,wondering this too where can we check i have to start either jared cook martellus bennett or cj uzomah
fantasyfootball,removed,you did the right thing
fantasyfootball,removed,youre gonna get a lot of shit for posting this here instead of wdi threads but yes marvin jones is awesome this year
fantasyfootball,removed,i want him from a guy thats shopping tyrod taylor thinking about trying to package them both for jameis winston and vjaxdiggswatkins not sure if thats a good idea
fantasyfootball,removed,i have to start from this group hilton moncrief sims tevin coleman tyrell williams would you really go with out of the noncolts group

fantasyfootball,removed,start him over d jackson gb
fantasyfootball,removed,him or arob
fantasyfootball,removed,i guess im out of the loop i picked up draughn earlier this week as an option if mccoy was ruled out harris is still available worth dropping draughn to play harris
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,you think hes a better option than asiata in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr still have to go with coates over harris right or does it depend on big ben
fantasyfootball,removed,pick him up and start him over mathews
fantasyfootball,removed,inching towards mckinnon here
fantasyfootball,removed,struggling because of byes at rb should i drop gills for him or play henry over both i am also playing demarco

fantasyfootball,removed,please do drop them so i can pick them up
fantasyfootball,removed,eh to be fair wentz gifted the giants those first tds and put the d in a tough spot and the st were like yards away from putting up giants barely have yds of offense
fantasyfootball,removed,wentz screwed them on the first scores sproles just barely stepped out of bounds on a return that was a sure td with about yards to go im mad but im not going to drop them
fantasyfootball,removed,its a division game against the giants giants and cowboys always play the eagles good stfu please
fantasyfootball,removed,go fuck urself

fantasyfootball,removed,donald glover
fantasyfootball,removed,just in case youre new there are threads called wdis who do i start that are for this they were made so this subreddit isnt flooded with posts like yours of people asking about their specific circumstances
fantasyfootball,removed,this is so frustrating right now i really thought he would keep his high value
fantasyfootball,removed,there were quite a few plays where defense pi was called on something he was involved in unfortunately that doesnt help us fantasy guys the potential for big plays are there but they obviously didnt happen today
fantasyfootball,removed,take this game with a grain of salt xavier rhodes pretty much shuts anyone down
fantasyfootball,removed,nah chill hes played some tough teams hell be fine at
fantasyfootball,removed,its official sean payton hates mark ingram there is no other explanation
fantasyfootball,removed,jk fuck you you piece of shit
fantasyfootball,removed,high quality post mods please sticky to top of sub
fantasyfootball,removed,i appreciate that apparently time share means mark ingram doesnt play at all
fantasyfootball,removed,im so inconvenienced by this not being a wdis post
fantasyfootball,removed,fbi closes investigation against hillary what a joke
fantasyfootball,removed,should i flex crabtree dt baldwin or latavius standard
fantasyfootball,removed,i hope mike mccarthy gets aids what a pos and hes an overrated coach anyways

fantasyfootball,removed,im about to be
fantasyfootball,removed,i have the most points scored but also the most points against and my of cammarshallallen didnt work out
fantasyfootball,removed,if bell is on the board in the first round still then you take him otherwise id go best wr available
fantasyfootball,removed,charmander was such a beast for me that backfield tends to be a dumpster fire for me might steer clear of kc
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk easy
fantasyfootball,removed,allen the expiration date on rbs is much sooner
fantasyfootball,removed,ppl are super high on k allen huh i had him seasons ago n was underwhelmed i know he was having a good season last year up until he got hurt but he only played like half a season why do ppl think he is such a safe pick
fantasyfootball,removed,if you are talking about them with regards to keepers i would definitely keep keenan i mean freeman had a super fantasy year but his yards per carry was a bit worrisome on the flip side keenan is always hurt it seems so its kind of tough to project injuries aside i feel keenan allen has more upside as long as rivers is the qb
fantasyfootball,removed,montgomery should be dropped unless youre in a league with no other options cobb is consistent with a midlevel floor adams is consistent with a high ceiling id go adams

fantasyfootball,removed,drop smallwood for watkins

fantasyfootball,removed,personally hightower boyd has a tough matchup and ingram may be limited coming out of the concussion protocol
fantasyfootball,removed,ajayi no question
fantasyfootball,removed,on meno on my on ok
fantasyfootball,removed,would a switch to goff negatively impact kendricks or possibly give him a slight boost
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks for putting my mind at ease i really didnt wanna bench brees especially at such a crucial junction of the season but the situation made me really start to consider it any thoughts on thomas vs rishard matthews vs steve smith sr for my flex spot halfppr

fantasyfootball,removed,i dont believe you understand the situation youre in this is a doug martin hype train thread not a doug martin might get reinjured thread choo choo motha fucka
fantasyfootball,removed,trump electeddoug martin practicing coincidence
fantasyfootball,removed,for ros picking lets say with a fourth option freeman hyde martin coleman gio freeman is an in the best offense in the league im saying hyde gets healthy and starts running but i could easily see him being the one you drop here martin is coming back and assuming he starts next week he could be a top coleman has proven himself if healthy that he can come in and still get points as an gio he hasnt shown me enough this year as an to justify keeping him especially with the other talent youve shown here gl personally running dj dion white and doug for ros
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,cubs win the world series trumps president and martin is actually practicingwhat on earth
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,ughwould anyone start steve smith over him

fantasyfootball,removed,hes coming up on a yard season with a horrible qb not taking any pressure off him youre an idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,who are these fucking people that arent jarvis landry this is why i dont start him anymore
fantasyfootball,removed,what was that about michael thomas and allen robinson your welcome to play in my leagues anytime i love free money
fantasyfootball,removed,fine lmao hes had solid production all year long you dont get to yards without also producing in fantasy my statement of you being a fucking idiot stands
fantasyfootball,removed,do i roll with gronk or zach ertz full ppr

fantasyfootball,removed,do i flex gronk or s ware
fantasyfootball,removed,honestly are you retarded i almost feel bad for how stupid you sound
fantasyfootball,removed,benching michael thomas for steve smith may have been my dumbest move of the year
fantasyfootball,removed,benching michael thomas for steve smith may have been my dumbest move of the year
fantasyfootball,removed,benching michael thomas for steve smith may have been my dumbest move of the year
fantasyfootball,removed,ertz or gronk feel like ertz will have a good game without the risk of gronk just being used as a blocker
fantasyfootball,removed,both my playoff bound teams with him on it disagree dumbass
fantasyfootball,removed,really nice sentences you put together there is english your second language hes been a key part of my playoff hopes a reliable rb who puts up every week is very important
fantasyfootball,removed,still happy with him did you take minutes proofreading to get that comment out without sounding like an idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,fucking record player over here you dont even have anything new to say and you still cant type proper sentences
fantasyfootball,removed,welp you are wrong girl im winning but the fucktard could have help what a neegur
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk or kben i pull pryor last minute to give a chance to start gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,did you just go look up records to have something new to say lol youre pathetic
fantasyfootball,removed,thanx
fantasyfootball,removed,had my worst week since week points standard and im up against rodgerssproles monday im feeling a little uneasy
fantasyfootball,removed,oh yes im sure you perfectly predicted the future too you knew what every analyst didnt huh id be willing to bet money that you wouldnt have said any of that exactly one year ago
fantasyfootball,removed,so youre arguing tht manning sucks and tou wouldnt have taken him but now youre saying well a year ago i wouldnt have said that youre making shit up and youre all over the place congratulations im now convinced you have no idea what youre talking about
fantasyfootball,removed,is he black or retarded
fantasyfootball,removed,me too i also started wilson over rodgers double fuck me
fantasyfootball,removed,siemian bortles bradford and kaep are my options right now no choice but to stick with brees right
fantasyfootball,removed,i have brees too my other options are cousins stafford rivers tyrod vs cleveland what do you think
fantasyfootball,removed,in my two qb league i started mariota and eli hehehe
fantasyfootball,removed,way to go dickless
fantasyfootball,removed,you might be retarded
fantasyfootball,removed,i got really cute starting melvin gordon matt forte and donte moncrief also started leveon bell™
fantasyfootball,removed,i didnt want to cloud the original post but i have dak and with his previous two weeks being horrible and the bucs defense starting to look legit im thinking about replacing him next week my options though are matt moore or matt barkley not very glamorous options there
fantasyfootball,removed,wrong
fantasyfootball,removed,would you flex tevin over alshon in ppr next week
fantasyfootball,removed,nice work weirdo
fantasyfootball,removed,your name cracks me the fuck up
fantasyfootball,removed,week to week
fantasyfootball,removed,honestly its a good question
fantasyfootball,removed,that was just my take on it from watching the game the fact that smith is probably better in pass pro is just one more reason to think that smith would be the guy to go in ot because he is less likely to lose them the game on a blown block and just another reason to think he will be more of a down role type back this week not the lead back im not arguing that barber will get jacquizz level carries there will likely be a substantial split in snaps but he is my bet to be the down back and get goal line work also the fact that antone smith also came from atl doesnt mean anthing other than that he knows koetters overall system but this isnt atl its tb and even though the coach is the same its an entirely different team with totally different assets see dexter mccluster and how hes been used in san diego he knows the wisenhunt offense but hasnt been used in the woodhead role at all antone smith had like carries in his entire years in atl so yeah sounds like koetter really has a lot of faith in him
fantasyfootball,removed,wont happen unless u upvote me
fantasyfootball,removed,its a defense play on
fantasyfootball,removed,ride it out there was an article posted by someone earlier warning that cutler usually does really well against zimmervikings dont worry about it
fantasyfootball,removed,division matchups are always like this the chargers beat the broncos a couple weeks ago and had a chance to win in denver yesterday
fantasyfootball,removed,division games
fantasyfootball,removed,division games are always funky
fantasyfootball,removed,someone does bad quick let me make a ros thread
fantasyfootball,removed,sure theres no better option unless you trade
fantasyfootball,removed,this game has been pretty disappointing agree with the offense hurting the defense the sack totals in the past few weeks have concerned me as well i plan to keep them though hopefully they turn things around
fantasyfootball,removed,you are stupid are you even watching tonight maybe points in standard i play ppr i expect nothing less than
fantasyfootball,removed,good call nostradumbass
fantasyfootball,removed,if this post ends up positive you will win if not you will lose so yall better upvote this post
fantasyfootball,removed,this is what u get for not upvoting me you only have yourself to blame
fantasyfootball,removed,you seem to like losing
fantasyfootball,removed,im debating between alfred morris and derrick henry for waiver pick up would this have you targeting morris over henry
fantasyfootball,removed,are you surprised to see a nice dose of davis oh wait that didnt happen because youre a fucking idiot and he already got cut moron
fantasyfootball,removed,non story nothing will happen she is a known liar alf owners keep dreaming
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah it means suck my dick bitch boi
fantasyfootball,removed,so what do i do with gillislee drop
fantasyfootball,removed,im killed with byes and injuries this week and need to pick up an rb going to drop knile davis should i pick up duke johnson or charcandrick west
fantasyfootball,removed,leading in total points means nothing if you arent able to put up a good score consistently each week you say you have the most points for and the least points against that must mean that you have a few weeks where you scored very low and a few weeks where you scored absurdly high high enough to give you the most pts for ive always valued consistency in a ff team and your team is a good example of why
fantasyfootball,removed,as always really look forward to this thanks for doing it every week wdis question at receivers for you trying to figure out who to start i have julio amari moncrief pryor and montgomery im thinking julio is a definite however wasnt sure about the other because of the matchup for cooper moncrief looked good coming back from injury and pryor has mccown back obviously i could play of those and then one of those at the flex my rb options for the flex include ajayi ingram hightower currently starting with freeman booker at rb your thoughts

fantasyfootball,removed,or youve ascended to being a true master you need to know the rules before you can break them
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt drop quizz until i had official word on him so it sucks that the info isnt coming out more quickly theres still a pretty solid chance hes out weeks if i heard that for sure i might cut him
fantasyfootball,removed,d none of the above hold quizz until we know for sure doug is coming back and even then id still hold him if you can afford the stash
fantasyfootball,removed,ha i did too ive been streaming for the past weeks not a good qb stream yea

fantasyfootball,removed,fu jamaal
fantasyfootball,removed,not a chance in the world but thanks so much for sharing your unbridled pessimism
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop morris or sanu for him dont own zeke
fantasyfootball,removed,they wont take that
fantasyfootball,removed,keepers league fuck no single season go with what will make the season fun for you gurley is a better talent on a garbage team and gordon is a decent talent on the current top offense with no competition for goal line work
fantasyfootball,removed,i would pull the trigger
fantasyfootball,removed,id take gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,as of writing this hes at exactly lol
fantasyfootball,removed,should i try to get martin for lacy
fantasyfootball,removed,for you i wouldnt if you sell gurley it wont be a solid return high risk high reward welcome to fantasy football
fantasyfootball,removed,id go gordon that rams passing offense is not going to get better anytime soon gordon has looked good the nfl seems to have clicked for him and hes the uncontested back now that woodhead is out
fantasyfootball,removed,sure as hell would do it gordon is gunna end up too rb with woodhead gone for some time hes going to get a larger workload even without keenan allen the passing game is still looking strong as well so he will not be facing full defensive boxes making it nearly impossible for him to produce like gurleys situation right now if you can get him to accept i would definitely do it maybe even toss a high low if you have enough depth to do so
fantasyfootball,removed,i think this is a decision that will either sink your fantasy year or make it if you want to gamble do it if you want to play it safe and have other rbs on your team that can get you through the next few weeks hold
fantasyfootball,removed,looking for some advice on a trade in a team ppr league i have david johnson and i was offered gurley nelson and langford the rest of my rbwrs are miller foster duke johnson mike evans dt shepard fuller and josh gordon thoughts it feels like im being offered so much but is it worth possibly giving up the potential is gurley going to rebound or is it too bleak in la with that offense
fantasyfootball,removed,early in the season i would wait it out at the very least you can try to sell higher on gurley by waiting for a better week out of him
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got the same walshon maybe well get lucky and theyll collide at halftime
fantasyfootball,removed,as someone who lost woodhead keenan and still has ivory i would not accept that trade just out of spite for the chargers their strength and conditioning must be lacking or something
fantasyfootball,removed,to you as well
fantasyfootball,removed,youre carryiing tes yes drop city
fantasyfootball,removed,id hold henry but flip sharpe for one of the week darlings
fantasyfootball,removed,these douchebag eagles why are you giving them the ball back im up by vs alshon in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,lulz
fantasyfootball,removed,noooo
fantasyfootball,removed,thank fantasy gods for cheating zebras

fantasyfootball,removed,aww man an unsatisfying conclusion to that
fantasyfootball,removed,they were killing clock
fantasyfootball,removed,you fuckers all laughed at me i said i needed matthews and jeffery to combine for points you assholes all said lol matthews will do it in the first half fuck you i won but i won by like points fuck you rff fuck you hard
fantasyfootball,removed,need help i have evans should i accept a trade for my evans and crowell to get odell and rashad jennings
fantasyfootball,removed,hoyer is an upgrade
fantasyfootball,removed,id hold washington if possible but the other two are junk store trash
fantasyfootball,removed,drop forsett for vereen im not liking the backfield situation in baltimore at all
fantasyfootball,removed,no one would buy him outside of the bell owner
fantasyfootball,removed,ryan mathews i wanna offer the charles owner ryan mathews tyrell williams for jamaal charles ty hilton
fantasyfootball,removed,perfect time for my morning work shits thank you why so high on the packers detroit is a pass friendly team and stafford isnt really the old int stafford he used to be im not going against you bc i own the gb defense just want to be sold so i can start them with confidence appreciate it
fantasyfootball,removed,stream miami or pick up minnesota to hold the rest of the season
fantasyfootball,removed,would you rather grab miami or cincinatti
fantasyfootball,removed,whats a realistic offer for me to give i have wr depth and crabtree lockett tate that i could be more than willing to part withalso could possibly pick up d parker on waivers this week
fantasyfootball,removed,theo riddick
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start the vikings on the road vs cam newton and the panthers
fantasyfootball,removed,would i be an idiot to trade away maclin for eddie lacy im super deep at wr and just lost woodhead and martin
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah and always injured
fantasyfootball,removed,traded dmart for jordy right before the game and then just got cja for latavius and josh gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,gurley
fantasyfootball,removed,yes you process the trade
fantasyfootball,removed,its set in the rules check your league settings
fantasyfootball,removed,would u give up hill for coleman or who is worth giving up for coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,i lost woodhead do i package gio and hurns to get gordon or sit on gio ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,week question possibly longerros obviously a deep league yes this is for assumes injury knocks out incumbent brian hoyer dal cody kessler mia jacoby brissett hou aj mccarron den
fantasyfootball,removed,cant go wrong with either but with rivers so smoking hot im sitting stafford
fantasyfootball,removed,tannehill miami running game is in shambles and will have to throw to move the chains
fantasyfootball,removed,i like carr but tennessees defense will put him on the ground some
fantasyfootball,removed,not sure whats with all of the cousins hate lately man i wish i had tannehill on waivers in my bigger leagues i think these both are relatively equivalent depends who you feel like rooting for
fantasyfootball,removed,id go bortles
fantasyfootball,removed,bortles
fantasyfootball,removed,winston looks like trash and big ben has been killing it going pitt
fantasyfootball,removed,julian edelman man ppr manages to get him for marvin jones today
fantasyfootball,removed,dalton is flying under the radar in way too many leagues i think its a viable strategy if you have the bench room but i think brees will light it up vs sd
fantasyfootball,removed,rivers until he gives you a reason to bench him
fantasyfootball,removed,think id go cousins and hope this week they play the nonyg albeit in different uniforms
fantasyfootball,removed,breezin to highest scoring game this week
fantasyfootball,removed,ugly options but dalton is the superior qb and should be in your lineup for that reason
fantasyfootball,removed,im not sitting rivers until he gives you a reason
fantasyfootball,removed,eli no brainer
fantasyfootball,removed,absolutely ryan he is likely qb in your league if you check scoring
fantasyfootball,removed,rivers until the rest of his receivers are out
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start jarvis landry against the browns secondary or that rising star fuller against the pats and will blount be a risky rb against the texans dline
fantasyfootball,removed,rivers in a shooter
fantasyfootball,removed,its too panicky but you should grab matty ice with a different roster scrub
fantasyfootball,removed,im thinking stafford outplays in this one
fantasyfootball,removed,rivers without question
fantasyfootball,removed,im targeting murray miller or crowell right now i got decimated with stewart freeman and gore sitting with arob edelman m wallce landry sharpe and d jackson right now the crowell owner has coleman and im looking to ditch freeman thinking of offering freeman and and a wr looking for help for crowell
fantasyfootball,removed,breezin to that win baby
fantasyfootball,removed,jordy nelson or demaryus thomas im trying to shop one of them for an rb
fantasyfootball,removed,depends on who you can net for scam obviously if he lights it up again and you can seduce a young playing lights out make the move otherwise ride the cheater
fantasyfootball,removed,i like palmer divisional games nygwas are so unpredictable
fantasyfootball,removed,dwill to a nonbell owner
fantasyfootball,removed,i have waiver priority in inverse of standings i have so many wrs but which rb should be targeted
fantasyfootball,removed,cobb and moncrief individually and together
fantasyfootball,removed,great program been using it almost years now i had grand ideas of a new dashboard for this year but time caught up with me so i havent had time to build anything if you are in a reporting capacity and are looking at tools like tableau to automate some of the workprovide better reporting i would also highly suggest checking out alteryx it is the single program i have used in my career that has saved the most amount of time and the others are not even close no more coding vba just drag and drop workflows to manipulate the data i used alteryx here to help because all i have is a bunch of excel tabs with web connections that i refresh obviously that format is not ideal and i have an each tab for receiving and so on i automated the cleanup process fairly quickly in alteryx and now all i need to do is jump in and hit play after refreshing the excel doc and it spits out an updated tde for my tableau dashboard
fantasyfootball,removed,deangelo williams specifically to bell owners
fantasyfootball,removed,parker available dropped by waiver guy before gameim number dont know thoughi already know someone below me will waiver him
fantasyfootball,removed,do i have to ask for a single guy trying to trade gio sanders or djax for and upgrade at either position
fantasyfootball,removed,i have a position this week and i could use a better wr desean jackson e sanders w snead tate watkins should i drop k white and pick up t williams
fantasyfootball,removed,dude dropped diggs last saturday blowing my for him
fantasyfootball,removed,chicago is notoriously crappy to its
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys do simms and fuller for zeke what if fuller was replaced for cobb i also have alf on the bench and pretty good wr depth
fantasyfootball,removed,jeremy langford
fantasyfootball,removed,eddie lacy
fantasyfootball,removed,freeman for gurley stupid i have coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys waste a waiver on derick henry i dont own demarco but i do own brandon marshall so quincy enunwa is also appealing to me
fantasyfootball,removed,is he a must start over crowell and baldwin snead im leaning towards crowell right now
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr looking to upgrade at wr or rb what would you give up for demaryius thomas or randall cobb packaged with arian foster or tj yeldon
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trade your travis benjamin and m sanu for arob ppr team
fantasyfootball,removed,should i do a trade for antonio brown i give up christian michaels eddie lacy and mike wallace
fantasyfootball,removed,melvin gordon for cj anderson im cj owner wanting gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,thinking about offering odell and an rb for this guys arob and forte in man standard should i do it
fantasyfootball,removed,i was thinking arob for gio and sharpe in my ppr team league not sure if hed bite
fantasyfootball,removed,allen robinson would you trade away edelman and r matthews for him
fantasyfootball,removed,in ppr what about offering mckinnon alshon to the peterson owner
fantasyfootball,removed,im debating selling robinson and dorset for crabtree and snead wish i had a fucking crystal ball to see how the rest of the season was going to go
fantasyfootball,removed,mckinnon or bernard ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,should i see if someone takes my riddick for their ingram
fantasyfootball,removed,ty and hyde for deandre hopkins
fantasyfootball,removed,im offering jarvis landry and will fuller for allen robinson thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,forte and crowell
fantasyfootball,removed,i just got offered will fuller for him good trade
fantasyfootball,removed,willie snead
fantasyfootball,removed,itt melvin gordon is the new flash gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,going to propose icrowellsanu for gurley wish me luck p
fantasyfootball,removed,does anyone think i could get gurley for mccoy or i guess the better question is should i do that
fantasyfootball,removed,just traded jeremy langlang and travis benjamin for mark ingram thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,perhaps im wrong but it seems like rb is your strong suit gurley crowell and riddick seem alright right now maybe try to trade dwill the insurance policy to the bell owner
fantasyfootball,removed,eh at least we dont have pussies like you in it
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah i got an offer for ingram for him thinking about jumping on it since i think ingram is a buy low
fantasyfootball,removed,got offered diggs for him im not sure what to do buy the hype or hope his situation will improve
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah it was when it was announced the guys in our league destroyed the dude i traded with lol
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got elliot miller forte and gordon needing a wr who should i look to trade and what should my expectations be
fantasyfootball,removed,charles sims some ros season value in and immediate value for those dealing with injuries and martin out
fantasyfootball,removed,i just traded away julian edelman and eric decker for deandre hopkins and tajae sharp i think he might have panicked because hes did i make a good trade
fantasyfootball,removed,youre my least favorite type of person
fantasyfootball,removed,got offered ingram for him think i should do it
fantasyfootball,removed,if its between those two i think you have to drop jones until you know what charles situation is going to be
fantasyfootball,removed,you should keep both you cant go a whole season with just rbs and you definitely dont need tes
fantasyfootball,removed,why wouldnt you drop fleener he hasnt warranted holding thus far
fantasyfootball,removed,aj green randal cobb
fantasyfootball,removed,deangelo ty hilton lamar miller for ryan matthews diggs and latavious would you do it im losing the first set of players and winning the second i have not accepted yet
fantasyfootball,removed,even if i got offered ingram for him
fantasyfootball,removed,i would keep ware
fantasyfootball,removed,which rbs for baldwin which wrs for crowell
fantasyfootball,removed,wouldnt waste a waiver on any of them
fantasyfootball,removed,mckinnon for a few weeks drake for a week
fantasyfootball,removed,diggs mccoy
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop rawls for nothing or
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard scoring im currently rostering gary barnidge as my te but will be dropping him due to cody kessler taking over with that heres are the top available tes in my ranked by total points scored for the season the ones im considering are starred thoughts on which one to pick up
fantasyfootball,removed,i got offered arob for my jstew and ty cant decide know arob is due but his sched isnt great
fantasyfootball,removed,nelson shepard jstew to a team that needs wr help could net you a good return maybe if any of them are
fantasyfootball,removed,not sure if im doing this right but i was offered isaiah crowell and corey coleman in exchange for josh gordon is that a good return
fantasyfootball,removed,i was offered lacy cobb for my hopkins my wr are hopkins robinson d thomas maclin sharpe my rbs mathews rawls jones coleman what would you do
fantasyfootball,removed,jordy nelson
fantasyfootball,removed,gio bernardtheo riddick tevin coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,jordy nelson
fantasyfootball,removed,would trading lacy filler for gurley be paying too much
fantasyfootball,removed,was offered latavius murray for alshon im really hurting at rb and have aj green kelvin travis benjamin sterling shepard and josh gordon at wr think its worth it for me
fantasyfootball,removed,diggs
fantasyfootball,removed,lamar miller standard
fantasyfootball,removed,offered jamaal charles for emmanuel samders and matt jones im thinking this is a no brainer and i add jamaal charles as my back to go alongside with doug martin and zeke ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,hopkins thinking about sending watkins and rawlsnot sure who wins
fantasyfootball,removed,thinking about offering the same cobb and ware for alshon jeffery would you do that
fantasyfootball,removed,thoughts on this trade doug martin desean jackson for arob
fantasyfootball,removed,arob for gurley in a ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trade crowell for coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,would brandin cooks one of gore j hill or j stewart be reasonable for gurley yahoo team standard scoring
fantasyfootball,removed,diggs
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard scoring im currently rostering gary barnidge as my te but will be dropping him due to cody kessler taking over with that heres are the in my league ranked by total points scored for the season the ones im considering are starred thoughts on which one to pick up
fantasyfootball,removed,can you read you fucking retard
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,just have to wait and see as an ap owner i think id do that trade
fantasyfootball,removed,so you get the overall draft pick in most leagues and a potential powerhouse in rawls for basically nothing are you playing with women or something
fantasyfootball,removed,im right here
fantasyfootball,removed,atzsdxxffxcxxttz
fantasyfootball,removed,you must be new here
fantasyfootball,removed,i thought the same thing until i just got offered kelvin benjamin for mccoy i have depth at rb too ingram blount jennings abdullah
fantasyfootball,removed,he didnt ask if you would accept the trade moron he asked if it was good for him the answer is a resounding yes
fantasyfootball,removed,wow goodwin is pure trash
fantasyfootball,removed,😞
fantasyfootball,removed,the trade will go through tuesday he gets the points tonight
fantasyfootball,removed,i have ww and devante parker was just dropped do i use it on him before he clears tomorrow or wait and pick up enunwa
fantasyfootball,removed,should i pick up quincy enunwa he seems to be the real deal should i drop kevin white for him i feel like white is a bust but i need second opinions please help
fantasyfootball,removed,trajae sharp or enunwa going foward
fantasyfootball,removed,will fuller tajae sharp or quincy enunwa on waivers
fantasyfootball,removed,welcome to seven years ago
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard scoring qb rivers winston rb david johnson demarco murray arian foster woodhead tevin coleman wr alshon jeffery ty hilton demaryious thomas golden tate diggs kevin white te coby fleener dst houston kicker josh brown
fantasyfootball,removed,in ive got deandre hopkins alshon and decker should i always start decker over alshon and alshon is my flex play this week i decided to flex langford over decker due to matchup and im hoping it doesnt come to bite me decker obviously has a ridiculous floor but i just feel like alshon has greater ceiling what do you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone drop eli rogers for inman
fantasyfootball,removed,i eat crow here but he still looked shitty not sure why the jets kept giving up the long throw was he
fantasyfootball,removed,i sat him for sterling shepard just please tell me everything is going to be okay
fantasyfootball,removed,i got arob for the spencer ware rental
fantasyfootball,removed,challenger shuttle cte slickers dhaquille a mocking bird sandy hook and ladder dicks out for harambe
fantasyfootball,removed,aps switch hitter i have a few pryors fuck my team is bad
fantasyfootball,removed,fuller over jackson or maclin
fantasyfootball,removed,hes floating on my ww but i dont know if i should drop someone for him i have sharp lockett gore and eifert should i just pass on fuller
fantasyfootball,removed,no one else bid thats where it would be example
fantasyfootball,removed,romo isnt worth the hold and ne rbs are such a crapshoot year to year id hold allen for now and cut bait later if a more appealing name gets injured
fantasyfootball,removed,wrong thread but i think so graham has shown next to no synergy since moving to the nw
fantasyfootball,removed,of course though wouldnt take that in his shoes hes getting draft value on gronk which is still less than a functioning ad you would need to sweeten a little further lockett or maybe crabs to have a shot imo
fantasyfootball,removed,i think its even value but id rather have decker higher floor vs higher ceiling
fantasyfootball,removed,fitz is playing lightsout right now and should have his way with the bucs defense this weekend if he goes you can get more than langford though if youre set on the chicago rb its a fair deal
fantasyfootball,removed,higher floor vs higher ceiling
fantasyfootball,removed,landry
fantasyfootball,removed,youre selling very cheap
fantasyfootball,removed,youd have to aim high in to make it worthwhile for you in a standard and i dunno if im giving up lamar or ad for rodgers if im holding them unless im a cheesehead homer what else do you have to work with
fantasyfootball,removed,no way dude
fantasyfootball,removed,yes huge upgrade
fantasyfootball,removed,do it quickly before he sobers up
fantasyfootball,removed,if im dealing ware youre not giving enough
fantasyfootball,removed,youre the league taco this is insultingly dumb
fantasyfootball,removed,nice upgrade
fantasyfootball,removed,me too
fantasyfootball,removed,well its a lesson that your league is cheap use the info for your next add
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont feel this favors you but if youre clearing room for waivers and trust lockett to do anything this season its a minor upgrade of floor i like dorsett more though as hilton seems to be made of glass
fantasyfootball,removed,in standard you could gamble hard and package murraywoodhead for gurleyjunk
fantasyfootball,removed,hurns but you can get more for ware right now
fantasyfootball,removed,take it
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt
fantasyfootball,removed,bigger risk to you but value is in your favor
fantasyfootball,removed,woodhead way too valuable in ppr imo think youre looking at hill gio rawls land at best
fantasyfootball,removed,youre on the losing end for me
fantasyfootball,removed,and overall the deal favors you
fantasyfootball,removed,crabs
fantasyfootball,removed,sitting sanders
fantasyfootball,removed,sitting morris
fantasyfootball,removed,riddick
fantasyfootball,removed,foster
fantasyfootball,removed,abdullah
fantasyfootball,removed,seconded
fantasyfootball,removed,sitting sanders
fantasyfootball,removed,rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,bucking the trend going theyll run plenty of hb sets without keenan woodhead will get his but is probably good for
fantasyfootball,removed,snead
fantasyfootball,removed,wallace for me
fantasyfootball,removed,hilton if he plays
fantasyfootball,removed,rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,jennings
fantasyfootball,removed,i love fuller i just dont know if i can start him very often i drafted green landry and tate in a wr flex ppr league so im playing those guys while they may not have the ceiling of fuller landry and tate will easily get at least points a game im having trouble passing up on those almost guaranteed numbers can someone explain to me if im dumb choosing landry and tate over fuller everytime
fantasyfootball,removed,i want to flex him over jennings and crabtree in ppr but i cant seem to pull the trigger
fantasyfootball,removed,ogletree for me
fantasyfootball,removed,what about a lacy gio return for him
fantasyfootball,removed,i have two leagues where im deciding to start him or marvin jones in the flex
fantasyfootball,removed,ive been feeling tempted to drop hurns for fuller is this a bad idea
fantasyfootball,removed,what kind of glitch yes commish can manipulate
fantasyfootball,removed,i despise veto system i wouldnt play in this league again in the future the veto should only be used for collusion
fantasyfootball,removed,keeper system im not too sure i like this good gamble on rogers he fits the steelers mold but its a couple of years before hes relevant coleman can usurp the job in atlanta and like you pointed out gore is old if youre playing to win this season and need gore for flex though there are certainly other better options its worth considering id pass personally
fantasyfootball,removed,gordon for coleman might be worth it
fantasyfootball,removed,damn now i have the tough call of yeldon or baldwinw wilson being however he is
fantasyfootball,removed,for more context and why i am wondering about this i traded cooks away last night and part of my reasoning to send him off was that i also have brees the other guy i was shopping was cooper would that have been something you would have used in your proscons to decide who to send away
fantasyfootball,removed,coleman over freeman as an owner of both fuck man can one of them just implode or something
fantasyfootball,removed,okay is it wrong that im wanting to start yeldon over lacy and d martin in my ppr league i know i need to start my studs but my thirst is really fucking real
fantasyfootball,removed,hmmm ivory is sat staring at me on the waiver cant decide whether its worth picking him up now and playing foster against ne this week or risking leaving him there and roll with yeldon against the soft chargers d
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone start yeldon over l murray or r jennings
fantasyfootball,removed,would it be crazy to put yeldon in my flex over shepard sharpe moncrief or williams and start j stew in my shepard is in my flex now and i know theyre playing the saints blah blah blah but in terms of volume and potential points would yeldon and j stew be the better play here
fantasyfootball,removed,so now yeldon or tate as my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,theyre probably even value i think id like to hold more
fantasyfootball,removed,you lose badly
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start yeldon over j stewart
fantasyfootball,removed,start yeldon over cobb floyd or t benjamin
fantasyfootball,removed,hes hurting literally everywhere but te you could offer him a qb upgrade you could offer him junkstore rb hyde value highest right now imo you could offer him junkstore wrs benjis
fantasyfootball,removed,this is ridiculously tilted in your favor two waiver adds for two starters why would you let your mom in your league
fantasyfootball,removed,i would but you actually might be able to tease slightly more for hyde right now his value will drop by monday so execute something before the game starts
fantasyfootball,removed,surprised hes not trying for more wforte hes definitely worth more right now with his projections i love amari but you should consider this
fantasyfootball,removed,no one will take this
fantasyfootball,removed,yeldon or hill is really killing me also have murray who i think i am going to play regardless
fantasyfootball,removed,dez has a higher ceiling i would value both about the same in todays trade market and the az dst should be to i would pull the trigger
fantasyfootball,removed,quit picking on your dad
fantasyfootball,removed,both are in your favor
fantasyfootball,removed,sold high on hyde but got lowballed on dez id prefer arob but relatively even trade value
fantasyfootball,removed,not in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,tilted in your favor but realistically none of these players will be a factor this season without something happening in front them
fantasyfootball,removed,si senior
fantasyfootball,removed,if i have miller im laughing at you and your record
fantasyfootball,removed,hmmm im debating picking out of the yeldon snead or e sanders
fantasyfootball,removed,yeldon over langford ware looked awesome last week and so did the philly d
fantasyfootball,removed,so in two flex league which two would you start yeldon foster tate leaning towards yeldon foster
fantasyfootball,removed,ware but there is a whis thread
fantasyfootball,removed,both have pretty rough matchups is asiata available still with aps issue i expect a matt forte like game from asiata top potential this week
fantasyfootball,removed,yeldon or foster as my in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,team in my league teams dropped ivory i put in a claim for him dropping duke i already have gio is this madness
fantasyfootball,removed,i think you can get dez for cheaper
fantasyfootball,removed,no one takes that trade
fantasyfootball,removed,higher floor vs higher ceiling
fantasyfootball,removed,could try to snag gurley or jc if the owner is unhappy with some kind of package i dont think maclin is at his peak market value youre looking at lmurray or dmurray straight swap or thereabouts
fantasyfootball,removed,wtf are you talking about that team is not projected this is a stealth brag thread
fantasyfootball,removed,sitting point marvin jones and sterling for yeldon because ivory isnt playing felt so wrong i need a support group for this kind of thing
fantasyfootball,removed,start eli also wdis thread thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,i think i would not play in your league you dont veto bad trades only collusion
fantasyfootball,removed,what is the priority set to in your rules take a look
fantasyfootball,removed,call me crazy but i have decided to start siemian over cousinsvsden this week
fantasyfootball,removed,so tempted to play a less than demaryius over the likes of cobb maclin and fuller
fantasyfootball,removed,maclin or diggs please help
fantasyfootball,removed,yeldon over gurley or freeman thinking i bench freeman but gurleys got a tough matchup
fantasyfootball,removed,yeldon or l blount
fantasyfootball,removed,would you play hurns or jones jr in your flex spot this weekend
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt gimp myself tyrell os most disposable unless youre playing standard ppr in which case drop the browns rb
fantasyfootball,removed,yup
fantasyfootball,removed,bye charizard is brown there im sour on cat
fantasyfootball,removed,should i eat pretzels or cheetos when watching football this weekend
fantasyfootball,removed,nope
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,youre playing with a dolt get both
fantasyfootball,removed,first year player
fantasyfootball,removed,absolutely
fantasyfootball,removed,jones for morris maybe
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,yeldon or sanders half ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,drop ertz both of those backs have trade appeal and solid upside
fantasyfootball,removed,id rather own white
fantasyfootball,removed,fuller
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,white
fantasyfootball,removed,sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,nah
fantasyfootball,removed,sure
fantasyfootball,removed,drop graham drop austin take both
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,who would you rather start langford or ryan mathews
fantasyfootball,removed,hamster gore
fantasyfootball,removed,lacy ameer
fantasyfootball,removed,doubt youll get a trade next week your is foster
fantasyfootball,removed,obviously you did post rfindaleague that you need a replacement
fantasyfootball,removed,trying to decide between the two murrays doug martin and jonathan stewart for spots ive been flip flopping on demarco and jstew for days you have jstew ranked the lowest of the would you mind weighing in on why a lot of people have him ranked high this week
fantasyfootball,removed,yes get sanders
fantasyfootball,removed,id look to swap mariota for someone else for that week gio is disposable in a league
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start sanu or travis benjamin
fantasyfootball,removed,i have agholor and cruz on my bench should i either for inman
fantasyfootball,removed,same thing happened to me but i can decide between marvin foster shepard and landry with forte killing it yesterday i want to roll the dice on shepard
fantasyfootball,removed,i like it though the hamster is at the end of his run i might be tempted to drop gio instead
fantasyfootball,removed,maybe carr
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt but bilal is a late season play at best
fantasyfootball,removed,only if they reset weekly
fantasyfootball,removed,drop ertzcolemanduke jr sure stash morris
fantasyfootball,removed,inman marginally more value
fantasyfootball,removed,hell turn this season still another year as lead dog but will be in decline does sims inherit the offense though
fantasyfootball,removed,makes the decision between ware and jeremy hill a little more difficult
fantasyfootball,removed,am i nuts to start dt and moncrief instead of mike evans with evans going up against peterson
fantasyfootball,removed,do you just hate maclin i dont like him much either and somehow have him on half of my teams i would be talking to the owners of the buylow candidates right now ad gurley jc mccoy ingram you wont get in a for but you might get a sense if anyone is disenchanted and ready to cut bait
fantasyfootball,removed,so do i run semien at qb instead of winston
fantasyfootball,removed,would you flex him over sneadriddickabdullah
fantasyfootball,removed,gore or maclin
fantasyfootball,removed,yesterday
fantasyfootball,removed,what if you own sanders and ty i considering starting ty and kelvin this week leaving sanders on my bench
fantasyfootball,removed,langford or demarco murray
fantasyfootball,removed,sanu or snead for flex
fantasyfootball,removed,diggs out for dt
fantasyfootball,removed,all minutes count this is idiotic to not count yds bc thewy were garbage time garbage time happens in every damn game why dont you remove those lucky gains to and those unlucky gains as well like i dont get how anyone can take this seriously stupid as shit
fantasyfootball,removed,im trying to decide if i should start sanu over tate this week or i can put him in my flex instead of latavius
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt rush on this one trade favors you but you dont know what you have in fuller and gates if he can stay healthy will be a stud
fantasyfootball,removed,probably not
fantasyfootball,removed,i feel this favors you
fantasyfootball,removed,id hold pat
fantasyfootball,removed,i actually think you can get gurley cheaper but id probably take this
fantasyfootball,removed,feels like you win
fantasyfootball,removed,your advice was still terrible you really are retarded arent you because no one said it was yours fucking dumb ass no wonder all you make are shit posts
fantasyfootball,removed,hes selling zeke very cheap
fantasyfootball,removed,take it
fantasyfootball,removed,no brainer
fantasyfootball,removed,both are trash would prefer jones if i had to choose one
fantasyfootball,removed,gurleys stock has tumbled you should be able to get him for less
fantasyfootball,removed,not even close
fantasyfootball,removed,cj side wins handily
fantasyfootball,removed,playing with your dad
fantasyfootball,removed,playing with your dad
fantasyfootball,removed,obviously yes
fantasyfootball,removed,fair trade id prefer to have hilton personally
fantasyfootball,removed,a foster ne or crowell vs bal
fantasyfootball,removed,heres a deep qb add question background inherited a team in a league relatively deep bench but also full idp roster relatively decent bench but he drafted and its quite possibly the worst starter in the pros case keenan trying to fix via trade but not shortselling rest of team for some trash any you guys feel especially bullish on later in the season the usual backup suspects are gone seeing lynch geno vick ej anything here have any potential
fantasyfootball,removed,hold
fantasyfootball,removed,sanu or ebron at flex
fantasyfootball,removed,what do yall think if hes out tajae sharp fleener or mike wallace theyve all got pretty sweet matchups
fantasyfootball,removed,sure

fantasyfootball,removed,i am one with the kirk and the kirk is with me
fantasyfootball,removed,kirk in fear of dak being pulled in the second half
fantasyfootball,removed,kirk the chiwas over under is trending up and the skins are only a slight favorite could be a sneaky shootout
fantasyfootball,removed,im talking about his floor as a projection christ youre dull
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck chris ivory i almost put him in for miller when he went down

fantasyfootball,removed,thomas owner put him on the trade block would it be worth trying to get a deal for him
fantasyfootball,removed,sorry if im asking you too many questions but i just wanted to get your opinion on my situation i did zerorbs drafting by accident and ended up with rawls duke johnson and bilal i dropped bilal for for ware as soon as i could we do get return points too heres the thing were only allowed to roster rbs on our team so we basically have no depth there what would you do would you hang on to duke or drop him for sims ive been hearing good things about sims from other places too but i need someone i can play every week if my tajae sharpe of josh gordon dont pan out thanks again
fantasyfootball,removed,i have both c mike and foster on my squad currently starting foster over mike but idk anymore
fantasyfootball,removed,bortles or tyrod
fantasyfootball,removed,received a brandin cooks for rawls offer would you take it
fantasyfootball,removed,rodgers or carr
fantasyfootball,removed,would you go sims or jordan matthews as a flex standard
fantasyfootball,removed,question regarding rbs i have charles sims doug martin spencer ware and todd gurley which of those three should i start for this week
fantasyfootball,removed,rawls or coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,its a high floor low ceiling play for example playing marshall and decker on the same team you can be confident youll get about touchdowns from your wr position the negative is that more than likely you wont get a big game from both players
fantasyfootball,removed,athleticism httpswwwplayerprofilercomnflantoniobrown when it httpswwwplayerprofilercomnfldeandrehopkins to it just doesnt i mean it does but not a whole lot weight is more predictive of future success and college market share is a lot more predictive this is another area in which httpswwwplayerprofilercomnfltyhilton shines with his percentile dominator rating and percentile breakout age in a league where every single cornerback runs a forty moncriefs exceptional athleticism guarantees you exactly dick especially when hes lining up across from a historically productive dynamo who has been lucks every season of their careers in that graphic you posted moncrief narrowly edges ty in fewer targets and that number is buoyed by a touchdown rate that is probably not sustainable of his came in games with luck last season andre johnson was not a red zone height guy for them and coby fleeners replacement was number two on that list its certainly possible dont get me wrong moncrief will probably have a fine season but the op asked which one will finish with more points and theres only one notinsane answer to that question
fantasyfootball,removed,get everyone to send your commish trade offers offer your kicker for their top player drives em nuts every time its a good way to shut up loud mouths in the league to

fantasyfootball,removed,httpimgurcomawpbxc
fantasyfootball,removed,so now that i have all who the hell do i start
fantasyfootball,removed,i was planning to start wareshould i pick up west and start him instead
fantasyfootball,removed,is dan bailey a better player to hold over justin tucker
fantasyfootball,removed,crosby worth hanging on to to see how things play out or drop him for boswell
fantasyfootball,removed,wheres that little fuck from yesterday who was saying west was trash and ware was god and anybody who thinks ware wont get carries this week is a bitch
fantasyfootball,removed,well shitdo i start ware or jennings
fantasyfootball,removed,would u guys grab west as a jc owner that missed on ware
fantasyfootball,removed,looks like i will be dropping powell for west then
fantasyfootball,removed,httpimgurcomaxsmwh
fantasyfootball,removed,drop catanzaro for him
fantasyfootball,removed,mcmanus on walsh think my matchup could be close and dont want to fuck up on the kicker
fantasyfootball,removed,i have gano but im seriously thinking about swapping him out for santos am i crazy uphoecesbrown

fantasyfootball,removed,private league
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,can someone post the match ups here im at work
fantasyfootball,removed,its private
fantasyfootball,removed,santos or mcmanus both are avail leaning towards santos

fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,private league
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,private league
fantasyfootball,removed,so we thinkin cairo santos or boswell
fantasyfootball,removed,private league
fantasyfootball,removed,private league
fantasyfootball,removed,i currently own crosby is it worth dropping him for mcmanus
fantasyfootball,removed,httpimgurcomaevghb
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,mcmanus is available pick him over crosby
fantasyfootball,removed,vinatieri walsh and boswell all sit on my waiver how would you rank those for the season i have bell and brown already which makes me reluctant to take boswell too thanks for your hard work
fantasyfootball,removed,i have justin tucker but mcmanus is available on the wire should i pick him up
fantasyfootball,removed,do i pick up martellus if i have gronky
fantasyfootball,removed,i have catanzaro but hauschka is still available yahoo rankings are weird should i just switch kickers dont think it matters but i dont have any cardinals but do have wilson and the seahawks d
fantasyfootball,removed,i have both mathews and sproles this would further complicate my life but id be okay with having two in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,tucker as in justin tucker the kicker who averages points a game bc baltimore cant do anything in the red zone why wasnt he drafted
fantasyfootball,removed,tucker but i might be biased
fantasyfootball,removed,i mean jennings is a starter gio is great in ppr and fits magic well i dont like him peterson is on the wrong side of so i wouldnt be against it
fantasyfootball,removed,i have the same dilemma and i decided to bench kelvin i just dont like everything against him the snap count denver def cam not looking too sharp i think its worth benching him for the week
fantasyfootball,removed,every trade is a fair trade if there is no collusion involved if two willing owners agree to a trade regardless of whether the rest of the league thinks its fair the trade should stand if you cant find evidence of foul play this is a completely legitimate trade
fantasyfootball,removed,incredibly one sided imo fitz is a waiver qb jennings a and go am a nickel dime and quarter for a dollar why would anyone do this
fantasyfootball,removed,what do both rosters look like now
fantasyfootball,removed,hell no players added together do not make up position
fantasyfootball,removed,let it go through fitz could have a good year and jennings bernard gives them rb depth ap is great but hes one player who could get injured at any time its a risky move but you never know i absolutely hate when other owners bitch and veto trades
fantasyfootball,removed,id say its bullshit its the same as giving up a rd and a round pick not sure where fitz would go in for a top pick its too unreasonable and i doubt aps owner doesnt have a rb better than jennings
fantasyfootball,removed,i would never give up my first pick for that but depending on his roster this still is serviceable gio is a better ppr running back than ap
fantasyfootball,removed,i have carpenter should i swap for mcmanus
fantasyfootball,removed,stick your daily thread up ur ass
fantasyfootball,removed,start dwayne allen over gronk tina belcher ehhhhhhhhhhhhhh
fantasyfootball,removed,santos or catman az
fantasyfootball,removed,i have catanzaro but santos boswell are still available should i drop him for one of them
fantasyfootball,removed,you must be the commish they are talking about you have as much class as our politicians have you ever thought of running for the us senate you would fit right in my only question is whether you are a republican or democrat
fantasyfootball,removed,op should i drop catanzaro for bailey a dude dropped bailey in my league
fantasyfootball,removed,drop blair walsh for vinatieri
fantasyfootball,removed,mcmanus or boswell just for this week i would think boswell has the better floor and comparable upside
fantasyfootball,removed,witten ebron or v mcdonald as backup leaning witten but worried hell spend a lot of his time blocking for the new qb
fantasyfootball,removed,so based on this i should drop walsh and plug in santos
fantasyfootball,removed,would you keep tucker or drop him for boswell
fantasyfootball,removed,should i trade gronk and duke johnson for adrian peterson ppr man league i think id prefer to have ap on my roster but im worried that i wont be able to secure a solid tight end i have martellus bennet jared cook and eifert on still on fa and so is eric ebron richard rodgers vance mcdonald and clive walford thoughts id appreciate it
fantasyfootball,removed,in light of this news who would you guys start having martellus bennet or jason witten witten has a great history against the giants so im leaning old man witt thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,man it is so hard to keep marvin jones on the bench but obj demaryius and cooks have to start over him right
fantasyfootball,removed,love the post really appreciate the rare kicker advice man would you drop catman az for boswell
fantasyfootball,removed,dwayne allen is on my waiver wire would anyone pick play him this week
fantasyfootball,removed,do i drop blair walsh for matt bryant
fantasyfootball,removed,im in a dilemma right now i may take you up on this i have ap deanglo williams c mike as my rb game right now my is ap is deanglo flex is c mike i also have tyler lockette so im torn between lockette c mike i have some time to figure it out but i dont think ill make any progress
fantasyfootball,removed,shit should i start zach ertz over gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,witten or julius thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,do i go with antonio gates or martellus bennett
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks i was thinking the same thing would you rather add mcmanus or santos over boswell though they are also on waivers somehow
fantasyfootball,removed,witten or this mysterious gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,dont know where else to post thistorn right now debating on which wr to start willie snead steffon diggs kelvin benjamin or emmanuel sanders plz help me reddit world
fantasyfootball,removed,well i appreciate it i may take you up on that advice im torn right now
fantasyfootball,removed,you should rape your league to be honest this team would be good in a man
fantasyfootball,removed,espn team ppr pick qb rivers carr rb d johnson bell gordon foster dwill morris wr k allen landry hurns gordon te gates dst streaming k crosbystreaming
fantasyfootball,removed,gates or jt leaning more towards gates but i hate the matchup against the chiefs
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start him or marvin jones this week in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,im worried about him in week also im thinking about putting torrey smith in for him instead
fantasyfootball,removed,really struggling with this as well i have gio sims abdullah and cmike as alternative options
fantasyfootball,removed,i have jt vs gb and d allen vs det debating on which to start i feel like jt has higher ceiling but d allen will be lucks safety net with fleener out of indy this year im hoping jt can become the te the jags are paying him to be
fantasyfootball,removed,gates or thomas on sundayfuck
fantasyfootball,removed,my flex options are matt jones markus wheaton and julius thomas so this is telling me i should be starting jt at the flex what do you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,stuck on gates vs thomas forever leaning towards gates though anyone else in this dilemma
fantasyfootball,removed,awesome i appreciate it just for reference sake wrs ended up deep bench league cobb edelmann crabtree m jones tajae sharpe will fuller hoping cobb edelmanjones are consistent enough and will hope for high upside for my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,if he doesnt suit up barnidge or bennett
fantasyfootball,removed,clive walford
fantasyfootball,removed,clive walford no
fantasyfootball,removed,it was me unfortunately my source is no longer apart of the chiefs organization
fantasyfootball,removed,hell be fine not even a question in my mind to start him over dt
fantasyfootball,removed,i traded watkinssproles for dez this preseason feel great about dez with prescott and even if its bad romo is on pace to be back by the playoffs
fantasyfootball,removed,so should i bench zack miller for julius thomas team standard
fantasyfootball,removed,my j charleskendall wright for his d moncriefj langford ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,do not take it unless you doubt gronk can stay healthy
fantasyfootball,removed,this should have been posted in the trade thread but i would do the trade gronk though slightly injured is the te in the league ppr or not and hes one of bradys favorite targets golden tate is now the in detroit with calvin johnson having retired over the offseason do it up
fantasyfootball,removed,getkeep gronk and tate lions will be a passing juggernaut this year with tate as the gronk is gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,well my team name is still yes we cam from last year so i would love to get cam newton back on the roster this year ive never done a trade so i dont know who i would trade for him my current qb wilson
fantasyfootball,removed,thoughts on thomas vs walford vs allen for week cant decide
fantasyfootball,removed,i have tj yeldon too and i have doug martin already in
fantasyfootball,removed,youre a fucking asshole
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah you should be posting this to the wdis rb thread personally id go with langford
fantasyfootball,removed,julius or delanie week
fantasyfootball,removed,forsett is my rb should i drop him for lynch
fantasyfootball,removed,soooo im gonna drop alfred morris in my team league
fantasyfootball,removed,drop dion lewis for lynch
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start hurns over him in a standard league
fantasyfootball,removed,dropped josh lambo backup kicker for marshawn now this could be a fun hype train
fantasyfootball,removed,drop sharpe for lynch
fantasyfootball,removed,ok thanks for the tip starting keenan allen and allen hurns
fantasyfootball,removed,keenan allen allen hurns corey coleman and kevin white gonna start allen and hurns
fantasyfootball,removed,gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,last second cam start over stafford yn
fantasyfootball,removed,soshould i drop corey coleman for this guy or what
fantasyfootball,removed,one league i have eifert te another league i have sharpe and henry as fliers on the bench drop any of these guys and take lynch just in case
fantasyfootball,removed,a guy in my league sent me a trade request his vincent jackson for my thomas rawls should i make this trade
fantasyfootball,removed,should i pick him up
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks parcells when he gets a deal from a qbneedy team in march i want you to think back to this moment and say you know what maybe i really am an idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah well in my current situation i have brady den or eli vdet and yes my opponent has obj so given bradys tough matchup im leaning toward eli
fantasyfootball,removed,i genuinely cant decide between eli and brady den so thats my issue here
fantasyfootball,removed,none because im not a fucking retard like the rest of this sub
fantasyfootball,removed,worst part is youre crying about having a league member who is grinding it out till the end even if he can only place last he can still screw other people fairly stop pissing and moaning and deal with the fact that you screwed up and didnt carry your handcuff your buddy has done nothing wrong you did youre crying about not owning your fortes handcuff nothing to see here folks
fantasyfootball,removed,youre not being an asshole the op is being a bitch and is pissed he didnt keep his handcuff
fantasyfootball,removed,read the ops comment replies he plainly states that he is a forte owner and thinks its unfair someone who isnt in the playoffs can pick up powell when he isnt in contention for the crown
fantasyfootball,removed,good point it definitely feels a little greedyoptimistic to expect them both to produce big numbers
fantasyfootball,removed,the fact that its against cle is the only reason i think its a possibility to start both i think its brave but not insane good luck
fantasyfootball,removed,i have shady hyde and gilli i think i am going to start crowder over gilli as my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,youre a pussy theres nothing wrong with your league except youre a crybaby
fantasyfootball,removed,interesting would you flex him over crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,so would you play white riddick tyreke hill or rashad jennings need of the in a ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,i have taylor gabriel or reed for flex lucky to have eifert at te who do i start
fantasyfootball,removed,maybe hes just dressed up as a leopard so he can camoflauge better
fantasyfootball,removed,stewart and farrow
fantasyfootball,removed,this kills the
fantasyfootball,removed,after having lost adrian peterson melvin gordon donte moncrief matt forte giovani bernard phillip dorsett charles sims tj yeldon john brown ty montgomery cj fiedorowicz allen hurns kelvin benjamin ryan mathews christine michael at various points in the season due to injuries and player performance fuckups please fantasy football gods no more i know im riding on leveon bell but are you really going to force me to win on the strength of him alone all hail leveon bell
fantasyfootball,removed,nigga what took so long lol i wait on these though thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,id think either cobbty are better shots than him at flex
fantasyfootball,removed,felt like he got a low floor due to ben away in potential snow green is a good player but its up to how well ben plays to get him points might be another leveon bell show though im still starting green over gates but only becauseim hoping for a boom my opponent team is too good
fantasyfootball,removed,hey im just saying the dude hasnt topped yards in his past games and his targets have dropped dramatically totalling in those past games those stats worry me and they should worry anyone who has him on his team calling cooper for powell a bad trade with those stats i listed up there can only rationalize that people are putting to much value on his name and not enough value on his performance
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt feel comfortable with either tbh but what am i gonna do trot put crapernick or tygod
fantasyfootball,removed,theres a trade thread for this post but yeah you should do that
fantasyfootball,removed,dez for those two take it and run
fantasyfootball,removed,dude yes
fantasyfootball,removed,i have pick would anyone consider using their round pick to keep shady im considering it now
fantasyfootball,removed,rip harambe
fantasyfootball,removed,rip harambe
fantasyfootball,removed,green and ap are your best players but please elaborate on the keeper rules
fantasyfootball,removed,i like matthews outta that bunch gonna be keeping my eyes on that kid behind obj as well
fantasyfootball,removed,brown for consistency involvement in passing offense and power of offense
fantasyfootball,removed,ulividlysane
fantasyfootball,removed,ulividlysane
fantasyfootball,removed,any signs of slowing down from ap i have pick and hes my number five currently
fantasyfootball,removed,i have to choose between keeping palmer or lewis in both cases i would give up a round pick advice anyone
fantasyfootball,removed,bell is obviously one and i dont think you can go wrong with dez or arob although i would go with arob no recent injuries and is coming off of a great year opposite for dez
fantasyfootball,removed,id go bell and arob im in the same situation but with rawls gurley arob evans a jeffrey leaning toward gurley arob
fantasyfootball,removed,i can keep him for my round picklast roundi do that right
fantasyfootball,removed,good job forrest that was intelligent
fantasyfootball,removed,maybe your hunt for hypocrisy is you hating your own shitty character trait enough to project it onto me i mean it usually is
fantasyfootball,removed,spotted the year old people are going to disagree with you dumbass thats life
fantasyfootball,removed,who would you guys pick in a keeper league devonte freeman todd gurley antonio brown or andrew luck
fantasyfootball,removed,these fuckin rotoworld blurbs that are just a local writers opinion are so misleading they should be banned mods need to do something to indicate that cj prosise is in fact not the favorite to lead touches this week by anyone within the seahawks coaching staff rather he is simply the favorite of random immigrant sheil kapadia to lead touches this week
fantasyfootball,removed,i hope he comes back strong with a big load
fantasyfootball,removed,and what pray tell is the reason for this premature excellence
fantasyfootball,removed,dolphins for sure
fantasyfootball,removed,most people probably just use qotds weekly ranking to determine who to start i were hoping to use dolphins myself but they were picked off on waivers before i could get to them so if they are available use them
fantasyfootball,removed,i have no idea what to do one week hes great and the next hes awful based on the last few matchups carolina has been great at stopping the run i know this isnt the place for this but any help here would be appreciated my team is stocked with players who are hit or miss and i need to win to even think of making the playoffs im currently determining which to start from this group in a ppr thomas rawls vs philadelphia robert kelley vs green bay isaiah crowell vs pittsburgh mark ingram at carolina rishard matthews at indianapolis
fantasyfootball,removed,moncrief or tyrell williams for the playoffs
fantasyfootball,removed,just to add to the situation he has a picture of a topless woman looks like a cheerleadermodel in case that gives you any ideas
fantasyfootball,removed,standard m bennett sf r cobb wash j reed vs gb j crowder vs gb
fantasyfootball,removed,if crowell hits yards ill eat a spoon
fantasyfootball,removed,deandre hopkins or woods this week
fantasyfootball,removed,woods or eli rogers this week this fun decision brought to you by julios bye week
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start him over marvin jones this week in point ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,cj until dl has a big game
fantasyfootball,removed,i think prosise has this week of strong flex relevancy and then become a lesser gio std scoring from here on out w a healthy rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,the answer this week is prosise
fantasyfootball,removed,as the rawls owner i dropped lewis to pick up prosise this week
fantasyfootball,removed,i had to make this decision this week and went with cjp i had both last week but had to keep only one this week due to byes and the one i kept i had to start so my decision was made almost solely on who i prefer this week the more news coming out though on both sides i think cjp is the better option both this week and ros
fantasyfootball,removed,i hope he comes back strong
fantasyfootball,removed,as an ingram owner i have no idea what to do
fantasyfootball,removed,i am thinking about starting eli rogers over himbut i cant justify myself to do it
fantasyfootball,removed,op pls answer
fantasyfootball,removed,i know you said only julius thomas is available but did you check fedora and ladarius green both extremely low ownership
fantasyfootball,removed,ladarius green
fantasyfootball,removed,julius isnt that bad of a play this week detroit gets lit up by tes and he is a big rz target also had targets last week any other week i would shy away from him but this is as good a matchup you could hope for
fantasyfootball,removed,close your eyes as you put fleener as your starting te then watch sadly
fantasyfootball,removed,either that or see if you can throw a quick trade in for someone you never know if gronk may be out more than a week
fantasyfootball,removed,aha i would drop fleener for julius julius has tds in the last weeks and coming off a target week fleener too much of a question mark with the way brees spreads the ball around
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trade ingram for edelman
fantasyfootball,removed,i need help im in a two qb league and trying to decide between these qbs brady sf brees car newton vs no i really want to start brady since hes playing his first game in his home town so i kinda locked him in the lineup but i cant decide between brees or newton help
fantasyfootball,removed,driving home from work today i was looking for signs if i should start mark ingram all the experts are saying sit of the week but they have been waaaay wrong before the second i get home a lady bug flys and lands on my windshield ladybugs are believed to bring good luck and it was the sign i needed i predict ingram has a night with the following stat line rush yards receiving td this will be good for points in ppr a solid number start with confidence and thank me later

fantasyfootball,removed,use the index threads to post for advice on trades id take murray though
fantasyfootball,removed,pick ppr benji vs no crab vs hou snead vs car britt vs mia eli vs cle
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont want to make this post about my specific team but the guy id be dropping is dixon
fantasyfootball,removed,i would say mine is semi competitive so im deciding between dion coates and hogan with the pick of resetting waivers
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got arob marvin crab maclin and wallace
fantasyfootball,removed,so you would spend your lotto ticket on lewis given the opportunity with only lotto ticket
fantasyfootball,removed,got gurley martin charlesware and christine michael trying to trade one of those with a guy like c mike for a high end
fantasyfootball,removed,question for you since i dont get to find much info on and nobody really knows too much on it my rbs are howard coleman mckinnon west wrs are arob landry sanders and jeffrey there is a way trade on the table where i give up howard and jeffrey and in return i get crowell and cj anderson i have no clue what to do it seems like a good deal but maybe im just being a pansy appreciate the info and i know there is a trade thread but nobody answers my questions interesting to see though how the rbs are doing though
fantasyfootball,removed,uhg palmer or carr nyj have worse passing defense in the league but palmer has been shitting the bed so bad
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck i wish my league would drop players like him im in a team league yet somehow there is nothing on the waiver wire
fantasyfootball,removed,youre going to catch some shit for not posting this in a trade thread but i take this deal if im you murray has been great but i dont know that his production is sustainable same with cmike especially whenif rawls gets back and obviously brown is an upgrade over robinson
fantasyfootball,removed,take the deal
fantasyfootball,removed,who is the most valuable healthy handcuff stash booker morris henry
fantasyfootball,removed,so for those of us with wentz and bortles who are we rolling with this week
fantasyfootball,removed,i would go michael for sure he is the main guy in seattle and has earned that job i think coming off their bye week they are going to be rested and prepared i think this is the time of the year where seattle does what seattle does best which is to rape and pillage
fantasyfootball,removed,i spent on stewart and the next highest was im okay with it but i hope he pans out
fantasyfootball,removed,deangelo williams was dropped in my league for coates any reason i shouldnt make a move to get williams im completely flush with wrs now and would need to drop d jax or enunwa to get williams
fantasyfootball,removed,is he a better bench stash than corey coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,bortles or hoyer for the next games i cant really keep
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start cam over brian hoyer i think cams got the slightly better matchup vs the saints hoyer has jags but hoyer has just been playing way better than cam lately leaning towards hoyer right now honestly what do
fantasyfootball,removed,definitely a brace or a wrap on that left ankle
fantasyfootball,removed,im in a man ppr league with only bench should i drop matt jones for merideth rbs are miller michaels and mathews wrs are a robinson landry and t benjamin
fantasyfootball,removed,enunwa just got dropped in my league should i grab him his starts over the past couple of games dont look impressive was that fitzs fault
fantasyfootball,removed,would you rather hold decker or sammy in ir can they back date his ir since he hast played like in baseball
fantasyfootball,removed,i would i be too crazy to drop fuller for him
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt but i would add stewart somehow
fantasyfootball,removed,start alex smith this week over him
fantasyfootball,removed,moncrief is available in my league on the wire should i grab him and hold on to him i havent heard any recent updates on his injury status
fantasyfootball,removed,drop decker placed on ir this morning
fantasyfootball,removed,drop decker if you have decker and then trade an rb for a wr
fantasyfootball,removed,i got an offer of matt ryan and jordy nelson for todd gurley before week i went rb heavy in the draft i talked him into palmer with me adding sterling shepard i know nobody cares about your fantasy but goddamn that shit is haunting me lol
fantasyfootball,removed,just put in a trade for gio after reading this hopefully the owner doesnt check and just accepts maclin for gio im stacked at wr my others are crabtree j brown marvin hopkins robinson ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,so hill is droppable
fantasyfootball,removed,freeman vs seattle mathews vs wash charles vs oak miller vs ind pick
fantasyfootball,removed,freeman vs seattle mathews vs wash
fantasyfootball,removed,im debating whether i should drop cameron brate this week and pick up either jesse james or dennis pitta its a ppr league who do you like best ros i also have fleener
fantasyfootball,removed,have been struggling to decide between pitta and james for about a week now james is back on the wire have played pitta for weeks now pitta gets targets but not once in the rz james has tons of gl targets but doesnt get the same volume otoh pittas targets arent rock solid
fantasyfootball,removed,lol what makes you so sure ryan will regress he was relatively successful against the most dominant d in the league im not saying he for sure wont but this post makes no sense
fantasyfootball,removed,with decker going to ir im looking to stash someone should i pick up rawls moncrief or dion lewis standard scoring
fantasyfootball,removed,id go with stafford matt ryan tends to be complete garbage late in the season
fantasyfootball,removed,i gotta pick either crowder or hogan thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,drop miller for james apparently jax is good at limiting tes
fantasyfootball,removed,if its actually a bone bruise as they say i dont understand everyones desire to keep him out for more weeks if hes moving fine in practice theres really no reason to hold him out
fantasyfootball,removed,better than either of your qbs
fantasyfootball,removed,hes the scoring player in fantasy you need to roster him his hardest matchup denver is over with he looked great all things considered you should be very happy to get him
fantasyfootball,removed,really excited to help you out on this one just start both of them
fantasyfootball,removed,i just dropped rivers for ryan looking at his schedule after the seahawks im on board for the roller coaster ride matt ryan will take me through this season
fantasyfootball,removed,my waivers clear at central time on everyday of the week except tuesdays its the time frame we voted on a few notes this means that inactives are officially announced a half hour before waivers clear on sunday which is a huge help to owners also we have a dayof addon so a team can pick up a player after waivers clear if that player is playing later that day waivers have cleared you have the roster room and you got the faab so you have michael floyd playing monday night and you find out that he is inactive then you can message the commish me and request a dayof addon for john brown to replace floyd i will remove floyd from your team add brown leave him on your bench at which point its up to you to plug him in and remove from your faab which is of total faab on the year
fantasyfootball,removed,trade one of em for a top notch wr man
fantasyfootball,removed,crowell or foster halllp
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,booker or james white from ne
fantasyfootball,removed,freeman
fantasyfootball,removed,freeman and its not close
fantasyfootball,removed,by end of season easily ingram hes had back to back games in ppr even with the vulturing he isnt in a rbbc so by nature of his lead back role he should outscore him ros if healthy playing against the falcons panthers and bucs again is nice too
fantasyfootball,removed,i assume this thread is full of jc owners would you trade him for marvin jones if you were weak at wr and also have dj
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,great moments in fantasy football history sunday december reddit
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop rashad jennings for booker
fantasyfootball,removed,drop reshad jennings for booker
fantasyfootball,removed,in a ppr league who is the better pickup v davis or p garcon
fantasyfootball,removed,as a reed owner i just grabbed niles paul off of free agency not worth the risk of missing out on him when this news becomes big reed has too much of a history with concussions for me to expect the best here
fantasyfootball,removed,if you have the option to pick up any of the who do you go with ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,crowder over garcon
fantasyfootball,removed,crowder over garcon
fantasyfootball,removed,crazy to trade him away for theo riddick
fantasyfootball,removed,would vernen davis be a good pick up then i also have hunter henry doyle and clay available in my league
fantasyfootball,removed,i have demarcojhowardjcharleslmurray if that helps i guess i should wait and see how jennings does thank you for replying
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard rank these three potential trades in order of best deal for me to worst id give m bennett d parker for d baldwin id give m bennett d parker for m jones id give m bennett d parker for b cooks or if any of these are unfair to the other player i could do bennett parker and crowder for one of them i need a decent wr pretty badly
fantasyfootball,removed,start him over ryan mathews this week half point ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,i own both jeffrey and meredith and dont really want to start them both i dont want to bench alshon but i get the same feeling that you do that its becoming a similar situation as johnson in which will make for a rough ros for jeffrey owners
fantasyfootball,removed,dixon or grab booker
fantasyfootball,removed,its paying melvin too much
fantasyfootball,removed,trade cj anderson and mike wallace receive eddie lacy and emmanuel sanders the guy already has odb abrown and fitz so he doesnt really need sanders and im trying to sell high on anderson thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,red alert really
fantasyfootball,removed,siemian is on waivers which of those three would you start
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trade reed for rudolph guy just sent me the offer im guessing to try and buylow although rudolph has been solid so not sure if this is low haha i really really like his and bradfords connection though and their schedule honestly seems great i also have ertz so i am not worried about his bye this week and can just swap him and ertz out on matchups i had reed last year and dont want another situation like that but i am not sure if reed for rudolph is solid or not need a bit of advice
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trade reed for rudolph guy just sent me the offer im guessing to try and buylow although rudolph has been solid so not sure if this is low haha i really really like his and bradfords connection though and their schedule honestly seems great i also have ertz so i am not worried about his bye this week and can just swap him and ertz out on matchups i had reed last year and dont want another situation like that but i am not sure if reed for rudolph is solid or not need a bit of advice
fantasyfootball,removed,dont drop pryor i feel like it will be pryor and the possession guy and coleman as the deep threat they will each have different games based on match up probably
fantasyfootball,removed,pryor actually has put up a decent body of work despite qb situation right now coleman only has one good week personally i like pryor in ppr as hes just such a big target
fantasyfootball,removed,im genuinely considering getting rid of carlos hyde for mike evans
fantasyfootball,removed,for example i traded my cobb for his dez in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,i was thinking of trying to trade my blount for doug martin
fantasyfootball,removed,id do that all day long
fantasyfootball,removed,run or so mock drafts look for players in the and round you would be comfortable starting if you can draft startable rbs late then get good word early and vice versa worked for me always make the playoffs
fantasyfootball,removed,question then would yall pick ap over gurley
fantasyfootball,removed,nah a player not too bad how many teams
fantasyfootball,removed,team league that i manage we determine draft picks randomly using a website but i do a weeklyish until the season begins newsletter where i try to show off some writing ability i think my favorite thing that we do differently is using google forms to survey the league and figure out what everyone wants to do were on the verge of adding performance bonus for qbs and i was hoping to move up to members but currently the stats arent going my way on that i also know that people want to get together for the draft and i have options for days in which to have the draft this year were doing slotted keepers so a couple people have rbs in the round david johnson and thomas rawls projected but i dont actually know that until the draft its going to be exciting
fantasyfootball,removed,if you dont pay attention to strength of schedule youre dumb now go ahead and write a paragraph rebuttal on how smart you are
fantasyfootball,removed,a
fantasyfootball,removed,no the answer is antonio brown
fantasyfootball,removed,ab ab ab ab
fantasyfootball,removed,antonio brown pick no question if you feel obj or julio is better you can do that but have a real reason there will be a solid rb around for your pick
fantasyfootball,removed,do an auction instead
fantasyfootball,removed,no question david johnson
fantasyfootball,removed,its called an auction jackass man why dont you step get out of the kiddie pool
fantasyfootball,removed,id go david johnson hes the main back on a pretty good offense and he catches the ball out of the backfield as well as anyone thats just my ¢
fantasyfootball,removed,im taking gurley there of the players you list i go hopkins
fantasyfootball,removed,talent scarcity difference between and team leaguse is pretty big so make sure you study lesser known names with upside and of course go much more wr heavy than you normally would throughout the season be mindful and much more aggressive of the waiver since the talent pool there will also be very shallow
fantasyfootball,removed,i have you tagged as pedantic asshole and noticed you likely downvoted the other positive replies basically youre a cunt i dont want your feedback boy
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah started at preseason and ended up doing very well
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,you must be new
fantasyfootball,removed,what does this do to wes welkers value
fantasyfootball,removed,id rather get cheaper better looking strippers for my draft but thats just me
fantasyfootball,removed,please consider licking my balls
fantasyfootball,removed,kkakaawwww
fantasyfootball,removed,i need you to fight by my side brother theres a lot of parrots in here
fantasyfootball,removed,im going hou vs jax for week
fantasyfootball,removed,buff vs cleveland is who im starting next week assuming i dont get knocked out this week week is harder the chiefs have a real turnover problem and if anyone can make it show denver can theyre a safe bet in my mind past that id call every other match up a bad combination of a low floor and a low ceiling with the best option in my mind being the giants
fantasyfootball,removed,in same spot have brady and denver d no way i can start both but buffalo houston on the wire we got max moves im at and need to make a move for a new kicker so leaves me with left im really wondering if its even worth it and because im on waiver wire i would most likely have to pick up buffalo before kick off tomorrow to get them just nervous how bad they have been and no idea how cleveland is going to play clev does not want to go so they will be playing their little hearts out
fantasyfootball,removed,russell gb in the snow or kaep vs nyj
fantasyfootball,removed,amy other receivers worthy of grabbing if he is out other than gabriel why has no one asked that
fantasyfootball,removed,would you bench him for tyrell tyrell is a afternoon game
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start hopkins or wait for gametime to and have gabriel as my backup option ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,looks like im going crowder and edelman
fantasyfootball,removed,who should i replace him with duke johnson burkhead or c sims
fantasyfootball,removed,kelly or booker ppt
fantasyfootball,removed,ugh i need to replace him with either tevin coleman la or kenneth dixon ne ppr im already starting freeman thoughts

fantasyfootball,removed,should i bench julio for watkins or inman now or should i wait and see and start gabriel if julio ends up not playing
fantasyfootball,removed,im leaning cobb for wr verenne for rb and brate for flex
fantasyfootball,removed,damn trying to figure out how to replace him right now im leaning toward shane vereen which i know is crazy but if hes good to go i feel like eli will check down to him all day against a tough run d other options are justin forsett huge risk cole beasley the safest play but also has been trending down lately rashad jennings feel like he was out played by perkins last week and only savaged his day with passes which wont be there with vereen in the mix or cameron brate not a bad option who do you go with
fantasyfootball,removed,well fuck b powell or dion lewis
fantasyfootball,removed,you guys think tyrell williams is a good replacement for julio this week hes been in my bench all year and does pretty good im just terrified tof not start julio

fantasyfootball,removed,what a good call
fantasyfootball,removed,your advice at least for me has been wholly useless this season good effort i guess but thanks for nothing
fantasyfootball,removed,lol just kill yourself wilson
fantasyfootball,removed,nope this is exactly the right subreddit youre been lurking on the new submissions i know you want content bae
fantasyfootball,removed,listen you fucking insect ill tell you what the fucking wrong sub is bitch ill post what i want where i want and youll fucking like it
fantasyfootball,removed,rjokes wrong sub
fantasyfootball,removed,did it ruin your day did you vagina hurt because there was a post about eli manning in the new submissions were you anxiously waiting to contribute to a fantasy discussion in the fantasy offseason
fantasyfootball,removed,lol yeah but i just read it again and kyle rudolph is the all fantasy second team tight end what a joke
fantasyfootball,removed,picked him up in standard and now have to decide between him adams and kelvin
fantasyfootball,removed,anybody have a good stream there isnt a game thread yet on nflstreams
fantasyfootball,removed,lol who df is jew a jew barista
fantasyfootball,removed,lol you guys all the new queue and respond to posts there including this one but youre mad because theres a game on sorry i interrupted you but if you want to just watch the game seems like you guys are all sitting here waiting until a post like this comes on to vent your outrage im not even mad but i do find it pretty weird
fantasyfootball,removed,i hope you get better at sucking dick seems like a skill youll need to be good at
fantasyfootball,removed,bruh theres a game on get a life ill chalk this one up to tryptophan even though thats been proven not to be the cause of dickish behavior on thanksgiving
fantasyfootball,removed,tannehill mariota or russell wilson this week
fantasyfootball,removed,no thanks id rather you keep playing with yourself especially with mike pence in office i wouldnt want to risk getting aids to which im already in dangerously close proximity in these threads
fantasyfootball,removed,lol that guy is a dick i just had an interesting chain with him not too similar to this one
fantasyfootball,removed,the bengals already said he will be back before the end of the regular season ajs toughness is also well documented so him beating the recovery timetable would not surprise me
fantasyfootball,removed,i get a small amount of wood about him this week
fantasyfootball,removed,dion or tevin
fantasyfootball,removed,coleman booker or hightower which one should sit this week out other rbs are shady and d murray
fantasyfootball,removed,davante adams mike wallace tevin coleman pick
fantasyfootball,removed,lewis will be their number receiving back hes the smoothest runner on the team you just can never tell what bb will do
fantasyfootball,removed,there is no right answer to this question all we know for sure that lewis looked great last game white still scored
fantasyfootball,removed,i have owned lewis all year and still cant pull the trigger to start him giving it one more week
fantasyfootball,removed,i have both but picked up smallwood and ivory for insurance so i dont plan to play either pat rb if i had to play one it would be lewis no analytical or statistical reason just my gut and thinking belichek wants to run the guy at full speed since he hasnt had that opportunity yet this year
fantasyfootball,removed,its tough because james white hasnt done anything to not be the receiving back but dion lewis is arguably the best of the two if you are in a good spot to win this week i would maybe just take dion lewis and hope he gets used but i might even try and find another rb if you cant afford a performance also on a related note this might be a good game for receiving backs pats d giving up nearly the most receptions to rbs in the league bilal powell seems smart this week too
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr pick one r cobb vs phi m sanu vs ari b lafell vs bal s watkins vs jax as a side note i dont think i have the balls to start sammy his first game back but im hurting for consistent performing wrs so im not ruling it out just yet already started c beasley and l fitzgerald is locked in as my after losing ajg last week would really appreciate some incite
fantasyfootball,removed,looking at their highlights from last week lewis looks like a much more dynamicelusive player and he should see his role increase further but white does a great job of getting open has great hands and is very fast both will get used each game and knowing bb it will be very difficult to predict their usage game to game we do know that lewis will get more carries than white though but receptions could be roughly even on average highlights
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start either of them over brandon marshall
fantasyfootball,removed,c
fantasyfootball,removed,so does that mean start rawls or nah
fantasyfootball,removed,i hope he comes back strong
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck i reaally want to start him over starks

fantasyfootball,removed,i hope he comes back strong
fantasyfootball,removed,every time he goes to fleener it doesnt go well
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr pick one jones v jax cobb was beasley v bal leaning beez w norman possibly on underperforming cobb and been down on jones
fantasyfootball,removed,i hope he comes back strong
fantasyfootball,removed,i hope he comes back strong
fantasyfootball,removed,you guys please dont do this again this is worse than any gordon meme that ever lived i hope he comes back strong

fantasyfootball,removed,matthews
fantasyfootball,removed,muslims
fantasyfootball,removed,no way you keep aj green instead of the first pick gurley and eifert are obvious keepers and i would say keep mccoy as well sure his adp is in round but you have last pick that round right now on fantasypros ppr rankings he is overall even before keepers are removed from the draft pool that is adp for you if you dont have any other positive adp keepers id definitely go with mccoy for the last spot tldr gurley eifert mccoy
fantasyfootball,removed,adrian beathisson
fantasyfootball,removed,gronk if you ♥ jesus the walkering dead turn your head and goff oblahdi oblada oblabduuuulah
fantasyfootball,removed,i prefer rawls simply because of seattle and i have no faith in chip kellys offense but it would be helpful to know who you are trading to see if it is even worth it
fantasyfootball,removed,can we get more details about the trade my understanding is that youre choosing hyde or rawls but whowhat are you losing
fantasyfootball,removed,its a toss hyde has the lock for the job and sf may ride him to carry the offense and has a chance to be a down rb rawls was amazing when weve seen him seattle is a run first offense and has a defense so rawls benefits from it rawls vs hyde adp drafting wise i would say pick hyde up at a round and a half later than a shaky rawls at the moment

fantasyfootball,removed,im rolling with jt as long as he is healthy hes a good redzone target and theres always garbage time with the jags
fantasyfootball,removed,came here to check nacl levels was not disappointed
fantasyfootball,removed,i would do it basically gordon and a bench spot for charles i like that
fantasyfootball,removed,cja owners listen to me you wasted your draft pick you failed he sucks youre just too dumb to understand this because youre a fat loser downvote if im right
fantasyfootball,removed,standard he has ertz for te and has baldwin matthews cooper brown decker for wrs im interested in either cooper or baldwin and have the following players to trade t eifert m bennett d parker c meredith j crowder would bennett parker be fair enough for either of them or would i need to add on meredithcrowder as well are there better suggestions you have
fantasyfootball,removed,after this game how is booker looking i have a trade out for c mike giving up booker and coates
fantasyfootball,removed,so hows that benjamin start working out for ya bud

fantasyfootball,removed,i have to drop a player to pick a kicker for my team after tonight i dont know if i should drop tyrell williams or devontae booker
fantasyfootball,removed,u mad bro
fantasyfootball,removed,i gave up on dwayne washington
fantasyfootball,removed,i finally got the morris owner in my league to give him up for a reasonable trade i gave him rudolph and crabtree for morris and edelman
fantasyfootball,removed,man standard espn just received greg olsen for derek carr and tj yeldon my rbs gurley blount booker dion lewis my qb is wilson my te now on my bench is julius thomas how did i come away from the trade
fantasyfootball,removed,hopkins fitz crabtree baldwin cooks
fantasyfootball,removed,im trying to pry away c mike from another owner he has rb melvin gordon cj terrance west cmike wr brown marshall fuller wallace deckerstill on his bench te henry enron looking for suggestions who to send potential options id consider sending are alshon landry coates booker enunwa lockett dion lewis and julius thomas is there any potential here i was thinking of trying coates and booker but dunno if its enough
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks for the answer i thought it might not be enough i put out coates and booker for now but i think im hesitant to sell low on alshon right now do you think cmikes value might dip in a few weeks with rawls coming back im thinking of trying coates and booker in like weeks and if coates keeps it up it might be enough then
fantasyfootball,removed,im a little worried about the storm brewing is seattle for russell wilson this weekend thinking of starting hoyer or alex smith from the waiver wire whos the best of the three
fantasyfootball,removed,yea im leaving this guy to his delusions good points bro
fantasyfootball,removed,i never want any part of a belichick backfield feel free to have him
fantasyfootball,removed,beasley has come thru for me each week with a solid floor but i am scared to see that his targets have dropped the last two weeks i am forced to start him or kersley so not a great selection
fantasyfootball,removed,with this news would you rather start wallace over sammie coates this week i also have edelman and have to play
fantasyfootball,removed,coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,romo back triggered
fantasyfootball,removed,lmao im taking an l this week royal q cobb q diggs bye evans bye sss out riddick out foster q already lost decker watlins and sims if the qs dont play im fucked need a piece from brady dj and lamar
fantasyfootball,removed,i cant believe i snagged him in a trade teams still have until tomorrow to veto it thankfully nfl new mobile app makes that difficult in a team league my rbs look like this david johnson zeke hyde howard marting ungghhhhhhh
fantasyfootball,removed,hes coming back dammit yeah in months
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop randolph or ebron for him ros
fantasyfootball,removed,whos gonna have a better season starting now him or diggs
fantasyfootball,removed,if you want to be disgusted with humanity go over to rthedonald right now
fantasyfootball,removed,somebody talk me out of starting both gio and gore over forte in ppr this week i just cant see forte doing well unless he gets multiple goal line looks
fantasyfootball,removed,debating ryan mathews or snead for my flex this is intriguing
fantasyfootball,removed,full ppr been debating whether i should go michael thomas floyd parker or crowell in the flex is this a good indicator that thomas could be my best bet
fantasyfootball,removed,michael thomas or pryor
fantasyfootball,removed,landry or michael thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,now i have to decide between michael thomas and maclin
fantasyfootball,removed,ryan mathews vs wash doug baldwin vs atl
fantasyfootball,removed,now im torn between brees and brady
fantasyfootball,removed,bell michael stewart crowell mathews jennings after bell stewart crowell blount jennings i could have had david johnson if i took him in and bell in after draft everyone else said they werent taking bell until round
fantasyfootball,removed,snead or jarvis landry
fantasyfootball,removed,have you ever posted anyone in here that you disagree with in rtherecordcorrected like you do with other people
fantasyfootball,removed,hill in a normal league return yards is a huge added bonus
fantasyfootball,removed,your mom
fantasyfootball,removed,yes just you
fantasyfootball,removed,wr on the week
fantasyfootball,removed,demaryius fitz rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,my little glib oneoff was never intended to make the guy delete his comment i now dont remember what he even said
fantasyfootball,removed,i would love to say duke johnson is the better choice however its looking like the browns arent going to be winning any games this season rawls is probably the better bet i dont think hell catch a td but he should get plenty of opportunities to rush
fantasyfootball,removed,likely starting dixon over marvin in a half point
fantasyfootball,removed,kaepernick or winston std league
fantasyfootball,removed,it was set to learn to read you stupid fuck the rules dont change for someones mishearings
fantasyfootball,removed,i need for my man ppr league rkelley ari dlewis vs la tcoleman vs kc
fantasyfootball,removed,thats literally at the top of the page dipshit
fantasyfootball,removed,if this is an actual problem you are worrying about then just go fuck yourself
fantasyfootball,removed,snow is best for tes the short passes will happen to fedoramousekawitz
fantasyfootball,removed,the major thing snowrain does is shorten the pass fedora is at that range already and may see even more volume nbsp anything shorter and brock would be hitting the linemen which is a distinct possibility with the way hes been playing
fantasyfootball,removed,no not at all wallace averages more targets and yards than crowder who is more touchdown dependent in his scoring but i actually caved last second and started dixon because i just need a solid floor from this position
fantasyfootball,removed,what are you talking about you said wallace gets more yards then concluded that hes more dependent on tds than crowder total nonsequitur
fantasyfootball,removed,shut up
fantasyfootball,removed,why on earth would you start him
fantasyfootball,removed,is nick o leary a good fill in today as the bills backup i was gonna start clay today as delanie walker is on bye
fantasyfootball,removed,go fall on a cactus naked
fantasyfootball,removed,theres a subreddit
fantasyfootball,removed,no he fucking didnt as a packer fan we havent played the niners this year are you actually stupid
fantasyfootball,removed,started him over kirk kill me
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,routoftheloop who is he and why is he benched
fantasyfootball,removed,spoken like a true sheep is he the greatest does he just win games go watch his playoff losses his sb losses where her looked like a little bitch when his line breaks down
fantasyfootball,removed,what are your keeper rules
fantasyfootball,removed,hurns and kelce
fantasyfootball,removed,i think kelce is the best pick and i dont think its close he is a great value there and is someone you can safely start every week
fantasyfootball,removed,do you have other really good options yes i still think you keep gordon here his upside is too high to not roll the dice on
fantasyfootball,removed,lookin to make your mark on a known bruiser is a sure fire way to get respect i knew zeke was good but not this good it was only one drive but its enough to reconsider taking him if he falls in the first
fantasyfootball,removed,no way man
fantasyfootball,removed,there were previous threads on this subject but they got removed because they were low effort
fantasyfootball,removed,dont do it man
fantasyfootball,removed,i drafted him i feel like that was pretty risky i wouldnt have done it with the
fantasyfootball,removed,if you want him take him he wont be there in the round
fantasyfootball,removed,its your season do it your way
fantasyfootball,removed,well youre going to either be the smartest guy in your league or the absolute dumbest
fantasyfootball,removed,yes that would be absurd take ab and be happy
fantasyfootball,removed,think i can get him at
fantasyfootball,removed,i have pick in a man league think zeke is worth it over a top wr standard scoring
fantasyfootball,removed,fml i have rawls foster and ajayi should i drop ajayi to get michael
fantasyfootball,removed,i have a choice between zeke and deandre hopkinsaj green ppr league zeke looks fucking good though so i might have to just say fuck itugh
fantasyfootball,removed,elliot over miller with the injuries to the texans line
fantasyfootball,removed,got him at in qb full ppr any thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah and absolutely nothing has changed since last year right idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got pick in team keeper gurley leveon hopkins julio ab obj are all accounted for crazy to consider taking zeke over ap i am an tosu grad though so i almost want to drink the kool aid devonta freeman is my current keeper in round
fantasyfootball,removed,pray his kid has autism but really why would sacrifice a monster paycheck
fantasyfootball,removed,please dont come back
fantasyfootball,removed,is there someone else you can keep i feel like you could draft dez at regardless
fantasyfootball,removed,im keeping him in the second round this year but i wouldnt worry about tony so much dak has been lighting it up and rookies tend to lean on their im more worried about dezs foot etc dak is good
fantasyfootball,removed,where are you drafting wr talent is so deep this year i like watkins alot but that wood head pick at is crazy good value
fantasyfootball,removed,whod you end up getting at rb
fantasyfootball,removed,ok good i know i didnt reach and the value was there you know how it is you draft and then have buyers remorse
fantasyfootball,removed,join this fantasy league its a points league with a large roster its a little bit different but it is actually a lot of fun
fantasyfootball,removed,shut the fuck up pussy i hope your kid gets autism
fantasyfootball,removed,boring low upside finishes every year as a borderline but thats only because he never gets hurt he was something like dont quote me on that in a per game basis last year umoneybagels
fantasyfootball,removed,landry not even close
fantasyfootball,removed,no in terms of do i take the best rbs and run my team around them
fantasyfootball,removed,lamar miller aj green a rob dez gronk whatever one falls then get mike evans
fantasyfootball,removed,robinson i like evans a lot and i think hell break out in a big way this year but robinson has already broken out
fantasyfootball,removed,coming from someone who chugs the mike evans koolaid id take allen robinson and its not close mike evans is still incredibly unproven and tampa faces a pretty brutal schedule throughout the year against opposing secondaries i also trust bortles in year more than winston in year arob has a case to be in tier for the wr group whereas evans is firmly in tier
fantasyfootball,removed,loser will be send the biggest puzzle we can find under you get from monday to friday to complete it solo and if you fail to complete it lose in next years auction no keepers
fantasyfootball,removed,not necessarily in larger leagues mine for instance is man with keepers slim pickings
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah my plan was to go green dez and then allen then try and get jarvis on the next double and salvage together a rb core in the later rounds
fantasyfootball,removed,pick crow ingram sims
fantasyfootball,removed,wes welker
fantasyfootball,removed,how can you tards forget about josh gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,anyone who doesnt say dwayne is getting down arrowed
fantasyfootball,removed,spencer ware
fantasyfootball,removed,dwayne bowe
fantasyfootball,removed,morgan freeman
fantasyfootball,removed,george washington
fantasyfootball,removed,i hate to be the one to stop the dwayne train but how is there no love for josh gordon in here
fantasyfootball,removed,i take it back cuz everyone should see this mother fucker thinks an app friend zoned him and its gonna ruin his life lol haha
fantasyfootball,removed,talent when all else is equal sims especially with ppr bonus
fantasyfootball,removed,cut someone for sims probably dixonwashington start crow sims
fantasyfootball,removed,should i play marvin jones or decker then
fantasyfootball,removed,i hope wilson bounces back i have tannehill in but im worried that theres gonna be thunderstorms and heavy rain go for flacco
fantasyfootball,removed,i think you give gurley a last chance bucs defense isnt exactly scary sim over the rest
fantasyfootball,removed,i feel sims outscores him but think you have to roll with gurley if he puts up a dud again its time to plop him on your bench for byes
fantasyfootball,removed,i think theyre all relatively equivalent on what you can expect if this is my squad im rolling freemanwarecmikemckinnon
fantasyfootball,removed,should i replace him with enunwa or tajae sharpe what do you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,shit have to decide between enuwa and cmike in my flex spot everyone is saying they are must starts
fantasyfootball,removed,would you bench dt for jones im extremely tempted to do it jones just seems to have more upside this week maybe this entire season
fantasyfootball,removed,jones or michael floyd
fantasyfootball,removed,hopefully they rule alshon out early if hes not playing i cant start jones over amari jordy decker alshon
fantasyfootball,removed,howard wont get carries you cant have a newcomer come in and steal the show
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt drop him but id def start cap over him
fantasyfootball,removed,looking for some help about who to start this week in my ppr format my options are between fozzy whittaker cameron artist payne or tj yeldon cap and whittaker have a tough matchup against the vikings while yeldon has a good matchup against baltimore but chris ivory is back any advice would be appreciated
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone start shepard over forte cj anderson melvin gordon dez bryant or allen robinson team ppr rb wr flex
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys start ivory over a guy like matt jones who faces the giants this week
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start cmike or sterling shep for flex
fantasyfootball,removed,vincent jackson scores td
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start dak over wilson qb ppr league my other qb is bortles
fantasyfootball,removed,kk i have tajae sharp would you still rock cmike
fantasyfootball,removed,tds from landry please
fantasyfootball,removed,itt me upvoting all positive bold predictions that apply to my players
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start dwayne over yeldon now
fantasyfootball,removed,itt people upvoting amazing stat lines for their own players
fantasyfootball,removed,stafford or tannehill this week
fantasyfootball,removed,should owners start stafford given this news
fantasyfootball,removed,alshon or benjamin
fantasyfootball,removed,alshon or decker
fantasyfootball,removed,jeremy maclin or jeffrey
fantasyfootball,removed,a guy offered me diggs for him trade is still sitting there is it wrong to accept now injury wasnt listed when he offered it
fantasyfootball,removed,i think so
fantasyfootball,removed,snead and matt jones for latavius and fuller
fantasyfootball,removed,my entire bench is hurt or suspended eifertcolemanbradycharlesivory only other options are lockett or yeldon which of those or do i risk for snead
fantasyfootball,removed,walford
fantasyfootball,removed,id get walford
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,not crazy but id rather have allen robinson
fantasyfootball,removed,absolutely
fantasyfootball,removed,pick up wallace hes gonna finish as the best te this season and super sneaky
fantasyfootball,removed,definitely dolphins
fantasyfootball,removed,dolphins
fantasyfootball,removed,do you still think andy reids comments concerning charles status was misdirection how is your busti mean charlespick working out for you but but he will have a monster year when he comes backhahah yeah right the only thing coming is a rbbc near you enjoy your second round bust pick
fantasyfootball,removed,i dropped gates for burton do i pickup rudolph on waivers tomorrow to start this week instead
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start him over lacy
fantasyfootball,removed,to think the browns wont figure out a way to get the most electrifying man in sports entertainment the fucking football is fucking stupid youre an idiot and you should feel bad about yourself this began as a lighthearted jest and then you played yourself
fantasyfootball,removed,so with the gb defense so hobbled this week no matthews shields burnett is washington a viable flex option or do we wait him out another week
fantasyfootball,removed,hey dumb shit im saying he shut down wrs just as tall as kb kb is calvin is also and way better than kb aj is
fantasyfootball,removed,im sorry
fantasyfootball,removed,does ertz pitta
fantasyfootball,removed,aka charged not sure why people are trying to correct me on this a criminal charge is a formal accusation made by a governmental authority asserting that somebody has committed a crime a charging document which contains one or more criminal charges or counts can take several forms including complaint information indictment
fantasyfootball,removed,my mom said nobody ever this is probably for an inactive taco youll sign into his account and send yourself trades you dirty fucking whore ill kill you
fantasyfootball,removed,i could understand that in a ppr in a standard youre a fucking idiot when you consider how deep wr is and how much of a crapshoot rb is
fantasyfootball,removed,your last posts have been attacking me because you literally couldnt bring anything else to the discussion
fantasyfootball,removed,youre an idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,let me guess hes fat isnt he
fantasyfootball,removed,no need to get defensive i was mocking you moron youre the one who said that and were back to youre struggles with the english language
fantasyfootball,removed,how about if i add ware or d washington
fantasyfootball,removed,how does that list work i still havent been able to figure it out ill google and post results if i can find them
fantasyfootball,removed,this guy gets it
fantasyfootball,removed,go with peyton fuckting manning
fantasyfootball,removed,i have sims cadet and whitaker west is on free agents help
fantasyfootball,removed,so i have walker and tamme is on the bench do i play tamme instead of walker or drop him for henry
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm rudolph or walker what fo you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,i got fleener last night just in case think hes a better play i like walker especially without watt but forever broke thru last week
fantasyfootball,removed,im between him and gronk im leaning towards gronk because they are both coming off injury and i think gronk will get more looks in the red zone but im not sure
fantasyfootball,removed,i have delanie bennett do i drop bennett for hunter henry and wait on pre game for delanie v game my options are limited thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,delanie or kelce i feel safer with kelce but delanies upside has got me in a jam
fantasyfootball,removed,start walker or fleener
fantasyfootball,removed,fact the cute pudgy girl in the att commercial is a lesbo
fantasyfootball,removed,try going to free agents or players on your mobile app then click on deandre washingtons player profile and click add
fantasyfootball,removed,ivory could have two touchdowns if the coach didnt hate blacks
fantasyfootball,removed,same happened in my league i really needed a wr after losing dez and allen
fantasyfootball,removed,was kinda hoping he would rest so i didnt have to decide between him and miller blah
fantasyfootball,removed,hmmcant decide between walker and ebron now
fantasyfootball,removed,walker or rudolph
fantasyfootball,removed,start witten or walker
fantasyfootball,removed,walker or pitta today im leaning towards pitta because his match up with oakland is a nice one but delanie walker is mariotas top target
fantasyfootball,removed,the real question is do i start walker over pitta
fantasyfootball,removed,i hope luck dies
fantasyfootball,removed,ill probably play ebron just cause im scared walker will end up playing like plays
fantasyfootball,removed,start over crowell or howard
fantasyfootball,removed,walker or graham worried walker will be a decoy
fantasyfootball,removed,walker or barnidge sigh
fantasyfootball,removed,walker or tamme today ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,walker over henry i love henrys matchup and am unsure on how many snaps walker will play
fantasyfootball,removed,walker or fleener
fantasyfootball,removed,walker or fleener
fantasyfootball,removed,walker or kelce
fantasyfootball,removed,still starting pitta over walker today matchup is rough on walker and hes certainly not going to be top of his game with the hammy injury pitta on the other hand has a juicy matchup
fantasyfootball,removed,ben vs kc or matt ryan vs carolina
fantasyfootball,removed,good now i dont have to worry about bennett not getting targets with brissett starting
fantasyfootball,removed,commercial question would you start sims vs denver or riddick vs chicago in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck just when i was sure of my starter walker or ebron tough man truly ugh
fantasyfootball,removed,im starting rudolph over walker today too risky
fantasyfootball,removed,i own gronk in one league and walker in another i learned from last week when gronk delivered a im sitting walker this week
fantasyfootball,removed,i
fantasyfootball,removed,walker or tamme
fantasyfootball,removed,sigh my buddy said delanie i shouldnt have second guessed myself i said well cool tamme just scored too bad you told me dalanie the response i got was youll be alright we can only hope
fantasyfootball,removed,stats barfed it will get credited eventually
fantasyfootball,removed,broken shins dont have anything to do with strength or conditioning shut the fuck up dudes
fantasyfootball,removed,i am carries to yeldons was hopeful hed be the lead back but doesnt look like thats the plan
fantasyfootball,removed,dont start ryan or russell they said
fantasyfootball,removed,i have both and picked up flacco of the waivers cause i bought into the experts im going to just trust ryan from now on till he has a bad game
fantasyfootball,removed,i started flacco instead of russel or ryan
fantasyfootball,removed,anderson was already rostered in all but one of my leagues as well
fantasyfootball,removed,youre retarded
fantasyfootball,removed,r u stupid sorry just asking
fantasyfootball,removed,except gurleys bad weeks could have made you lose
fantasyfootball,removed,team dynasty
fantasyfootball,removed,i wasnt having a pity party i made one offhanded remark suck a fat cock
fantasyfootball,removed,can anyone help with an adddrop question according to the projections i am down by points in my ppr league matchup and i have an empty wr slot to use in either the sunday or monday nighter not great options but who should i grab chris conley pit sammie coates vs kc adam thielen vs nyg also in order to pick someone up who do i drop from my bench corey coleman dion lewis orleans darkwa
fantasyfootball,removed,you misspelled one
fantasyfootball,removed,kc is playing san diego who is not doing well for various reasons and they lost to the browns last week would definitely start kansas city d
fantasyfootball,removed,false last year he played with manning who played some of the worst qb in years dt had add in another fluke td or and he jusmps up a bunch of spots avoid dt at your own risk his worst year was a year most wrs only dream of
fantasyfootball,removed,whats the rest of your team look like
fantasyfootball,removed,that is good as pot has been shown to help with regrowing damaged brain cells football players need cannabis not pain pillsmuscle relaxers
fantasyfootball,removed,doug martin in the and its not even close robinsons adp is off the board in a team league martins is keeping robinson saves you at the absolute best picks say you pick and martin will save you picks since his normal price tag is the round
fantasyfootball,removed,starting up an auction keeper ppr league buy in through leaguesafe so far we have of its a mix of people throughout a few leagues is this something youd be interested in
fantasyfootball,removed,one of floyd brown or diggs most weeks but itll of course depend on matchups
fantasyfootball,removed,john brown so its between floyd brown and benjamin honestly id try to package two of them for a consistent all three are pretty boombust floyd probably has the highest floor
fantasyfootball,removed,ab no question youll still have rbs to choose from at the turn around reinforces this even more
fantasyfootball,removed,depends on what the rest of your team looks like
fantasyfootball,removed,i might keep baldwin if you believe in the seahawks passing more dont keep dgb
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt be surprised if theres a pretty big drop off in baldwins production this year tbh
fantasyfootball,removed,k
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,wdis thread bro
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah bro
fantasyfootball,removed,kelley and next time wdis thread bro
fantasyfootball,removed,did vinatieri fuck your girlfriend
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont care who the fuck you have thats a shit trade and you know it if you dont you go and you fucking quit fantasy football right now you fucking fuck
fantasyfootball,removed,he tries to throw picks but mike evans always appears out of nowhere to catch it first
fantasyfootball,removed,youre really one to talk playing fake moderator on a fucking fantasy football subreddit get off your high horse and out of your moms basement you sad waste of space
fantasyfootball,removed,im talking about the fact that this forum was always insisting on selling him high i did didnt work out in my favor and it is what it is i was poking fun at the forum not blaming them idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,trust doug over ingram car
fantasyfootball,removed,start him over miller v raiders
fantasyfootball,removed,got vinaterri woot my only dilemma now is that all my wide receivers are on byes and my defense is on a bye im not sure who to drop in my league to pick up anybody else who do i drop if anybody im leaning towards rolling the dice and leaving my roster alone a luck d johnson l mccoy d thomas t williams sd j graham s ware broncos dst a vinatieri m gordon b marshall t hightower d lewis m mariota t rawls a peterson ir
fantasyfootball,removed,wdis and harris has no value hyde is the guy shoulder sprains are nothing lingering
fantasyfootball,removed,dropped the vikings picked up miami d and also was able to secure thomas rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,start over gio bernard in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,i play him every week i know hes a brown but hes the ranked wr in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,every week i stare at my screen and decide whether i should start him or cooks this week julio is on bye so i dont have to worry about it but his floor has been pretty consistent i picked up rishard mathews but i might still start pryor because he seems to have established a chemistry with kessler based on last weeks game and the steelers d hasnt been that good need to confirm that last part
fantasyfootball,removed,matchup based flexing ty williams or pryor wr setup fex obj dez dt ty or pryor its pryor this week cuz ty on bye
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont know what this means but i have had him in as my most weeks hes a lock now that alshon is suspended
fantasyfootball,removed,doug martin vs prosise this week i know this isnt wdis
fantasyfootball,removed,so is it very fair to assume that when a crime is committed within city limits it was perpetrated by a minority because most inner city crime is committed by minorities thats whats wrong with this logic and thats why its fucked up for people to start witch hunts without the facts
fantasyfootball,removed,so im not going to lie i was only using your spreadsheets in the first place to get the underlying data which i then used to create my own spreadsheets i have a question about numberfires projections ive found it easy enough to get what i need from them but i cant get over my suspicion that the numbers arent taking bye weeks into account ie the projections assume every player will play every remaining week regardless of whether they have already had their bye or not do you have any insight on this
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,it is inadvisable to start either rawls or dion
fantasyfootball,removed,start blount for sure theyre being cautious with dion
fantasyfootball,removed,honestly no even though its a matchup against sf blount will feat and white is still doing pretty well hes gonna have to play days at least to see if the pats want to use him over white
fantasyfootball,removed,is it ppr if yes then i think dion over rawls is the right choice although its close if no ppr id go rawls im keeping both guys on my bench this week but looking forward to seeing how they do
fantasyfootball,removed,im in the same position as you if you sub out starks for rawls given that dion was a healthy scratch last week im not confident hell get the workload until i see it i think rawls has a lower ceiling since hes ceding touches to prosise but a higher floor since we can be relatively sure that if he plays hell get touches if dion plays hes got potential to be brilliant im just not certain theyll even let him touch the pigskin
fantasyfootball,removed,would i be crazy to start an unknown rawls over gurley
fantasyfootball,removed,should i go with rawls starks or kelley ive picked up too many streamers
fantasyfootball,removed,walker is on bye
fantasyfootball,removed,lol pussy
fantasyfootball,removed,what level player do you think youd have to pair with say forte powell would fortepowellbaldwin move the needle if you were a wr needy team
fantasyfootball,removed,blount jstew gurley in that order
fantasyfootball,removed,oh man im a big believe in rawls coming back however i just traded for doug martin because i love his playoff schedule i also believe the bears just said howards injury is not serious as he practiced today i think id hold howard if hes playing
fantasyfootball,removed,this was expected
fantasyfootball,removed,everyone on the benny train
fantasyfootball,removed,nah deep balls to brown when a corner slips from the snow and brown gets loose
fantasyfootball,removed,the edit only brings more questions such as why the fuck does one division have a phantom team which gives them all a free win jake your league is fucking stupid and this is the dumbest question ive ever seen on reddit
fantasyfootball,removed,man half ppr someone has offered me doug baldwin and jordan howard for ty hilton good trade im skeptical of their numbers this season

fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,you got dt in the in a team league that value is so good that you can afford dt underperforming for now
fantasyfootball,removed,definitely pornbub
fantasyfootball,removed,id drop tate for him rawls deep for beast mode
fantasyfootball,removed,giving up that gurley ingram combo was definitely mistake cobb is in my mind a likely improvement over benjamin but not necessarily by much whereas going from ingram to hyde is a huge downgrade also basing your trades off of you assumption that a player will get injured is not a smart move all in all you got taken here imo what do i expect from hyde i expect high volume low efficiency in the first half then when the are trailing i expect him to disappear fairly often chip kellys offense will feed him early and often but i just dont think they are good enough to keep games close and establish the run also if youre gong to place bets on people getting injured hyde is a good place to start hes already injured just got cleared to play he was out a substantial part of last season injured and now hes gonna be playing a bigger role in an uptempo offense more touches more opportunity for injury
fantasyfootball,removed,just wow terrible trade ingram is way better than hyde on a way better team the rz opportunities the saints will have compared to the will be a lot then benjamin is and cobb is
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah alright my bad man sorry for telling someone to drop a choice wr with a worse qb instead of a first choice wr with a better qb
fantasyfootball,removed,it is a ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,he got probably times as many responses in the short life of this thread as he would in wdis why are we so obsessed with killing discussion to follow stupid rules on literal redditcom
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop rishard matthews for him
fantasyfootball,removed,adrian peterson beating ciara with a switch as russell wilson looks on horrified
fantasyfootball,removed,my rbs are miller and williams my flex was moncrief half ppr so i favored at wr
fantasyfootball,removed,paula deen lording over a group of black fellas
fantasyfootball,removed,my question is should i roster booker or ajayi in case foster goes down which do you think is a better bet
fantasyfootball,removed,add clive walford to start over gates this week
fantasyfootball,removed,could you please take this photo and add a transparent looking harambe in the sky that dak is pointing to team name is daks out for harambe
fantasyfootball,removed,team league ppr wallace is currently a fa should i drop stills on bench and pick him up ie will wallace provide better wr depth vs stills other bench options to drop charles sims vincent jackson will fuller mohamed snau
fantasyfootball,removed,or tajae is also fa should i go for him over wallace
fantasyfootball,removed,i already have ab jordy and brandin cooks should i pick up fuller sanu vincent jackson or kevin white
fantasyfootball,removed,question for you then i have yeldon but hes on my bench should i consider playing him this week if not this week then what weeks do you think hell be decent starting rbs hyde and ware benched ebs yeldon gore matt jones and langford im watching hyde like a hawk until gametime first time fantasy player newbie to football trying to get all the advice i possibly can about my team
fantasyfootball,removed,you should direct people to the adddrop thread instead of answering them here those threads exist for a reason and should be utilized
fantasyfootball,removed,this is my main complaint the matchup page is pretty much the only thing i use and only half the screen is showing my actual players theres a nav bar on the top and bottom and for some reason they felt the need to list who the two teams are twice so much wasted vertical space
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop fuller for wallace
fantasyfootball,removed,jesus youre dumb lets break down your post for a second last year freeman was the rb in fantasy you say he cant match last year last year he didnt break yards rushing very often yet he still managed to be the rb in fantasy hes the better pass catching back the big play guy and the goal line back sowhat exactly has changed from last year to this year even if he doesnt get the overwhelming majority of the rb carries hes still the goal line back which equals touchdowns hes still the pass catching back which means ppr and straight rec yards hes still the big play guy who can catch a screen pass and run it in for think before you type
fantasyfootball,removed,hm does this make jones a must start this week who would you start him over mid tier guys like decker maclin crabtree moncreif landry edelman i have no idea how to rank him hes certainly an interesting start
fantasyfootball,removed,dang now i gotta decide on jones or jordan reed at flex this is gonna be tough
fantasyfootball,removed,do i give it a couple more weeks to wait and see or do i drop lynch now for c michael
fantasyfootball,removed,so am i safe to drop him now
fantasyfootball,removed,theo riddicckly speaking yes
fantasyfootball,removed,cmike or landry or abdullah in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,im trying to decide if i should have tate in instead of jordy nelson i have stafford and my other receivers are obj and brandon marshall ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,half ppr would you drop justin forsett for theo riddick
fantasyfootball,removed,riddick or sims
fantasyfootball,removed,drop forsett for yeldon yeldon owner dropped him for garcon team ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,thoughts on stafford vs carr
fantasyfootball,removed,have to decide between moncrief and marvin mind says moncrief gut says marvin
fantasyfootball,removed,im really struggle if i should start cobb tate or jones
fantasyfootball,removed,landry vs cooper in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,i keep toying with the idea of starting jones over mike evans cause the matchup is so good but i just cant do it not week at least
fantasyfootball,removed,in a man ppr league with only bench spots and no ir would you continue to hold eifert while starting the likes of jesse james jared cook or virgil green or would you drop him and grab a lotto ticket like kenny stills or tevin coleman in the hopes of picking him up off the waiver in a few weeks as he gets closer to playing
fantasyfootball,removed,what do you guys think about abdullah this week im struggling between him and edelman in the flex edelman has a tough matchup ari but i feel like hes gona be garropolos safety valve
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start landry over keenan in standard trying to fill in my flex behind obj and nelson
fantasyfootball,removed,do i bring back kelley and drop lynch
fantasyfootball,removed,last manning standing pleaseee
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone start jones over langford as a flex
fantasyfootball,removed,does anyone like gio this week

fantasyfootball,removed,im not sure whether to start brees or stafford this week it doesnt help im a raiders fan so i want brees to do horrible
fantasyfootball,removed,so who should i start lol ware or west
fantasyfootball,removed,would you rank clive salford ahead of eric ebron
fantasyfootball,removed,marvin probably better than djax given the matchup
fantasyfootball,removed,damn very tempted to flex him over ware suggestions
fantasyfootball,removed,start staff over cousins
fantasyfootball,removed,jones or decker
fantasyfootball,removed,do i drop jared cooks and pick up bennet for this game
fantasyfootball,removed,jamaal charles owner here in a wrte flex spot ppr and per return yard league i have ware and foster as my rbs for now with sproles on the bench i also have the following wr aj green jarvis landry kelvin benjamin tyler lockett sterling shepard kevin white would i be crazy to trade kb for a starting rb the two offers i got last night from people in the room were devontae freeman straight up or matt forte straight up or i could sit here with all these monster wrs and hope that they can carry me since theres flex positions
fantasyfootball,removed,drop gronk for jared cook
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm guess i should drop lynch for walford
fantasyfootball,removed,any chance you could put delaine walkers face in luke skywalkers body
fantasyfootball,removed,i got bennett ppr djax or bennett
fantasyfootball,removed,in a ppr not sure i want to start marvin jones or sterling shepherd hmm
fantasyfootball,removed,foster or ware in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,bennett or dwayne allen
fantasyfootball,removed,im thinking carr over stafford and hyde over jones at flex does anyone object
fantasyfootball,removed,thoughts on stafford or tyrod jones or djax
fantasyfootball,removed,charles owner ware is taken but west is available should i drop robert kelley for him
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start cmike over michael floyd in my flex ppr team
fantasyfootball,removed,michael or landry in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,drop one west terrance for the other west charchandrick
fantasyfootball,removed,morris is currently available in my league and i think he is a muststash problem is i have the max of rbs already would you drop any of these guys for him j white c sims c michael starters are l miller m ingram and j stewart
fantasyfootball,removed,hey week roster question for yall would you dress blount arizona or michael vs miami thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,eh clive walford or jesse james
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop yeldon or abdullah for cmike ppr man
fantasyfootball,removed,this brings up a tough decision for me and im wondering if anyone can shed some advice with gronk out is edelman worth starting over crabtree
fantasyfootball,removed,fire up james white
fantasyfootball,removed,god damn it should put cj as my so i could have the flex open i have no good backup running backs
fantasyfootball,removed,this brings up a tough decision for me and im wondering if anyone can shed some advice with gronk out is edelman worth starting over crabtree
fantasyfootball,removed,sooooo langford against houston and jj watt or cmike
fantasyfootball,removed,ertz or bennett
fantasyfootball,removed,rawls or brandin cooks at flex
fantasyfootball,removed,who should i drop to grab another te this week w snead charles sims or corey coleman also which te should i pick

fantasyfootball,removed,ughhh what two of tate baldwin and ty
fantasyfootball,removed,jimmy graham or martellus bennett who are we liking people
fantasyfootball,removed,so start michael or ware
fantasyfootball,removed,worth dropping ameer sbdullah to pick up graham as my my other rbs are miller hyde foster and ware
fantasyfootball,removed,gates vs kc best d last year against tes or bennett
fantasyfootball,removed,now the real question is cmike or ware
fantasyfootball,removed,allen j thomas and ertz are available any thoughts id have to drop one of my qbbortles winston or woodhead help im scared
fantasyfootball,removed,carrol just said that cmike is starting ahead of rawls rawls will most likely only get a couple of carries ware may only lose a couple carries to charcandrick west other two rbs are lamar miller and david anderson but they gotta start rightright help
fantasyfootball,removed,looking at cmike or desean jackson in my flex in standard scoring tempted to plug in michael for a week
fantasyfootball,removed,cmike or langford
fantasyfootball,removed,white or ware
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr problem roster is full i have rawls do i drop any of these for cmichael rbs foster leveon hyde rawls rashad jennings duke johnson bench wrs marvin jones crabtree maclin
fantasyfootball,removed,soooo ware or cmike in the flex i gotta start david johnson and lamar miller
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start jones or tate picked up both hoping this isnt going to be a weekly struggle for me
fantasyfootball,removed,could get you some points thinking he will be td dependant and i would only start him if i had no other option id rather gamble on jesse james or jared cook if they are still available in your league
fantasyfootball,removed,got cmike on my bench sitting behind l miller and rashad jennings seriously thinking about putting him in for rashad i know rashad is the safe betbut i just want to taste the drama
fantasyfootball,removed,would you add martellus and drop jimmy graham delanie is my starter btw
fantasyfootball,removed,is cmike worth number waiver someone dropped him and i have the waiver i dont really need an rb but someone is gonna use a waiver for him
fantasyfootball,removed,but whos the better start jones or tate
fantasyfootball,removed,so should i be starting crabtree over marshall because of the matchup ive got julio and alshon as my and flex
fantasyfootball,removed,based on reading this should i flex crabtree over ryan matthews i already have cooper starting if that makes any difference
fantasyfootball,removed,trade rape and collusion are different
fantasyfootball,removed,i would drop forsett and henry
fantasyfootball,removed,id drop forsett or jones for either one really ware will have the better week probably but michael may have the better seasonlong outlook personally id drop both forsett and jones and pick up both
fantasyfootball,removed,here we go drop james white for michael
fantasyfootball,removed,cmike or jordan matthews at flex
fantasyfootball,removed,c mike or spencer ware i feel like the obvious answer is ware
fantasyfootball,removed,taco in my league dropped rawls how much of my do i spend
fantasyfootball,removed,i hate everything would you start abdullah or gio in rawls place
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys start rashad jennings over spencer ware in a standard league
fantasyfootball,removed,help pls who should i start frank gore and cmike my team is wr heavy i already got points from anderson and cam last night but im going vs gurly and eli
fantasyfootball,removed,awh shit cmike or jennings in standard as a bell fill in
fantasyfootball,removed,so i have both ware and michael on two of my teams who the hell do i start
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,i would go with montgomery simply because ajayi hasnt been putting up the numbers without starting olinemen
fantasyfootball,removed,tim tebow team
fantasyfootball,removed,jordan howard
fantasyfootball,removed,im starting himwith our confidence biggest fear is that since they have nothing to play for and hes a little banged up he gets benched relatively early in the game no alternatives on the waiver though krapernick
fantasyfootball,removed,pick in ppr really conflicted amari cooper has been an absolute nightmare aj green vs houassuming he plays jarvis landry vs bufamari cooper vs ind marvin jones vs dal
fantasyfootball,removed,you will get better help in the wdis wr thread that being said love your user name he was a inside joke in my league for years also i like coop more
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont know ive been firing him up the past few weeks because start your studs but now that im in the championship i dont think i can risk him again of course as soon as i bench him hell have his breakout game
fantasyfootball,removed,being someone who is a goody twoshoes here in the bighouse we make guys like you pay for things with your manhood asshole
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard pick snake draft lamar miller jordy nelson demaryius thomas latavius murray julian edelman thomas rawls delanie walker josh gordon justin forsett tavon austin travis benjamin kirk cousins stephen gostkowski theo riddick alfred morris eagles d stuck with latavius and rawls through the highs and the lows
fantasyfootball,removed,why dont you just try it and see if he is a free agent you can pick him back up again if hes waiver he wont be available by game time
fantasyfootball,removed,team eli manning obj jordy nelson rob kelley lesean mccoy cameron beate latavius murray aguayo new york giants team drew brees mike evans ty montgomery ezekiel elliot jordan howard jimmy graham sammy watkins matt bryant new england
fantasyfootball,removed,it worked really well last night but i posted it right before the outage so it couldve worked a lot better
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,oh no it was a little different i was just using that as an example in reality i started both of them but i left alshon on the bench because everyone was up in arms on this sub saying that jamison crowders one bad game was nothing to worry about and that i was basically an idiot for wanting to bench him i stated how i felt they were cycling through receivers and his time was up with jackson garcon seemingly getting more targets throughout the game i was right crowder netted me a nice points to lead me to losing the semifinals however if i played alshon jeffery i would be in the championships really the moral of this story is trust your gut over what some strangers over the internet tell you
fantasyfootball,removed,go with desean man its the championship youll need the boom or bust
fantasyfootball,removed,youre picking i think gurley at a round value is much better than julio in the first think about it this way would you rather have gurley and allen robinson or julio and michael floyd floyd is projected at the back of the because with pick you are going at the very end of the gurley and julio are both first rounders and both top picks youre going to give away a first round pick because you like julio more that seems crazy to me
fantasyfootball,removed,really have no idea why this is even a question its clearly gurley and its not close both players have round adps and one costs you a why even ask
fantasyfootball,removed,somewhat related i have a keeper league where i enter the season with david johnson jeremy hill maclinhyde and allen robinson with my draft pick leveon bell and deandre hopkins will both be available am i being too cute by not taking bell i also have another early pick where i should be able to land dez or jordy hopkins and dezjordy seems really sexy and if i go this route ill likely keep hyde over maclin thanks for any help
fantasyfootball,removed,hadnt thought about it but what does ad returning do for rudolphs value those short dump passes bradfords been throwing rudolphs way may now be going to ad no
fantasyfootball,removed,kaep
fantasyfootball,removed,i also remember this guy absolutely choking it for me in the playoffs one year so yeah i would roll with either keep or bradford stay away from siemien
fantasyfootball,removed,no way in hell id start stafford this week my only lion is tate and im benching him if you just need a solid but not stellar performance id actually start siemian anything else id start sackernick also wdis thread
fantasyfootball,removed,his velocity went way down after he wore the glove last game i think it directly resulted in of his picks this week hell be wearing a finger bare palm glove but id still rather start eli or kaep over him
fantasyfootball,removed,in the same boat im rolling bradford at home against a colts team that gives up a lot through the air and has ol starters missing im expectinghoping with minnesotas tough d they control top and bradford has a nice day coming off a solid game last week against a much tougher pass d lol run on sentence gooooo
fantasyfootball,removed,im playing kaep over stafford in what could be a high scoring game i think the vegas line was like which is one of the higher lines of the week
fantasyfootball,removed,bortles in a dome in houston eli has rain and cold flacco has rain and cold kaep is fucking kaep dont start him in the playoffs
fantasyfootball,removed,what rbs are on waivers
fantasyfootball,removed,i cannot afford a point outing which brings me to eli youve never owned eli before have you
fantasyfootball,removed,okay dont start eli manning
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,book of eli you can feast or starvebut home games he has looked well great dfs play
fantasyfootball,removed,as this is a huge bit of information that will likely shape this years playoffs whats it gunna be personally i cant decide between kelley and powell and so i have decided to roll with the majoritywhoever that may be
fantasyfootball,removed,im in the same boat i got dion lewis hightower and gilislsee as my other options
fantasyfootball,removed,just play your defense pussy
fantasyfootball,removed,youre a pussy
fantasyfootball,removed,idk once he gets back bell and wheaton he wont be very useful especially now that rogers has seemingly emerged
fantasyfootball,removed,he got targets hes rosterable
fantasyfootball,removed,lol so what youre saying is you dont know who is better between cobb and djax go home
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont see why someone would give up cobb for ware i could see d jackson if its the guys or wr
fantasyfootball,removed,keep ware even with jc you think chiefs will bench ware
fantasyfootball,removed,i would drop john brown he can blow up for games but he can have a lot of games like last night trust me i had him last year
fantasyfootball,removed,who do you have for te i wouldnt waste a waiver on gates personally
fantasyfootball,removed,keep diggs hes the and a damn good one at that
fantasyfootball,removed,wouldcouldshould of does not exist what youre thinking of is wouldcouldshouldve a contraction of the word and have please do not use would of could of or should of
fantasyfootball,removed,vance macdonald or jesse james
fantasyfootball,removed,demarco gore and ugh gurley ¯ツ¯

fantasyfootball,removed,drop my rams defense for baltimore i have a limited amount of transactions
fantasyfootball,removed,i have kc should i drop them
fantasyfootball,removed,im not sure about anyone else but my league is real deep and all of those guys are owned for me im rolling with dennis pitta this week he was the unquestioned passing te for baltimore week played the majority of the snaps they play cleveland and should put up points this week
fantasyfootball,removed,i paid a high price for kc and unsure if i should keep them as the next few games arnt great and they have an early bye week i do like the few games after the bye though some def available jets miami buff phi bal
fantasyfootball,removed,drop eagles for jets im okay rolling with philly this week but i think jets may be worth it ros
fantasyfootball,removed,eagles for baltimore or just stick it out i have alshon and langford so i dont like the idea of rooting for players to score on my d

fantasyfootball,removed,start the eaglles over the cardinals you think i dont think another double digit defensive score is that likely
fantasyfootball,removed,i cant decide between sticking with the the jets d or dropping them for philly
fantasyfootball,removed,drop eagles for minn who is the better def long term
fantasyfootball,removed,should i pick up sharpe over fuller in a man standard

fantasyfootball,removed,drop vikings for ravens
fantasyfootball,removed,no that isnt additional value thats arbitrary ppr makes fantasy more of a crapshoot not less volume being easy to predict makes it easier to put together a decent lineup making everyone competitive even if they dont know shit
fantasyfootball,removed,lost keenan waiver but i dont think im going to use it im going to save it for an rb injury i still have hopkins fitz moncrief and sanders
fantasyfootball,removed,the main point is to make fantasy gms more similar not the players on the field and i know none of what im saying makes sense to you i expected that
fantasyfootball,removed,baltimore or philly defense
fantasyfootball,removed,if witten is available on the ww should i be grabbing him asap
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck it i drafted zach miller as his backup do i dump ertz and take a flyer on a guy like vmac walford etc or just plug in miller
fantasyfootball,removed,ertz owners who are you looking to target on the ww i am hoping to land ebron when waivers clear i am not sure if he is using my waiver on
fantasyfootball,removed,what are everyones thoughts on celek i own eifert and ertz so i gotta move ertz this week
fantasyfootball,removed,freeman a lot higher upside in my opinion less mouths to feed in atlanta detroit has three backs which will get time and the least useful of them will poach all of the goal line work
fantasyfootball,removed,you fucking retard
fantasyfootball,removed,someone in my standard man league dropped diggs should i pick up sharpe or diggs
fantasyfootball,removed,im not high on either but gun to head i would say freeman hes show he can be effective and less mouths to feed in atlanta
fantasyfootball,removed,so does celek step in seamlessly my te options are crap atm greene and cook so wondering if its worth dropping cook for celek man ppr waited way too long for a te
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop tyler boyd to grab sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,im struggling whether to drop kc for the jets
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got the rams defensive should i drop them for available san francisco philly buffalo nyj baltimore also and why
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop him for rudolph or allen
fantasyfootball,removed,should we drop ertz
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr deciding between james allen ebron tamme or walford whoever doesnt get a waiver used on them no idea what to do tight ends are tough to predict
fantasyfootball,removed,will fuller worth a top waiver priority if sharpe is already rostered
fantasyfootball,removed,should i use my waiver wire priority on him was thinking of waiting since i have nelson desean jackson fitz e sanders marvin jones
fantasyfootball,removed,do i drop ertz for barnidge or gates lots of questions about both teams if im being real
fantasyfootball,removed,do you think ertz is droppable
fantasyfootball,removed,would you a use waiver priority on fuller or b wait to see if tyrell williams makes it to free agency and scoop him
fantasyfootball,removed,what order would you guys rank asj ebron vigil green and walford
fantasyfootball,removed,picking up james should i drop ertz deandre washington or sammie coates theyre my most droppable players
fantasyfootball,removed,right but its just in context of not using the priority on fuller youre right that williams will likely be scooped via waiver but he would be one of the few candidates that could slip through to free agency
fantasyfootball,removed,coming into week would you keep freeman in or start yeldon jones or foster cj is my other rb right now
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop lockette and pick up sharpe or fuller in men standard
fantasyfootball,removed,kersey
fantasyfootball,removed,i drafted aiken thinking about dropping him for sharpe thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,first time being in a league with a faab lost keenan allen and have dt and watkins both ailing how much of my budget should i put on a guy like this
fantasyfootball,removed,thoughts on jacob tamme for ppr leagues as a replacement he did get targets sunday
fantasyfootball,removed,both snead and sharpe are on my league waiver i have the pick which one should i get im leaning toward snead since hes a proven candidate and in a much better offense
fantasyfootball,removed,how do you rate him in comparison to tajae sharpe ccoleman stills sanu wheaton i have number waiver priority and dont know who to use it on
fantasyfootball,removed,ertz was my only te i have hopkins marshall edelman and josh gordon at wr is it worth dropping kevin white for vanceebronjesse james
fantasyfootball,removed,dropping him for allen what of my starting faab should i drop first time using faab
fantasyfootball,removed,well this is sounding good eifert is available in my standard league is ertz or eifert the better injured te to own
fantasyfootball,removed,tamme or rudolph to replace ertz in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,youre overpaying
fantasyfootball,removed,no one in the world would accept this trade
fantasyfootball,removed,looks even on paper but im not selling dj right now he is looking like the back on the season and youre not getting that back
fantasyfootball,removed,travis value has skyrocketed you can get more for him
fantasyfootball,removed,keenan allen was my first round pick year in a team keeper league picked so he was by far the best available the way our waiver system works when you use yours you drop to the bottom im currently third on the wire is williams worth the pickup and dropping to the bottom my other receivers are mike evans kelvin benjamin kevin white and kenny stills i also have woodhead
fantasyfootball,removed,shit doyle rudolph and james are available in my league thinking of dropping ertz for rudolph but doyle far outperformed his projection last week and james looked decent too between these three who is the best pickup
fantasyfootball,removed,i scored pts this week in nonppr i have brady leveon and gordon all waiting to be unleashed feels like i need to make moves now if i wanna be on solid footing for when my reinforcements are released from suspension
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks not sure why i got downvoted if you have any input on gates that would be cool i can spend money on tyrell or just plug gates in my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,my receivers are ty hilton landry and desean jackson now my rb situation is christine michael derrick henry gio and devonta freeman im thinking that i should drop a random bencher for tyrrell williams whats the opinion ppr btw
fantasyfootball,removed,we have a keeper league someone dropped will fuller friday if i waiver him i can have him next year for my tenth rounder but i also have david johnson and jordy as keepers for next is it worth throwing away my claim for fuller
fantasyfootball,removed,bell williams odbhopkins or odbstafforddemarco something like that
fantasyfootball,removed,you win
fantasyfootball,removed,fair offer
fantasyfootball,removed,its overreaching but youd be buying both on the cheap and selling fitz high i think its worth throwing out there
fantasyfootball,removed,dont like this trade
fantasyfootball,removed,nope all i know is patriots d this week is a top play not a tier and top play
fantasyfootball,removed,my thought is youre playing with your baby sister or aunt no one takes this trade
fantasyfootball,removed,id pull the trigger in but ryan shouldnt be sitting out there either
fantasyfootball,removed,dont like this in a ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,you dont have any better trash in a man
fantasyfootball,removed,if thats jordan matthews immediately i like woods the best in there otherwise
fantasyfootball,removed,jonesfullersharpepryor for me
fantasyfootball,removed,ware
fantasyfootball,removed,i think your bid is right i would go slightly less on sanu but if youre desperate youre paying
fantasyfootball,removed,well fuck me
fantasyfootball,removed,like dorsett in there
fantasyfootball,removed,is not that much but something better will come up if you want to sit on your cash
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,again youre playing with a novice if theyre trading a pick who historically starts slow with an injured watkins you should be ashamed to even post this here
fantasyfootball,removed,thats a bit absurd but on you youre only trading one tier player though its two bodies
fantasyfootball,removed,reddit do we drop benjamin for williams
fantasyfootball,removed,yes you should use but someone will outbid you coleman will be a hot pickup
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt bother with either with pick unless waivers reset weekly
fantasyfootball,removed,think you have to go parker until he falls off the radar
fantasyfootball,removed,yes vjax
fantasyfootball,removed,i like dorsett but gio has trade appeal in a team league shop him first
fantasyfootball,removed,sneadfuller
fantasyfootball,removed,fullersanusharpe for me
fantasyfootball,removed,probably ebron
fantasyfootball,removed,isnt this almost proven to be rigged with dkj and fd having bots pre select players or something along those lines i will never understand people who still do this unless you are in a league with friends or just do
fantasyfootball,removed,trade michael thomas for hard hitting jason witten
fantasyfootball,removed,i just got offered freeman for sharpe lol the panic is real
fantasyfootball,removed,should i use the pick to target diggs or sanu keenan allen just went down for me my other receivers are brandon marshall deandre hopkins and kamar aiken
fantasyfootball,removed,id say with keenan allen youll be alright but even then most tes will put up pretty weak games here and there its just a matter of gameflow but going forward theyre going to have to involve him more they can only throw to woodhead so many times
fantasyfootball,removed,my personal opinion is that theyll attempt to get him the career td record for a tight end tony gonzalez currently holds it with gates has so he just needs tds to tie to break if gates manages tds in hell definitely be worth starting
fantasyfootball,removed,i would hold onto gates bad game is too early to be dropping him especially given that the fantasy situation there has changed so much given allens injury hold on for at least one more week and see how he does witten i think may have some good games down the stretch but he just will never be reliable with anyone other than romo under center i know he got a ton of targets from dak but im not convinced yet
fantasyfootball,removed,if youre in ppr id grab witten otherwise gates should be fine san diegos schedule for the next weeks are cake walks compared to kc
fantasyfootball,removed,i agree a healthy gronk would smash that record he just needs to find a way to stay healthy
fantasyfootball,removed,the rawls owner in my league just dropped him im thinking thats worth my right
fantasyfootball,removed,so using on fuller is a bad idea
fantasyfootball,removed,yea if it were me id pick up diggs
fantasyfootball,removed,is woodhead worth a claim you think
fantasyfootball,removed,man league no ppr i drafted wr heavy and took antonio brown allen robinson and jordy nelson with my first picks obviously that screwed my running back position as right now i have matt forte and jamal charles and jeremy hillfoster as back ups so heres the offer jordy nelson and allen robinson for david johnson thoughts his number receiver was kenan allen as he drafted rb heavy so hes desperate for wrs
fantasyfootball,removed,with you wont find a better rb than what youve got on the waivers this year unless something major happens so dont be afraid to use the waiver now diggs is a talented receiver and the vikings best go for it
fantasyfootball,removed,bills couldnt drive and the rushing game went to the outside just no opportunities
fantasyfootball,removed,im still going to hold onto kc but should i pick up baltimore or the packers this week
fantasyfootball,removed,the thing about trump shitposting is that both sides enjoy it
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,all day
fantasyfootball,removed,yup
fantasyfootball,removed,olsen
fantasyfootball,removed,playing with your dad this is lopsided
fantasyfootball,removed,matthews better value in halfppr
fantasyfootball,removed,youre selling very cheap
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys trade your josh gordon for k benjamin in
fantasyfootball,removed,maybe a strange keeper system or league of stoners
fantasyfootball,removed,the junk store called
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys take home over martellus bennett in a ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,is witten a good pickup with ertz out for a few weeks im worried about losing out on ertz later in the season if he comes back ready to go
fantasyfootball,removed,hes hisssterical
fantasyfootball,removed,barnidge you dimwit
fantasyfootball,removed,offer my riddick for his jstew ppr reason i think thats going to be theos best game of the season
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start fuller over alshon ab and kelvin are my other starters
fantasyfootball,removed,lmao cause youre retarded im not joking lmao
fantasyfootball,removed,rudolph sam bradford loves his te
fantasyfootball,removed,im just saying what everyone else is too scared to say
fantasyfootball,removed,drop philly for pitt uquickonthedrawl
fantasyfootball,removed,how is that buying low
fantasyfootball,removed,i would take that trade in a second i feel like you would be losing that trade
fantasyfootball,removed,would that even be considered buying low
fantasyfootball,removed,debating between moncrief and watkins as my third this week i dont know if i call moncrief a safe play
fantasyfootball,removed,udfhhj dfhio dfgjpo dfaqaqqqqqqq
fantasyfootball,removed,pour my dick in your mouth
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,let me spell it out for you since you are a retard i need a sugarmomma
fantasyfootball,removed,its you goddamn bonesmoker
fantasyfootball,removed,im trying to figure out how to turn this into a jew joke any ideas
fantasyfootball,removed,ok you fucking hebe
fantasyfootball,removed,go back to the cfl you whoring bitch
fantasyfootball,removed,mike evans is like the whitest black guy next to the cousin on fresh prince of course
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,arent you fucking jews mostly inbred anyway
fantasyfootball,removed,i didnt know black guys could be named lester
fantasyfootball,removed,boogers are green poop is brown mike evans is a homo because no touchdown
fantasyfootball,removed,my rbs are d murray l murray t rawlst coleman d henry my wrs are o beckham b cooks s watkins t williams am i forced to flex henry next week over rawls andor cooks and watkins
fantasyfootball,removed,youre a fucking retard
fantasyfootball,removed,thats the joke fucktard
fantasyfootball,removed,youre talking about these silly the dont do anything except reproduce the same things they have no incentive to venture out just stay within the pack
fantasyfootball,removed,youre a fucking idiot what im saying is teams like the cardinals are marketing their team every game they cant just go out and throw their scrubs out on the field just because theyre eliminated from the playoffs in fact id say its arguably the opposite if a team had a shit season theyre doing anything in their power to improvenot just lay down because this season is over fans would not be happy ratings would suffer and what would that say about the current coachesplayers who in the organization would even be making the decision to take part in such a strategy please answer those questions before you go downvoting someone that is only trying to save you from your own ignorance
fantasyfootball,removed,sure let us all take the time to coddle each individuals stupid idea go fuck yourself internet policeman
fantasyfootball,removed,youre just soft sorry for hurting your feefees
fantasyfootball,removed,thats kind of the problem i had with your post btw you openly acknowledge the fact you ignored all other realms of decisionmaking and then proceed to get hurt by someone calling you an idiot for calling out that exact thing lol
fantasyfootball,removed,im on board with everyone as far as his volume and involvement in the offense however im in a league that grants for every return yards can you really sit the guy
fantasyfootball,removed,yea i play a fantasy game and know it unlike you knob dicks who actually listen to podcasts and read spreadsheets and then lose bucks on dfs
fantasyfootball,removed,all aboard the hopkins hype train are we at all worried about him matching up with norman next week
fantasyfootball,removed,green is a borderline first round talent of course you take that trade
fantasyfootball,removed,allen robinson
fantasyfootball,removed,try and get golden tate and aj out of him
fantasyfootball,removed,take this trade before the other guy realizes how one sided it is
fantasyfootball,removed,its begun
fantasyfootball,removed,first round hype train all aboooooard
fantasyfootball,removed,everyone thinks josh gordon is a demigod
fantasyfootball,removed,jamaal charles is too good to cede a lot of work
fantasyfootball,removed,gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,flash ahhhhhhhh
fantasyfootball,removed,all aboard
fantasyfootball,removed,httpsgiantgfycatcomlikelyspotlessazurevasewebm
fantasyfootball,removed,i love riddick too hes fun to watch and he won me so many games last year im hoping last year wasnt a fluke but only time will tell as a lions fan their offense always scares me
fantasyfootball,removed,i think bortles is better in fantasy carr might be the better keeper option but he faces the broncoschiefs and i think the jags are more pass heavy and bortles takes more chances down the field
fantasyfootball,removed,fantasyproscom has httpswwwfantasyproscomnfldraftblakebortlesderekcarrphp but ive read so much about his upcoming regression id personally lean toward carr wouldnt blame you for picking bortles though
fantasyfootball,removed,based on last years defensive rankings carr is facing some soft passing ds to start the season the narrative this offseason which i could be convinced of is that bortles production was due to having zero defence and little running game and is expected to regress this year
fantasyfootball,removed,in a keeper league definitely carr i think bortles will have the better season in a passheavy offense and carr has to play the broncos twice a year but next year i think carr will be unstoppable the raiders have been adding a lot of firepower on offense lately and theyre poised to take over the division this year or next year
fantasyfootball,removed,so if i have bell and he gets hurt on the last snap of the game and i still win then i shouldnt have his backup for next week fucking idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,yea but fauria isnt dwayne allen so shutup
fantasyfootball,removed,i think the only real question i have is do i play carr over ryan and cousins in my league
fantasyfootball,removed,he plays the this week this is why you have the anxiety that it might be the one game this season he goes off
fantasyfootball,removed,rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,martin or rawls probably martin but its close
fantasyfootball,removed,was he mexican
fantasyfootball,removed,martin and mccoy
fantasyfootball,removed,crabtree
fantasyfootball,removed,miller and gurley
fantasyfootball,removed,thinking the first three moncrief as the third guy

fantasyfootball,removed,i got baldwin and cooks
fantasyfootball,removed,ty
fantasyfootball,removed,gt crief
fantasyfootball,removed,id roll with kelly
fantasyfootball,removed,m thomas tyrell
fantasyfootball,removed,if reed is out go crowder if not i lean towards mitchell
fantasyfootball,removed,forte miller and ingram imo
fantasyfootball,removed,adams mitchell
fantasyfootball,removed,mccoy and smallwoodgurley depends on what you need
fantasyfootball,removed,thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,tough one lat murray i think

fantasyfootball,removed,martin howard and miller
fantasyfootball,removed,howard ajayi rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,watkins a rob and crabtree
fantasyfootball,removed,i would go with jones and wallace assuming jones plays if not lafell
fantasyfootball,removed,crabtree and thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,amari tyrell crief
fantasyfootball,removed,cooks and jordy crabtree owner
fantasyfootball,removed,watkins i guess but im not confident in it
fantasyfootball,removed,howard and murray
fantasyfootball,removed,hmmmm i might go with sammy on this one
fantasyfootball,removed,julio dez and steve smith
fantasyfootball,removed,cooks crowder and lork tyrell
fantasyfootball,removed,i would flex either rawls or ajayi for sure over those for the wrs id go crabtree and crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,williams
fantasyfootball,removed,mitchell jmatthews boyd
fantasyfootball,removed,id go gordon nobrainer ware rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,id go with your choices martin rawls and howard
fantasyfootball,removed,i think rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,or black i dont judge
fantasyfootball,removed,agree howard and murray
fantasyfootball,removed,hyde and crowell
fantasyfootball,removed,if you had to put money on it what race would it be
fantasyfootball,removed,booker
fantasyfootball,removed,agree with your choices also
fantasyfootball,removed,go with the first three
fantasyfootball,removed,im racist wow youre racist for saying white people do fantasy football yeah its a way street i dont care if im racist or not i dont treat people disrespect whatever they are gay straight bi black white jew mexican if they a bad person then fuck them just my cents
fantasyfootball,removed,booker miller
fantasyfootball,removed,rawls booker gurley
fantasyfootball,removed,howard rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,hill murray
fantasyfootball,removed,forte and rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,still a tough matchup snows in the forecast the hawks still have a decent pass rush and kam chancellor is still hanging around
fantasyfootball,removed,no more duds
fantasyfootball,removed,lets get that quality post tag here mods
fantasyfootball,removed,mercedes benz lewis
fantasyfootball,removed,kind of hard without knowing who is available in your league
fantasyfootball,removed,take a stab at cook again or one of the indy tes
fantasyfootball,removed,allen tye pitta barnidge henry derby and walford are your best bets
fantasyfootball,removed,austin hooper
fantasyfootball,removed,can you post the top or so available options
fantasyfootball,removed,dropped my dick in your mouth for you hur dur
fantasyfootball,removed,i could give a shit less about internet points im sick of seeing these fucking stupid ass posts
fantasyfootball,removed,you can take that david johnson and shove it up your ass
fantasyfootball,removed,hurrr duuurrden
fantasyfootball,removed,i personally liked my delivery
fantasyfootball,removed,theyre not nor do i care if they do think about it fuck you
fantasyfootball,removed,worth rolling with my dick in your mouth
fantasyfootball,removed,keep beating a god damn dead horse with your shit joke
fantasyfootball,removed,im probably going with hill over murray myself hill wrecked the browns last time they played and gio was still splitting carries back then rawls might be better than either though if you believe the hype if it snows that day id go for rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,touch down syndrome always gets a rise out of everyone
fantasyfootball,removed,little sandusky urban achievers
fantasyfootball,removed,one guy drafted two defenses and a kicker before drafting his second rb another guy drafted derek carr in the qb league passing tds worth another guy drafted deandre johnson we do an offline draft we still dont know if he meant andre johnson or deandre washington
fantasyfootball,removed,all my friends are already tired of me bragging about it so now i have to gloat on reddit
fantasyfootball,removed,i got lamar miller round charles jnelson amari cooper my first picks have a huge chance to be top in their positions i know i have a bit of risk with injury but ill take the risk
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,keep lacy try and get rid of rawls and or mathews but there should also be a ton off wr left as free agents read into them more and maybe pick up some high upside guys or just wait and hold off on trading until the first weeks of the season shake out i would not freak out about the wr spot its very deep and everyone should have enough on their teams to not feel weak
fantasyfootball,removed,i drafted him in my league today hoping for a big year especially with mccarthy calling the plays again and a super easy schedule although someone offered me dez and eli for lacy and newton not sure if im going to take it ppr man leage for reference
fantasyfootball,removed,are you intentionally stupid or what
fantasyfootball,removed,how do you feel about taking bell as my second pick overall
fantasyfootball,removed,whats the deal
fantasyfootball,removed,not sure if i should keep brandon marshall in the or say fuck it and keep him in the
fantasyfootball,removed,my preference is httpwwwplayerrankscom includes top newsanalysis and summarizes expert and user draft rankings
fantasyfootball,removed,hes a good bet to get touches with a low price according to this over the last weeks of the season he averaged receiving yards and scored total touchdowns im buying even if its for a season
fantasyfootball,removed,good question i think it updates as experts and users update their rankings online not as quick as reddit
fantasyfootball,removed,it is preseason but langford is looking like an improved runner so far this year im starting to come around on his upside so i would go langford plus as darthstipidious points out parker will last longer in your draft so if you really like him you could still get him a bit easier than youd be able to get langford
fantasyfootball,removed,i drafted devonta freeman last round and keep him all year baby
fantasyfootball,removed,personally you have a passcatching stud with possible upside and youd be trading for blount who could be a dud lets face it and murray who could lose his job to a solid backup i understand you trying to get an advantage right off the hop but id have to see the rest of your team to understand the reasoning because i certainly wouldnt pursue a trade like that
fantasyfootball,removed,nah for trades typically favor the and this is not a rare exception mccoy is a and youre getting a in return
fantasyfootball,removed,if his value is high then you should be to looking to trade up not down remember that you need to drop a player to make room for both of those guys in a trade so in reality its still youre getting the shit end of the stick
fantasyfootball,removed,mirroring what other comments have said thats not good value if you really want to be rid of him find someone who really likes him and push that trade value up you should be able to get at least an and an someones and like latavius and a gio bernard or a like keenan allen and frank gore for one mccoy alternatively let the man have some beast games and trade him then if you really really think hell underachieve the hype you may undervalue him and sell yourself short maybe im pretending lesean has too much value but blount will only be a good play every other game or so his value will drop whenever dion returns and blount is not a pass catching back and latavius is quite solid but is no lesean mccoy how are your other rbs
fantasyfootball,removed,no fuckin way i could explain why n all that but youre losing the best player in that trade at least wait for the season to start but right now we can only base it on projections and potential mccoy has major potential
fantasyfootball,removed,and so the rampant misuse of fantasy terms for this season begins why dont you like mccoy afraid watkins will vulture his touchdowns
fantasyfootball,removed,how is getting latavius murray and blount consider selling high
fantasyfootball,removed,i would do it if you get another players too
fantasyfootball,removed,in real life if i offered you two coins for your bill you would be fine with taking it its free money in fantasy football though you have to have the highest denomination possible because you only get to use a limited number of pieces of currency
fantasyfootball,removed,i have an offer on the table giving my gore for his brown its a different league where its points per carry and point per reception i already have miller charles and mccoy and allen landry and baldwin
fantasyfootball,removed,sos your mom didnt stop half the town from picking her
fantasyfootball,removed,josh gordon went undrafted in my team ppr league i had last pick in the snake order so i have first waiver priority getting back on the hype train choo choo
fantasyfootball,removed,would you keep him in the round in a standard league
fantasyfootball,removed,shouldnt be posted here definitely dion lewis langford may not even keep the starting job all year use the daily thread next time though
fantasyfootball,removed,i like jeremy langford for a team that dump passes frequently dion lewis has huge upside but coming off an injury and no brady for games also not really a workhorse if brady isnt suspended id take dion for the boom otherwise langford should supply a high floor in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,seahawks man seahawks if they had a solid olinesuperbowl favorites
fantasyfootball,removed,are you some sort of analyst or just some asshole on a high horse gb hasnt been committed to running the ball for a long time lacy has the potential to be a stud on another team
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trade r jones or forsett for him straight up i have arian david johnson and cj anderson
fantasyfootball,removed,you salty this injuries on me guys just dropped dgb for him this morning
fantasyfootball,removed,were from kentucky we like our college basketball and our horse racing we either do the ncaa tournament or the ky derby
fantasyfootball,removed,snake smallest penis girth picks first
fantasyfootball,removed,last years winner picks how we decide the order this year was a double decker peanut butter and jelly eating contestwith wonderbread my stomach is not okay
fantasyfootball,removed,pick quarters
fantasyfootball,removed,would you take him
fantasyfootball,removed,nice flair for that breaking news mods
fantasyfootball,removed,that he still sucks
fantasyfootball,removed,hes my round guy i love me some treyvon martinertayvon austin
fantasyfootball,removed,drop dak let someone else make that mistake
fantasyfootball,removed,im in a similst position ppr at the position snake team debating whether to get dj or go for a tier wr like ajg only because i believe in the wrwrwr strategy im assuming ab obj julio go the first anyone got advice
fantasyfootball,removed,that sounds pretty solid
fantasyfootball,removed,i would try to go wrrb since you wont be drafting again until at which point the best rb will probably be forte take miller if hes still available
fantasyfootball,removed,two stud wr will go a long way in ppr wait on your qb then wait longer stockpile your rb and flex starters and dont follow trends if theres a race on tight ends or something dont draft a kicker good luck
fantasyfootball,removed,picks like that youre totally set at wr sit back and then grab some good value rbs next time up
fantasyfootball,removed,id draft the players whom i think will produce the most fantasy points and that are a good value based on their adp so wrwr rbwr rbrb terb tewr it doesnt matter you cant say ill definitely take wrs my first picks because if everyone drafts a wr then it would be best for you to probably draft rbs just look at the current adps judge whom you like over other players with similar adps draft the players you think will do the best near their appropriate adps
fantasyfootball,removed,team leagues lol must be nice
fantasyfootball,removed,julio side is better for wr needs alshon is better for rb needs close imo
fantasyfootball,removed,id say julio side by farrrrrrrrr
fantasyfootball,removed,im in a two keeper league and i have the first pick of the draft the three best guys left on the board are lamar miller brandon marshall and ezekiel elliot i was leaning to miller i think he is a great back and he should do well if he carries the ball like you said though i have lost faith in miller too he has a weak oline and a pretty tough schedule against teams that are good at stopping the run with a younger qb at the helm of the texans i think they are going to stack the box on miller and challenge the qb to pass under pressure it is what i would do an unproven qb i think miller will get volume but mainly and yard carries much like arian foster had last year miller will get some yardage on dump plays and short passes where he can get some open field elliot is dropping in my chart lately too after the romo incident i am actually leaning to marshall eh well see i keep thinking about it
fantasyfootball,removed,where have you been this sub has been commenting exactly that way for months
fantasyfootball,removed,agreed
fantasyfootball,removed,pedantic were talking qualitative assessments of people not bank account amounts and i was only responding to ops usage of average which was clearly meaning middle of the road
fantasyfootball,removed,take the upside
fantasyfootball,removed,b marsh
fantasyfootball,removed,i love gordon later in the draft im trying to be helpful get fucked
fantasyfootball,removed,trade away mike evans frank gore doug martin for keenan allen melvin gordon and deangelo williams should i make this trade i am trying to get keenan and melvin and have been going back and forth with this guy trying to massage this trade but not sure if this is giving up too much
fantasyfootball,removed,i would want to be on the desean jackson side of that trade personally i think hurns suffers the most from a possible jags offensive regression its still very close though
fantasyfootball,removed,hed manually edit the draft history to reflect that this swapped player was drafted
fantasyfootball,removed,hey man send me a private message it sounds like your league mates are trying to trade fuck you i can help you throughout the season
fantasyfootball,removed,it doesnt happen very often if ever yes i think whomever spoke to the commish first would have first choice but ive never seen that occur i agree its probably a bad rule in its vague form as third party i agree w scott commishs rule is only drafted players can be drafted commish contends swapped player is not drafted scott says playerswas drafted commish never implicitly stated that if there is a swapped player that swapped player wouldnt be keeper eligible
fantasyfootball,removed,i draft today at
fantasyfootball,removed,today at est
fantasyfootball,removed,search for the most recent beersheets and read though how to use it on mobile or i would link it choose the right sheet based on your league settings win your league
fantasyfootball,removed,the best way to learn is through experience that being said there are a few easy tips based on dollar budget dont even try going for the big qbs or tes try not to spend more than dollars on your and more than dollars on your te make a budget httpwwwthefantasyfootballauctioncomauctionvalues find players you like so lets say that you like lacy bell and anderson they are going for about dollars so you will budget as your dollars i would budget out your wr and your te i would also budget out or so dollars for the rest of your bench and as a reserve fund if you need to spend a few dollars over your budget dont spend all your money early some of the absolute best values in the auction are late when most of the money has been spent you can get amazing value in the early part of the draft always nominate someone you dont like so you should definitely nominate guys like cam rodgers gronk reed if you plan to go cheap at qb or guys like gurley if youre not budgeting to get a top rb
fantasyfootball,removed,i had you labeled as fantasy fuckwad and now i know why
fantasyfootball,removed,id like to grab kelley but my only droppables are a sharpe and corey coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,speaking of this would you start rgiii against them in week

fantasyfootball,removed,that sure doesnt sound like top end to me what you drafted him and you feel the need to defend him
fantasyfootball,removed,lol shill calls everyone who hates hillary a right wingerper talking points even though im further left then hell ever be im voting stein you moron
fantasyfootball,removed,i know its bad ppr pick terelle pryor cin jordan matthews vs min quincy enunwa vs bal victor cruz vs la sammie coates vs ne pierre garcon detroit i think im avoiding jordan matthews because of the terrible matchup and possibility of his injury affecting him also think im going to avoid coates because of the qb situation and injury cruz garcon and enunwa have pretty good matchups and pryor is pryor but also has an injury help me
fantasyfootball,removed,id take bell over dj any day of the week
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr should i trade away frank gore and mike wallace for stefon diggs and golden tate
fantasyfootball,removed,benching him for britt fwiw
fantasyfootball,removed,its a really tough decision man on one hand you have defense and on the other hand you have fitz and i looked up all the expert opions and they all say you should go to the appropriate location on the subreddit to ask the question
fantasyfootball,removed,roll with larry most trusted target who moves around sherman stays on the outside next time use the wdis thread
fantasyfootball,removed,thought so i wonder if i should drop booker or powell though
fantasyfootball,removed,corey coleman worth a stash
fantasyfootball,removed,leveon actually ran a at the combine which is why he went in the second look at you making up bullshit
fantasyfootball,removed,wdis thread pls also clay is the answer
fantasyfootball,removed,youre an idiot if you base a players skill solely on fantasy points
fantasyfootball,removed,who would you be willing to drop to get him assuming hes available in your league
fantasyfootball,removed,for most teams id say there wasnt a shot in hell this would work but the green bay packers are an interesting outlier because they are publicly owned if enough of their stock owners are ff players i could see it happening
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trade hilton for moncrief
fantasyfootball,removed,the person who came up with it happens to have a good team so this is a good idea is that how it works are you a fucking idiot also just because you think someone might enjoy it doesnt mean its not a stupid fucking idea some people enjoy fucking corpses is that a good idea honestly if youre stupid you just shouldnt talk its embarrassing
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks for the heads up on those players i dunno how that happened if you have a saved version of the sheet that have you issues with the show hide button thatd be useful in figuring out what is going wrong i cant say ive ran into that issue myself but hopefully its just a one time thing i dont think there would be any problems if you were to insert columns at the end of the spreadsheet to have more custom ranks the other option is to just overwrite a column that you dont need the ranks for
fantasyfootball,removed,aj and ingram but who would be the if ingram gone
fantasyfootball,removed,ab obviously edelman jmatt doug
fantasyfootball,removed,would definitely keep will tye and andy dalton
fantasyfootball,removed,you keep brown martin edelman jmatt
fantasyfootball,removed,brown edelman eifert martin
fantasyfootball,removed,pussy holdout and get your money
fantasyfootball,removed,brown and doug martin are keeps
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start moncrief over him denvers corners are no joke but i think luck will throw a lot
fantasyfootball,removed,allen is best of the three imo
fantasyfootball,removed,i like allen best of the three im not sure what he pulled during the game that he felt the need to sit out but i think if he was in he would be getting those doyle targets he also had what yards and a td and the targets were there obviously last week was probably the best matchup the colts will have for a shootout but i think if he stays in the full game he could repeat consistently
fantasyfootball,removed,i drafted gronk and ertz i have waiver priority and ebron is available do i drop ertz to pick him up or drop a scrub off my bench and stash him for trade bait later
fantasyfootball,removed,i can bench either evans allen robinson latavius murray or amari cooper im leaning towards latavius starting dewill spencer ware and all three wrs
fantasyfootball,removed,if i have walford on my bench do i dump him for rudolph
fantasyfootball,removed,oh so a bunch of other lottery tickets that had less than a chance of hitting big but did i would recommend preparing for your drafts instead go fuck yourself you self important cunt
fantasyfootball,removed,should i play him over james white this week
fantasyfootball,removed,kind of matters on the combination of whos on your team what you need and whos on the waiver wire were not mind readers
fantasyfootball,removed,whats the point of owning an unstartable player nice roster move champ
fantasyfootball,removed,horrible trade but your league rules dont exist to combat stupidity only cheating i would not undo if theres a heavy bit of angst have him post on msg boards acknowledging that it was intentional
fantasyfootball,removed,like folks have mentioned depends on what the league means to you if its with friends try to work it out if theres money involved think it through if its some random casual im pulling a cartman
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt roster tes
fantasyfootball,removed,taylor looks like shit dalton or ryan are upgrades i lean daltonryan but either is a good move
fantasyfootball,removed,clearly
fantasyfootball,removed,for this week yah but youre streaming from there
fantasyfootball,removed,just traded bell for julio a couple days ago he needed a rb i needed a wr
fantasyfootball,removed,im personally grabbing tamme targets equal to julio and sanu i want to see where this goes now the question is should i drop cameron for him
fantasyfootball,removed,depends on bench depth assuming you have a quality starter typically youre only rostering to prevent someone else or use for trade bait andor byes otherwise flipping matchups
fantasyfootball,removed,so should i start shepard
fantasyfootball,removed,someone offered me j stew and amari cooper for mike evans take it
fantasyfootball,removed,am i crazy to consider playing him over evans patrick peterson looked pretty solid sunday night
fantasyfootball,removed,tsmith looked old and useless i think its a minor upgrade
fantasyfootball,removed,shepfullersharpewilliams
fantasyfootball,removed,yes i would prioritize ware for the shorter term and youre a jamaal owner how you got that line up is beyond me though
fantasyfootball,removed,hold houston
fantasyfootball,removed,maybe sanu but not sure why youre rushing it
fantasyfootball,removed,probably
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,tajae
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt hes valuable enough to trade
fantasyfootball,removed,yes to both coleman would be a score too might want to flip morris for him
fantasyfootball,removed,sure
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,whats in free agency
fantasyfootball,removed,rodgers
fantasyfootball,removed,bortles of beer on the wall
fantasyfootball,removed,bennett is trash go for it
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,im taking nyj
fantasyfootball,removed,play him over fitz
fantasyfootball,removed,he got so many targets im tempted to try and pick him up for ebron not too sure
fantasyfootball,removed,i take that to mean youre a bernie supporter preemptively downvoting you
fantasyfootball,removed,so i have keenan and my options to replace him are fuller snead or sanders
fantasyfootball,removed,if your rbs right now are duke johnson and deandre washington and i offered you latavius murray yeldon and charles sims for bell would you accept it i am trying to make a trade with the bell owner but i want it to be fair
fantasyfootball,removed,im thinking about playing snead over demaryius thomas is that colts d matchup too good to pass up
fantasyfootball,removed,is eli worth a or ww pick idk if i should get him i dont really need wr currently
fantasyfootball,removed,should i trade eagles d for patriots d
fantasyfootball,removed,i just got offered travis benjamin for dez
fantasyfootball,removed,are sanu and sharpe looking better to producers
fantasyfootball,removed,open bench spot rip allen john brown devantee parker matt jones jimmy grahm davante adams eli rodgers i pick up one of the first right which one
fantasyfootball,removed,dump coby fleener for him
fantasyfootball,removed,ive been debating all morning id i should drop him for ebron
fantasyfootball,removed,someone dropped tyler eifert in my league for a qb i have gates but given eiferts effort last year should i waste my waiver pick this week to get him regardless even if gates turns out to be great this year eifert could become trade bait
fantasyfootball,removed,batch process staggered
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,depends on roster depth probably
fantasyfootball,removed,are you carrying tes cook will have good weeks but wont be consistent id add a receiver sure though thats scraping at the bottom might lean cruzhoganwilliamsagholor
fantasyfootball,removed,ivory or cmike would wait a little closer to weekend so they dont clear waivers if thats an option
fantasyfootball,removed,your backs are superior
fantasyfootball,removed,would drop rishard for colemansanu
fantasyfootball,removed,yeldon will have the lions share of touches for one more week but abdullah actually looked decent id probably hold one more week team there will be plenty of options throughout the year
fantasyfootball,removed,i like tye the most from this group
fantasyfootball,removed,ryan maybe but theyre close to equivalent in my book
fantasyfootball,removed,not a fan of two mouths to feed from same house but the move was fine you may want to try to package one away
fantasyfootball,removed,seconded
fantasyfootball,removed,forsett
fantasyfootball,removed,i like allen but both are serviceable pick the one you want to root for
fantasyfootball,removed,wallace
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,i like allen
fantasyfootball,removed,probably but wheaton will get back into rhythm sooner than later
fantasyfootball,removed,diggs dorsett wheaton have solid potential as well
fantasyfootball,removed,rudolph
fantasyfootball,removed,probably not but rishard was invisible make the move and cut kerley in a week or two when he inevitably fades
fantasyfootball,removed,might think about cutting eifert for allen
fantasyfootball,removed,white should be superior unless youre assuming rjennings will blow out his knee
fantasyfootball,removed,tes is silly especially in a league that big trade them away or make the move
fantasyfootball,removed,rivers sucked without keenan last year i would cut him for rb or wr personally and pick up alex later if needed
fantasyfootball,removed,cmike probably but would wait closer to the weekend so no one can grab him
fantasyfootball,removed,si
fantasyfootball,removed,youre good
fantasyfootball,removed,yes drop blount for rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,barner will not see the pigskin mckinnon better lottery ticket nothing else in free agency
fantasyfootball,removed,nope
fantasyfootball,removed,yep
fantasyfootball,removed,why would you veto this is fine helping a team is not collusion
fantasyfootball,removed,they are just abusing the taco these should not be vetoed
fantasyfootball,removed,if you cant help the guy learn for next year cut him from the league but these trades are not enough to warrant overturning
fantasyfootball,removed,im going ryanwinstonflacco here but feel theyre all within a low percentage of each other
fantasyfootball,removed,dont annoint wentz as the second coming yet dont get too cute winston here
fantasyfootball,removed,luck rhymes with yuck
fantasyfootball,removed,stafford
fantasyfootball,removed,winston
fantasyfootball,removed,eli
fantasyfootball,removed,bortles of beer
fantasyfootball,removed,cmon rodgers is tier qb flacco is a flaccid dick

fantasyfootball,removed,not touching tyrod
fantasyfootball,removed,like ryan
fantasyfootball,removed,leaning palmer
fantasyfootball,removed,not touching tyrod
fantasyfootball,removed,carr
fantasyfootball,removed,theyre in order already
fantasyfootball,removed,cousins for one week dalton for longer term hold
fantasyfootball,removed,wilson if he starts
fantasyfootball,removed,rodgers
fantasyfootball,removed,winston
fantasyfootball,removed,palmer
fantasyfootball,removed,leaning luck here but should be close on paper
fantasyfootball,removed,ne turd
fantasyfootball,removed,ryan
fantasyfootball,removed,they should be close to each other on the board im leaning stafford
fantasyfootball,removed,no tyrod no sir would take the ne guy for one game
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont know he is pretty tempting i already have dwayne allen and delanie walker so that would not make sense to me correct
fantasyfootball,removed,id take sharpe all day and im a packers fan
fantasyfootball,removed,is this a money league i would leave
fantasyfootball,removed,the mobile clients are not as feature rich gotta go to web
fantasyfootball,removed,problem with that is that all bids will be visible
fantasyfootball,removed,you could determine a fair market value per player k dst typically wont command massive price or arbitrarily bill him i like the idea of dividing by weeks remaining
fantasyfootball,removed,let the trade go through
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop barnidge for tyrell williams if you already have olsen or keep him to see if he offers any trade value after a couple weeks with mccown ppr league wrs marshall watkins crabtree lockett john brown will fuller
fantasyfootball,removed,is allen hurns a better pickup over the course of the season than parker
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop barnidge for tyrell williams if you already have olsen or keep him to see if he offers any trade value after a couple weeks with mccown ppr league wrs marshall watkins crabtree lockett john brown will fuller
fantasyfootball,removed,philly has a bye week and a tough interstate matchup before then i like cox for this week but mccoy for the longer haul
fantasyfootball,removed,gore has more value right now and is currently used more in passing game than freeman
fantasyfootball,removed,zrke elliott
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,wheaton will be back and take the targets
fantasyfootball,removed,you may need to take thompson then though i still like kelleys outlook on the team more during the longer season
fantasyfootball,removed,shopping for gurley or cj anderson i have lot of wrs
fantasyfootball,removed,yes overreacting but im in same boat when a kicker screws me like that he finds himself on waivers id wait for uphoecesbrown or uvirmd to come out with projections before moving
fantasyfootball,removed,i would flip him for ebron personally
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,trying to trade for him right now rb wr flex his proposal was for cj i am really high on cooks though thinking he can finish in top wr
fantasyfootball,removed,jbrown or crabs ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,cobb
fantasyfootball,removed,matthews marshall
fantasyfootball,removed,fading dez but not for wallace
fantasyfootball,removed,this is all junk pick the one you want to root for most probably would go lockettwilliamswhiterogers assumign wilson plays
fantasyfootball,removed,painful watkins if he plays i suppose youve got them listed in order id go
fantasyfootball,removed,targets last week and gates are both fa in my man ppr not sure who to pick up since i want to bench barnidge this week
fantasyfootball,removed,keep ware ask him if he wants that deal when you see his role when charles is back youre trading away a current for a timeshare nightmare
fantasyfootball,removed,ware is more valuable than coleman right now
fantasyfootball,removed,ware is a guarantee currently with charles out while coleman is still in the well run with the hot hand committee id hold off a couplle weeks at least to see how colemans situation shakes out and should charles go down again you already know what youll be expecting
fantasyfootball,removed,i think coleman has the higher ceiling than ware hes already proven himself a stud and has done well enough so that atlanta is looking at moving to an rbbc if freeman goes down coleman becomes the guy and youll have an absolute beast ware while he does have a high ceiling if charles goes down still has west and charles as part of an rbbc which are more mouths to feed and charles when he comes back will demand more because of the name its a tough call but i think id rather have coleman just because he seems to be in a better position to win the role back from freeman than ware can from charles
fantasyfootball,removed,until you can say for certain when or if charles is coming back treat him as an as far as im concerned hes a part of my starting lineup until i see charles play for a full quarter would you trade cj anderson for coleman cause thats what we got from ware and what we stand to get this week and possibly week possibly week etc when reid says the words charles will be back this sunday or someone offers a starting player in a trade you can proceed

fantasyfootball,removed,probay be back next week hes practicing fine and ware is a little banged up they probably play it safe again this week since ware was good and then bring him back next week on a full week of practice with the team
fantasyfootball,removed,nice write up dude would you go abdullah or steve smith in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,randall cobb in ppr i need a rb bad before jamaal charles comes back and spencer ware stops being my rb
fantasyfootball,removed,im so much more indecisive on what to this week i have both brees and manning and im leaning towards manning this week but i cant ignore brees talent i have dj and jennings as rb and feel ok about that but then i have mike evans larry fitz willie snead will fuller mohammed sanu and doug baldwin im leaning towards fitz snead and fuller this week im not sure how evans will do with peterson following him and sanu might be hampered by his ankle and then there is russell wilson who is injured so that might hurt baldwin production theres also maclin on the waiver any input or help here

fantasyfootball,removed,will fuller
fantasyfootball,removed,i have jennings murray riddick and snead last week i started jennings and murray as my rbs and riddick as my flex regretted not moving riddick to the starting spot over jennings and snead as my flex should i do the same as last week or slide snead in
fantasyfootball,removed,as of now should i start either ty hilton marvin jones tajae sharpe over dt
fantasyfootball,removed,so i should hold off on this trade im looking at my dez and tyrell williams for his mark ingram and sanu ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,drop eric ebron for him
fantasyfootball,removed,anyone riding this dude this week thinking about him over moncrief
fantasyfootball,removed,do you think it is worth to drop sss for him i mean sss got targets against of tyrell
fantasyfootball,removed,i own both him and t benjamin and i need to start one of them at its kind of interesting because theyre both going to have to step up with allen out what do you guys think i guess im imagining that williams has a higher ceiling
fantasyfootball,removed,i bring this up because im lucky enough to be a gurleydj owner in a keeper league and am i crazy in benching gurley for rashad i love my other flex options langford foster maclin thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,i got ware elliot and rashadi think i gotta sit rashad
fantasyfootball,removed,there is a wdis thread head over there but i would bench gurley for rashad
fantasyfootball,removed,im surprised theyve stuck with him this long to be honest chiefs have some quality backs at and couldve easily flipped the contract to oakland or washington etc
fantasyfootball,removed,he vacations in jamaica
fantasyfootball,removed,start e sanders or tajae sharpe for a flex this week detroit secondary pretty suspect while you can figure on denver looking to the rb position against the colts
fantasyfootball,removed,tyrod is crap
fantasyfootball,removed,probably not
fantasyfootball,removed,ad
fantasyfootball,removed,no though jets will outscore them this week if you have any other excess garbage you can flip it for nyj and bench az but dont cut them outright
fantasyfootball,removed,hes junk
fantasyfootball,removed,no sir
fantasyfootball,removed,nope
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,no reason to carry tes cut junkstore barnidge but for rb or wr
fantasyfootball,removed,cut bait on useless tyrod
fantasyfootball,removed,package tate in a trade before cutting him
fantasyfootball,removed,bad idea
fantasyfootball,removed,skins
fantasyfootball,removed,shouldve clarified in league constitution before the season
fantasyfootball,removed,horrible trade but vetoes are the devil let the taco die
fantasyfootball,removed,the system wont screw you but you wont get the player until week
fantasyfootball,removed,quit the league rebuild it somewhere else and have the other owners follow you if you want to stay with the group thats pure cheating
fantasyfootball,removed,tough shit

fantasyfootball,removed,sitting dt parker
fantasyfootball,removed,fitz and crabs
fantasyfootball,removed,hilton
fantasyfootball,removed,right now i have him starting over doug baldwin and tyrell williams as my flex very unsure about it though
fantasyfootball,removed,i own coleman and i want to trade him to the freeman owner in my league for a receiver but the dude has no good receivers i need a keenan allen replacement how am i gonna fleece people when their teams suck
fantasyfootball,removed,im pretty worried because he was my round pick its between him sims and crowell this week in ppr and im stuck
fantasyfootball,removed,also would it be dumb to give up cja for him
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys take lamar miler over him im afraid of defenses stacking the box at all times for the rest of the season resulting games like this to happen more and more
fantasyfootball,removed,trade my julius thomas for his chris ivory i have reed ingram foster and a bench of scrubs he has cook forte david johnson
fantasyfootball,removed,thinking of letting go jordan matthews for rawls am i giving away too much
fantasyfootball,removed,ebron
fantasyfootball,removed,throw the jew down the well
fantasyfootball,removed,idk about julio hes scary for what the reports are saying how hell be used idt kelvin is gonna do much since haywood shutdown mike evans so thats saying alot id do floyd cause miami looks like theyre giving up alot to receivers its really julio or floyd pending on what they say julio will dobe decoy ect
fantasyfootball,removed,for your situation i would wait for game morning reports on julio better for gabriel if julio is active and the weather in buffalo i think britt actually has a higher floor than sammy and gabriel but not sure about his ceiling with goff
fantasyfootball,removed,its fantasy football fuckface hes not stealing his girl the guy should be able to do his own research in the playoffs nothing scummy at all about that
fantasyfootball,removed,i hope youre trolling because thats just ridiculous friends joke and try and mislead their friends in fantasy football all the time
fantasyfootball,removed,ive used peterson daycare the last two years have drafted adp both years too

fantasyfootball,removed,no ray rice jokes gay
fantasyfootball,removed,what does this do for wes welkers value going into the season
fantasyfootball,removed,make me one for sandusys revenge por favor
fantasyfootball,removed,game suspension release him hes not worth for of the season this top rule sounds stupid but it makes it even more compelling to release him i like cj at but i know a lot of people got burned by cj last year and are gun shy i think he was battling through injuries and once he was fully recovered and given some trust to be the guy for denver he performed pretty well
fantasyfootball,removed,is there a folder for the custom requested sheets i think it was last season where they were listed by the names sent in with each sheet if there is i must have missed the link and excuse my ignorance
fantasyfootball,removed,lets just say its the and i already picked someone with my who would you take
fantasyfootball,removed,deandre washington
fantasyfootball,removed,antonio brown julio jones aj green todd gurley and lamar miller
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah because the hive mind traditionally dislikes drafting a te before has been selected but i say boo to that i might even talk myself into taking gronk overall and virtually guarantee myself at least one positional advantage over my opponent every week
fantasyfootball,removed,there is no gray area in this debate its either regression or top wr we need a public overunder lets put our reddit reps on the line
fantasyfootball,removed,rbs are important but they are way more prone to injury its so baffling to me to see so much indifference to taking gronk early
fantasyfootball,removed,i think hopkins is one of the most difficult players to evaluate you know the previous qbs were terrible but you dont know if osweiler is any better you know that his of targets has to come down but on the other hand he was still efficient with that many targets they say they want to run the ball but doesnt everyone say that in preseason
fantasyfootball,removed,bull shit if you really like him there is no bad spot to take him in round anybody who wont be available with your pick is a fine pick in non ppr an rb has a higher ceiling but the top wrs are ranked higher because of safety i would take one of the top wrs that early but if you want a back and think hes the guy then you absolutely go for it
fantasyfootball,removed,id take ap in that spot
fantasyfootball,removed,ap all day
fantasyfootball,removed,brown all day
fantasyfootball,removed,i personally would keep julio at but you cant go wrong with ab at one of those two for sure
fantasyfootball,removed,i never agreed with this until recently when i got past my te bias and looked at the value it comes down to would you rather have gronk and allen hurns or hopkins and zach miller its a wr and a te combo after all
fantasyfootball,removed,for creative censorship
fantasyfootball,removed,same boat here this just reaffirms my gut feeling
fantasyfootball,removed,theres plenty of rationale that miller will have a better year but theres no proof of it if youre just looking at expected value outside of beating another kid aps is higher because his uncertainty is much much lower
fantasyfootball,removed,im still taking ap in your scenario id even take ap over david johnson since its not ppr then i cant argue aj as well as i would like to lamar over deandre though thats for sure
fantasyfootball,removed,i know this isnt the thread but i think its relevant to the discussion would you keep hopkins in the second round pick overall
fantasyfootball,removed,my second keeper is doug baldwin whom i get to keep as a rounder i have jared reed tyler locket carson palmer who would both occupy my round denard robinson micheal floyd john brown tj yeldon i am unsure where these players would fall without being at my computer oh i also have forte but he would be a first round so no thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,wouldnt drafting gronk with the pick in the first round be a little early in a standard nonppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,everyone will tell you julio but i say pick the guy you want there are worse decisions to be stuck with personally if its non ppr i see no problem taking beckham but with ppr its hard to not say jones if that voice telling you odell is making sense to you then maybe you should listen
fantasyfootball,removed,julio is probably the safer pick based on his targets but obj has been trending up since college and could get even better for what its worth though there was a thread on this yesterday that probably has more answers than this one will get
fantasyfootball,removed,julio pretty obviously
fantasyfootball,removed,this may sound stupid but based off the immaturity we saw last year when confronted with josh norman obj plays him twice and the first time week if it goes well hes fine if he gets beat shut down or worse acts up and catches a suspension so i also concur that julio is the safer pick there but obj should be gone by the overall and at the latest overall
fantasyfootball,removed,hes been seen on the sidelines having bootyos to ensure he isnt booty
fantasyfootball,removed,i completely agree the only reason why i would consider going with miller over ap is because if their backups i feel that mckinnon is a far better player than alfred blue is
fantasyfootball,removed,late early early
fantasyfootball,removed,depends on the draft pool and your keepers imo for example in my keeper league there are a few elite options available but a lot of the late guys are kept so the value of a late pick drops in that case id choose an early pick and get a stud
fantasyfootball,removed,dmjn
fantasyfootball,removed,i inevitably draft a shitty worthless te and stream shitty worthless tes
fantasyfootball,removed,lamar especially if its non ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,lamar
fantasyfootball,removed,miller but also is dependent on what draft position you are in could snag both
fantasyfootball,removed,the texans strength is not in their oline that is simply false
fantasyfootball,removed,im in a similar situation and im taking peterson in a heartbeat in a ppr i might lean more toward green or hopkins but i think out of any rb in the first two rounds peterson is the safest hes low risk and decently high reward he might not have the bigger upside of gurley or dj or some other guys but he has a lot less risk too in a bigger league i tend to value safety in the first round over slightly higher reward but bigger risk imo you generally dont win a deeper league with your first round pick but you can easily lose it
fantasyfootball,removed,gimme aj green over both
fantasyfootball,removed,targets in a season puts him in the top for most targets in a season of all time
fantasyfootball,removed,most people will tell you peterson just because elliott is an unknown commodity that is risky in the first round in general i personally like zeke tho i think he will live to the hype handcuffs are pretty important for those two imo
fantasyfootball,removed,fantasy help week alshon against hou d michael floyd against ne d or crabtree against no d
fantasyfootball,removed,correct sammie coats was notoriously awful around the goal linered zone in college although i do think its funny that you think its ridiculous to speculate that a te with career catches will be a possible goal line threat but it isnt ridiculous to speculate that wr with career catches and really really really bad hands in previous years will be good there source attended auburnauburn fan
fantasyfootball,removed,would it be crazy if i drafted amari in the round at pick in a standard league
fantasyfootball,removed,good info thoughts on drafting amari cooper at pick
fantasyfootball,removed,i really like your thinking if you have the pick in a team standard league like i do would you draft ap over aj green deandre hopkins and allen robinson
fantasyfootball,removed,and you think his targets will somehow drop did the texans add some new wr or te who will deprive him of looks i dont understand
fantasyfootball,removed,i drafted edelman and i havent started him yet this year patriots are really fun to watch but i dont trust this qb situation edelman has been alright but i think snead and crowder are better options i think you should go with crowder though slot receivers are murdering the browns
fantasyfootball,removed,how would you guys feel about trading blount for amari cooper
fantasyfootball,removed,are you confident in making the playoffs winstons schedule is rough now but cake later
fantasyfootball,removed,quincy enunwa or steve smith this week
fantasyfootball,removed,brissett is available haha just kidding not much fitz bradford its a rough spot dropped flacco to snag wentz before someone else did and thenfoudn out about gordon tried to get flacco but he got chosen ahead of me
fantasyfootball,removed,baltimore has a shit run game oakland has a shit pass defense pats will be running garoppolo is coming off an injury go with flacco
fantasyfootball,removed,i should drop bortles for him right
fantasyfootball,removed,crabtree easily baltimore may look like they are good against the pass but they havent really faced any good offenses and they have still gotten burned heavily junk time by cle and jax
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr enunwa or dwayne washington
fantasyfootball,removed,im in the same exact situation so i have those two and i can stream osweiler siemian dont know how to spell bradford gabbert hoyer i have jimmy g starting right now over wilson
fantasyfootball,removed,i thought landry was my best bet this week and he got so going for another opinion on my other receiver spot no ppr i have a flex spot but id start rbs this week if i could so thats taken diggs vs nyg marshall vs sea crowder vs cle fuller vs ten hurns vs ind im currently starting diggs and i could be swayed easily towards marshallcrowder
fantasyfootball,removed,i feel like youre crazy for sitting jones over pryor
fantasyfootball,removed,no i did it was just my opinion that jones is the guy you should go with if you want robinsonmarshallpryor id say pryor youre right about robinson marshall is clearly the best wr but i dont think seattles d lets the ball get to him this is coming from a marshall owner
fantasyfootball,removed,reading comprehension jesus im sorry i edited my post youre right about robinson
fantasyfootball,removed,what if i was giving up adam humphries instead of tyrell williams
fantasyfootball,removed,i just got offered christine michael to give up jamaal charles charles has the bigger upside so i should just stick with him right
fantasyfootball,removed,what if that player on waivers was moncrief in a man ppr league i picked up ertz to cover kelce next week ive got rodgers and have plugged in prescott this week my other receivers are tate dez enunwa and beasley i was thinking of dropping prescott starting rodgers and picking up moncrief alternatively i could drop ertz pickup moncrief and figure out how to cover kelce next week
fantasyfootball,removed,im and was feeling confident until dez went down and gordon decided to fuck us all suppose ill play it safe and try to grab moncrief in the coming weeks once i can reassess who i can drop
fantasyfootball,removed,neither is a bad matchup i would go with riddick since hes more dependable now that abdullah is gone not always the case obviously but it wouldnt be weird if coleman scores even if its against the panthers go with your gut but id give riddick the slight edge
fantasyfootball,removed,coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,i would do this without thinking watkins is done for the foreseeable future and theres no reason to roster him
fantasyfootball,removed,demaryius thomas vs tampa or terelle pryor vs washington nonppr tough decision
fantasyfootball,removed,go frig yourself
fantasyfootball,removed,what would you guys say about dropping hurns for enunwa
fantasyfootball,removed,drop artis payne for enunwa
fantasyfootball,removed,was offered mark ingram for pryor i get pryor thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck this guy im benching cooks trying to get rid of that neeguh
fantasyfootball,removed,dont be a dick and go fuck urself in the ass charles reigns supreme
fantasyfootball,removed,not what she said
fantasyfootball,removed,play jacquizz over mike wallace havent heard anything back in the sticky thread
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start gronk or brate i need help
fantasyfootball,removed,start gronk or kyle rudolph
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start him over tyrell williams the weather in the skinsravens game is making me nervous
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop davante parker for him
fantasyfootball,removed,debating between enunwa and ryan mathews in my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,drop tyrell for hogan
fantasyfootball,removed,is there any situation where i should play enunwa over julio jones mike evans and ty hilton today
fantasyfootball,removed,i know this isnt a wdis thread but since youre telling me to start him i have to ask would you play him over pryor ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,drop travis benjamin or theo riddick in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr dont know which wr to roll with for my flex marvin jones jr travis benjamin
fantasyfootball,removed,would you rather steve smith or eddie royoal
fantasyfootball,removed,dont start golden taint
fantasyfootball,removed,play tate i know he will not fail you
fantasyfootball,removed,hey there are specific threads for these question it kind of clogs up the subreddit for people to post every individual question like this i would start djax
fantasyfootball,removed,it will be a windy fuckfest in baltimore id usually say desean the way tate hasnt been performing but with the weather id go tate today
fantasyfootball,removed,now that edlfoot is confirm activedo i start bmarsh or edlfoot
fantasyfootball,removed,ok last time i ask enunwa or shepard
fantasyfootball,removed,but hes out
fantasyfootball,removed,ive tried in the wdis paxton lynch or hoyer im projected to lose by
fantasyfootball,removed,should i flex royal or matt jones in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,blount or shady mccoy
fantasyfootball,removed,happy sunday ya fucks t pryor or randall cobb i gotta go pryor right
fantasyfootball,removed,can someone cut asiatas knees out or something why does he get all of the carries from the as if mckinnon couldnt have done that
fantasyfootball,removed,this guy is fucking trash i regret taking him immensely
fantasyfootball,removed,wow youre stupid

fantasyfootball,removed,gonna be hard to do on a bye
fantasyfootball,removed,facing riddick bennett vikings d points guys entire team scored the week before now i remember why i stopped playing fantasy

fantasyfootball,removed,i need jacquizz to get me points to get the w choo choo motherfuckers
fantasyfootball,removed,should i trade howard for dez
fantasyfootball,removed,fucking ridiculous to drop cobb at this point in any league with more than teams
fantasyfootball,removed,this is like the worst place to ask that but wait for quickonthedraws rankings to come out tuesday morning to decide
fantasyfootball,removed,its what allah wanted
fantasyfootball,removed,howd that go
fantasyfootball,removed,still sure that it was cja that was the problem and not the offensive line andor booker games say otherwise
fantasyfootball,removed,gordon is now a top dynasty asset you still think hes practice squad level
fantasyfootball,removed,as a bears fan i just cannot trust alshon to play a full season and he is always sitting there in the i would go ty alshon dt then cooks i am down on cooks since brees has more toys hoping dts talent gets him more receptions in what looks to be a shitty offense
fantasyfootball,removed,off the top of my head whichever of the two leagues you arent in will need to add a spot for you to be commissioner of that league or someone you trust will have to be commissioner and assign you cocommissioner status if you go the team route then youll want to edit the weekly matchups so that you have the bye every week youll also want to edit your roster predraft using keeper settings to fill it with string players so that you dont slow down the other draft also a good idea is to open the draft settings for each league in separate windows side by side and scroll through to ensure the settings are exactly the same on both
fantasyfootball,removed,should i keep him in the or jamaal in the
fantasyfootball,removed,torn acl mcl and meniscus first play of the season
fantasyfootball,removed,uh no not at all just wanted some arbitrary opinions thanks for being antagonistic for no reason though sorry your life is so whack you feel the need to try and find things wrong with peoples posts hope things turn around for you you can also stop replying since i sincerely dont give a shit what your opinion is you salty bitch

fantasyfootball,removed,a little quick kneejerk also how is watkins not locked diggs may become valueable after today though could be your last chance to add him
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start sharpe or lockette over dt this week this is screaming decoy but i fell for dt every goddamn week last year
fantasyfootball,removed,i think moncrieff despite the d he is playing i am sitting thomas this week who knows how healthy he is might play all snaps might play and the williams hype train has taken off but we havent seen what he can do yet moncrieff has lucks trust and a td in the bank so far
fantasyfootball,removed,start agholor or dt out of desperation i was low points leader last week in my league aint going through that bullshit again
fantasyfootball,removed,okay now do i start dt over stefon different dez or fitzgerald in a league
fantasyfootball,removed,until he proves his worth of a first rounder he sits i have guys in better matchups on better offenses youre an idiot if you sit gurley its pretty simple its not even a debate youre wrong and im right go away
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start diggs sharpe marvin jones or ty hilton over dt im a bit worried
fantasyfootball,removed,yup sitting a top running back is a dumb move made by dumb people who frankly have zero business playing fantasy
fantasyfootball,removed,im not being an ass im simply pointing out how stupid the guy who said hes benching gurley is im doing him a favor by pointing out how wrong he is anyone who disagrees with me is frankly an idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,youre wrong im right conversation is over and youre obviously not good at fantasy football nor are you very intelligent as i said the discussion is over im right youre wrong
fantasyfootball,removed,if you do that youre stupid im right and anyone who disagrees with me is wrong
fantasyfootball,removed,its not stupid for everyone more confident in stewart getting than i am gurley however more confident in gurley getting no its stupid for everyone not even a debate end of story
fantasyfootball,removed,bashaud breeland is a trash bag floating around on the field when the redskins defense is on the field i know ive been watching them lose every week for years where they both are in their careers right now dez will absolutely torch breeland on routes and the safety help wont matter just watch
fantasyfootball,removed,james green celek miller pitta my best avaible options thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,morris or crowell this week
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop deandre washington for morris or ivory ivory was just dropped this morning i do not have latavius
fantasyfootball,removed,smart trade what do you guys think of a demarco murray for jamaal charles trade guy in my league just offered
fantasyfootball,removed,a medium size load to disappointing all of us here looking up for a huge load
fantasyfootball,removed,start mccown and barnidge or luck and dwayne allen
fantasyfootball,removed,jordan matthews or floyd i feel like its a coin flip this week
fantasyfootball,removed,do it feels good man httpimgurcomnull
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr landry floyd or baldwin
fantasyfootball,removed,man its a tough call for me at flex between him and yeldon in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,i have him but cant justify benching cooks or jordan matthews
fantasyfootball,removed,would you flex him over jason witten
fantasyfootball,removed,matthews
fantasyfootball,removed,i traded him for brady and melvin gordon and im very happy while he rides the bench for their team today
fantasyfootball,removed,hey man floyd cobb or sharpe as my standard scoring
fantasyfootball,removed,its between floyd and mike evans any suggestions im torn mike evans is great but up against the arizona defense he might not score that much at least floyd will have a chance
fantasyfootball,removed,would you flex him over sterling shepard or cruz vs new orleans
fantasyfootball,removed,im struggling on this as well ppr and i cant decide between floyd or riddick for my flex thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr golden tate vs titans or eli rogers vs bengals obvious choice for me is tate but he burned me hard last year and im feeling like this year will be more of the same
fantasyfootball,removed,floyd over edelman
fantasyfootball,removed,considering by qbs were bortals and tannehill ill work
fantasyfootball,removed,doing standard should i start him over benjamin carolina kelvin had a solid game last week and i feel like the offense can handle the sf defense
fantasyfootball,removed,standard – need stewart landry snead fitzgerald im down big because my opponent had shady forte and decker play already
fantasyfootball,removed,why would you do a survivor not hosted on some site thats lunacy
fantasyfootball,removed,sure but why reward the same mediocre teams with top tier fas every single week i dont find it fair
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr teams i might be crazy but do i start him over dez
fantasyfootball,removed,floyd or marvin jones
fantasyfootball,removed,jennings or floyd for the flex in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start michael floyd over michael crabtree vs atl
fantasyfootball,removed,mods banned me for calling the op of a similar post a clown just so you know i stand by my statement anyone who does this multiple times is a clown
fantasyfootball,removed,bortles
fantasyfootball,removed,im still trying to decide between floyd and ryan mathews in my flex spot this week
fantasyfootball,removed,my other options is rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,start him over marvin jones
fantasyfootball,removed,im stuck too with floyd at the flex i have sanders s shepard freeman or rawls my two wr are j jones and allen robinson my rbs ware and woodhead i am in ppr league any suggestions
fantasyfootball,removed,start over snead giants
fantasyfootball,removed,floyd or rawls aaaaahhh
fantasyfootball,removed,ware or demarco im very torn seems like they have similar floors ceilings
fantasyfootball,removed,nate solder is back bennett or virgil ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start sanu or tajae sharpe at flex i cant decide sanu was great last week but i expect more from julio and tajae got a lot of targets any ideas
fantasyfootball,removed,allen robinson or kelvin benjamin
fantasyfootball,removed,id start him over langford possibly riddick if you arent in a ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start rawls or lacy
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr pick two yeldon murray foster

fantasyfootball,removed,about time
fantasyfootball,removed,murray
fantasyfootball,removed,sadness squad checking in for the second week after finally benching mathews this morning due to the insurmountable mountain of positive reviews for stewart im looking at a grim beginning to the season unless gates and arob can pull off a miracle plus foster is injured again and cam keeps racking up points on me nbsp who would guess that decker bmarsh and marvin jones ab
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck you fucking idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,gio had a huge game but hope you kept sims
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,you dont mean it you fucking coward
fantasyfootball,removed,tyrell hype train full steam ahead choo choooooooo
fantasyfootball,removed,because youre a coward who deletes his comments if you get too many downvotes
fantasyfootball,removed,i want the colts to score here so denver has to do something with dt and cj
fantasyfootball,removed,is there a question here
fantasyfootball,removed,seattle lost because they let wilson qb today
fantasyfootball,removed,damn god forbid we answer a question
fantasyfootball,removed,sitting az for nyj
fantasyfootball,removed,oh did you hear rawls got injured suck it
fantasyfootball,removed,please please please let bradford be a huge disappointment and let diggs get gunned down in the locker room for racial slurs
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks short and simple
fantasyfootball,removed,of those eli but he wont be there in late rounds read after the
fantasyfootball,removed,if im picking one of those its winston i think hes a good qb with a good reciever and a mediocre defense but more importantly he plays the saints twice a year id use my other qb spot to stream good matchups and hold winston for a streamer with upside
fantasyfootball,removed,well i have winston in my league and the first thing that jumps out to me is he faces a lot of tough pass defenses but im hoping he can make the sophomore qb leap like we saw from luck and cam iirc both newton and luck finished top in points in their sophomore years and winstons rookie year is comparable to their rookie years and the bucs d looks average to below average so winston should be throwing it quite a bit to stay in games also everything ive heard about winstons offseason has me very very high on him and i know its just the browns but he slayed them in the preseason this is biased as an eagles fan but i would avoid cousins seems to me like last year was a fluke as he just seems like an average at best qb in my eyes when he faces tough defenses he plays poorly and he plays a lot of tough defenses this year that and their d looks better so should be less passing overall eli has a huge ceiling but as always very inconsistent but imo definitely the best pick out of the as they have no running game and seem like theyll be pass happy this year
fantasyfootball,removed,someone please convince me not to drop crowell for him
fantasyfootball,removed,howard or sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,pretty sure the black ones join boko haram its like their university s
fantasyfootball,removed,im pretty set at wr in a ppr league and drafted corey colemen last pick would drop him for howard
fantasyfootball,removed,i own langford as my rb currently have morris as my last guy on bench should i replace him with howard instead
fantasyfootball,removed,mmm not sure rbs i have ezekiel gore bell woodhead and michael wrs i have robinson baldwin moncrief torrey smith and sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,your decisiveness has convinced me ill hold onto to morris
fantasyfootball,removed,julio unless his injury status worries you
fantasyfootball,removed,obj not close double digit tds
fantasyfootball,removed,odell standard julio ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,julio quite easily imo
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah but they both have injury histories if you think they can both play a full season it is hands down julio obj has more competition for target this year as well
fantasyfootball,removed,hes white
fantasyfootball,removed,wrong sub but would you take foster right now instead
fantasyfootball,removed,charles or foster week ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,james white has had chances to win the job before and hasnt done anything special weekydstdrecrecydsrectd sure lewis went down in week but white didnt really cement himself until week granted that in weeks he had tds i think hell be the guy to own until lewis return for a round pick hes a steal
fantasyfootball,removed,sit coleman bench thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr give doug baldwin michael crabtree get dez bryant wrs sammy watkins doug baldwin michael floyd crabtree sanu thinking of proposing this trade thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,a i have no idea what that has to do with anything a i understood your first comment was a joke but then you made a claim that he said something and it seems like you meant it to me no need to be a fucking douche about it i was asking if that really happened
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah i have him as my also curious could really use the bench spot worried he may not produce this year as a rook
fantasyfootball,removed,just drafted him in the late second should i look to ship him off or do i hold onto him
fantasyfootball,removed,should i be dropping ajayi for him also have rishard so i feel like i need an insurance policy and jay has looked super average
fantasyfootball,removed,was just offered sharpe for henry by the demarco murray owner you guys like that offer
fantasyfootball,removed,drop diggs for sharpe smart or stupid
fantasyfootball,removed,ive been holding michael thomas for that wr spot on my team worth a drop for sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,tavon austin or tajae sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,so i have ware sproles and ajayi as my bench rbs with gurley and murray as my starters should i swap sproles or ajayi for sharpe this is a fun no league as well just looking for some input
fantasyfootball,removed,i scooped up ware a couple days back and will be starting him with confidence week vs sd
fantasyfootball,removed,this year i liked my mock drafts at the and spot much better than the teams i came up with with a later pick luckily both my money leagues i ended up with a top pick
fantasyfootball,removed,i start three wr in my league and we still have a flex im more than complacent with my wr but not too thrilled on the rest of the team
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks i feel retarded now
fantasyfootball,removed,tim
fantasyfootball,removed,anyone think if i draft charles but didnt get ware id b ok starting ryan matthews and abdullah
fantasyfootball,removed,in a vacuum should i trade away mike evans and frank gore for keenan allen and duke johnson what if its melvin gordon instead of duke johnson
fantasyfootball,removed,entirely depends on the qb if tier qbs cam rodgers bradyetc go down everyone on the offense loses value if an average qb like bridgewater or smith go down its hard to say and depends on who their backup is but the value loss is minimal if alex smith goes down how much does that affect charles not much if any it may even increase his value if foles is in being that hes more of a pocket passer and teams will have to spy less thats just one example
fantasyfootball,removed,absolutely if you didnt come to the draft prepared thats your fault if you think megatron is still in the league and you dont have a sheet with players adp in front of you thats your fault it happens almost every year in my league some player gets injured week before the draft then some guy in our league drafts him we all laugh and he feels like shit fantasy football is about making your friends feel like shit not about helping them out
fantasyfootball,removed,i think im auctions theres a lot of value in getting players with competent handcuffs in a snake draft its really easy to miss on deangelo williams charles sims or alfred morris i think if bell martin or zeke go down any of those rbs would be top and being able to surely get both of them would take away a lot of risk that goes with spending on a top player i would probably take of those running backs and try to get a round wrs at a good price like demaryius thomas randall cobb ty hilton sammy watkins brandin cooks jeremy maclin kelvin benjamin golden tate that way i could play of the based on match ups at this point the budget would probably be looking like bellwilliams martinsims wr k dst streaming leaves to spend on bench spots a qb and a te on rivers dalton or stafford on antonio gates dwayne allen or zach miller leaves with to spend on bench spotssuper late flyers id probably take another one of those tes or charles clayclive walford then some deep wr that could be something i wouldnt carry any rbs besides those two and there handcuffs guys like torrey smith travis benjamin tajae sharp and terrelle pryor other players id be missing out on that i do like if they fell to the right price derrick henry josh gordon and arian foster
fantasyfootball,removed,whats your thinking for gurley over ap or zeke just curious as i have the fourth pick as well
fantasyfootball,removed,hey im in a ppr standard team league there are two copies of players here is my roster so far we are in the middle of drafting qbandrew luck rbl bell rbajayi rbr mathews rbd williams wrd hopkins wrw fuller we roster with no kicker defense or idp trade is my luck hopkins ajayi pick round is for his big ben gurley e sanders c fleener what are your thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,keep miller met the rest go
fantasyfootball,removed,miller and ajayi even with foster ajayi is still going to get a few touches every game then on top of that ifwhen foster inevitably goes down then ajayi will become a great
fantasyfootball,removed,miller is safe and still a good keep just giving up a but i think jones is the more fun keep if he can stop fumbling he is a top rb this year the round pick is worth the risk
fantasyfootball,removed,miller and floyd
fantasyfootball,removed,i would go with miller and matt jones too all the others are replaceablenot a good enough value while i expect jones to be maddeningly inconsistent its not like washington has a deep stable of rbs so hell get work
fantasyfootball,removed,i like to buttfuck
fantasyfootball,removed,it depends on other keepers but i would think hard about keeping freeman
fantasyfootball,removed,i personally would keep freeman take bell with overall and than grab a wr in the
fantasyfootball,removed,this title is a bit misleading and the question cant be answered without knowing the list of players kept lamar could very well be the best player on the board
fantasyfootball,removed,freeman in the seems like a no brainer
fantasyfootball,removed,so keeper league i have gordon for a borts for a and b marsh for a choose two
fantasyfootball,removed,first overall and its not even remotely close
fantasyfootball,removed,not only is it a plus but its something many people dont know either way i am drafting him first overall
fantasyfootball,removed,i just took him overall in a yahoo standard league rest of my roster in order of draft i had first overall pick a brown keenan allen mike evans greg olsen golden tate matt jones frank gore eli manning gordon good value
fantasyfootball,removed,picked him overall hell compliment alshon jeffery and arobinson quite nicely on my team
fantasyfootball,removed,i feel like the answer is hopkins
fantasyfootball,removed,matt forte will be a top running back this year
fantasyfootball,removed,because dez is coming back next week and will probably be a top wr and hes exchanging that for a defense that is fairly replaceable
fantasyfootball,removed,tickets please train to the standard knile is on your left train to ppr montgomery wis is on your right watch your step
fantasyfootball,removed,hes on the rams lol but point taken
fantasyfootball,removed,because its not the question pertains to if this situation ever makes it better to start one quarterback over another because of your opponents players receivers picture a situation where you have one quarterback that will score points that week and will be playing against receivers from his team and another that will score from a random team starting the point quarterback will be better of the time the effect of your opponent gaining losing points will happen whether or that quarterback is on the bench or not so although it may seem like it while youre watching the game this line of thought shouldnt come into play when choosing your starters
fantasyfootball,removed,holy crap
fantasyfootball,removed,i offered t west r wilson and m floyd for big ben and dez
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard pick jeffrey gb meredith gb cobb vs chi crowder det britt vs nyg
fantasyfootball,removed,got offered diggs for edelman accept
fantasyfootball,removed,someone offered me diggs for my edelman yes or no
fantasyfootball,removed,is diggs worth ware straight up
fantasyfootball,removed,til yards and td is terrible
fantasyfootball,removed,bottles in mine at least for the next two weeks funnily i drafted bortles and traded him with others for a package that included ben our paths cross again
fantasyfootball,removed,i have to since i have no choice
fantasyfootball,removed,i was waiting for this post all day slim pickings in my league but hoyercutler is available im waiting on a decision who is going to start thursday then ill plug sam bradford on week hoping big ben will be ready by week
fantasyfootball,removed,set your lineup based on who will score you the most points who your opponent has is irrelevant
fantasyfootball,removed,offered the big ben owner in my league cam newton for his mike evans no one ever trades in this league so i am assuming it gets shot down but worth a try i need wr help bad and dont mind sticking with andy dalton ros at qb
fantasyfootball,removed,im rolling with winston good match ups for the next weeks
fantasyfootball,removed,i was offered vikings d for jimmy graham in a team standard league should i take it
fantasyfootball,removed,😂😂😂
fantasyfootball,removed,the cowboys should start romo keep him on a short leash and then throw in prescott if shit gets bad if they start prescott and he performs badly the masses will call for romo and if he then sucks they have no other option
fantasyfootball,removed,serious do you start him this week in the flex spot
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard pick jeffrey gb meredith gb cobb vs chi crowder det britt vs nyg
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard pick jeffrey gb meredith gb cobb vs chi crowder det

fantasyfootball,removed,fuck i can really only drop dion or gio im panicking

fantasyfootball,removed,i am playing the shady owner this week should i pick up gillislee i would have to drop antonio gates only te currently trade pending for hh or dion lewis
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck should i drop booker for gillislee
fantasyfootball,removed,drop don jackson for him
fantasyfootball,removed,drop ty montgomery for gillislee

fantasyfootball,removed,drop booker for gillislee
fantasyfootball,removed,vinatieri is
fantasyfootball,removed,drop hill for gill
fantasyfootball,removed,but its hopkins
fantasyfootball,removed,damn as a lacyhyde owner i was lucky to get ajayi and knile davis off waivers but my opponent has mccoy this week should i drop davis for gillislee im stumped
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,dropped mckinnon ass
fantasyfootball,removed,would it be worth it to drop ryan mathews for gillislee im a mccoy owner and wrestling with this
fantasyfootball,removed,but rff told me to never believe him because rff is always right

fantasyfootball,removed,httpsgfycatcomglumsmoothgoosefish
fantasyfootball,removed,it sounds like hes startable
fantasyfootball,removed,keep kevin white or drop him for tajae
fantasyfootball,removed,s
fantasyfootball,removed,predraft make juice grape again post draft face palmer
fantasyfootball,removed,id do it i kinda feel like dj and gurley are a washarob is better than cobb and brady is better than wilson suspension sucks but you can stream the first weeks w someone like derek carr or keep mm id go for it
fantasyfootball,removed,id take it
fantasyfootball,removed,meh i feel like cobb will put up ppg this year which could be what robinson does id pass i think wilson will have his best year this season
fantasyfootball,removed,id take it i think gurley will be extremely valuable for rams this year and going to be a workhorse dj is still getting some help from palmer if he can continue to produce like last year especially with the receiver core he has at his disposal brady and rw is a wash to me maybe a slight advantage to rw due to the running game i still think that brady is more consistent in terms of fps than rw rw is to me a boom or a bust every week for fps id take the safe points than something much more unreliable
fantasyfootball,removed,its s good trade depends who you like i like your team as it is though
fantasyfootball,removed,what are the details of the league im looking for another
fantasyfootball,removed,dont really have room on my bench for two tes you think hes worth an add this week i only have cook right now but i like his potential with aaron rodgers
fantasyfootball,removed,you should bet if you win you get to punch her in the face lol right
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop antonio gates for him
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start him over arian
fantasyfootball,removed,enron walford cook or mcdonald
fantasyfootball,removed,would you go rashad jennings over him
fantasyfootball,removed,dropping bilal powell for cmike i feel its the right move now think its lays off long term
fantasyfootball,removed,ebron or cook week
fantasyfootball,removed,so should i sit rawls for either jeremy hill justin forsett or isaiah crowell
fantasyfootball,removed,no who are your rbs
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm so now the question is start him or forte at
fantasyfootball,removed,so do i hang on to christine michael or pick up james white off of waivers
fantasyfootball,removed,i would probably drop wheaton here
fantasyfootball,removed,absolutely snatch him up before he is gone drop forsett
fantasyfootball,removed,aiken or tajae sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,droppable for ebron jt or virgil
fantasyfootball,removed,drop him for witten for vance mcd
fantasyfootball,removed,marshall fitzpatrick is going to reward him often for getting him another paycheck
fantasyfootball,removed,drop jimmy graham
fantasyfootball,removed,newton
fantasyfootball,removed,i would go with gates
fantasyfootball,removed,team yahoo standard first year of a keeper keep pick qb rodgers rb ezikiel hyde gore forsett morris wr marshall keenan josh micheal floyd benjamen te ertz def ari kicker cantazaro
fantasyfootball,removed,i have zeke lamar miller as my starting rbs do i start rawls or d will as my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,worth taking a flier on ebron instead of dwayne allen
fantasyfootball,removed,in my flex in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,does this put cmike into a good flex position for week looking between kelvin benjamin tajae sharpe cmike and davante parker
fantasyfootball,removed,i currently have him in instead of decker im considering switching that out though
fantasyfootball,removed,im torn between starting jennings or deangelo willams for week one thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,mccoy you dummy
fantasyfootball,removed,shady youre overthinking
fantasyfootball,removed,hard to bench shady
fantasyfootball,removed,mccoy all the way but if charles goes down for the year id actually prefer ware
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop julius thomas for ebron
fantasyfootball,removed,im split between him and clive i dropped vance for clive but could go either way
fantasyfootball,removed,flex spot cooks or jones
fantasyfootball,removed,shady
fantasyfootball,removed,im going ware if charles is out west is banged up too playing a shit sd defense ware could be top rb for the week
fantasyfootball,removed,i think you should start colt mccoy
fantasyfootball,removed,im split between him ebron and cook
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start him or coby fleener
fantasyfootball,removed,split between him green james and ebron
fantasyfootball,removed,ive been offered rashad jennings in exchange for ryan mathews in my league thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont think your wrs are that bad you have guys who should all be top i think benji might end up being your in standard league i think he will score more tds than maclin your rbs are set i might want to try to find that te who always seems to break out early on the ww incase thomas doesnt pan outi read he hasnt had the greatest training camp and preseason id give this a ba if i had to give it a grade here is mine if you dont mind
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys start jordan mathews over rawls at flex this week i got ware and forte in atm
fantasyfootball,removed,ebron over vance mcdonald
fantasyfootball,removed,so dont drop funchess for michael
fantasyfootball,removed,think hes better option than dwayne allen this year
fantasyfootball,removed,vance or dwayne allen
fantasyfootball,removed,ebron over virgil green
fantasyfootball,removed,i have hurts and cobb available for my flex im leaning cobb at this point thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,im so torn between him and walford
fantasyfootball,removed,i had him but dropped him for m bennet simply because of the injury concern im also a big believer in ebron this year should i swap back
fantasyfootball,removed,if youre ppr i would definitely have woodhead flex every week
fantasyfootball,removed,i drafted gore instead of blount was that as stupid as i think it was
fantasyfootball,removed,with the jamaal charles news i may be starting giants eli obj now jennings bad idea
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys recommend trying to flip spencer ware the charles owner in my league wants him from me i have freeman martinfostermichaelmckinnon at rb he offered my dwayne allen for him which i declined so far
fantasyfootball,removed,i drafted zach ertz as my te before the sam bradford trade feeling pretty uncomfortable with him as my te now would ebron be worth starting over him infact is it worth it to drop ertz for any of these guys eric ebron jared cook jason witten dwayne allen martellus bennett zach miller charles clay ladarius green
fantasyfootball,removed,so is ebron a better bet than gates
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr pick rb flex rbwrte from duke johnson phi gio bernard nyj jordan matthews cle zach ertz cle corey coleman phi
fantasyfootball,removed,i have both ertz and ebronwith bradford traded to minny is ebron a better week one option
fantasyfootball,removed,drop jimmy graham and pick up ebron ppr league i have virgil green and i really wanna drop jimmy graham and believe in ebron
fantasyfootball,removed,probably not in a bench league you wont be able to make moves all season
fantasyfootball,removed,ugh ive been back and for on him and spencer ware all week who is the better guy to own right now
fantasyfootball,removed,so my question is this ebron or julius thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,i have dalton and mariota haha who would you start
fantasyfootball,removed,how many keepers and why in the world would you want cook i can see cmike and mthomas assuming for the saints for benjamin as a good trade who did you have to drop to make this happen
fantasyfootball,removed,man ppr i had to choose between and ended up taking kelvin in the fifth over golden tate was this a bonehead move
fantasyfootball,removed,if this game truly is the shootout that is expected who do you start moncrief or jones
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys start marvin jones as a flex in a wr league i have ab cooks kallen as my starting wrs and undecided about a flex m jones a solid choice
fantasyfootball,removed,with this news who should i start in my flex in standard ppr kelvin corey coleman l murray seems like people are not huge on l murray this year with washington behind him this news and going against denver defense for kb and yeah cleveland is obviously cleveland but someone has to catch the ball with no josh gordon right
fantasyfootball,removed,you wouldnt even wait a week
fantasyfootball,removed,would you pick up gb over ne
fantasyfootball,removed,if theres nobody on your roster lower than matt jones and you dont own jamaal charles the you probably dont need spencer ware
fantasyfootball,removed,drop bilal powell for him
fantasyfootball,removed,there is no shot the ware owner accepts that if he does you should do it in a heartbeat
fantasyfootball,removed,if you are to trade him should should get more than spencer ware one you drafted in the round the other some dude picked up off wavers use that to your advantage and see if you can get a two for one deal working that is if you must absolutely trade him
fantasyfootball,removed,i have to drop someone to pick up dixon before i can stash him in my ir spot do i drop steve smith sr once i slot dixon into the ir spot i can pick up someone else as well could also drop javorius allen and rishard matthews
fantasyfootball,removed,no imo you are essentially betting that charles is limited all year if charles is healthy he is the starter even if they trend rbbc to preserve charles a bit for playoffs if they go rbbc i think ware gets of total touches with west in mix too so if you think the chance of charles being hurt or limited all year with ware being the new starter is greater than the chance that jones will have fantasy relevance then go ware i think jones is a lock to get way more volume than ware baring additional injury which is why id rather have jones
fantasyfootball,removed,cant decide between him mcdonald or green
fantasyfootball,removed,ok i see a rawls thread at least times a day and i keep questioning my roster v bench ive got e lacy and j stewart on my starting roster and rawls along with abdullah as my two backup rbs does this still make sense is rawls being undersold due to injury chance
fantasyfootball,removed,so white or foster
fantasyfootball,removed,riddick or michael in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop coleman for michael own rawls but felt coleman had better value
fantasyfootball,removed,do you think someone like sanders is better flex option then a matt jones or ameer abdullah
fantasyfootball,removed,would prescott be a better start than dalton this week
fantasyfootball,removed,how many teams
fantasyfootball,removed,yeahcause fuck you
fantasyfootball,removed,drop ellington for lafell ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,olsen vs denver or charles clay vs baltimore
fantasyfootball,removed,if those are absolutely your only droppable players and you want ware i would drop ivory if you have a matchup that looks like a win this week i wouldnt drop either ware could be a game winner though
fantasyfootball,removed,im in a team league and im not sure why ware wasnt drafted im pretty stacked for rbs at the moment i have gurley mccoy forte m gordon ivory i agree they are tough drops though but im worried about ivorys production on jax with yeldon poaching snaps i could drop a wr i guess but fairly stacked there too with my worst being marvin jones
fantasyfootball,removed,cj or lacy my is lamar miller
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop chris johnson or buck allen for him i have in case dj busts or get injured but i dont have dj so its not a handcuff for me i only grabbed buck allen because he was free to take when the ravens cut forsett but now that hes back im not too hot on him especially since im good at rb
fantasyfootball,removed,drop ellington for him ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,as a rawls owner do i try to trade charles sims for cmike cmike owner also has d martin
fantasyfootball,removed,drop spiller and take a flier on darkwa
fantasyfootball,removed,after reading your post and conducting my own research analysis to verify i conclude with reasonable certainty that andre williams could kick my ass
fantasyfootball,removed,ryan matthews against cleveland
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt pay
fantasyfootball,removed,darkwa or rob kelley
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop kenny stills for cmike
fantasyfootball,removed,would you feel ok trading him for will fuller
fantasyfootball,removed,in all seriousness if im the rawls owner how important it it that i grab cmike hes available but id have to drop marvin jones
fantasyfootball,removed,ok maybe it really is best to sit rawls week and wait to see what goes down someone please help me make a decision here my current lineup qb kirk cousins thomas rawls demarco murray julio jones brandon marshall te greg olsen flex deangelo williams flexing williams just cause monday game but im considering moving him to sitting rawls and flexing someone from my bench derrick henry marvin jones john brown bilall powell mohammed sanu also have christine michael but not gonna flex him leaning towards marvin jones as the flex
fantasyfootball,removed,sproles or darkwa in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,drop abdullah for cmike
fantasyfootball,removed,so drop forsett or ivory for darkwa
fantasyfootball,removed,so drop rawls for marcus harris i know hes just a fa but hes got such great upside s harris is a high school friend bummed the giants released him
fantasyfootball,removed,same but i have no damn room how do you guys find bench space i have guys like travis benjamin chris ivory steve smith as my worst players humble bragg but its a real problem
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop jeremy hill or arian foster for him maybe even martellus bennett or none at all
fantasyfootball,removed,dont get mad at me lol but i qas offered jeffery for ryan mathews and foster in standard league my rb are gore miller gurley and wr are j landry kevin white moncrief i am not sure how to feel about jeffery injury issues
fantasyfootball,removed,i was tryna improve on wr and alshon the best deal on table or miller for green
fantasyfootball,removed,in standard i was in the same position and i went gurley kind of regret it but i cant imagine who else i would pick
fantasyfootball,removed,if its a ppr league its julio or beckham your choice
fantasyfootball,removed,i had the in two different leagues brown fell to me in one and i took odell in the other
fantasyfootball,removed,take julio or beckham an elite wr isnt easy to come by not in the class of those youll come back around in round and probably have a shot at a good rb will they be todd gurley no but the production youll get from someone like julio will make up for it
fantasyfootball,removed,k
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,start mike over latavius murray
fantasyfootball,removed,this
fantasyfootball,removed,probably not tbh id look to get dion lewis them kenneth dixon to place on your ir for your bench i like forsett better than buck allen shaun draughn will start week if hyde isnt ready benny cunningham will be used on third downs over gurley basically drop buck allen and get any one of these guys if possible
fantasyfootball,removed,as a rawls owner i wish cmike would just slit his own throat
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr league my rbs are jstew gio and ivory other bench players are aiken j gordon funchess t boyd should i drop someone this week and take a flyer on cmike
fantasyfootball,removed,worth dropping blount for michael in standard seems like michael could have more upside
fantasyfootball,removed,drop terrance west for cmike
fantasyfootball,removed,at least girth is nice too oops wrong thread
fantasyfootball,removed,is it worth dropping starks i have lacy and then picking up michael
fantasyfootball,removed,i have rawls cmike melvin gordon and hyde as well as aiken and emmanuel sanders who should i start as my rbs and my flex cant make up my mind
fantasyfootball,removed,why would he ever start brown with the wrs ahead of him keeping the player in the shallower position seems like the smart move to me
fantasyfootball,removed,yes and there is a thread for this
fantasyfootball,removed,no youre a fucking idiot dude my point is that at his adp he is a steal i would like to have gotten him if i was in the right place where he has value unfortunately there is no way he falls to pick and hes not worth pick thats why snake draft suck whats not to get because of the way snake drafts work i wasnt in a position to get him for the value i wanted him at it aint rocket science
fantasyfootball,removed,i like cameron over cameron cameron for sure
fantasyfootball,removed,you dont need tes
fantasyfootball,removed,immediately
fantasyfootball,removed,i use fantasy pros and i like it honestly more than articles what helps me the most is doing mock drafts nonstop that really helps you get a feel for where the players are going and if youre in a mock draft youll see how much they are going for therotocom
fantasyfootball,removed,dont make up your mind before your draft if you decide ok im gonna draft a rb first since decline is steep but then somehow julio is available at your turn its gonna throw you out of wack do mock drafts before your draft tinker with your selections and see what works but always keep a fluid strategy in the end bpa always turns out the best teams therotocom
fantasyfootball,removed,i have it as ab julio green odell i know im gonna get sht for green over odell but thats just a judgement call i think green is going to have a monster year therotocom
fantasyfootball,removed,im a commissioner of few leagues and i love ppr id stick with instead of the full point keep it fun and simple make sure everyone pays up before week and if you can facilitate the trash talk email out stuff and keep the action going becuase thats what lets the bottom tier teams still enjoy it i created a service called therotocom just for that check it out maybe you find it interesting for your league but the most important part as commissioner is keep the fun going
fantasyfootball,removed,hello league commissioners i dont know if this is the right place to do this but im trying to gauge a level of interest in a new fantasy football product ive created check it out at therotocom we write articles and do news coverage for your league any feedback you have would be great and if you want to sign up private message me and i can send you a promo code created exclusively for reddit for a discount thank you
fantasyfootball,removed,i run a team dynasty league we do everyone seems really happy with it and it seems balanced out quite well therotocom
fantasyfootball,removed,ok setting aside the logic if you were drafting from the spot in a snakestyle draft would you trade down to the spot
fantasyfootball,removed,that sounds cool i just launched a service that will write up articles for your fantasy league as well as provide news coverage it costs only per team for the whole year check it out and let me know what you think and if youd like it i can send you a discount code httptherotocom
fantasyfootball,removed,upvote so more people can see and vote get rid of this part and we will reapproveits against reddits sitewide rules
fantasyfootball,removed,i would try to keep dion if you have a large enough bench he could be a when hes back but if you have a smaller bench and dont want to get rid of stills or fuller or whoever else is on your bench i guess its okay but i would rather wait to drop him until i had to and just roll out duke and zeke
fantasyfootball,removed,lottery ticket but probably gonna take a flyer on hightower after what he did last season
fantasyfootball,removed,i remember someone made a list of handcuff rankings last year i wonder if that has been updated to the present
fantasyfootball,removed,i read his articles for enjoyment not for advice think of it as a buzzfeed article on espn sponsored by espn produced by espn and promoted by espn httptherotocom
fantasyfootball,removed,weve always felt yahoo is a superior product but thats more of a comfort level fit httptherotocom
fantasyfootball,removed,im not sure why your post is being downvoted youre asking a question this subreddit is getting real harsh anyway he definitely has the talent to be just like you said he is injury prone but even if he plays all i think its tough to crack the ab julio odell green hopkins he could definitely do it and if he finishes as the best he already outperformed his current rank httptherotocom
fantasyfootball,removed,i have that if you dont get it by tomorrow pm me since its on my work computer
fantasyfootball,removed,damn i dunno about coates i would definitely hold onto him thru this week just to see where hes at henry wont be doing anything all year as long as demarco is playing
fantasyfootball,removed,ok just saw one comment that hopkins getting high target shares is an issue i dont get it i think hopkins is a boss are you also saying that hopkins is a stud and osweiler is the problem because i completely agree
fantasyfootball,removed,lmao just stumbled across is old thread arent you the guy going around telling people to use the search function comeonman
fantasyfootball,removed,side note cmike or cwest
fantasyfootball,removed,trump pres
fantasyfootball,removed,tyrell or jones
fantasyfootball,removed,i sold high on antonio too got evans and myself last week but i think your analysis doesnt factor in other important variables like quality of opponent quality of qb etc
fantasyfootball,removed,sad to see a fellow eagle fan go before he could see a super bowl win im not sure ill ever see one
fantasyfootball,removed,also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium
fantasyfootball,removed,i played in a league like that and got kicked out for consistently bitching about that waiver process theres no incentive to winning during the season i was in first place all year and i got good waiver pickups and lost first round
fantasyfootball,removed,youre fine dont listen to these shit post fucks you asked a question the wrong section who gives a shit
fantasyfootball,removed,even though you posted this in the wrong placeno do not do this howard could be a league winner
fantasyfootball,removed,edit talk about bad timing totally missed the vick thread last night but i see it now that op probably got inspired by the lt post as well anyways dont see too many numbers in that thread so hopefully people find this interesting
fantasyfootball,removed,hahahahahahhah
fantasyfootball,removed,pseudoreign more like pseudobrain right guys
fantasyfootball,removed,commishleague issues thread in the index
fantasyfootball,removed,is it collusion if i give someone for gronk
fantasyfootball,removed,is it collusion if i suck a dick in exchange for dj
fantasyfootball,removed,is it collusion if someone is begging you for something you have and the only way you will give it to them is for landry and reed for ab
fantasyfootball,removed,thats what this thread is for
fantasyfootball,removed,report doesnt specify if he broke one arm or two but i heard his mom is going to be taking care of him
fantasyfootball,removed,k
fantasyfootball,removed,amari safer to start over twilliams or mthomas now
fantasyfootball,removed,carr or kapernick
fantasyfootball,removed,lol youre ridiculous this type of news is the one that constitutes a thread full of comments of people reacting to the news adjusting their lineups and asking who to start look at the comments theyre full of them just cause im op i cant do the same fuck outta here lol
fantasyfootball,removed,him or landry vs jets
fantasyfootball,removed,not any more hes not maybe you should pay attention after this last game carol said hes going to get prosise more involved btws youre a fucking idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,good work im not a programmer by any means and id love to help if i am able
fantasyfootball,removed,cant have pats need a seahawk
fantasyfootball,removed,i design a bunch of different write ups for my league wwwnickleblanccom got the idea from someone here tried to share dickhole mods took it down
fantasyfootball,removed,step one
fantasyfootball,removed,i have hopkins and need rbs my buddy is offering keenan allen and matt jones for hopkins and starks thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,i feel like you have to go with keenan and martin you are pretty much getting them for free antonio brown is probably the best one there but you would be keeping him at his value if you can try to find out who everyone else will most likely be keeping that is first round value and look at your draft order to project what talent you would be able to get in the first round potentially
fantasyfootball,removed,keenan in the and doug in the why so many rounds and how many teams are in your league to answer your question though hands down its keenan and doug do not keep antonio yes he is the best player in the draft but you are not creating any value by keeping him you can keep keenan and doug for free and still have your first round pick and still get someone in the ballpark of antonio brown keeper choices are about best value not best player
fantasyfootball,removed,just fyi there are daily threads for keeper draft startsit etc questions that is where stuff like this should go because you have a bunch of people smarter than me giving you solid advice hopefully but if it was me id take brown and allen i know the argument against brown is hell cost you a round pick but you gotta take the player available if you have that option allen because i dont trust walker and martin and rivers has shown that he loves allen especially for a round picjesus christ thats alot of rounds good luck
fantasyfootball,removed,id go aj lamar
fantasyfootball,removed,i dunno maybe the three first round guys
fantasyfootball,removed,bold in will be years old for most of the season the best talent and size comp for boldins upcoming season is former jaguars wide receiver jimmy smiths year old season smith went for
fantasyfootball,removed,the reason why you got down voted is nobody cares about your team and definitely not your arch rival
fantasyfootball,removed,i explained why you got down voted that was not me getting hard you took it offensively that only shows your ignorance i always have a soft spot for the mentally challenged so i hope you do well this year were all pulling for you big guy
fantasyfootball,removed,with only rawls had an online
fantasyfootball,removed,because it means he can do it again and kaep just dropped pts last week yeah hindsight is but doesnt change the fact that youre an asshole
fantasyfootball,removed,ouch bro too much tryptophan
fantasyfootball,removed,k
fantasyfootball,removed,hes proven that he can catch passes from any of them hes their biggest target and most reliable weapon id roll him out
fantasyfootball,removed,oh please get off of your pedestal you act as if you care about a player who isnt even a household name that you pretend to care about his wellbeing after an injury you fuckers act so high and mighty sometimes i swear fuck yourself
fantasyfootball,removed,do you have something to add you
fantasyfootball,removed,almo alfmo you fuckwit
fantasyfootball,removed,i could end up anywhere from the seed with a bye to the seed playing the seed with dj bell evans and brady if moncrief has or fewer points in my game and vinateri and forte combine for less than in another matchup i get the seed heres hoping for an ugly defensive battle
fantasyfootball,removed,please dont remove this
fantasyfootball,removed,lol right op can we talk about this thing mod hey i dont see any stats
fantasyfootball,removed,i have allen robinsonjulio jones jordan matthews diggs and coleman this week started robinson jones and matthews which should i roll with next week
fantasyfootball,removed,what a great day for those of us inheriting shitty dynasty teams
fantasyfootball,removed,they schemed for him bortles looked lousy except for the junk time too unfortunately
fantasyfootball,removed,remindme day check back thanks for great index
fantasyfootball,removed,they did so much better with
fantasyfootball,removed,how predictable
fantasyfootball,removed,with todays injuries and him on my team ya
fantasyfootball,removed,hope you got diggs
fantasyfootball,removed,hey its me your marital problems
fantasyfootball,removed,where is fat lacy
fantasyfootball,removed,game script motherfucker do you understand it seriously though you guys either need to watch the game or shut the hell up they were down for enough of the game and hes not the passing down back never has been never will be you knew what you signed up for and youre getting exactly that stfu everybody
fantasyfootball,removed,no one is shadow banned the mods are just giant assholes
fantasyfootball,removed,try again douchebag
fantasyfootball,removed,wise advice gio explodes
fantasyfootball,removed,could be worse he could be grabbing his sons testicles to pound on them until they bleed again
fantasyfootball,removed,saved my ass
fantasyfootball,removed,my opponent is done and im down all i have left is alshon
fantasyfootball,removed,yep
fantasyfootball,removed,benched diggs for moncrief like a fool but i learned that bradford looks for him early and often excited to have him on my team
fantasyfootball,removed,not on sundays
fantasyfootball,removed,would you rate tyrell williams over travis benjamin they are both available like mckinnon
fantasyfootball,removed,he had use the espn sports app
fantasyfootball,removed,pick up whitaker or mckinnon
fantasyfootball,removed,worth it to use waiver priority on him
fantasyfootball,removed,i have both i may try to package one in a trade if you had to choose one to keep the rest of the season in a ppr who would it be im leaning towards benjamin
fantasyfootball,removed,stat corrections are determined once a game is over and are issued by the nfl on a rolling basis meaning that they can be provided to at any time during the week
fantasyfootball,removed,didnt show up couple of qb hits but total nonfactor
fantasyfootball,removed,its fairly even in value if you pulled the extra body it would help
fantasyfootball,removed,id hold mckinnon right now and see how the dust settles
fantasyfootball,removed,fair
fantasyfootball,removed,youre overpaying
fantasyfootball,removed,i dunno i dont see much in gurleys future and obstacles keep disappearing probably even value right now but youre banking on gurleys talent vs oppty
fantasyfootball,removed,i probably would
fantasyfootball,removed,even value
fantasyfootball,removed,relatively even trade imo id prefer to be getting bell despite the marginally better tilt coming in to your group
fantasyfootball,removed,i think you can get more for sims
fantasyfootball,removed,what is more likely philly negative but against the bears dont see that happening
fantasyfootball,removed,stat corrections are processed all week i won the championship last year days later on a stat change to big ben
fantasyfootball,removed,the guy im playing got more or less a swing this morning the only player i see common on his roster is lmurray
fantasyfootball,removed,some havent moved at all regular adddrops when the player is listed as a fa do not affect waiver order
fantasyfootball,removed,week question obviously a deep league yes this is for assumes injury knocks out incumbent cody kessler jacoby brissett aj mccarron
fantasyfootball,removed,i need him to score like to win can we work with that
fantasyfootball,removed,would like alshon to get injured in the first quarter with recepts
fantasyfootball,removed,best not panicking about dez and playing him this week worst keeping forte on my bench
fantasyfootball,removed,i like ryan
fantasyfootball,removed,id lean matthews i dont see game script giving langford but the philly back has a better shot to score that given offenses that fire also not a guarantee
fantasyfootball,removed,i like diggstate
fantasyfootball,removed,your bench is better than that list
fantasyfootball,removed,you could toss bennett for eifert if you believe in him but i wouldnt cut the rb
fantasyfootball,removed,not a smart move both of those mediocre qbs were drafted at a mediocre tier the stuff you listed is trash if you want an upgrade trade
fantasyfootball,removed,mathews for sure
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,i probably would
fantasyfootball,removed,cmike has vaulted into starter status i dont know if id drop him bennett and tyrrell or jennings depending on latters injury
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,only if his injury knocks him out for weeks
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,you dont want him landing somewhere else see if ads injury is seasonthreatening later today and you can drop the purple jesus for the crappy backup
fantasyfootball,removed,sproles rawls ware in that order
fantasyfootball,removed,not yet
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,yes youll have to gamble with one or more of these i would consider dropping rawls as well depending on injury severity
fantasyfootball,removed,i would be hardpressed to carry multiple tes dont do it
fantasyfootball,removed,he looked better week i would hold off cutting outright yet
fantasyfootball,removed,the order you have listed
fantasyfootball,removed,i would
fantasyfootball,removed,what does your team need and how does blount get you there
fantasyfootball,removed,mfl almost never changes inseason i had a support ticket open to see whether clowney might get recast as de as my commish wont modify this was their response we havent made a position change during the season in at least a year or two sometimes a prominent offensive player will switch from rb to wr or something like that and then we may follow suit if the fantasy community in general goes crazy about that type of thing
fantasyfootball,removed,what they have in him mckinnon was drafted in and started games in he raised that to they know what they have in him he doesnt get the volume because of purple jesus
fantasyfootball,removed,you base that on what statistics
fantasyfootball,removed,yes but nyg has been mum on it see
fantasyfootball,removed,is it worth dropping sims or tevin coleman for corey coleman tyrell williams mike wallace michael thomas victor cruz have shepard already or jerrick mckinnon ppr league bench spots
fantasyfootball,removed,so in dire need of a rb lost woodhead rawls abdullah the only healthy rb i have right now is sproles shane vereen and mckinnon are both on the wire i have priority who do i take ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,chance coincidence trend i press the panic button at
fantasyfootball,removed,i would try and sell high on coleman with mccown going down and its going to be a mess there try and package him up with coleman to the freeman owner for one of his top backs
fantasyfootball,removed,move coleman while you can
fantasyfootball,removed,youre pretty stacked at reciever id try to move one of those guys for a rb
fantasyfootball,removed,youre fine
fantasyfootball,removed,alshon jeffery
fantasyfootball,removed,my thoughts are he should climb into a bag of cheetos
fantasyfootball,removed,they play the this coming week id hold for one more bad game
fantasyfootball,removed,cut them
fantasyfootball,removed,the guy who has a robinson is selling low can you help me if i should offer him tyrell williams or jarvis landry its standard people league thank you for writing these
fantasyfootball,removed,lol
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trade ingram for arob i have cj anderson crowell and gore as other rbs
fantasyfootball,removed,youre useless
fantasyfootball,removed,you mean his rookie year
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks for the detailed feedback i didnt see the whole game so definitely a play bs cam newton and the panthers
fantasyfootball,removed,russ at qb mccoy woodhead gio charles sims tevin coleman forsett at rb antonio landry marvin jones and p dorset at wr vikings fan in my league just said hed trade me the world for diggs he has forte and derek carr
fantasyfootball,removed,drop danny woodhead for charles sims standard scoring league
fantasyfootball,removed,start diggs lol
fantasyfootball,removed,eat a dick hows that
fantasyfootball,removed,i just offered a trade to a different team tell me what you think im sending gurley and crabtree im receiving robinson and gore i have mccoy bernard and crowell as my backup rbs so i dont think this kills my rb core i have aj green evans j gordon and tate i offered crabtree because tate did awful and didnt think the other player would go for tate especially since id be taking their
fantasyfootball,removed,youre getting raped there
fantasyfootball,removed,u
fantasyfootball,removed,damn i just bought ingram if i had waited a little longer everybody would want to rape me
fantasyfootball,removed,lol i see what you did there
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,person leagues are cool
fantasyfootball,removed,weineritis
fantasyfootball,removed,take someone who will get reps
fantasyfootball,removed,qb luck dalton rb gurley gore blount forsett washington wr cobb jeffery sanu gordon adams te kelce fleener k boswell dst streaming currently steelers this is my straight year of an start and the previous years i finished to last and dead last so i really need to change my ways or ill just end up sucking all season again i read so much on rff trust the regular posters as well as my gut but it doesnt seem to matter what choices i make as they tend to end up being the wrong ones last year i started cja and alfred morris for most of the season thinkinghopingpraying theyd get better and of course never did so this year i said fuck that im not drafting those guys again and of course theyre both having far better seasons wellcja is well see about morris is there any advice you can give a cellardweller like me
fantasyfootball,removed,play your studs or base it on mathcups
fantasyfootball,removed,ive been happy how marvin has been playing i have him and i honestly would start him i might even start him next week sadly i didnt this week hes getting targets and many yards hopefully he can score tds
fantasyfootball,removed,no way i could bring myself to bench arob personally jones is certainly approaching everyweek territory though
fantasyfootball,removed,does it have to be jones vs a rob do you have room to play both a rob faces a defense that just gave up tons of points to the brownsand jones has had targets over games
fantasyfootball,removed,this is my first year with faab but i would say from might even be reasonable depending on your league size this cant be a teamer to drop grge his production is pretty much dream production from handcuff stash only thing better it the lotto ticket winner like last years dj id take him over anyone who mentioned but rorgers is by far the worst
fantasyfootball,removed,gore is a depth guy at this point not a league winner dont blow too much
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start the eagle dst tonight if im already beating my opponent by pts and hes out of players
fantasyfootball,removed,trade away mike evans and ware for melvin gordon and crabtree its a ppr league and i could use the rb help
fantasyfootball,removed,so i have peterson woodhead and watkins on my team my back ups at rb and wr are j hill for cin m floyd for arz t pryor for cle and m wallace for bal i have cam as my starting qb and brady on my bench i want to trade cam for any combination of wrshbs what should i hope for out of the trade
fantasyfootball,removed,blm
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard i have rb wr and flex spot available booker vs lewis diggs vs baldwin vs crowder i keep going back and forth over crowder vs lewis for the flex and i dont know if i should sit baldwin over diggs help please
fantasyfootball,removed,it wont be until monday yeah i do my power rankings at work but i can send you the one i do and show you how to use it itll take up front work inputting the scores but after that its easy to update week to week
fantasyfootball,removed,i got hyde howard and booker at rb odell jordy and michael thomas at wr start hyde at flex or thomas vs broncos d
fantasyfootball,removed,i can not believe they signed the chipper so now i guess im starting hyde over rkelly
fantasyfootball,removed,harris james white or starks leaning white
fantasyfootball,removed,goddamn im in a pickle mccoy is on bye so i have to start hyde prosise or dion lewis fuck me
fantasyfootball,removed,brandon marshall or tymo standard league
fantasyfootball,removed,start hyde or doug martin
fantasyfootball,removed,because of byes and stashing players for playoffs i have jason witten d walker eifert and hyde to fill in te slot and flex te is not ideal not sure if i should take a chance of hyde getting limited carries
fantasyfootball,removed,all im saying is its not a slam dunk that petty is going to be terrible but retards like have all the answers
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah but would you start him over dez or jordy
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start him in a standard league im between him tyrell williams and brandon marshall edelman and marshall have both had pretty disappointing seasons so im unsure of which two to start
fantasyfootball,removed,think i should start jarvis ty of davantee
fantasyfootball,removed,wdis thread but jeffery
fantasyfootball,removed,its reed and jeffrey and its not close
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start him over b marsh in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,witten and coates for sure alshon is no good with cutler in and tampa bay has a fearsome passing defense and jordan reed is too small and slow to be an effective pass catching tight end
fantasyfootball,removed,well this makes my decision today even tougher edelman or ingram in a
fantasyfootball,removed,need in ppr snead meredith rishard mathews
fantasyfootball,removed,sturgis or bryant
fantasyfootball,removed,wtf did i just read
fantasyfootball,removed,not as many as when anderson was in and i dont care about targets no good if he sails the ball yards over his head anderson can actually pass it to olsen where he can catch it racist pos
fantasyfootball,removed,what a fuck head this guy is
fantasyfootball,removed,lol wah wah you mustve voted for trump hahaha
fantasyfootball,removed,of course i owned lamar that has nothing to do with you being a fuck head
fantasyfootball,removed,will delete comment but need quick answer ppr dez or tyrell williams i also have rivers
fantasyfootball,removed,start tyrell williams over dez answer quick please
fantasyfootball,removed,you were saying
fantasyfootball,removed,three down back howd that work for ya
fantasyfootball,removed,how many rbswrs do you start
fantasyfootball,removed,i feel like dion is still a wildcard and none of those wrs are going to get you the consistency demarco has think you would be better off packaging gio or dion with a wr to get a decent upgrade rather than target a top tier wr
fantasyfootball,removed,im and played defensive end i think ill be ok also i dont choose to play nfl football how the fuck is the defensive line man supposed to predict where bens head will be in seconds when he changes directions
fantasyfootball,removed,i started tyrell lance kendricks minnesota d ty montgomery and corey coleman it was bye week hell and im payin for it
fantasyfootball,removed,i started tyrell lance kendricks minnesota d ty montgomery and corey coleman it was bye week hell and im payin for it
fantasyfootball,removed,shut up look at djs stats today and stop being an obnoxious asshole
fantasyfootball,removed,yes tannehill keep giving tds to williams
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trade your eifert and ware for aj green team standard
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,dez or allen robinson
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop devante parker for rob kelley
fantasyfootball,removed,i think i would put lockett in the flex before riddick you dont sound terrible if youre in a man league or greater
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah i would say either him or cam depending on when your league decides to draft keepers some leagues do when you drafted them last year others do it all in the last round etc and what your draft strategy is good luck
fantasyfootball,removed,id take allen robinson personally but him aj green and hopkins are all fine picks
fantasyfootball,removed,gurley there are many more goodgreat wrs than premium rbs
fantasyfootball,removed,standatd id go ap he just got another td added to his a year teddys gone now so hes gonna carry our offense again like the bleak ponder days mckinnon asiata will steal down and pass plays but that barely affects aps value i also really like eliot in both league types but relaisticly in ppr id go with someone who will catch balls hopkins green i value rb more then wr so apgurley dj miller are my top after the big are gone in any league
fantasyfootball,removed,i truly hope hopkins goes off this year and has the most fantasy points buy not because hes on my team but so people include him in the top teir of wr
fantasyfootball,removed,i like hopkins for his upside the fact that hes going to have a much better qb than hes ever had in his career and he plays in the afc south and will be up against some of the worst secondaries in the league i also like david johnson a lot hes a running back on a very talented team will get his fair share of touches whether hes catching or rushing the football and has very fresh legs compare him to other top rbs and you have guys who play on runonly offenses with bad lines gurley and ap or the rookie in elliot so in my opinion id choose one of those two leaning towards johnson because i believe hes going to be the best rb in both standard and ppr leagues it also depends on the size of your league if it is a team league draft johnson and then see if you can get another rb in the late secondearly third you can always find overlookedtalented wrs in the latter half of the draft however you really cant do that with rbs
fantasyfootball,removed,id be between hopkins or david johnson
fantasyfootball,removed,rules are keepers per team per year i have david johnson as well who is an obvious keep so its between peterson and keenan allen for the keeper
fantasyfootball,removed,charles all day even if he starts off slow charles upside is worth the risk
fantasyfootball,removed,cj anderson is also an option
fantasyfootball,removed,charles doesnt drop four rounds with current knowledge you could easily end up with both players if you draft charles first
fantasyfootball,removed,this is whats more commonly known as an overreaction
fantasyfootball,removed,last time stewart made it through games was years ago not exactly risk free either
fantasyfootball,removed,trade decker for cobb in ppr im really high on cobb this year for this reason too my and are green and watkins
fantasyfootball,removed,that is really odd the year of horrendous fantasy football apps continues really we keep waiting for google to get into the fantasy sports business httptherotocom
fantasyfootball,removed,wed be really really surprised if that were to happen honestly this sounds more like click bait to us but hey weve been wrong before httptherotocom
fantasyfootball,removed,i actually did use it correctly but alright there buddy
fantasyfootball,removed,take it immediately and then use the goddamn trade threads next time
fantasyfootball,removed,fyi use the trade threads in the sub just a suggestion you will get a bit of hate for not using those but i would do it ivory is in a rbbc with yeldon for a split i think murray would be the better option
fantasyfootball,removed,i traded macklin and cobb for aj green and sanders who won the trade
fantasyfootball,removed,i would say keep him for sure
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont think you need to do anything youre pretty set and dont need him right away if anything you could get another wr instead
fantasyfootball,removed,luckily you have lamar and latavius which is a solid rb duo and yeldon and sims are quality options off the bench i have no idea why you drafted charcandrick west although i do enjoy that you called him charmander yes i know it was intentional you can drop him for literally anybody else now your wr depth is a huge problem torrey and vjax are probably not worth anything wheaton is a at best love dhop and ty but on bye weeks or if your league requires you to start wrs thats a problem does your league have an ir spot otherwise id let dion go because the earliest youre getting him is week and i really think its gonna be longer than that if not the entire season really hard to burn a roster spot youre gonna need for so long
fantasyfootball,removed,can you not just let him hang out on the ir
fantasyfootball,removed,i would drop him i dont see his upside worth weeks of a bench spot i am not a fan of carrying tes but when you roll the dice on someone like bennet you usually need another high floor te in case he doesnt pan out like witten
fantasyfootball,removed,sharp
fantasyfootball,removed,sharpe easily way less competition for targets and enters the season fully healthy if this was a keeperdynasty format though i would prefer doctson
fantasyfootball,removed,julio or obj imo
fantasyfootball,removed,grab an elite wr and set him and forget him for the next months as he goes for catches tds and over yards have a nice day
fantasyfootball,removed,non ppr id do it last year was an anomaly top tier rbs make all the difference
fantasyfootball,removed,drop powell
fantasyfootball,removed,drop powell safer than sorry is the rule sounds like you have a team league so shud be depth out there
fantasyfootball,removed,powell should be dropped in this case despite what he did last year forte is more then likely an every down back hes a good rusher and his hands arent to shabby whereas with ware it sounds like hes giving jamaal a run for his money
fantasyfootball,removed,first pick is antonio brown dont think to hard about it try to balance out your team as much as possible start with wrs and elite rbs and dont pick a qb or te till a little bit later in the draft if you pick an injury prone rb jamaal charles lesean mccoy matt forte etc try to pick up his handcuff a handcuff is the player that is on the depth chart always draft a kicker with your last pick and draft a defense in the later rounds as well they are less valuable in terms of point scoring do your best to get a backup qb in the later rounds as well no need to take two high scoring qbs try to make sure your starting rb wrs dont all have the same bye week most importantly have fun
fantasyfootball,removed,floyd train chooooo chooooo
fantasyfootball,removed,this is the exact thought ive had that is making this a tough decision thanks for the insight
fantasyfootball,removed,if youre not familiar with beersheets custom sheet is close to matching your scoring settings and may be helpful as a general guide
fantasyfootball,removed,id drop either in a heartbeat for ware
fantasyfootball,removed,i would say target wr but dont kill yourself doing so look for value with alshon amari or someone in that tier
fantasyfootball,removed,what have i done should i start him over foster for week zona defense lean in his favor over the ground game
fantasyfootball,removed,i just put in a waiver on kelley in my team league figured hed be a more high upside option over kadeem carey whatre your thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone drop steve smith for kelley in a team
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah im fairly torn between keenan dez or shady in my ppr league im pretty sure dez will go before my pick anyway but im almost positive both keenan and shady will be on the board and im not totally surethane who i like more
fantasyfootball,removed,are new beersheets coming out today
fantasyfootball,removed,isnt foster supposed to be starting in miami id drop ajayi
fantasyfootball,removed,use beersheets
fantasyfootball,removed,beersheets or fantasypros rankings imo
fantasyfootball,removed,great sense of humor wish you good luck god bless
fantasyfootball,removed,use mathew berrys rankings
fantasyfootball,removed,if you have online access use jayzhengcom in a pinch also as mentioned beersheets
fantasyfootball,removed,pick foster in and bell in second then turn around pick up aware at round you will be set
fantasyfootball,removed,you have it the opposite way idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,honestly my stafford opinion might be a drunk on koolaid thing but personally i feel he could have a very good season this year over the second half of the season stafford had the best statistical performance of any lions quarterback ever there arent a lot of great qbs in lions history but that still says something maybe that was because of megatron he certainly had some good games maybe that was because of a new coordinator amd defenses wont be surprised this season maybe it was a fluke go back two years ago megatron was limited by injury he was out for several games as well the lions won many of those games if i remember correctly most of those wins were come from behind wins they had a bunch that season including the last second field goal against atlanta in london tate performed very well in the wr role and maybe he could do it again other tidbits i feel like the recievers now have better hands than previously i remember someone in the lions subreddit posting the drop statistics for some of the new recievers and they were very good tate already has very good hands thats good for stafford because he throws it hot and fast ill post more in a bit
fantasyfootball,removed,probably the one thats a way better player than the other
fantasyfootball,removed,marshall if fitz signs otherwise robinson
fantasyfootball,removed,robinson adding a running game should help
fantasyfootball,removed,great breakdown i have a tough keeper decision to make with a rob i can keep two as my first two round picks bell freeman dez arob im leaning towards bell and robinson right now any thoughts would be much appreciated
fantasyfootball,removed,this kills the tys and criefs
fantasyfootball,removed,got one player left to play its between crabtree and nuk and i need points to win going with nuk somebody in my position start crabtree so hopefully at least one of us will be able to go to bed tonight without killing ourselves
fantasyfootball,removed,i understand youre not that bright you said youd be offended by someone other than me which means you have the ability to be offended by redditors how sad you simpleton
fantasyfootball,removed,lmao butthurt lil bitchhhh
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck you man
fantasyfootball,removed,hey mods rfantasyfootball surely looking at the leagues settings or googling the answer is easier why dont you block him too dipshits
fantasyfootball,removed,or botching at you homie i had the same issue and the mods blocked me for simply asking the community instead of googling it bitching at those dip shits
fantasyfootball,removed,was up by and opponent had hopkins i needed to win to make playoffs glad osweiler cant throw

fantasyfootball,removed,everyone but freeman
fantasyfootball,removed,id go with murray
fantasyfootball,removed,miller and ware
fantasyfootball,removed,id say dj and blount obviously id lean rawls over gore but that is the hard pick
fantasyfootball,removed,id sit freeman but keep an eye on leseans status
fantasyfootball,removed,ingram
fantasyfootball,removed,gordon ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,devonte freeman and booker
fantasyfootball,removed,wes welker for how good edelmen has been doing id expect it to affect his value
fantasyfootball,removed,really you guys have people that actually trade my keeper league is full of dummys offered crow and riddick for pryor he reoffered pryor for my future first rounder lol i have kelley couldnt get squat for him rather keep him behind mccoy and bell
fantasyfootball,removed,okay so im making a block buster deal and trading odell in my man im and need i win the next two and have either team a or team b lose the next two its possible but slim and i need something to turn my team around should i do this deal or no i was trying to fleece baldwin from him but that didnt work out httpiimgurcomewrrtqujpg
fantasyfootball,removed,lamar miller with round keeper status for next year just lost aj
fantasyfootball,removed,trade dj and jordy for melvin and julio
fantasyfootball,removed,howard ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,ware ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,jeremy hill ppr really need a receiver
fantasyfootball,removed,and what do you know so is bell youre a fucking idiot you said so many dumb things but then you still think you can come back here with an i told you so youre fucking delusional bro
fantasyfootball,removed,antonio gates
fantasyfootball,removed,give rob kelleyjordan matthews for jordy nelson at wr i have matthews diggs crowder britt hill enunwa sharp at rb i have tevin coleman ware rawls rob kelley duke johnson team ppr with wr rb flex
fantasyfootball,removed,demarco murray need a wr to take greens place
fantasyfootball,removed,demarco
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr team qb luck wr cooper cooks j matthews michael thomas rb e elliot rawls hyde ajayi te gronk dst seattle kstream i think i have a pretty good team but my predicament is now who to start at flex every week rawls hydeand ajayi seems to be very similar any tips on best flex is i seem to be stacked in rbs any trades i can make to bolster my roster even more thanks guys
fantasyfootball,removed,awww is someone oppressed
fantasyfootball,removed,agree hell be exposed again in the playoffs
fantasyfootball,removed,should i just go no defense based on my leagues rules so far ive had rams steelers rams i missed out on all of the good defenses and now its a crapshoot each week theres or defenses that net a reasonable score but the rest get less than points and as bad as points would it be safe to just go empty on defense here are the rules
fantasyfootball,removed,you know who doesnt know what theyre talking about you whereas i do know what im talking about dont you ever criticize any decision i make again you fucking idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,i mean why the fuck would i post about it before hand i did respond with a lol earlier by the way its not like i was afraid to respond to you being a dipshit
fantasyfootball,removed,id do it if you could
fantasyfootball,removed,fox is an idiot ill yourself
fantasyfootball,removed,if you can get decent value for blount id say its a no brainer the patriots backfield is not something id want to be a part of once brady and gronk are back
fantasyfootball,removed,everyone saying his value will go down keep this in mind in games the pats win by he has averaged carries per game and something like per game in all others forgot exactly what it was and im on mobile thats even with brady and gronk on the field so yea i think his value drops from an but i fully expect him to stay am
fantasyfootball,removed,im holding top handcuff when lewis comes back brady helps blount no more stacked boxes blount feasts when pats are winning brady will only improve that
fantasyfootball,removed,officially httpfantasynflcomresearchstatcorrections
fantasyfootball,removed,youre a fucking idiot seriously hence the down votes
fantasyfootball,removed,he played to expectations
fantasyfootball,removed,confirmed youre a fucking idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,week opponents d points vikings week points texans week points chiefs week i face the broncos get ready for a point week for their defense
fantasyfootball,removed,droppable in ppr espn man leagues where im playing against you
fantasyfootball,removed,lol yes he was what are you talking about
fantasyfootball,removed,trade hopkins for pryor straight up
fantasyfootball,removed,droppable in all formats
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah but is he sharpe worth or the next big man up is crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,theres a trade thread for this but who do you get
fantasyfootball,removed,would you burn for for an emmanuel sanders that was dropped a bit hastily
fantasyfootball,removed,no i dont
fantasyfootball,removed,someone will shit on you for wdis but im interested in this discussion as well have fleener and depending what he does tonight im likely to drop him and try and go for one of these two
fantasyfootball,removed,wilson is hurt supposedly so i guess that would favor rudolph
fantasyfootball,removed,same here like rudolph for consistent looks but the possibility of more lines like yesterday from graham are enticing
fantasyfootball,removed,this is a shit post literally could of just read the buy low thread and the ww pickup thread the mods in this sub need to step up ill clearify on why this is a waste of space everyone has different needs because everyones roster is different this is a lazy post go read the threads that get posted everyday
fantasyfootball,removed,michael has looked great in camp preseason and the first three games of the year hell go back to the end of last season and he played really well so this isnt a one game sample this isnt just breaking off a big run he was averaging ypc coming into the game he had some great holes to run through but what impressed me yesterday were the times he shouldve been tackled for a loss but got back to the los he was explosive and breaking tackles all game
fantasyfootball,removed,i was offered allen robinson and latavius murray for julian edelman quincy enunwa and matt jones should i do it
fantasyfootball,removed,i was just offered arob and murray for edelman matt jones and enunwa thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,michael thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,not cadet
fantasyfootball,removed,give me cadet coleman has proven to be fodder and cadet got targets in the saints last home game
fantasyfootball,removed,okay these dick mods keep deleting my post asking who to start between brandon coleman or travaris cadet tonight as if half of these other posts are more useful im sure im not the only one who believed snead and thought hed play tonight but im assuming this is where i should ask this standard league btw and sorry for the saltiness im just tired of typing this shit over and over lol
fantasyfootball,removed,so i currently have baldwin as my and c mike on the bench would it be worth moving my flex fitzgerald into that spot and putting cmike at my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,so it looks like in limited sample size the away team is percent more like to lose than normal homeroad splits that might be statistically significant but ive seen fantasy point statistical models showing there is no significance for fantasy purposes let me see if i can find it
fantasyfootball,removed,fleener hype intensifies intesifies
fantasyfootball,removed,this entirely depends on your league guys in mine were throwing at fuller t benjamin and wallace its safe to say itll take the same for sanders as hes the big ww option this week
fantasyfootball,removed,trying to figure out a good offer now im trying to get him cheapish of course hoping his owner thinks hes stuck in an rbbc team ppr trying to get him for jamison crowder a depth rb maybe
fantasyfootball,removed,ha im a bell owner eagerly expecting his runningback back and what do you know my opponent has charles
fantasyfootball,removed,gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,david johnson and mark ingram so my running backs arent bad i am kind of conflicted cause i also have allen robinson and alshon and jordy would be a sick addition but i dont know if im willing to give up on three serviceable players regardless thanks so much for responding
fantasyfootball,removed,shepherd he has best opportunity and upside
fantasyfootball,removed,sheppard because of the volume now that vereen is down for a bit eli will be looking to his wideouts even more
fantasyfootball,removed,sterling shepard less mouths to feed there compared to new orleans
fantasyfootball,removed,wait for after tonights game to see how sanu plays but shepard would be my choice he gets targets receptions and makes great plays id avoid thomas because brees loves to spread the ball
fantasyfootball,removed,shepard without a doubt
fantasyfootball,removed,i think ol breakdowns are huge you get a feel for the ol but also see the talent of the running back and see how they playwhat they see and how they make decisions also see pass pro sets for example you get to see the differences in why someone like leveon bell is so valuable its not just his patience and decision making but also how good their ol is compared to someone like matt jones or a crowell i wish i had more time to watch and breakdown i think theres value for seeing the pass pro and techniques of the ol for picking a defense
fantasyfootball,removed,i think you got fleecedlol just an opinion though
fantasyfootball,removed,nope
fantasyfootball,removed,powell isnt taking anyones job it wouldve happened by now
fantasyfootball,removed,i didnt play that long tough for undrafted i wasnt ever scared its more of a fuck if i dont go all out im going to get hurt imo theres very very little of the nut grabbing even though we are all crazy we are still people lol but theres always outliers even in college there was very little of that from my experience one time i was playing against coples in college he was a dirty as fuck player and this was his year before the draft he tried to poke me in the eye during a play so on the next play i hit him in the knee completely legally he ended up being near the pile afterwards so i roughed him up and knocked him into it sorta low he got up pissed off before he could say anything i yelled at him if you fucking do one more dirty thing ill end your nfl career before it even starts i dont give a fuck bitch needless to say after that it was quarter he played very very clean and almost hesitant me personally and i bet for most people didnt want to hurt others on nonfootball things i wanted to hurt people by putting my shoulders into them and de cleating or pancaking them
fantasyfootball,removed,welcome theres definitely a universal vocabulary but whats cool is that you only learn football from your coaches or if you watch someone else play its literally passed on between generations of players or people who have figured it out from watching others thats why op and i are both right each coach and playbook has different terminology somethings are the same others have different names hmmm i wouldnt know dont know if i can help here i grew up with a football in my hand ive played every position except corner back and safety over my years playing
fantasyfootball,removed,precisely we dont know the extent of their friendship and the guy may actually find it hilarious
fantasyfootball,removed,quick question im a ravens fan and we obviously have a nice kicker should i trade stephen gostowski for justin tucker
fantasyfootball,removed,hellz yes
fantasyfootball,removed,it starts in the trenches
fantasyfootball,removed,being anonymous is a good thing
fantasyfootball,removed,i didnt even think about thr inches thing until my college coach told me thats why technique is so important
fantasyfootball,removed,im in the predicament of choosing between foster and some wrs for my flex spot this week would love opinions here is a link to my atm i have foster out because he is up against seattle d
fantasyfootball,removed,what about langford or jennings or cmike in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,this thread is absolute fucking cancer
fantasyfootball,removed,you guys live for this shit philly at home against cleveland or new england on the road against arizona
fantasyfootball,removed,damn this makes it a tough call for me yeldon or welker
fantasyfootball,removed,this puts me in a harder place as a charles owner i am think at rb and have to choose between yeldon and crowell now
fantasyfootball,removed,well in your case you have no choice but to start him i like the guy and from what ive seen hes done good in the preseason however most sites have him ranked ridiculously high for a rookie starting his first regular season game against a rival team on top of that but hell definitely do decent at least and better than rivers imo
fantasyfootball,removed,nobody cares
fantasyfootball,removed,i am very tempted to put in yeldon over hill now in my standard league
fantasyfootball,removed,i have yeldon powell matt jones and tevin coleman for my my gut was telling me matt jones but maybe yeldon now its ppr what do you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,does this place yeldon above duke johnson in ppr now
fantasyfootball,removed,i currently have diggs in as my flex is it safer to put yeldon in
fantasyfootball,removed,yeldon or matt jones in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,what would you like to know
fantasyfootball,removed,played without going to any combine
fantasyfootball,removed,dammit im struggling between yeldon or c mike for my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,at the moment i think rob kelley is more valuable than barner barner has mathews ahead of him on the depth chart and will likely be fighting for scraps after sproles gets his kelley on the other hand has does enough in joness absence to warrant a share of the carries and could even make a claim for more if jones cant get the ball moving id take kelley over barner
fantasyfootball,removed,could be a sports hernia
fantasyfootball,removed,and i have one open bench spot im going to pick someone up but i dont know who what do you guys think httpiimgurcomgsuppcvpng
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah i would you dont need receivers but i think sharpe offers better overall value than west
fantasyfootball,removed,crabtree is safer and a good bye week fill in sharpe is a boom or bust guy i would actually drop parker and pick them both up assuming you have an open space already
fantasyfootball,removed,drop jameis regardless of who you pick up i would actually pick up bennet for now just to see how he does
fantasyfootball,removed,probably sproles the other two i dont have much trust in
fantasyfootball,removed,meh that whole rule about adding too many people from the same team doesnt really apply to kickers i would add vinny since i dont think theyll score too much but always get close
fantasyfootball,removed,can you trade someone you dont have the best rbs and ware and michael have some value even if its shortlived if not then sims is probably the one that has to go
fantasyfootball,removed,kelley is the only one that has a good chance of starting as of right now
fantasyfootball,removed,i mean not right now you dont need him and i doubt hes gonna get picked up any time soon
fantasyfootball,removed,id drop dookie
fantasyfootball,removed,drop dak no one needs two qbs
fantasyfootball,removed,i mean if youre getting peterson then fuck yeah
fantasyfootball,removed,i would for sure do that first trade for either of those guys you dont need brown and either of them is way better than murray
fantasyfootball,removed,wrong thread
fantasyfootball,removed,i would do this k allen isnt sharing targets with anyone right now and i think he has a better shot of blowing up than marshall does
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr need one of the follow to start with mccoy spencer ware vs sd duke johnson phi charles sims atl
fantasyfootball,removed,i mean if foster goes back to his old self he can win the league for you but so can c mike if rawls never gets back to form or gets hurt again i would give the nod to foster just because he isnt sharing the backfield with anyone
fantasyfootball,removed,yup id wait it out with what you got and hope charles comes back in form
fantasyfootball,removed,still doesnt rule out sports hernia
fantasyfootball,removed,this is not a bad trade but like the other guy sais he is the best qb in the league i would do the trade if he offered someone better at wr
fantasyfootball,removed,i would actually do this just becuase i think murray will be a good goal line back youre also trading a back rb for a guy who will get work even if hes better in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,ledarius green and which benjamin you gotta be more specific
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah for sure
fantasyfootball,removed,i think you can trade either of your qbs for a better rb
fantasyfootball,removed,this is tough but i think you go with the guy who is going to get involved in gates too many question marks with bennet for me
fantasyfootball,removed,id go carr just because that defense sucks ass
fantasyfootball,removed,duke and gore i dont even think rawls is playing and west isnt going to do much behind ware
fantasyfootball,removed,jones is he plays
fantasyfootball,removed,hilton for sure then marvin jones
fantasyfootball,removed,maclin and crabtree
fantasyfootball,removed,cobb and landry
fantasyfootball,removed,alshon
fantasyfootball,removed,cobb
fantasyfootball,removed,cobb
fantasyfootball,removed,toss up between tate and floyd i would go withfloyd just because fitz and brown have question makrs around them
fantasyfootball,removed,the first three without a doubt
fantasyfootball,removed,cobb and evans
fantasyfootball,removed,allen for sure too much talent to ignore
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah for sure youre getting an upgrade at every position except te
fantasyfootball,removed,woodhead
fantasyfootball,removed,yeldon or ware
fantasyfootball,removed,not even hard yeldon
fantasyfootball,removed,but what does this do to wes welkers value
fantasyfootball,removed,what about wes welker
fantasyfootball,removed,allen
fantasyfootball,removed,walford or efron in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,michael all day
fantasyfootball,removed,walford or barnidge
fantasyfootball,removed,moncreif or micahel in flex
fantasyfootball,removed,so uhwalford over dwayne allen or what
fantasyfootball,removed,ertz or walford
fantasyfootball,removed,jordy or giovanni bernard ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr gordon on the road vs kc or edelman without brady

fantasyfootball,removed,you can tell that the dallas oline is helping dak he looks way more poised and relaxed
fantasyfootball,removed,kenny stills out here crushing dreams
fantasyfootball,removed,if this keeps up beasley is going to be the wr in the league this year
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont have him on my team but it didnt look like he was really effective today
fantasyfootball,removed,lose week season over super whack bro fuck espn making you start all those rubbish players you drafted
fantasyfootball,removed,youre not going to make me feel bad about lazy fucks
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah atleast you can still check scores and what not im not praising espn for it just giving people a heads up you cunt
fantasyfootball,removed,same how the heck does a kid from stanford suck so bad at learning a playbook brees goes nuclear and he has one catch for less than yards worthless bum
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt be concerned if i was a dez owner i think everyone should realize theyre going to be pedestrian and ease dak in hell get his shots
fantasyfootball,removed,wtf is tom brady even on the field
fantasyfootball,removed,i hear damien marley was unavailable and they wanted the worst damien available
fantasyfootball,removed,i recognize that my life is fucking awesome i dont recognize what the point of your comment really was
fantasyfootball,removed,i started latavius murray and lamar miller over him still would
fantasyfootball,removed,team just lost keenan allen i have jeremy maclinlarry fitzjordan matthews as my other wrs at rb i have mark ingram david johnson and jamaal charles spencer west owner wants to get charles what do you think of charles for sammy watkins
fantasyfootball,removed,allen who
fantasyfootball,removed,keep gurley arob and allen
fantasyfootball,removed,shut your fucking mouth
fantasyfootball,removed,beepbeep im a bot your comment seems sad to us cheer up have a ps this bot is powered by ai httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcejlvmnrty
fantasyfootball,removed,i used of my to draft him this year because i too believe hes a generational talent he passes the eye test in so many ways its almost unbelievable dj was the only player that was a mustown for me during our draft league mates mocked his price and said he didnt even know who dj was i promised him after this year hed never forget lets hope im right
fantasyfootball,removed,so when do you go running back at if julio and odell are gone
fantasyfootball,removed,jheri curl sterl because sterling shepards dad back in the day rocked a jheri curl at oklahoma derrick had been asking out cheri sheps mom whenever he got the chance but she told him not until he shaved that jheri curl off his head so sure enough he got it cut asked her out she finally said yes and the rest is history
fantasyfootball,removed,ill take brown his last seasons together have been truly historic hes much older than obj but still not old steelers o will continue to thrive through ben and brown is your league standard or ppr if its standard i could make the argument for obj as he catches more tds
fantasyfootball,removed,had a debate with a buddy last night and we were talking about these two the ending conclusion is that beckham is in fact safer based on the longevity of health that eli has demonstrated vs that of large ben with that said i saw a stat that over the last games in which ben has played of the snaps brown has gone for i cant pass up that type of production and would be willing to gamble on bens ability to stay upright
fantasyfootball,removed,as a giant fan even ill say brown hes just too safe as a top for the next years but anything after that will be odell in his prime and then gimme that obj
fantasyfootball,removed,who is your starting you have tons of high ceiling picks like bell zeke white cooks sharpe but not a solid floor i wouldnt make that trade period since bell is a solid when he plays and allen is a solid for a solid rb in miller but a maybe in tate keep your team but maybe try to find a week fill in for bell james white ne or a bal rb that might get carries
fantasyfootball,removed,wrong i dont come here for upvotes ill post however i want even if it hurts the feelings of the underground circle jerkers
fantasyfootball,removed,just take ab and move on no discussion here
fantasyfootball,removed,these guys dont know more than you do imtalking to you anybody who visits this sub
fantasyfootball,removed,honestly i think your pretty set in a team it might hurt until bell gets back but i like langfords potential you know stewart will get his carries and hyde is intriguing in kellys offense just play the waiver wire and i think youll be okay
fantasyfootball,removed,did you accidentally type leveon instead of joique
fantasyfootball,removed,it doesnt even make sense you have those wrs and you have belljust shut the fuck up and go away
fantasyfootball,removed,i think youd be fine but you are going to be disappointed by jennings stewart is definitely a starter over jennings
fantasyfootball,removed,to be fair watching football in standard quality sucks major ass compared to hd quality hd streams are hard to come by consistently
fantasyfootball,removed,dez you can get a better rb than rawls in the first few rounds
fantasyfootball,removed,if you keep gronk you lose your first round pick i assume i wouldnt do that personally is there someone else you can keep and lose a pick from a different round or is your keeper automatically your round pick
fantasyfootball,removed,if you can guarantee david johnson i would go with him if not nah
fantasyfootball,removed,but i have gordon and zeke with cobb cooks and julio i wish there was a way to start him lol
fantasyfootball,removed,👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
fantasyfootball,removed,you must be new here
fantasyfootball,removed,let me put it this way someone offered me hopkins for arian foster and i rejected it
fantasyfootball,removed,id say so ya

fantasyfootball,removed,montgomery essentially a wr you can plug into the rb slot in a ppr league this is your golden ticket i wouldnt trade him for blount
fantasyfootball,removed,no id stick with blount gronk and bennett on the oline gives him good running lanesops ty montgomery has had one maybe two solid outings but with the amount of toucheswork is susceptible to injury
fantasyfootball,removed,nope keep blount hes got a proven value with the pats whereas montgomery will likely begin to lose carries to knile davis when he gets up to speed with the offense and james starks when he is healthy
fantasyfootball,removed,cam newton and melvin gordon team ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,alshon jefferies and cameron meredith

fantasyfootball,removed,guy just sent me an offer my jarvis landry for his jamal charles do we think he will make it back for playoffs my wrs are amari cooper jordy nelson and jarvis landry maclin and t williams rbs are d johnson l murray and duke johnson with a waiver in for tye montgomery just worried ware has solidified his place as the rb in kansas and landry is a ppr monster worth the risk
fantasyfootball,removed,dt
fantasyfootball,removed,s
fantasyfootball,removed,dt
fantasyfootball,removed,but that gap is huge ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,yea and i came to the conclusion that youre an idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,should probably be asked in a different thread but would u guys use a waiver on him or moncrief
fantasyfootball,removed,i am at league i need to start ty mon zach miller ruodolph eifert m thomas out of these i am thinking doing tymthomasruodolph is this good
fantasyfootball,removed,heres a
fantasyfootball,removed,lamar miller for me drafted him in the late rounds his second year randomly and also because he was backing up someone injury prone targeted him his third year when he broke yards rushing then traded for him after week last year unfortunately dont have him this year yet also have drafted josh gordon every year after his breakout year lol
fantasyfootball,removed,qb streaming used kaepernick this week cameron meredith benching now until i see how he does with cutler ty montgomery te vernon davis rb mike davis cutting was just a fillin since hyde was out and now on bye flex isaiah crowell flex jamison crowder k tucker def new england bench wr michael thomas cecil shorts iii cutting bench rb doug martin carlos hyde my roster is pretty crappy but its a league i scraped it out this week with a bunch of scrubs and fillins
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,just turned him and james white into kelvin benjamin i feel free
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,eifert ate titties
fantasyfootball,removed,youre low effort and stupid
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr league i get to keep two players out of these three who should i keep keenan allen he would be my round draft pick tavon austin willie snead
fantasyfootball,removed,uh no duh
fantasyfootball,removed,you are an idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,ray rices greatest hits offensive holding issues hash gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got kickerlivesmatter bye week and bill cosbys sleepers
fantasyfootball,removed,sticking with last years cosby pills and smash
fantasyfootball,removed,virgil green over zach miller andor eric ebron
fantasyfootball,removed,think its a good trade with ingram for evans ppr team league gurley is my woodhead my my wrs arent very flashy but i have depth decker fitzgerald d jackson m floyd k aiken p dorsett cant decide if i should lean on my rbs and hope for a breakout or try and even it out a bit
fantasyfootball,removed,jared cook or virgil green
fantasyfootball,removed,careful umargravos will be here soon to tell us all to stop talking about him
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm thinking of playing benjamin number wr for panthers great chemistry with cam either him or decker who faces cincy whos pass d is pretty gd anyway panthers fan here so its always nice to have that added cheer
fantasyfootball,removed,i have a trade that i wanna ask you guys about its a ppr espn league i will be giving up amari cooper doug martin and lamar miller i will be receiving todd gurley demaryaus thomas and ryan matthews i still have antonio brown on my team and i have jonathan stewart for a second back with ryan matthews if i did pull the trigger thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard leaguei have bilal powell as my for now and jimmy graham is a fa should i drop powell for graham i already have eifert in my ir spot and dwayne allen filling in until eifert is back
fantasyfootball,removed,downvote this man
fantasyfootball,removed,my bold predictions something clicks with sam bradford going to the vikings and he ends the season a top qb startable in most leagues marvin jones is the steal of the draft ends up a top wr but golden tate also ends as a top by end of season you could have started both if you had both and it wouldnt lose you a game jameis winston rides the production of mike evans and he ends the season a top qb devonta freeman regresses hard under a struggling shanahan offense ends the season no better than a however tevin coleman is still the backup all season giants think the preseason is now weeks long and obj takes a big hit he ends the season outside the top bonus prediction this hurts me to my core to say because im a lions fan the packers find their stride with the return of jordy and it paves the way for jared cook to be a top te by the end of the season jordy ends the season in top cobb in top eddie in top and aaron top
fantasyfootball,removed,i wouldnt keep him
fantasyfootball,removed,requesting a logo for ojs slashers dashers thanks in advance
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah we do idp as well and was thinking of just not drafting any lol
fantasyfootball,removed,sorry man we are and per yards passing with tds all around
fantasyfootball,removed,ingram martin is injured the next weeks
fantasyfootball,removed,even if martin was healthy id like ingram more
fantasyfootball,removed,mark ingram today martin in the playoffs
fantasyfootball,removed,zzzzzzzz
fantasyfootball,removed,hes playing wr too
fantasyfootball,removed,please change my mind in the matchup that i think im still rolling with bennett or grabbing dwayne
fantasyfootball,removed,what a shitty shitty game
fantasyfootball,removed,idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,he still rated houston
fantasyfootball,removed,bench brock
fantasyfootball,removed,i never asked for special treatment i asked for help within the sub thanks for the link but dont be such a dick considering i made this post before the adddrop one was live plus im doing this from my phone not an excuse but maybe you should realize that not everyone has the knowledge or resources as you and giving them shit about it is a kinda assholeligio thing to do
fantasyfootball,removed,i have a pending trade offer to trade miller for allen robinson thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,ivory is on your ww is there anybody else you can drop because pick him up before somebody else does yeldon is trash ivory is a starting rb waiting to be let loose
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr robinson marshall bryant wallace not sure if marshall will be sitting this week or not should i start wallace over him
fantasyfootball,removed,howd that turn out lmao
fantasyfootball,removed,ahahahahaha
fantasyfootball,removed,ivory is available on fa ppr man my bench spencer ware frank gore emmanuel sanders matt jones tajae sharpe tyrell williams tevin coleman anyone worth dropping for him i think almost certainly no
fantasyfootball,removed,i all our os
fantasyfootball,removed,his value is tricky soo many people hate the way bill toys with rbs and fantasy owners i see him as a top overall ros but i believe the masses are more in the top range blount for demaryius thomas yes or no
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start hyde or ivory yeah its that bad lol
fantasyfootball,removed,do i keep my round pick eddie lacy in points weeks and or bench him for ivory
fantasyfootball,removed,you are as retarded as that bitch that pushed you out of her useless cunt if you think brady is going to average and for the rest of the season
fantasyfootball,removed,removed
fantasyfootball,removed,why is it very likely charles gets injured he has two injuries in his career an acl tear for each knee otherwise hes always healthy
fantasyfootball,removed,trying to work a deal to send langford for cobb think im getting good value for him
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,who would you start yeldon or ivory and yea its that bad for me ap and abdullah down things are tight lol
fantasyfootball,removed,zach miller over antonio gatess replacement playing the colts and jordan cameron playing cleveland
fantasyfootball,removed,so i have spencer ware and christine michael who should i start
fantasyfootball,removed,good lord why is ivory available
fantasyfootball,removed,ivory has a higher ceiling langford is in the dog house and fox is known to go with the hot handhoward so i would say ivory just because of his upside yeldon has looked bad and could not secure the starting job down with ivory out
fantasyfootball,removed,you are an idiot effects everyone differently you may be barely inebriated but i would trust my wife on a bicycle and a
fantasyfootball,removed,willams without a doubt imo indys defense is ugly and philip is a slinger
fantasyfootball,removed,gio for allen robinson they had absolutely zero rbs after last weekend i still feel a little bad about it cmike for ty is equally as rapey good work
fantasyfootball,removed,try this one
fantasyfootball,removed,tevin coleman or devante parker standard league flex spot
fantasyfootball,removed,sharpe or sterling shepard for megood but touch choices
fantasyfootball,removed,im rolling with diggs and sharpe trying to decide between enunwa and gio in the flex
fantasyfootball,removed,lol thats not what a handcuff is jackass a handcuff is the backup who becomes the workhorse if the star gets injured they have no other use in fantasy you dont ever play a handcuff unless that situation occurs and you dont expect to get x number of points from them each week unless they become the workhorse idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,my entire bench or one bench slot please enlighten us all on the proper way to use a bench oh fantasy football master also i didnt give advice i put you in your place with facts jackass
fantasyfootball,removed,what the hell are you talking about there is no report of any such groin injury even the tweet doesnt say that zimmer said he was held out for precautionary measures hes fine
fantasyfootball,removed,woah woah woah what are you a white supremacist i cant believe this is not a joke httpswwwhillaryclintoncomfeeddonaldtrumppepethefrogandwhitesupremacistsanexplainer
fantasyfootball,removed,would you buy with a continuous waiver priority
fantasyfootball,removed,uh source
fantasyfootball,removed,coming from the guy who said i trust cousins over carson palmer this year youre the damn idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,league standard have mccoy and gore as my starting rbs after losing ap should i burn my waiver on foster who was just dropped
fantasyfootball,removed,it originally said join our nazi team
fantasyfootball,removed,hm would you start jennings forsett vs jags or mckinnon vs panthers this week
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,no you didnt find nearest bridge
fantasyfootball,removed,trade him for olsen
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start him over diggs or dt this week
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trade dez legarrette for him because i just did
fantasyfootball,removed,so will edelman be scored as a qb if i have him in my wr spot on yahoo
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm thanks gives me a bit more to think about ill probably swap my waiver claims around times tonight and then miss out on both because someone else in my league also needs a new bye week receiver oh well
fantasyfootball,removed,crowder for sure similar floor but crowders ceiling is much higher you can never expect more than catches for yards from beasley
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop him for tannehill wentz dak or winston need backup to rivers
fantasyfootball,removed,i would say crowder we dont know what kind of usage beasley will see when romo comes back could still be great but its a question crowder doesnt have looming over him
fantasyfootball,removed,i have him in an team ppr league where we get point for every return yards should i keep him for his return ability
fantasyfootball,removed,i did
fantasyfootball,removed,not yet
fantasyfootball,removed,im doing it my team is stacked though that is not to brag though it depends on your teams settings mine counts all purpose yards i feel like i have to start crowder every week based off that alone
fantasyfootball,removed,wondering the same thing you are got waiver priority so im taking ol jameo i got sanu and snead and theres only so many roster spots i can give to oftinjured wrs when hurt rbs are trendy this year
fantasyfootball,removed,wrong williams mang
fantasyfootball,removed,im holding tyrell in the hopes he turns into allen jr i lost allen so i need something to comfort me
fantasyfootball,removed,i thought the same but you still want him after he didnt come through in a prime matchup last week
fantasyfootball,removed,travis benjamin had a similiar hype train last year than disappeared im no pro but i feel like the browns are prone to these flashs in the pan
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,crowder plus hell get more targets if reed misses any time itll offset your loss
fantasyfootball,removed,dez might be hurt doe
fantasyfootball,removed,he did in the second half of last year
fantasyfootball,removed,tossing sharpe to the wire that titans offense just flows through the rb it seems
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,yes you can sharp has an old man game all savvy without the athleticism i think good nfl corners will shut him down with enough film low ceiling athlete in a low ceiling passing offense
fantasyfootball,removed,then keep them and quit your bitchin for fucks sake
fantasyfootball,removed,am i the only one who thinks washington isnt that good and cousins is due for major regression from last season in addition to all that
fantasyfootball,removed,crowder is a better yardagered zone bet but i wonder if doctson is any threat to steal away looks as the season progresses
fantasyfootball,removed,who is the better pickup between crowder and jordan howard
fantasyfootball,removed,you seem confident romo will return for more than a play before shattering again
fantasyfootball,removed,so the question i have is start him or sanders or put him in flex over cmike or neither
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone drop michael floyd for jamison crowder because im about to do it
fantasyfootball,removed,no need to be a douchebag
fantasyfootball,removed,drop the other waiver claims if you want walker they will bump you to bottom of queue
fantasyfootball,removed,got offered him for blount i should take it right
fantasyfootball,removed,interface is screwed up for me almost every time i go to my playbook it fails to see that i am a paying customer its so frustrating i cant find a way around it other than clicking a bunch of times over and over until it finally works randomly
fantasyfootball,removed,youd take them over alshon then
fantasyfootball,removed,just submitted for him dropping sharpegot too many dann titans demarco henry sharpe and delanie
fantasyfootball,removed,might be a stupid question but would you drop desean jackson for crowder jackson has out scored him by over the weeks in standard but im looking for a more high floor guy and crowder seems like that
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop allen hurns for crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,i think you do especially in ppr cousins is leading the league in yardage because thats the only way they stay relevant and hes his favorite receiver they also have had a limited amount of touchdowns so you can expect those to increase a bit and him get a few of em i think its reasonable he finishes with like yards and tds
fantasyfootball,removed,crowder because mediocre wrs are everywhere
fantasyfootball,removed,drop k drake for him
fantasyfootball,removed,drop moncrief for him
fantasyfootball,removed,i think youre getting downvoted by people who dont understand flex plays
fantasyfootball,removed,i just got offered demarco and mike wallace for lacy d allen and asiata i should take that right
fantasyfootball,removed,might use that waiver ive been saving i also need a qb but wentz has a way better chance of making it to fa and i feel like im just going to keep saving it for that perfect thing that will proceed to never happen
fantasyfootball,removed,do i use the waiver pick on crowder ppr and my wrs are cooks demaryius decker shepard enunwa and agholor or could go for howard but im not sure hell be worth it
fantasyfootball,removed,do i use the waiver pick on crowder ppr and my wrs are cooks demaryius decker shepard enunwa and agholor or could go for howard but im not sure hell be worth it
fantasyfootball,removed,free agent pickup should i choose christine michael or terrelle pryor ppr league of i have similar depth at both positions i would put whoever i choose at the flex
fantasyfootball,removed,web
fantasyfootball,removed,drop victor cruz for crowder other options are michael floyd and dorsett if my other waiver does not go through
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop donte moncrief for him
fantasyfootball,removed,you were just dying to break out the word tertiary all day werent you
fantasyfootball,removed,you have me intrigued since i never use them would you drop anquan boldin or tavon austin hed be a nice safety net for the team me thinks
fantasyfootball,removed,its my first year using it w budget im dropping
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone drop sanu for crowder this week wondering if sanus value will rise later in the season so thinking of stashing him
fantasyfootball,removed,say you already own yeldon would you trade yeldon for ivory hes rotting on your bench as your
fantasyfootball,removed,enunwa or sharpe is on the chopping block
fantasyfootball,removed,drop cruz to pick him up hes getting a lot more targets but i feel like cruz has a higher ceiling
fantasyfootball,removed,i have leveon bell jc ryan matthews and latavius at rb diggs decker tyrell will and michael floyd at wr would you trade latavius murray and decker for aj green or stick with depth
fantasyfootball,removed,please no
fantasyfootball,removed,as of week nice job
fantasyfootball,removed,i just did
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop tyrell for crowder ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm cant seem drop yeldon or tyrell williams
fantasyfootball,removed,stashed minnesota last week as fa and started cinci lost by points with sota on the bench but excited to have them regardless
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop stewart for dixon
fantasyfootball,removed,do you think so i have the waiver priority as of now and plan to use it was going to grab kyle rudolph to fill julius bye week but what it be best to use it on the vikings d i normally stream hasnt gone well this year
fantasyfootball,removed,do you guys think crowder is worth picking up over chris ivory in a team ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,thinking of dropping dhenry or hurns for crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,crowder or tavon austin ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,do i finally let go of ap to get crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,i want to pick up crowder but dont know if i should drop rawls for him
fantasyfootball,removed,drop cobb for him or am i crazy
fantasyfootball,removed,i have lmurraymelvin gordon charles sims doug martin and crowell at rb
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone trade gore or coleman for him im in need of wrs coleman seems a bit of a push
fantasyfootball,removed,or crowder for j brown in my other league
fantasyfootball,removed,ive been convinced that i need to pick up crowder over pryor but right now im hurting at running back with jstew on my bench i played cap last week and i want to replace him with howard this week but back to crowder i dont want to miss my chance with waiver priority should i make my rb swap first or pick up crowder i am not hurting at receiver with jedelman bmarshall and obeckham jr in my lineup i even have tyrell williams on my bench but damn you guys have me so hype and people get hurt obviously thoughts please
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys drop quincy enunwa for him
fantasyfootball,removed,what do yall boys think about crowder vs shepard both open on my waiver wire but torn on who to choose
fantasyfootball,removed,drop sharpe for him km eat a schlong
fantasyfootball,removed,youre getting downvoted but nobody mentioned why it is my understanding based on a some comments in the middle of last week that he shadowed dorsett because ty plays in the slot but i would generally agree that fuller has shown enough to warrant a spot over dorsett imo both a pretty tough to drop here
fantasyfootball,removed,im targeting sss where i can tennessee is a run first team and was pretty tame against oakland last week in the two prior weeks though passing attacks had their way with the raiders secondary could be his breakout week again if he continues to get the looks from flacco targets last week and his stat line has improved every week
fantasyfootball,removed,making me want to drop cobb for crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,rlmnote
fantasyfootball,removed,ok you reeled me innow who do i drop httpimgurcomyekzgyfjpg
fantasyfootball,removed,beasley dropped a td in week and came within a yard of scoring this week hes certainly capable of scoring
fantasyfootball,removed,is dropping tate for jamison in half ppr getting too cute
fantasyfootball,removed,jordan howard or jamison crowder im first on the waiver
fantasyfootball,removed,so should i drop coleman for him in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,its a toss up to me were only games in sharpe and marioto still have some chemistry building to do and if i remember correctly crowder seemed to get most of his targets after jackson got hurt
fantasyfootball,removed,bottom line they are a run first offense also houston pulled points last week jets pulled you dropping those wrs any team can have a bad week
fantasyfootball,removed,crowder or odell he is obviously droppable in all formats
fantasyfootball,removed,desean jackson is available bb what you think
fantasyfootball,removed,at this point easily
fantasyfootball,removed,i did just that
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start him over snead
fantasyfootball,removed,so would it me smart to trade allen hurns to pick up crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,what would you think his tradevalue is now is a cooper j winston giving up too much in a standard league
fantasyfootball,removed,would hurns be worth a drop for him hurns hasnt done much and jville offense is off other wr obj k benjamin and maclin
fantasyfootball,removed,ya really should sharpe cant do anything with the ball once he gets it sure there are more mouths to feed in washington but all they do is pass titans well we all know what they wanna do with the ball
fantasyfootball,removed,that he better throw to jamo chowder all day i spent my waiver claim on him
fantasyfootball,removed,i just dropped john brown to pick up crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,unexpected thanks honestly
fantasyfootball,removed,just did this in a league where im hurting for receivers nothing to lose at this point
fantasyfootball,removed,standard crowder or devante parker other wrs are antonio brown larry fitz marvin jones randall cobb
fantasyfootball,removed,worth dropping allen hurns
fantasyfootball,removed,weeks into the season shape isnt even a top wr benchgarbo
fantasyfootball,removed,sharpe isnt even a top wr in my league which makes him a if it wasnt for the hype you wouldnt play the guy
fantasyfootball,removed,ill pretty sure the irl depth chart is mathews as the and sharpe as the regardless sharpe isnt even a top wr on my league check your league so that makes him a if it wasnt for the hype train you wouldnt be playing the guy
fantasyfootball,removed,i would go beasley its close enough that i would rather have the handcuff only reason im going crowder over dorsett is because i have jordan reed
fantasyfootball,removed,ok so who do i drop to make room for crowder theo riddick quincy enunwa corey coleman tavon austin
fantasyfootball,removed,lol wtf do that shit right now
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr league but i have baldwin and robinson and marvin all on my team
fantasyfootball,removed,well i have robinson baldwin and marvin jones that could fill his spot
fantasyfootball,removed,wr man league between floyd and tate to start will probably go with floyd
fantasyfootball,removed,drop cincy for philly d after this week or maybe stash philly d now
fantasyfootball,removed,cam every week
fantasyfootball,removed,ummm yes why is he there

fantasyfootball,removed,hmmm what to do what to do i want to jump the dixon train maybe someone can help me out just going to dump my thoughts here league standard jennings mckinnion and foster bellforte combo as jennings im keeping until the rb situation in ny shakes out i am not liking the week hes going against min he doesnt seem to involved in the passing game either mckinnion optimistically with his volume the way minnesota plays and how dominate their defense is i imagine flex with upside not too confident in that assessment also im not too familiar with the giants match up foster is my likely candidate both he and dixon represent my lottery ticket rb foster had a tough matchups week and week however his injury history is something i just dont want to deal with anymore positive no one in the dolphins seems to want to step up and take the job from foster on the flip side i can also just sacrifice wr depth and cut pryor who seems to scream boom bust league standard jennings rawls foster mckinnion dwayne washington forte as i figure i can get away with jennings or mckinnion as my depending on matchups washington can be the flex play depending on how his usage pans out foster same as above rawls has the same narrative as foster injury concern but worse longer time on the bench due to injury concern i read about a month or so to recover cmike has seized the position also not planning on cutting any of my wrs i might just gamble and do a wait and see in this league so pryor in league and give it another week to see how the situation changes in miami and seattle
fantasyfootball,removed,i picked up washington and dixon this morning so my rb squad are as follows mccoy forsett langford washington dixon i hope i hit on one of these guys or my wr corp will have to carry me p standard im thinking i should handcuff mccoy
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys take him over darkwa standard i feel like jennings and rainey coming back will drop his value way too much thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop lockett for crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,dropped my kicker and picked him up not i have to drop one of the following t yeldon d washington t sharpe a morris
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard give j charles s ware f gore get d johnson the david johnson owner hit on his first picks but hes striped down the rest of the picks in the most confusing way possible just to paint a picture his rbs d johnson d sproles m lynch d woodhead hes somehow and he scored points last weekend my rbs cja m gordon jcware f gore j mckinnon ivory rawlsir
fantasyfootball,removed,so according to this chart i should take j charles and olsen for mike evans and dwayne washington ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,httpimgurcomxsxlmmd is there anyone i can cut to pick this guy up my current rbs have been stressful as hell
fantasyfootball,removed,sanders over marshall this week
fantasyfootball,removed,is it worth dropping cap for boobie in man standard scoring
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start him over will fuller
fantasyfootball,removed,i love millars floor too much just waiting to see that ceiling
fantasyfootball,removed,read the index thread
fantasyfootball,removed,hes only been with one team for more than two years for a reason to each their own but if he wasnt a headcase he would have been retained by one of his previous teams ive seen it first hand since he was drafted
fantasyfootball,removed,choo choo
fantasyfootball,removed,dropped him last week not sad about it at all
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop dwayne washington or orleans for him

fantasyfootball,removed,jonathan stewart
fantasyfootball,removed,devante parker
fantasyfootball,removed,emmanuel sanders
fantasyfootball,removed,fpros regrettably doesnt update their httpswwwfantasyproscomnflprojectionsqbphpweekdraft that would make my life much easier i have to scrap the data manually yeah that will usually work but it can screw things up when you consider the rbwr flex borderline i hope to make that more robust eventually i dont understand what you describe is exactly what the games column is for i am already using weekly projections for ros
fantasyfootball,removed,i have juilo am i stupid for wanting to trade him for cj anderson
fantasyfootball,removed,matt stafford points for passing td
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,choo choooooooooo
fantasyfootball,removed,i see what you did there
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys rather crabtree or parker in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,those of you starting him this thursday who are you starting him over
fantasyfootball,removed,waynes has always been a bust hes been in the league for year are you retarded
fantasyfootball,removed,i dropped them for minny houston is still a great play this week imo but in the long run you should probably start streaming
fantasyfootball,removed,youre giving up way too much defenses are basically worthless also use the trade thread next time
fantasyfootball,removed,same boat i was able to snag vikes d with my waiver today but i may just stream the texans against titans then act accordingly
fantasyfootball,removed,same thing i do with every defenseplay them when they have a great matchup kick them to waivers when they dont
fantasyfootball,removed,jesus christ do not trade a borderline for a defense
fantasyfootball,removed,the washington racists
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone trade blount for parker in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,wdis thread also no one can see the future to know if someones going to dominate thats a pretty strong word also start your studs
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start parker over tyrell williams ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,my league has the exact same settings as yours i went with a same as last year but with league this deep you can only realistically get two to have a chance to fill the rest of your starting squad with some decent ones last year i this backfired as charles died but until then i was doing pretty well good depth is very hard to come by in a and i firmly believe you should just try to go topheavy and hope for the best seems your values are about the same in my league luck and olsen were almost better each for you though i was surprised to see charles so low this year im curious how many players went over in your league
fantasyfootball,removed,i drafted torrey smith the fine rate my team folks have said this was a poor choice what says you man standard bench spots
fantasyfootball,removed,im trying to get together a ppridp league right now based on another redditors settings he put together so far weve got teams in the league if it ends up coming to fruition and i play idp this year ill definitely check it out
fantasyfootball,removed,all julio falling that far tells me is there are at least crazy people in your league i love ownig julio sure hes often got some hamstring or leg concern but he doesnt really miss games and he gets rest because hes so good he doesnt need to practice as often
fantasyfootball,removed,ware crowell or jeremy hill
fantasyfootball,removed,probably not the best place but would u guys trade my mckinnon in waiver wire for ware and ebron i have charles already and my tight end is bennett thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,ware demarco langford and montcreif who sits
fantasyfootball,removed,ware or cobb as a flex i feel like this week might be the only week ware will have starter value unless charles goes down
fantasyfootball,removed,am i starting ware or melvin gordon sunday
fantasyfootball,removed,rbs david johnson matt forte te and flex jordan reed anbronio gates should i insert ware in one of these spots or just see how week plays out
fantasyfootball,removed,ughhhh i need some certainty soon ware owner offered me the charles owner ware for my gio what are other charles owners paying for ware
fantasyfootball,removed,jc owner here who didnt get ware i also am the lebell owner so he is also up a bench spot should i start cmike this week or pick up vereen powell coleman or starks
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr out of freemanwood headivory stewart and ware grade on rbs overall
fantasyfootball,removed,please help my rb corps is terrible charles gore joneskelley washington with charles out im shittin bricks my wrs are stacked im hoping to trade ty hilton have moncrief as well what startingcaliber rb would be fair value for both sides also forsett got dropped onto waivers should i pick him up i def want dixon but dunno if i can afford to stash him right now other waiver options are james white chris johnson hillman vereen
fantasyfootball,removed,now i am even more pumped about trading mark ingram and eric decker for antonio brown
fantasyfootball,removed,jeremy maclin for latavius murray in a ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop him for tygod week
fantasyfootball,removed,think its worth me targetting the guy who has reliable rb after leveon bell gets back has deangelo to upgrade my qb something like eliarian for brees and deangelo
fantasyfootball,removed,i didnt drop tygod i actually just dropped dalton for tygod
fantasyfootball,removed,i picked up ware and traded him to the jamaal owner for marin jones in a ppr league super happy with that even though a lot of people may have wanted more
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,i was just going to ask about this ive got freeman rawls and murray in a team ppr league line is qbrbrbwrwrteflexdefk which if any do i handcuff
fantasyfootball,removed,i am in a bit of a jam deciding my week i am a charles owner so with the news coming down he wont play i quickly grabbed spencer ware i was dead set on starting ware if charles was out but with the news of foster being the starter in mia my decision wasnt as easy so what do you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,rototrade is your friend
fantasyfootball,removed,im in man three wr league and im super thin at wr my only other options would be sims vereen or treadwell
fantasyfootball,removed,guy in my league asked me to give him forte for charles still trying to figure out if its worth it
fantasyfootball,removed,yard and touchdowns choooo choooo
fantasyfootball,removed,this guys a cheeky cunt stfu
fantasyfootball,removed,ros is shut up
fantasyfootball,removed,well for one dt doesnt have to face the denver defense twice this season
fantasyfootball,removed,weve been done you guys lost the moment you tried defending cobb take that l you know nothing about ff probably your leagues taco if you think were all the same person you have mental problems cobb is trash and so is your fantasy team he never said anything about so i think maybe you should learn what the definition of specific actually means
fantasyfootball,removed,is emanual sanders good trade to send
fantasyfootball,removed,were in this together boys
fantasyfootball,removed,is he worth picking up over bilal powell
fantasyfootball,removed,picked him up really conflicted here tho should i start him over blount the pats have a very unpredictable rb so i kinda dont wana take the risk with blount this week
fantasyfootball,removed,i want to but unsure who to drop i was thinking gio diggs sims or crowder
fantasyfootball,removed,pick wash up but drop sims or bortles my other qb is wilson
fantasyfootball,removed,choi choo motherfucker
fantasyfootball,removed,start sims or washington
fantasyfootball,removed,drop deangelo williams i dont have bell and im pretty deep
fantasyfootball,removed,would u drop dixon for him
fantasyfootball,removed,drop dwayne washington or powell for him
fantasyfootball,removed,do you think he takes over as the lead dog after this game would you drop murray for him
fantasyfootball,removed,i dropped devantae parker for him still trying to decide if i should play washington over riddick🤔
fantasyfootball,removed,dropped coleman for him he is starting with jordan howard for my comeback of the century run
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop crowder so i can hold on latavius but still have deandre just in case wr julio dez arob enunwa crowder rb r mathews lamar latavius doug martin t west
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone drop tevin coleman for him
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr team saw this post and just wanted to take a gander at his sched and shit the owner fucking dropped him he clears waivers in a day or two do i snag him id drop j brown or bortles for him i already have a qb in wilson ros
fantasyfootball,removed,would you drop l murray for him
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop hogan coates dparker or mfloyd for dwash
fantasyfootball,removed,washington or matt jones
fantasyfootball,removed,shouldntve been deep in ya mum
fantasyfootball,removed,benched cooper in the flex for him crabtree cant rush for touchdowns right right
fantasyfootball,removed,i got warecharles and c mike on bye with martin injured should i drop bilal for him
fantasyfootball,removed,if he suits up id play him
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck kinda question is him vs theo
fantasyfootball,removed,would you flex washington over enunwa
fantasyfootball,removed,should i flex washington over matt jones this week people are back and forth if jones will do well this week
fantasyfootball,removed,id consider him a im trying to be realistic with him since i own him luckily i was able to snag powell so im covered its not like he plays on sunday night or mnf he plays at noon on sunday so just keep your eyes peeled on sunday morning to verify hes suiting up we still have today tomorrow and saturday news to sieve through i think if he is you have to start him unless you have a better option
fantasyfootball,removed,theo is playing the eagles not a good matchup forte is the jets go to guy for the running game hes a much safer play ros idk the jets look pretty fucking bad offensively until fitzpatrick figures out how to pass to a player thats wearing a jets uniform i think id temper my expectations
fantasyfootball,removed,but would you start him over matt jones its a ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,start him over ryan mathews
fantasyfootball,removed,i like williams a bit more against oak
fantasyfootball,removed,was offered zeke demaryius and golden tate for my freeman hopkins cooks i think im paying a bit much i had proposed freeman and hopkins for dt and zeke but that was vetoed
fantasyfootball,removed,trade at least one to the jamaal and leveon owners
fantasyfootball,removed,i look forward to some opinions on this one league im own bellcharles and have dropped williams and now considering doing the same with ware in another slightly bigger league im own only charles and am not as quick to drop ware and while i dont own bell williams was just dropped and considering grabbing him instead of my hype train position that seems to change each tuesday
fantasyfootball,removed,it really depends on your depth if you have good depth hold them they are one injury away from being league winners and we still dont even know how large of a role ware will have with charles
fantasyfootball,removed,start washington or coleman this week
fantasyfootball,removed,no way coleman is a high end or flex option at the moment maybe if something happens to freeman
fantasyfootball,removed,drop zach miller for him i have delanie walker
fantasyfootball,removed,ugh i have ryan matthews kenneth dixon and deandre washington i can only start one i didnt need the decision of who to start to be harder
fantasyfootball,removed,would you say its worth dropping latavius to pick up deandre or am i looking too far ahead
fantasyfootball,removed,floyd is a option at best in my opinion who are your other wrs
fantasyfootball,removed,who is better flex larry fitz or e sanders
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start him over marvin jones julio or evens
fantasyfootball,removed,fitzgerald or diggs worried about fitz with the backup and diggs draws houston at home
fantasyfootball,removed,i have david johnson and fitz ive been losing my shit all week should i start fitz over shepard and diggs in your opinion right now i got shep in there and felt pretty confident about it
fantasyfootball,removed,i have to pick between larry fitzgerald and randall cobb
fantasyfootball,removed,fitz or enunwa decker is still out obviously
fantasyfootball,removed,dude even pretending to be that gay is an l for you today be better tomorrow and stop spreading your gay talk around here
fantasyfootball,removed,drop langford weeks ago
fantasyfootball,removed,hold on to rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,team league both dropped and no one has touched either
fantasyfootball,removed,i think wentz will come out on top
fantasyfootball,removed,no bias here but im gonna go with wentz
fantasyfootball,removed,wentz
fantasyfootball,removed,wentz has the much softer match up
fantasyfootball,removed,wentz stafford has had a rough outing his first meeting against a schwartz defense with sacks yards td int
fantasyfootball,removed,drop jalen richard for him
fantasyfootball,removed,im a shady owner should i drop morris for him
fantasyfootball,removed,as a mccoy owner with an open bench spot currently being used on terrance williams hes worth a speculative add right
fantasyfootball,removed,shady owner derrick henry on my bench and dont own demarco safe to drop henry for karlos
fantasyfootball,removed,this this is why im tempted to hold dude can put up points and has because hes a dual threat their run game is iffy and their defense isnt strong enough to keep scores low hes a djax type qb i dont want to rely on him but for lack of better options im holding on mind you i play in a man league
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah id probably quit pretty clear collusion
fantasyfootball,removed,team ppr league im and the team is willing to do a trade to help his team of course it has to go through the veto system so i want to offer a trade that helps both of our teams get better so any help would be appreciated my team qb j winston d prescott rb m ingram melvin gordon g bernard a foster k dixon wr a brown m evans j landry e decker te z ertz k g gano dst denver broncos
fantasyfootball,removed,drop langford for karlos
fantasyfootball,removed,hm im not sure i want to start carr over ben but everyone seems to put carr up as a must start and hardly mention ben who threw tds last week
fantasyfootball,removed,i got ty hilton crabtree and mike wallace still feel like i got to start hopkins over one of them even though i dont expect much
fantasyfootball,removed,marshall ros
fantasyfootball,removed,crabtree
fantasyfootball,removed,to brate or to ertz that is the question
fantasyfootball,removed,thats what im thinking one of these lists him as a meh start which i dont get but otherwise theres nothing about him so i assume its because hes an obvious start
fantasyfootball,removed,whoever gets miller is getting robbed
fantasyfootball,removed,team im thinking about trading carlos hyde for michael crabtree is this an ok deal
fantasyfootball,removed,smallwood bigload
fantasyfootball,removed,give my tyrell williams all day over tavon austin
fantasyfootball,removed,tavon is on an awful team with an awful offense i like tyrell because hes got an established big name qb throwing to him tavon just doesnt have the adequate support system around him to make him a consistent viable pick
fantasyfootball,removed,i hate it when i dont see all of my players on the startsit lists and i have to make my own decisions half point per reception league who should i start in my flex dontrelle inman james white chris hogan deangelo williams or darren sproles
fantasyfootball,removed,thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,stefon diggs groin was held out of thursdays practice diggs has been limited by his groin in practice for the past two weeks but missing backtoback sessions is never a good sign diggs will likely return on friday and earn a limitedquestionable tag but it cant be taken for granted if diggs suits up hell be a lowend against the texans passtough defense source matt vensel on twitter oct pm

fantasyfootball,removed,ctr shill you are busted we found you out through todays leak
fantasyfootball,removed,man let me add thoughts on hogan whodoistart loves this guy this week
fantasyfootball,removed,no he shouldnt have
fantasyfootball,removed,man league so dont judge me but im debating howard over blount
fantasyfootball,removed,for op left team
fantasyfootball,removed,im on the left man standard this is a repeat of last years championship match up which i lost what do you guys think the coloured circles are the starting decisions i am torn against im the most confident in ware over ty mont i think he is safer kaepeli and alshoninman i could go either way
fantasyfootball,removed,i would have no problem sitting him but not for those two players
fantasyfootball,removed,at this point in the season i feel he is droppable depending on your needs and situation panther and kb do not seem to be getting along and it shows on the field disinterested is the best way to describe the situation and i dont want a part of that
fantasyfootball,removed,janoris is banged up thursday game on the road in hostile phillyid go la senior
fantasyfootball,removed,crap start aj or amari cooper
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard kirk cousins chi or phillip rivers cle i see cousins ranked higher everywhere but my gut is telling me to start rivers because of the matchup and cousins has struggled as of late
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard jay ajayi buf or frank gore oak i see ajayi ranked higher everywhere and i know he will get the volume but his performances have been lackluster as of late thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard should i start the bills d against miami or add the titans d to start against the jaguars
fantasyfootball,removed,if julio is playing you play julio
fantasyfootball,removed,team a team b a rodgers d prescott d murray l blount j ajayi d freeman m evans j jones o beckham m thomas t kelce k rudolph d adams l miller a vinatieri m bryant patriots defense vikings defense
fantasyfootball,removed,i played cja today and lmiller i benched jhoward ugh do you think booker would be worth a pick up ive got sims benched and was debating dropping him
fantasyfootball,removed,k
fantasyfootball,removed,he literally had a td taken away from him that would have put him at points in the first quarter dumb as fuck imo you dropped him
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,you know lynch is the quarterback right
fantasyfootball,removed,i made this exact thread way before this was posted but it was taken down thank you mods d
fantasyfootball,removed,so youre legitimately making the argument that the packers defense is complete shit and you have no reservations about starting any nonstud player against them youre a fucking moron
fantasyfootball,removed,as a forte and powell owner i just wish forte would either get injured or get good
fantasyfootball,removed,bro you need to not be so drop happy
fantasyfootball,removed,keep him hes probably the best handcuff behind morris and williams
fantasyfootball,removed,his potential to go off has to be better than every guy on the waiver right now
fantasyfootball,removed,you need to add people to your league or even more man league is way more fun than an
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr possibly fozzy std jacrispy no questions asked
fantasyfootball,removed,jaquizz
fantasyfootball,removed,what do you guys thinkk about buffalo defense for ros
fantasyfootball,removed,except when he nosedived last season as his team got more injured ending with a terrible week performance that lost many people championships
fantasyfootball,removed,i drafted him as my starter and i played dalton this past week would it be smart to try and trade for a new qb one owner has both rivers and brees and i was thinking about going after rivers
fantasyfootball,removed,classic rff thread people downvoting things they dont want to hear two years in a row brady has had bad games at new york his bad game tanked a lot of people thats the truth
fantasyfootball,removed,your assumption is that someone will check here before checking their team and on top of that see this post and not realize the obvious before seeing the ir thread
fantasyfootball,removed,well im not butthurt because i didnt play him but please continue to make bad assumptions and call immature names where did i ever blame brady my entire point was his circumstances missing ol wr rbs which you listed backing up my own point meant that he wasnt the best play and i agree it wasnt the best play but people like you make blanket statements like above brady should be an exception to all wdis qb questions i would never have recommended starting brady last year in week thank you for proving my point that you cant make a blanket statement like you made above those are two conflicting statements
fantasyfootball,removed,i dropped him for brate my tes are fleener and witten or should i go with hauschka
fantasyfootball,removed,im thinking of offering tevin coleman kenneth dixonstefon diggs not sure if thatll be enough
fantasyfootball,removed,umm where did i call you a butthurt fan you literally are putting words in my mouth that i did not say i wont continue arguing with people who straight up lie or cant read
fantasyfootball,removed,humphries or corey brown hold on i just puked in my mouth a little
fantasyfootball,removed,what do you expect from ware at this point id do that in a heartbeat
fantasyfootball,removed,all the black players will be traded
fantasyfootball,removed,this is beautiful still not sure about starting him two and a flex from him obj nelson m jones and maclin
fantasyfootball,removed,from a flex would u guys roll with ty or jstew
fantasyfootball,removed,id invite you guys but id lose my only advantage rff
fantasyfootball,removed,did he give tomlin the finger
fantasyfootball,removed,just traded fitzgerald for him straight up drafted fitz in the round ill take it
fantasyfootball,removed,jordan cameron
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys start lacy or maclin in the flex
fantasyfootball,removed,i wish i drafted him but didnt because of the photo
fantasyfootball,removed,this is just insane talk they have wifi in that asylum
fantasyfootball,removed,someone hold me do i drop dion lewis and grab john brown off waivers need input
fantasyfootball,removed,remind me
fantasyfootball,removed,tres cinquanta
fantasyfootball,removed,😂😂😂😂😂
fantasyfootball,removed,none of those guys are droppable for patterson stills goodwin or heywardbey try and try edelman to the pats fan hell take him as for the other good luck
fantasyfootball,removed,worth the pickup thinking of dropping henry
fantasyfootball,removed,i would just drop the la defense since theres not much to lose there
fantasyfootball,removed,hmmm dixon langford or perkins for a ros stash
fantasyfootball,removed,i would start tyrell and cole
fantasyfootball,removed,trade him
fantasyfootball,removed,so i have the opportunity to possibly get luck but id have to give up obj in a trade my roster curently looks like this carr miller rogers jeffery evans eifert white j minnesota d insert k here beckham west adams and thomas m saints anyway hes offering luck and one of the following sanders e dez or crabtree should i pull the trigger and give him obj and carr for luck and another wr should i use this strategy or try and obtain luck
fantasyfootball,removed,lafell and maclin
fantasyfootball,removed,there is a thread for this but you absolutely start graham over djax and sss in any situation
fantasyfootball,removed,i decided to cut the chord a few years ago when i moved to a new city and found myself literally watching my fantasy stats update in real time as i did other things it was a very sad time thankfully ive since found a friend with red zone and discovered rnflstreams
fantasyfootball,removed,please let it be
fantasyfootball,removed,i have the opportunity to trade him for tyrod taylor too so that is another reason i am interested
fantasyfootball,removed,lafell
fantasyfootball,removed,no better trade all yo a browns here
fantasyfootball,removed,at this point though the only droppable guys on my bench are dion lewis deangelo williams jack doyle diggsthink doyle is the only one i could justify dropping
fantasyfootball,removed,its been years since i last played in an idp league but i would drop doyle too as long as you have another te to start with moncrief coming back i feel like hes gonna lose a lot of targets to him
fantasyfootball,removed,jordan matthews
fantasyfootball,removed,gio bengals play wsh i think not sd game in london too
fantasyfootball,removed,trade bennett
fantasyfootball,removed,thomas rawls henry is only usable with an injury to murray rawls could be usable regardless of michael

fantasyfootball,removed,i think you want the adddrop thread but the answer depends on your league size and roster in a man league bennett might not have much trade value in which case i would drop him for rawls can you stash rawls in your ir and keep both

fantasyfootball,removed,its happening
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trade crab and jamaal for dez i have ware

fantasyfootball,removed,my goal is to get him and doug martin with my round pick
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,this sounds very similiar to my keeper league do yall allow off season trades for picks in my keeper league we have to keep players from previous year and thats essentially the first three rounds so our round is our first round of real picks ive done very well in my league long term by having guys on my team at the end of the year that look to be rounders for next year i typically will shop all of my keepers around eventually trade the that i can get the best draft trades for then keep the other three example last year i had ap and traded him to one of the teams that had a weak line up to begin with traded him ap to swap picks in round and giving me early picks in all the first four rounds just something to consider shrug
fantasyfootball,removed,starting osweielr over wilson high floor high ceiling play imo

fantasyfootball,removed,i have not learned anything new i read all about football prediction tips still here httpwwwwikibetcobettingtipsfootball i earned a few coins with this information
fantasyfootball,removed,it is not enough fresh information i know all that yet here httpwwwwikibetcobettingtipsfootball football prediction tips are open books for me it is very clear for me
fantasyfootball,removed,i would ask this at the wdis thread but to answer your question go with tate since riddick will most likely be out
fantasyfootball,removed,luck
fantasyfootball,removed,you edit it in settings just like you do for regular decimal scoring
fantasyfootball,removed,in custom leagues yeah you can my commissioner did it at the beginning of the season
fantasyfootball,removed,sanu or gabriel
fantasyfootball,removed,jeremy hill or robert kelley
fantasyfootball,removed,so davante adams or sammy watkins to take his place im leaning adams
fantasyfootball,removed,fml now im between brandon marshall vs miami julian edelman denver jeremy macklin vs tennessee why must this happen while im in first
fantasyfootball,removed,aww fuck so should i roll sanu or shepard i feel like eli is garbage lately
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start gabriel over watkins or davante adams this week
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start gabriel over doug martin miller dez bryant ty hilton or spencer ware now
fantasyfootball,removed,sooo tyreek hill jordan matthews sammy watkins or taylor gabriel
fantasyfootball,removed,im in an auction keeper league at the last moment before our trade deadline i bought lesean mccoy and amari cooper from teams who were out of the playoff race it cost me of my draft budget for next season thats a lot i was in place and wanted to win it all a few days later aj green and jordan reed both got hurt now moncrief as well just in time for the playoffs i hate everything
fantasyfootball,removed,fuck
fantasyfootball,removed,you guys thinking i should start rishard matthews or taylor gabriel
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start him over frank gore skeptical of aps workload
fantasyfootball,removed,now this is interesting with aj doubtful was looking for a flex start mitchell bmarsh garcon or roll out ad
fantasyfootball,removed,this guy gets it
fantasyfootball,removed,am i shadow banned
fantasyfootball,removed,im panicking after graham got me points should i drop ladarius green or inman for miami d against nyj or ride it out with steelers d against cin projected to win by currently i have a playoff so im holding on to pit for the week browns matchup and i have sd for week
fantasyfootball,removed,now i aint saying she a gold diggerwellactually yes i am
fantasyfootball,removed,poor girl now she got aids
fantasyfootball,removed,when you have enough money to pay for one hundred thousand strippers to have sex with you i find it very unbelievable that youd rape one instead
fantasyfootball,removed,and to compare their stats from last year is just wrong aj missed games
fantasyfootball,removed,would this be considered stealing
fantasyfootball,removed,to be fair in a completely unrelated incident lael collins did fail to pay throatzilla for services rendered
fantasyfootball,removed,remember its a courtesy to leave reddit if youre just going to be a troll
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop lockett for washington lockett doesnt really provide much when i have tyrell and enunwa and washington could be big
fantasyfootball,removed,would you go with burton over hunter henry
fantasyfootball,removed,i cant trade my blake bortles and latavius murray for drew brees and josh gordon do i take it
fantasyfootball,removed,sims will do much better amd its not even close
fantasyfootball,removed,drake is the starter
fantasyfootball,removed,standard witten vs bears or pitta
fantasyfootball,removed,clevelands offense looks pretty terrible so the dolphins are a good start despite not having that many stand out players cowboys dst could be a good choice but they are really in the same tier as the dolphins i think cousins looked pretty bad only one week but the redskins are really more competent and equipped than the browns you may consider the giants or the ravens jags are a decent offense but will have turnovers
fantasyfootball,removed,dwayne washington
fantasyfootball,removed,tyrell williams or sharpe in full ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,im sitting aj green against den in place of diggs carolina
fantasyfootball,removed,fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck torn between ware and sims looks like i wont be sleeping well tonight
fantasyfootball,removed,bruh i have ware gurley elliot and gordon what the fuck do i do
fantasyfootball,removed,when theyre done with ya sistas ass
fantasyfootball,removed,debating between tevin coleman vs no or ware vs nyj leaning toward ware now but the matchup scares me
fantasyfootball,removed,guess you missed the part where i laughed at the fact yahoo gave me a good grade whats the deal with being an asshole i know yahoo draft grades are based on getting people at better places than their adp it was a joke dickhead i was drafting how i always draft my friend asked me to join this league the day before the draft because someone bailed i should have looked at the rules more closely yes you should go stick your attitude up your better than thou ass
fantasyfootball,removed,the game of football has a incredibly high risk of injury its impossible to draft well without taking players who have been injured in the past and will be injured in the future who should have i taken instead of keenan allen alshon brandon marshall they were the other best available around there who should i have taken instead of woodhead in that round remember where he finished in ppr last year no one left was even close to his upside youre a dick and the only purpose of your post is to try and bring me down this post was about why the cap sucks not about your opinion on my draft i draft to win not to avoid players hitting the ir and all the arguments on this post have helped me convince my commish to change to a dollar charge per move after thirty so ill still take my upside of my ton of injury prone players they are all injury prone moron woodhead and allen have torn acls thats not from being injury prone thats from moving your knees in a way they arent supposed to move which is unfortunately something that can happen to anyone playing football not just the injury prone ones very few players are as lucky as boomer esiason
fantasyfootball,removed,sanu
fantasyfootball,removed,is lacy and t benjamin in flex good over ware need line help wdis thread question
fantasyfootball,removed,go fly a kite bro i did a favor for a friend who had someone back out the day before the season began he told me it was return yardage ppr i said yes drafted two hours later never imagined there would be a rule that undermined the spirit of fantasy football
fantasyfootball,removed,ive been waiting for darkwa time all season
fantasyfootball,removed,if thats what you call a discussion id hate to be your friends
fantasyfootball,removed,you are literally retarded
fantasyfootball,removed,patriots defense shuts down the lobster and scores pointsoh wait
fantasyfootball,removed,ware or cmike for a league
fantasyfootball,removed,i have him starting now in ppr but considering replacing him with gore or crabtree
fantasyfootball,removed,drake vereen or mckinnion
fantasyfootball,removed,i disagree i think i sold riddick at the right time because he has had one good run this year otherwise hes the same runner he has always been no vision poor between the tackles etc
fantasyfootball,removed,i have him starting and i have decker on my bench im stuck between a rock and a hard place on this one
fantasyfootball,removed,ware or marshall
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start him over diggs have landry in the flex and ab as
fantasyfootball,removed,cut one of the wrs
fantasyfootball,removed,ware or mccoy
fantasyfootball,removed,wrong thread and yes
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start e sanders over him whyd c coleman have to get hurt damn
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start marshall over t y or mike wallace ive currently got both in over marshall
fantasyfootball,removed,ok but do i play lockett or marshall the decision gets more difficult
fantasyfootball,removed,ughh id rather have him not play going to start wallaceparker in ppr also have enunwa dorsett and cruz thoughts on those over bmarsh
fantasyfootball,removed,if i have enunwa and bmarsh is the consensus that its worth starting enunwa over him
fantasyfootball,removed,marshall or golden tate or maybe frank gore in a ppr league thanks all
fantasyfootball,removed,i did not have a good feeling putting in golden tate over bmarsh
fantasyfootball,removed,shit who do i drop for a replacement have gore baldwin bell brady and mckinnon on the bench do i drop walker and try to scoop him back up next week
fantasyfootball,removed,im really torn with plugging him in already got odb and dez at wr diggs at flex
fantasyfootball,removed,the guy is sitting in my waivers and watkins is sitting in my bench with a big ol donut im thinking of pulling the plug and picking up parker
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start cruz over him ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,ap owner here looking at rolling with latavius blount going forward i have decent wr depth is it a good idea to swing t benjamin latavius for gurley
fantasyfootball,removed,dorsett or marvin jones over him
fantasyfootball,removed,i have bmarsh enunwa and t coleman for my flex so confused who to go with
fantasyfootball,removed,i am seriously struggling with the decision of parker vs floyd
fantasyfootball,removed,i have marvin jones k benjamin demaryius thomas tyrell williams and devonta parker i can only start of them help me out
fantasyfootball,removed,the anxietyits too much bmarsh enunwa or frank gore in flex spot fuuuuddgggeeeee
fantasyfootball,removed,marshall or tyrell williams
fantasyfootball,removed,its a great match up but i cant decide if i want to plug jordan matthews as my flex or parker
fantasyfootball,removed,devante parker or brandon marshall i also have jarvis landry sitting in my position
fantasyfootball,removed,start vereen with no competition in the backfield or a snap count brandon marshall
fantasyfootball,removed,sims all the way
fantasyfootball,removed,debating parker or sharpe vs oak in my ppr lineup still parker
fantasyfootball,removed,grabbed parker this week off the ww and planning on starting him over dt someone tell me im not making a mistake dts got a real bad matchup and still not loving his qb situation
fantasyfootball,removed,start a relatively unproven devante parker in my flex spot or a snap count brandon marshall or even vereen with no competition in the backfield
fantasyfootball,removed,i want to plug him in but it would only be for cobb or crowell and i also like both of those matchups and floors
fantasyfootball,removed,i have him on bench over travis benjamin landry and ty tough call
fantasyfootball,removed,i have him or desean for what do you guys think boomorbust desean or snap count marshall
fantasyfootball,removed,so enunwa over sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,so i should fire up my enunwa
fantasyfootball,removed,i have mckinnon in my flex at the moment start parker over him standard scoring
fantasyfootball,removed,i would start him in my flex but im putting cj spiller in there because that article a few weeks ago told me to
fantasyfootball,removed,guess im starting sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,do you think will be fantasy relevant again this is aimed at dynasty leagues since we know he will have no relevance this season
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trust dorsett over ty today
fantasyfootball,removed,but the corners could also slip and blow coverage and let bmarsh gat a td i dont know who to start at flex bmarsh or riddick
fantasyfootball,removed,marshall enunwa or floyd floyd has been awful so far this year but has some upside potential left i suppose enunwa appears to have a good floor concerned about marshall putting up a goose egg or close to it
fantasyfootball,removed,with moncrief and sammy watkins out i need a flex spot between parker crowell mike wallace and lockettparker seems to be the best bet input
fantasyfootball,removed,i have green cooks fitz diggs and parker i can start but have no idea what to do
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got landry is it a good ideal to pick up parker as well
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start enunwa over marshall
fantasyfootball,removed,trying to talk myself into parker over cobb or tyrell but they all have dope secondary matchups so torn
fantasyfootball,removed,im playing ty in a wr slot but idk if i should play coleman sims or langford over marhsall i also have mckinnon and bernard but idk esp with earlier game times
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm up in the air on what i want to do right now my starting wr are landry snead toe so need to make a decision soon sanu bench marshall enuwa i brought sanu off my bench on the chance marshall wasnt going to play now need to decide between marshall and enuwa for snead any suggestions
fantasyfootball,removed,do i start him over dt marvin jones
fantasyfootball,removed,enunwa over gio
fantasyfootball,removed,baldwin or shepard over marshall
fantasyfootball,removed,i got odb cooper and benjamin the vikes d is sick nasty so i was thinking about parker over kelvin considering i also have olsen any thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,brandon marshall or ivory in flex ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,the news keeps making it hard for those who own marshall and enunwa what are your thoughts this is going to be a tough choice
fantasyfootball,removed,man league wr and cooper diggs parker who would you use any insight i could also flex tevin coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,tyrell or mike evans
fantasyfootball,removed,basically it comes down to this marvin jones or b marsh
fantasyfootball,removed,full ppr pick devante ryan mathews matt jones crowell smith sr
fantasyfootball,removed,damn so much love for parker is making it hard to bench him this week im projected to win though so i think id rather have the safe floor a crabtree provides
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start him over alshon i had him penciled in as my all week but then traded melvin gordon for evans and alshon and now im not sure what to do
fantasyfootball,removed,i feel like an idiot as i have marshall decker and enunwa on my team i want bmarsh to have a huge game so i can trade him for some reason decker always falls under peoples radar even though hes the model of consistency
fantasyfootball,removed,unfortunately two of my receivers already played poorly fuller and hopkins you wouldnt bench jordy for parker would you
fantasyfootball,removed,it came down to parker jeffrey and cooksi dont think i can start him over the others
fantasyfootball,removed,you think parker is worth owning over sharpe or dorsett in ppr considering picking him up and playing him over marshall with his snap count issues
fantasyfootball,removed,i have marshall and emmanuel sanders who is second string think itd be worth starting marshall even on the snap count over sanders
fantasyfootball,removed,pick allen robinson mike wallace marvin jones devante parker tyrell williams
fantasyfootball,removed,michael floyd or devante parker
fantasyfootball,removed,ugh why is ff so hard i have decided on parker in my flex but now its made my choice for and that much harder i have to choose between maclin dt enunwa and sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,worth starting in flex over freeman normally i wouldnt question but the words snap count got me like
fantasyfootball,removed,marshall or crowell in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,play him or dt also have tyrell williams against a banged up colts d
fantasyfootball,removed,its hard to choose him since ive already got mediocre receivers to begin with decker travis benjamin and mike wallace who plays well since flacco can only throw deep balls would parker really perform well enough to replace one of these really average receivers
fantasyfootball,removed,im starting parker over diggs this weekim sitting on pins and needles over here
fantasyfootball,removed,have barnidge drop for rudolph
fantasyfootball,removed,this brandon marshall drama has been too much do i start him over ty hilton at the game i also have fitz and diggs in a ppr league marshall has a lot of upside but hilton has been getting a lot of targets and hopefully wont be shadowed nina shutdown corner marshall shouldnt either i feel like indy and sd have a better chance of it being a shootout rather than kcjets especially since weather could be a factor in kc
fantasyfootball,removed,ugh need some help marshall or dthomas den vs cin
fantasyfootball,removed,sitting him with ab maclin and cruz i think ill survive
fantasyfootball,removed,i really want to start him but i cant start him over odb jordy nelson and decker
fantasyfootball,removed,my tough call this week is between parker and dorsett in ppr right now im leaning dorsett with moncrief out verrett on hilton and a potential shootout the skys the limit for dorsett
fantasyfootball,removed,enunwa or markus wheaton
fantasyfootball,removed,hey op who would you start in parker crabtree or tyrell
fantasyfootball,removed,marshall or sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,theres too many question marks around marshalls injury snap count usage weather concerns etc im starting lord tyrell fuck it
fantasyfootball,removed,enunwa or cobb in ppr format
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr devante parker or mike wallace
fantasyfootball,removed,parker over evans i feel like la is gonna lock evans out like they did ole dougie
fantasyfootball,removed,id play him if i didnt have ab evans and diggs ahead of him i just think that the dolphins get up and try to run
fantasyfootball,removed,i just picked up parker but im so stacked at wr i wont be starting him ive got hopkins evans and benjamin parker is just an insurance policy against sanders with the byes coming up
fantasyfootball,removed,you didnt give advice you just said a players name based on incorrect stats that you didnt even bother to look up dont be lazy if you want to help people help people
fantasyfootball,removed,help me out here folks do i go with parker at or do i go with alshon jeffrey despite cutler being out
fantasyfootball,removed,yea but do i start him over decker team ppr wr rb flex
fantasyfootball,removed,alshon jeffery with a backup qb hoyer and a hamstring injury or parker
fantasyfootball,removed,would it be crazy to start parker over travis benjamin or alshon
fantasyfootball,removed,with verrett likely covering ty would still chose him over parker been flip flopping all day over this
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm so do yall think i should start ware over golden in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,point ppr team would you start parker over maclin baldwin diggs or dt
fantasyfootball,removed,cant decide on parker or doug baldwin this week
fantasyfootball,removed,i have odell alshon and decker parker on my bench i dont know if i can take out alshon just because hes questionable last time he was questionable with a backup qb he lit up
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys consider starting sharpe vs oakland over marshall id hate for this to play out like the gronk fiasco on thursday night
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got obj ty hilton and jordan matthews with moncreif out ty should have a big day so i think it really comes down to whether i should start parker over matthews or not thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,you should have been aborted
fantasyfootball,removed,b marsh crabtree or parker ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start him over jarvis landry
fantasyfootball,removed,would you start him over jordy nelson alshon jeffery or ty though
fantasyfootball,removed,do you trade jeffreylmurray for deckeringram
fantasyfootball,removed,should i be bench mike evans dez bryant or travis benjamin for parker
fantasyfootball,removed,this certainly is convincing my wrs have been terrible and i have been roaming the waiver parker is available should i start him over cruz or cobb ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,pick two man devante parker tyrell williams michael floyd
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got enunwa as my flex and parker on my bench j matthews and aj green as my wr slots standard league flex parker or enunwa
fantasyfootball,removed,ugh antonio brown is a no shit start now i have to make a decision on b marsh a questionable willie snead in the flex and jmac and mike wallace on the bench
fantasyfootball,removed,pick for standard bmarsh ty cobb baldwin parker
fantasyfootball,removed,cobb or parker having a hard time deciding
fantasyfootball,removed,would you guys play parker over a questionable willie snead
fantasyfootball,removed,should i play enunwa over cobb in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,going back and forth between ol big dick marsh and latavius latavius is in a time share but marsh is on snap count latavius prob wont find the end zone and faces the most stout run d in the league but marsh will probably only have targets in the end zone the raiders will keep airing it out but the field in kc is nasty kill me
fantasyfootball,removed,id love to put him in my lineup but already have julio cooper and decker as my wrs not gambling over any of them
fantasyfootball,removed,relax and start enunwa think of the stress youre going to put yourself through watch the browns and hoping pryor sees qb snaps
fantasyfootball,removed,start him over mike wallace
fantasyfootball,removed,come on guys help me out herebig dick marshall or ty hilton
fantasyfootball,removed,playing cwoke over marsh today god what am i doing
fantasyfootball,removed,i have dez cooks and larry fitzgerald starting baldwin and parker are on my bench thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,i cant decide in a ppr league between starting of these three parker ware and charles sims i get a different answer every time
fantasyfootball,removed,anyone flexing him
fantasyfootball,removed,is he starting ivory tj yeldon or steve smith at flex ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop rashad jennings for him what about e sanders
fantasyfootball,removed,so i have aj green and kelvin benjamin at mike evans at flex was going to keep devante on the bench this week should i reevaluate
fantasyfootball,removed,i cant decide if i should leave in aj green or put in parker only because that denver defense is beastly
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr vereen or marshall
fantasyfootball,removed,tajae sharp or devante parker hype overload please someone give me advice
fantasyfootball,removed,brandon marshall or devante parker
fantasyfootball,removed,so do i play ivory or cmike or do i drop ryan mathews
fantasyfootball,removed,i have odb and fitz starting with freeman at flex parker and alshon on the bench should i change anything
fantasyfootball,removed,where you would put parker in this set up obj kelvin decker and nelson i need to start
fantasyfootball,removed,start him over d washington on detroit standard league
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got quincy brandon marshall and desean jackson for one wr spot
fantasyfootball,removed,parker or marshall
fantasyfootball,removed,im torn between b marshall devante parker and tajae sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,do i fire up my sims please guys help me with this selection nightmare
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start devante parker or taje sharpe over b marsh to be safe
fantasyfootball,removed,im taking that risk of starting parker over snead since snead is a game time decision i also have michael floyd but not sure to start floyd or parker gut says parker
fantasyfootball,removed,i need to choose of sharpe parker samders hilton and diggs really dont know what to do
fantasyfootball,removed,hes oddly on the wire but id have to drop riddick mathews dwayne washington matt jones or chris johnson i have divide johnson too
fantasyfootball,removed,parker or sharpe standard scoring
fantasyfootball,removed,should i start langford over yeldon now
fantasyfootball,removed,start him over drake or forsett ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,parker over sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,no
fantasyfootball,removed,ivory or ajayi
fantasyfootball,removed,ty hilton djax or langford currently have ty in but having last minute anxiety
fantasyfootball,removed,im happy to hear this still starting vereen though but would love to see ivory perform
fantasyfootball,removed,ty or djax team standard djax needs a breakout for the skins to be viable basically so i think he will have a fire under him to produce and get fed but monctief is out and ty looks like he might own the slot with verrett tied up in the wings
fantasyfootball,removed,start him over sheppard julio and cooper are my other wrs
fantasyfootball,removed,i picked up cole beasly he is playing tonight and has score his last two games cant decide if i want to start big d marsh ughhhhh
fantasyfootball,removed,wdis thread in the future keeps hilton in
fantasyfootball,removed,ivory or hyde
fantasyfootball,removed,jones crowell or ivorystart two
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got to choose two of ty hilton parker and tevin coleman right now parker is the odd man out
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got to pick two ivorygoremjones it seems more of a pick your poison type decision im liking ivory and jones simply because i feel they will have the most carries i think im waiting on ivory i dont see him getting a full load
fantasyfootball,removed,better choice than snead
fantasyfootball,removed,weather a factor i have decker but i heard thunderstorms are in the forecast would you go with tyrell williams or sharpe
fantasyfootball,removed,what do you think him or ty hilton
fantasyfootball,removed,i need to decide between one of yeldon parker sanu and cruz sanu and parker have the sexiest matchups ugh
fantasyfootball,removed,i need to choose in a standard cooper benjamin robinson and parker i should also mention i have tannehill starting with parker being the odd man out
fantasyfootball,removed,ivory drake or brandon marshall in flex
fantasyfootball,removed,ivory or mckinnon fuck
fantasyfootball,removed,im between starting charles sims and parker in my flex ppr i think parker has a higher ceiling but i wonder if the dolphins ruin away with it and try and get the run game going
fantasyfootball,removed,lastchance shameless wdis standard scoring do i play marvin jones or stefon diggs
fantasyfootball,removed,im torn between starting him marvin jones maclin or alshon jeffrey this week two of those four
fantasyfootball,removed,tyrod taylor or brian hoyer as my qb cantdecide
fantasyfootball,removed,his mom
fantasyfootball,removed,tevin coleman or tyrell williams in flex standard
fantasyfootball,removed,okay guys agonizing over jordy and parker thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,ivory over sanu and cruz for my flex
fantasyfootball,removed,saw this too late not sure i would have pulled jeffery for parker anyway since those are my best options
fantasyfootball,removed,probably not great
fantasyfootball,removed,sims or ware espn standard
fantasyfootball,removed,they can have their choo choo trains im on the marvin jones concorde
fantasyfootball,removed,djax limping off looks like an ankle injury
fantasyfootball,removed,i cant decide between him or vincent jackson
fantasyfootball,removed,hes back if he was out tho tbh the next best receiver to have on the skins is probably crowder for his yac and punt returning
fantasyfootball,removed,guys ppr ryan mathews brandon marshall phillip dorsett im still super conflicted
fantasyfootball,removed,it was a nice yard pass the db was there but semien put it right over the shoulder dt caught it at the and the db couldnt tackle him so he walked in with the td
fantasyfootball,removed,vikings d int
fantasyfootball,removed,choo choo
fantasyfootball,removed,cousins is averaging more yards per game than palmer and they are currently equal in points scored this year
fantasyfootball,removed,was decker in the boat with fernandez
fantasyfootball,removed,i got hill on bench with ware in line up charles owner wana trade for jeremy hill i got gurley doug martin as my other backs i am really considering taking that offer but in my opinion hill may have more upside than charles
fantasyfootball,removed,somebody has to die
fantasyfootball,removed,ppr dez or cooks

fantasyfootball,removed,clearly not a big ben owner
fantasyfootball,removed,i think i can flip ab for david johnson should i pull the trigger
fantasyfootball,removed,should i pick up mariota off of waivers
fantasyfootball,removed,target the guy needing knee surgery
fantasyfootball,removed,maybe olivia finally told him for certain that attack of the show isnt coming back😢
fantasyfootball,removed,ahhhhh another week recommending to sit ryan and another week where he plays well
fantasyfootball,removed,how long is he going to be limited by his injuries he needs to start running more soon
fantasyfootball,removed,youre dumb and you should feel bad
fantasyfootball,removed,bitches be crazy
fantasyfootball,removed,all trolling and loling at your comment aside did you really think bottles production was sustainablewas going to continue the ol playing from behind garbage time production seems like a smart investment pal your pick was useless of course bottles was the wrong decision you drafted him in your league wow
fantasyfootball,removed,looks like charles is still a scrub eh again sorry you drafted him its almost like they formed a rbbc because charles is injury prone haha
fantasyfootball,removed,im and have weak rbs dropped ajayi week
fantasyfootball,removed,you fucked up colossally brother you traded a work horse who gets touches a game for trevor siemiens number wr in terms of talent hahahahhahahahahahhabahahaahah your season is probably over scrub
fantasyfootball,removed,need a combined standard points from david johnson and fitzgerald if dj gets points and fitz points im solid
fantasyfootball,removed,youre a fuck boy ros
fantasyfootball,removed,i started both charles and smith yesterday cant believe it wasnt even a passing td to that fat fuck
fantasyfootball,removed,the person i described did not even bring a piece of paper so no research at all and then he used his round pick on a player that he thought was on the bears but is actually on the jets moron might be harsh but they signed up for an activity then decided not to put any effort in whatsoever
fantasyfootball,removed,lulz
fantasyfootball,removed,good god i hate matthew berry for telling me to play coates if he was available i just wanna punch him so hard
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard qb wilson carrtraded away last week rb gurley blount yeldontraded away last week booker dion lewis deandre washington wr jeffrey landry coates lockett enunwa te olsen acquired last week j thomas dst vikings jaguars k crosby
fantasyfootball,removed,as a cousins and kaep owner chop choo
fantasyfootball,removed,kap is a good idea
fantasyfootball,removed,youre gonna get hated on but ill be nice and answer start kaepernick for sure id start him next week if i had him
fantasyfootball,removed,definitely start keap
fantasyfootball,removed,thats a good choice kap has a solid rushing floor bears are actually a pretty ok secondary i do think kap will still manage a couple passing tds should give you points on the lower end with plenty upside cousins might not be such a bad play too the way hes been playing doesnt look like a stretch
fantasyfootball,removed,even without keuchly the panthers front are still amazing you still have to go through kawaan short kony ealy thomas davis etc as for the other two ware may not have a stellar matchup but hes rhe undisputed back on a good team that can stay on the field rawls has to compete with wilson and ware only has to compete with alex smith millers qb is nearly nonexistent if that helps justify sitting rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,agreed kcs d is tough so hes tough to trust this week he might be worth a look over r kelly im also trying to figure out if i want to play him over either m wallace or c ivory depending on his injury
fantasyfootball,removed,yep im deciding between ajayi dion or crowell as this week had ajayi in but rethinking it with this post
fantasyfootball,removed,im sitting gurley vs the pats d playing james starks instead but ive also already clinched a playoff spot in my league that said i think i would play gurley over lewis i dont think lewis is getting many touches certainly not a likely td candidate full disclosure i have blount on my fantasy team and will definitely be playing him
fantasyfootball,removed,i think the correct play is gurley he caught passes last game which is about what lewis has caught so far and past two weeks gameflow probably hurts both rbs and makes it a lapass happy game and ne blount game
fantasyfootball,removed,man ppr pick mike evans sd fitz was diggs dal watkins oak moncrief nyj den

fantasyfootball,removed,dak
fantasyfootball,removed,fitz
fantasyfootball,removed,not now that you made my comment not make sense
fantasyfootball,removed,ive considered the revenge game factor for him this week but still wont start him over cooks or moncrief maybe over kelley in flex though
fantasyfootball,removed,id play him over robden im struggling to choose him over deandregb what will give the leagues worst qb or the leagues worst defense
fantasyfootball,removed,im playing hill over wallace this week matchup is better and figures to be a high scoring game both hill and wallace have to fight maclinsss for targets but i trust hills playmaking ability
fantasyfootball,removed,wdis and no i wouldnt play him this week
fantasyfootball,removed,ehh julio got doubled a lot thats the whole point the cardinals deny their opponents best receivers and make them run or throw short passes if reed is out there he will have guys draped all over him my argument is that a good offense can very well beat the cardinals but this thread is about jordan reed not some generalized offense yes cousins relies on reed a lot hes a matchup nightmare for most defenses unfortunately hes going up against the best defense at stopping tight ends this week this is literally what everyone is trying to tell you guys and you keep responding with generalities about the cardinals defense being overrated and their opponents offense being subpar thread is about reed vs cardinals ability to cover tight ends matt ryan didnt force the ball into the middle because the defense didnt give him that look so the falcons took the look they were given and ran with it much pun intended
fantasyfootball,removed,its perfectly fair but in my opinion its lame and if i was team a i would try to win every game i could
fantasyfootball,removed,team a can do what team a wants to improve his chances of taking the ship
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah but ppr is more popular nowadays and any standard list should be considered ppr imo
fantasyfootball,removed,start ingram and diggs the vikings will rape you when you least expect it especially for qbwr
fantasyfootball,removed,loser has to inject himself with aids contaminated blood
fantasyfootball,removed,i cant believe the amount of overthinkers on this sub it is dez bryant a top wr going up against a top tier cb vikings have given up points to top wrs this year jordy nelson receptions yards td deandre hopkins receptions yards td alshon jeffery receptions yards td golden tate receptions yards td larry fitzgerald receptions yards td golden tate receptions yards boldin had yards and a td this defense hasnt really shut down a lot of wrs they are still getting their production and if we learned anything from last weekend dez likes playing against top level cbs and proving how good he is he went out last week and was determined to beat up on norman and he did he will do the same thing to rhodes or whoever the vikings put on him
fantasyfootball,removed,honestly i wouldnt start rawls in just about any matchup that ol is terrible if you have any other choice take it
fantasyfootball,removed,i appreciate his time he puts into this and everyone loves it but it seems to me its all pretty bland information he doesnt really make any decisions he just throws around the obvious and then says some people are borderline etc i feel bad for criticizing but how are people using this to start their lineups for instance devonta freeman and tevin coleman should have a tougher time against a fairly good kansas city run defense however this rushing duo is extremely potent im giving them the benefit of the doubt and happily starting freeman as a high end and coleman as a high end basically says they shouldnt do well but theyll do well enough as and why not just make an actual stance

fantasyfootball,removed,if dion lewis is available pick him up that way if he comes back you have him and if he doesnt white will be a solid third option for the rest of the season
fantasyfootball,removed,hes still in scoring in points per game in ppr it depends on your team but i would hold him
fantasyfootball,removed,yes thats fine you should probably try to trade that depth but how deep is your bench that you can keep rbs i would guess you have some areas of weakness to shore up at wr

fantasyfootball,removed,weeks is still probably optimistic no set backs or anything then you have at least one week you wont start him because you dont know the situation now its week thats a long time to hold a guy that might never bring value he is only owned in of leagues and he was drafted in most sure he should be owned once he is back but holding him for weeks on the prayer he adds value is foolish too so then the question is when you add him to beat everyone else and not kill yourself i do suspect this may be the week
fantasyfootball,removed,no rape scene please
fantasyfootball,removed,in a good position to use rb depth to improve my wr corps team ppr he gives ryan mathews and my preference of amari cooper stefon diggs terrelle pryor corey coleman tyrell williams john brown i give my choice of either spencer ware or carlos hyde i think the obvious choice for me to take at wr is cooper but ive listed them all out in case someone thinks pryor has more upside or whatnot in essence the trade is amari cooper and ryan mathews for either hyde or ware he owns charles if youre questioning why i would feel comfortable making this trade my other rbs are lamar miller and doug martin my best wrs are aj green and jarvis landry so im looking to get a bit more depth there who to give up spencer ware or carlos hyde

fantasyfootball,removed,found something interesting brady is averaging fantasy ppg over carr this season denver is allowing points under average for opposing fantasy qbs meanwhile sd is within point in terms of average points allowed to qbs main point the matchup probably doesnt outweigh the season long production as much as we might think id go brady who actually scored fp denver last season

fantasyfootball,removed,you know what sucks more than that losing to a cheater some guy had ab a pretty stacked team and needed an upgrade he traded away christine michael a week before rawls was coming back and tyrell williams for obj to his friend who had no chance of playoffs i tried disputing it with the league commissioner but ultimately it was not vetoed he went on to win every single game after that and beat me this week in playoffs i just feel stupid all this time spent checking the sub for injuries waiver pickups and latest news only to lose to a cheater man pot down the drain hope everyones luck is better than mine and you guys take that chip
fantasyfootball,removed,oh weird i wrote this two hours ago fuck derrick henry jesus christ ty montgomery puts up on me and i have this fucker vulturing my murray points edit to add im also starting tevin coleman so mark freeman down for points tyrod demarco tevin coleman somehow the only rushing td i have is tyreek hill

fantasyfootball,removed,not to insert my personal team here but as i was reading your comment i got offered doug martin for thomas standard league have to take that right
fantasyfootball,removed,i am debating on trading aj green for tyrell williams because of their playoff schedules i know it sounds crazy but green plays cle pit hou i will probably get a bye so for me its only pit and hou which are both good defenses williams on the other hand plays oak cle kc i already have j jones and d baldwin so taking a risk isnt a big deal but i just dont feel confident starting green during fantasy playoffs i understand i should never trade green but ive been thinking about it for weeks now so to answer your question i think williams will be especially if benjamin is still out with injuries even when he comes back their schedule throughout the rest of the year is beautiful for the sd offense adams i havent been paying attention to i think williams will be top depending on when benjamin comes back
fantasyfootball,removed,lol i love being right
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,ill take mine for
fantasyfootball,removed,gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,send him this
fantasyfootball,removed,green miller and hopkins would be your best keepers definitely not murray i think a lot of people are undervaluing shady so you could conceivably pick him up in the fourth anyway
fantasyfootball,removed,aj hopkins and miller seems the easy choice regardless of format
fantasyfootball,removed,touch of the downs i use some picture of a kid with downs throwing a football
fantasyfootball,removed,ahhh im picking and in a ppr league and im debating between which two i should take of allen marshall and evans thanks for making this so hard evans

fantasyfootball,removed,kickerslivesmatter
fantasyfootball,removed,mine is cosbys coffee because the day after playing me you wake up in a daze with a headache not knowing what happened
fantasyfootball,removed,especially since its ppr i think it would be a waste to not select abjulioobj
fantasyfootball,removed,if you love ap get ap with the youre not going to get him in the second round i think he and gurley both lose some value in ppr formats but they are still top tier
fantasyfootball,removed,is there any examples of guys who played his position that came back after missing a year and went right back to dominant play i cant think of any examples off the top of my head but normally isnt what happens when a guy gets hurt and misses significant time followed by missing a lot of reps in camp is that he starts off slow and doesnt get into a groove for a while
fantasyfootball,removed,if youre committed to rb in the first round no pick is too early for adrian peterson that being said julio and antonio brown are just too valuable with any form of ppr to pass up i would suggest losing the mustdraftrb mindset and just picking the best player
fantasyfootball,removed,in my draft last week ap went over all i had ap last year from a trade i was one happy camper

fantasyfootball,removed,should i start amari or brandon marshall in my te spot my kicker is on bye is why im asking
fantasyfootball,removed,i posted this last evening and got a few responses but were still having a discussion in our league and id like to hear more takes on it tldr is available at the bottom days ago i was offered a trade of i give evans moncrief and kelley i receive bell wallace and martin i accepted and shortly after doing so the guy who offered the trade posted on the message board that he accidentally put doug martin on there and had no intention of doing so i responded saying this was fine to veto so long as we can work something else out the commissioner agreed and told us to come up with something else and that hed make sure it got pushed through before tonights game there is a precedence of pushing trades through during the same week and its been done on every trade before the games start for the players involved obviously so wednesday he sends over i give evans and moncrief i receive bell and landry i accepted around pm knowing that the commissioner said he would push it through before last nights game fast forward to yesterday afternoon and the commish still hadnt processed the tradeboth of us send him messages and he never responds the guy im trading with and myself are both basically resigned to the fact that it will get processed the next week and since the game is going to start i have evans inserted in my lineup since it looks like the commish wont be able to get around to processing well halfway through the first quarter once evans has already put up points he magically disappears from my scoreboard espn and is inserted into the other guys lineup the commish processed the trade in the middle of the game after evans had already been put into my lineup and scored nearly double digit points i complained and the guy who is playing against evans now is pissed since he magically showed up in his opponents lineup in the first half and now has points surely the commish should have just admitted he screwed up and told us that it would just process next week since the games already started right tldr commish said he would process a trade involving evans before last nights game but failed to do so and instead processed the trade in the middle of the game after evans had already gone off this has rubbed some players the wrong way additional point the player i was trading with who received evans echoed sentiments that it didnt seem right to adjust rosters midgame even if it had been agreed upon to push the trade through before thursdays game the player i am playing against said he thinks it should stand but also noted that hes ok with whatever is decided what do you guys think of this
fantasyfootball,removed,yeah easy to call other douche youre the dumbass who didnt bother handcuffing
fantasyfootball,removed,shit now i have to go with him got ingram and jstewart going who do i bench
fantasyfootball,removed,exactly what i came here to post ty will more than likely draw the top coverage from the titans cant remember his name but hes really solid freeing up plenty of room for moncrief to continue to produce
fantasyfootball,removed,no seriously dont even think about this
fantasyfootball,removed,ill try to start doing that more often by the way who do you like better as a flex this week g bernard or l murray
fantasyfootball,removed,who are we playing ty over do i need to temper my expectations or trust him as a safe level play personally i am thinking about him as over sanders team standard but would be curious how other people are playing him

fantasyfootball,removed,terelle pryor vs bal or allen robinson vs hou non ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,youve got the rb depth but rawls is the better lotto ticket imo he never delivered on the early promise but the hawks are about to imo move on from cmike prosise is the immediate beneficiary but he is horrid in passblocking and if russell gets creamed rawls is back in there for the majority of touches in a couple of weeks romo conversely will not get behind center unless the cowboys deteriorate or injuries pop up i like zambo lambo btw
fantasyfootball,removed,i would cut duke jr sure
fantasyfootball,removed,kelleys value remains to be seen he has the easier path to touches but the redskins schedule ros sucks i wouldnt cut starks or hightower agree with the maclin drop above
fantasyfootball,removed,i cut gillislee under similar circumstances i feel mccoy has wrestled his injuries this season already
fantasyfootball,removed,i would cut both actually and grab a second lotto ticket
fantasyfootball,removed,i would hold all of those
fantasyfootball,removed,i thankfully cut bait on maclin in most leagues im stuck with him in one and will be making a similar move where i couldnt unload via trade done with this trash
fantasyfootball,removed,id hold bibbs to see what shakes out in denver
fantasyfootball,removed,id be tempted to cut mckinnon for prosise i believe rawls takes the lead job back soon but if prosise surprises this weekend he has more upside than the mn backs imo
fantasyfootball,removed,drop west
fantasyfootball,removed,think it was just incorrectly creditted httpfantasynflcomresearchstatcorrections
fantasyfootball,removed,was there extra cash involved too
fantasyfootball,removed,i agree id snag prosise
fantasyfootball,removed,are there any wonky rules or pressing need that you need to activate dion this week while he may very well be active vs hawks i dont think youre starting him yet
fantasyfootball,removed,i feel youre safe dropping either or both at this point for this week its barberprosiseperkins for me for ros exactly the reverse
fantasyfootball,removed,im stuck with booker on one team and am wrenching my hands with the denver backfield ill likely cut him for rawls who is hidden in free agency as we get closer to weekend so booker stays on waivers that said i like bibbs chances to earn a respectable piece of that action and would likely opt to play him over cmike for the reasons you cite
fantasyfootball,removed,agree wabove
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont love either but brock makes this a nobrainer
fantasyfootball,removed,i flat cut blake on a team i named bortles of beer and then he had that beautiful garbage time game someone scooped him up and he repeated it i think id play him over cutler but hes been a disappointment for me all season
fantasyfootball,removed,both of them have been fantastic and youre giving someone a free qb from waivers id try to package in a trade if possible you have nothing else on your bench to consider
fantasyfootball,removed,holy shit
fantasyfootball,removed,gotcha id cut bait on west sooner than the qbs
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,who do you like more between flacco and wentz this week mind you falcons are against qbs this year rn
fantasyfootball,removed,im forced to flex kelce eifert in at te this week due to byes so no maclin is great news
fantasyfootball,removed,i have to go with robinson against no i know that garbage time hasnt really had an impact this year but i view the no game as a major blowout where borttles will have a lot of throwing to do against a really poor defense wallace on the other hand could be kept to a low impact if the ravens get ahead early which i think is probable
fantasyfootball,removed,wallace
fantasyfootball,removed,jj and thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,all of those are a toss up to me i guess id go michael thomas for sure and then jb or jj for the second spot
fantasyfootball,removed,i would go ajayi and gurley for sure charizard may be droppable now
fantasyfootball,removed,dt slightly
fantasyfootball,removed,definitely thomas and jj
fantasyfootball,removed,pryor
fantasyfootball,removed,pryor
fantasyfootball,removed,adams def
fantasyfootball,removed,my brownbell combo is pretty sweet
fantasyfootball,removed,landry hopkins and nelson are definite gos i would put in bryant in the flex
fantasyfootball,removed,who looks to be the better start west or sproles
fantasyfootball,removed,coleman
fantasyfootball,removed,marshall
fantasyfootball,removed,howard and forte
fantasyfootball,removed,cant decide between sss or ty monty as my
fantasyfootball,removed,would stick with howard and ajayi
fantasyfootball,removed,soooo im currently cmike and kelley with dion lewis and doug martin on the bench would you guys roll the dice with the returning injureds as a team i am actually projected to win with the first two chucklefucks in the lineup
fantasyfootball,removed,i agree with the posters above marshall smith
fantasyfootball,removed,thoughts on kendricks i dont know much about him but i am looking to replace snead at my flex i was going to grab pitta but kendricks is also available
fantasyfootball,removed,booker
fantasyfootball,removed,thoughts on kendricks vs pitta this week i am looking to replace snead in my flex position
fantasyfootball,removed,i would start thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,marshalls your pick
fantasyfootball,removed,my league is extremely competitive lol i have d murray evans green tom brady jimmy graham my key pick ups this year have been meredith howard and jacquizz im just good at fantasy bitch
fantasyfootball,removed,i have gronk and currently have snead sitting in my flex but thinking of replacing with pitta or kendricks any thoughts standard scoring
fantasyfootball,removed,thoughts on gronk pittakendricks trying to replace snead at flex
fantasyfootball,removed,i have gronk but was looking to replace snead on my flex was going to roll with pitta or kendricks any thoughts
fantasyfootball,removed,sproles is available as a free agent in my league is it worth dropping tevin coleman or crowell for him also have gordon stewart and ware who are the i was planning on running with
fantasyfootball,removed,booker is mentioned a lot anyone else not feelin it this week im thinking about starting k benjamin and t pryor over booker this week in ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,wow huge boost for crowder this makes my diggs or crowder decision quite tough
fantasyfootball,removed,did you cry you bitch
fantasyfootball,removed,fight me pussy
fantasyfootball,removed,actually the reddit fairies complaining about multiple posts are the dumbasses youre a fucking nerd and probably sit in a cube all day
fantasyfootball,removed,you think it would be at all sustainable to start both hightower and ingram like last week
fantasyfootball,removed,gotta choose two of demaryius thomas allen robinson and tyrell williams i know sitting would be the in thing to do but he had a decent game with a score last week help me rfantasyfootball youre my only hope
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone mind weighing in on stefon diggs vs davante adams vs kenny britt just need to pick in standard
fantasyfootball,removed,penis
fantasyfootball,removed,ive had a lot of trouble with people paying buyins and staying interested past week if they had a shit team i started using a company that did all the dues collection for me for free and allowed betting week to week it was awesome and changed my fantasy experience here is the link if that interests you sideprize httpssideprizecominvitematthewb
fantasyfootball,removed,apparently he had the worst production in the history of the nfl with the volume he received i forget what advanced analytics sport site mentioned it
fantasyfootball,removed,where are these weak stat lines hes had games with averages of and so one mediocre game against a very strong jets d
fantasyfootball,removed,got m bennett for almost nothing when i needed a fillin for kelces bye i was just hoping for points from him and i worried i might not even get that
fantasyfootball,removed,dude you are the one who tried to use stats to prove your point then when i called out the actual stats you just tried to move the goal posts again dont blame me for poking holes in your logic and we should always listen to coaches they always tell the truth of the time
fantasyfootball,removed,has he been dropped yet i need to know hahaha
fantasyfootball,removed,youre thats the proper spelling btw correct on your inability to read sarcasm
fantasyfootball,removed,your petty at being at being moron the irony
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,youre right i shouldnt expect smart things from you so its not irony it was just hypocritical because you cant spell use proper grammar or read obvious sarcasm yet call people morons
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,so i have t coleman m gordon and j hill normally start coleman and gordon but stupidly questioned colemans potential workload in denver luckily it didnt matter at all even with hills pt i destroyed my opponent by points im thinking of dropping hill for richard or rainey if theyre available when my waiver spot comes up bad move hes only really had big game in denver other than that he hasnt cracked ppr im pretty much done wasting a bench spot on him as i have corey coleman stashed for when he comes back burning a bench spot already im pretty ok when it comes to wrs nuk tyrell williams enunwa and coleman when he comes back and im afraid of the potential drop off melvin could suffer hes showing his fumble problems again which we all know can turn in to a huge issue if not taken care of also both my starters have normally tough matchups next week with coleman in seattle and gordon against denver although coleman just put up on denver
fantasyfootball,removed,you have good wr depth but could package forte coleman and a wr for a bonafide if the owner is losing bad and needs to switch up his team i think most people here are of the mind that charles is going to be fine
fantasyfootball,removed,dude pick him up you can easily trade him away for a good wide receiver especially with his cupcake schedule or if you can find someone who will give you good value for charles i would trade him for a wr
fantasyfootball,removed,pick him up as he gives you flexibility to trade one of your established rbs for a wr id wait for stewart to have a few good games and id advise you to trade him after that as he is injury prone
fantasyfootball,removed,the chargers te situation is one id probably avoid the only thing worse than a rbbc is a tebc youll constantly be guessing which one will have a good game and if youre like me youll always guess wrong
fantasyfootball,removed,id rather have gates personally
fantasyfootball,removed,marvin jones or allen robinson ros
fantasyfootball,removed,would you trade marvin for cmike straight up my rbs are mckinnon freeman and jennings
fantasyfootball,removed,care to tell me whos running better routes told your dumbass evanskeenan regardless of injury evans is the elite talent
fantasyfootball,removed,in a team ppr todd gurley randall cobb tyrell williams
fantasyfootball,removed,i just need to post this somewhere i just got a trade proposal from the kid i crushed last week in which he offers me edleman and fuller for david johnson in my league no one trades because the few people that try to initiate one do so assuming the other player is mentally retarded
fantasyfootball,removed,you guys take yourselves too seriously
fantasyfootball,removed,jordan howard brandon marshall trying to do for
fantasyfootball,removed,legarrette blount what good wr could i try tading for i have rb depth but really weak wr
fantasyfootball,removed,jarvis cja ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,guy in my league dropped him last night should i pick him up have duke johnson coleman foster hill mckinnon dixon would would you drop im thinking hill
fantasyfootball,removed,bro that was after week when all you cucks thought he was a top wr rest of season
fantasyfootball,removed,somewhat relevant who do you think the more valuable wr in fantasy is from here on out in oakland crabtree or cooper
fantasyfootball,removed,just judging by the pure value of the two players id say yes need to know your roster at wr and rb before id tell you to pull the trigger though
fantasyfootball,removed,seriously if people ask for personal help just let them be downvoted no sense in locking this and ruining it for the rest of us
fantasyfootball,removed,drop him yesterday
fantasyfootball,removed,golden tate is michael floyds spirit animal
fantasyfootball,removed,goodbye my sweet prince the waivers are were you belong
fantasyfootball,removed,dropped him for coates
fantasyfootball,removed,drop him
fantasyfootball,removed,jamaal charles
fantasyfootball,removed,arian foster
fantasyfootball,removed,having a tough time deciding who to pick up between jstew latavius murray and gio bernard any insight to who would be the more valuable back
fantasyfootball,removed,is there really a reason to lock a thread with this much traffic even if used incorrectly its not like the spam on new
fantasyfootball,removed,matt ryan
fantasyfootball,removed,trade thread and i think he gets shut down on those weeks
fantasyfootball,removed,god youre an idiot
fantasyfootball,removed,arian foster
fantasyfootball,removed,matt jones and terell pryor trying to see if i could trade them both for a high end if possible
fantasyfootball,removed,jimmy graham
fantasyfootball,removed,how is alex smith on your waiver in a league
fantasyfootball,removed,i think he will have intensifies
fantasyfootball,removed,latavius
fantasyfootball,removed,bennett is not going to catch tds again this season he isnt a fluke but that kind of production cannot be sustained i like coates going forward and i think hes a much more solid and reliable flex play than bennett
fantasyfootball,removed,id start both going forward grab coates if you need wide out help
fantasyfootball,removed,why do you have to lock it though an ruin it for everyone there are almost people here the chances someone is dumb doesnt follow this rule are extremely high i mean you may as well lock it now thenor could just let the voting system work its magic its not like those comments are being upvoted to the top and cluttering the whole page its like saying nobody is allowed to run a stop sign and if people do then we ban driving all together
fantasyfootball,removed,cameron artispayne
fantasyfootball,removed,hopkins
fantasyfootball,removed,julius thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,jimmy graham
fantasyfootball,removed,leveon bell for for
fantasyfootball,removed,what i hate about both is that both are getting their tds stolen asiata and newton but i like that panthers run game was averaging yards a carry last night maybe because they were playing tampa compared to mckinnon who got ypc
fantasyfootball,removed,spencer ware full ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,just traded amari cooper and willie snead for david johnson and alshon whats yalls take on that
fantasyfootball,removed,bellcow maybe the old ingram here is my team qb qb brady palmer wr aj jmatthews pryor snead evans tyrrell williams sammie coates moncrief rb lamar miller jordan howard deandre washington te jordan reed team ppr points td and bonus for passing yards we start wr and have a flex ingram has the worst schedule of any running back and i firmly believe that he will not dominate this year tom brady will win me more weeks than ingram will with palmer going down i had to make a move and im glad i did anyone on the waiver wire would have lost me the week brady won it for me
fantasyfootball,removed,john brown
fantasyfootball,removed,dont start fitz
fantasyfootball,removed,my jstew for amari cooper ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,im currently sitting at fourth and strongly considering using my priority on coates my wr depth is pretty good but im debating whether i can take the chance on him becoming a terrific asset to another team im not saying this is going to be the pickup of the season but i dont want to sit on the priority all season waiting for the pickup of the season while other teams make significant moves
fantasyfootball,removed,if youre a cmike owner you should definitely own rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,i picked him up while i still could do it without using waiver priority if i cant afford to wait long enough no worries
fantasyfootball,removed,depends what kinda goodies are in your stash
fantasyfootball,removed,sure if you have the space to put dead weight for a couple of weeks and you think people are going to snatch him up soon otherwise id be looking at potential handcuffs like booker morris etc
fantasyfootball,removed,if you have the ability to pick up our friend rawls then you have the ability to do anything you set your mind to trust in your players and you will find greatness when the season ends believe in yourself i will always love you
fantasyfootball,removed,im curious about how much rivers cooks and ryan mathews is worth considering shipping them
fantasyfootball,removed,julian edelman
fantasyfootball,removed,deangelo williams if youre the bell owner wanting the handcuff
fantasyfootball,removed,yup
fantasyfootball,removed,a dude is offering alshon and jstew for my cmike and dparker should i take it
fantasyfootball,removed,michael floyd
fantasyfootball,removed,julian edelman
fantasyfootball,removed,option between bradford and smith who do you take
fantasyfootball,removed,would anyone trade gurley for him
fantasyfootball,removed,dez for him
fantasyfootball,removed,mike evans for jamal charles i would be getting evans i already have doug martin and i have dion lewis on ir my other receivers are arob and doug baldwin
fantasyfootball,removed,mike evans for jamal charles i would be getting evans i already have doug martin and i have dion lewis on ir my other receivers are arob and doug baldwin
fantasyfootball,removed,mike evans for jamal charles i would be getting evans i already have doug martin and i have dion lewis on ir my other receivers are arob and doug baldwin

fantasyfootball,removed,julian edelman
fantasyfootball,removed,looking to get some help for your fantasy football team check this out
fantasyfootball,removed,traded him and mathews for obj and edelman have zeke hyde foster and martin so fealt i could deal
fantasyfootball,removed,d hopkins
fantasyfootball,removed,i have cj and theres a lot of talk about denver going to a committee i was just offered my cj for his miller good trade for me
fantasyfootball,removed,debating who to start palmer or wentz
fantasyfootball,removed,marvin jones
fantasyfootball,removed,tyler eifert
fantasyfootball,removed,believe in blount
fantasyfootball,removed,i have sss and floyd i feel like hogan could be more consistent than those guys but each of them could easily blow up
fantasyfootball,removed,im in a team but with wr slots
fantasyfootball,removed,soooooo gordon for miller
fantasyfootball,removed,i traded him for odell straight up i have evans hilton and diggs my rbs are lacy lmurray and yeldon and foster good trade
fantasyfootball,removed,starks is owned in my league my waiver wire is literally picked bare and i have mckinnon and martin on a bye to go along with lacy possibly sitting im probably gonna have to pick up and play chris thompson or john kuhn and hope for some receiving yards or a td its gonna fuckin suck
fantasyfootball,removed,i like dt and cj on the broncos in the and round
fantasyfootball,removed,stop being behind the times and do an auction draft
fantasyfootball,removed,i have to assume you are the guy that thinks his shit dont stink do you go on reddit and just criticize anyone and everyone is that how you get off if so i would suggest finding a women or at least start off by using rgonewild it might make getting off a little more enjoyable for you although women may not be your type im sure there is a male equivalent to gonewild try that out
fantasyfootball,removed,im not sure where in my comments you got elite from
fantasyfootball,removed,taking jordy nelson in the first off an acl tear is a fucking dumb idea but if you want to do that thats your prerogative im sorry i cant keep fighting against your asperger syndrome and ninja edits if you cant look at the thread title and my original post and put it together you cant be helped enjoy your fantasy season be sure grab your special buddy jamaal charles
fantasyfootball,removed,travis kelce value man ppr i have eifert
fantasyfootball,removed,i got charlesware on bye need someone to start with zeke my options are matt jones fozzy gio bilal what do you guys recommend
fantasyfootball,removed,remind me week
fantasyfootball,removed,over pay both ways for jordy or maclin
fantasyfootball,removed,i am concerned about basically everything obj im really hoping for a decent game this week so i can pass him off to someone else
fantasyfootball,removed,hunter henry or marty b ros
fantasyfootball,removed,homie drives like hes playing football and proudly posts meymeys of it are the consequences of his actions
fantasyfootball,removed,got decimated by injuries and traded away deandre hopkins and doug martin for crowell sanders and maclin
fantasyfootball,removed,offered fitzgerald and pryor for dt and obj i figure with obj on a slow slow start thanks eli and fitzgerald being down a qb that loves him it would be a good swap ps i have david johnson as well and i dont like how after palmer left that john brown got the most targets even though fitz had a higher catch
fantasyfootball,removed,i need an do i pick up darkwa or dixon
fantasyfootball,removed,yes
fantasyfootball,removed,im stuck on who to drop for ertz still available in my man qb cam and matt ryan rb l murray d johnson gio bernard dixon hyde wr d thomas pryor decker hogan enunwa te rudolph
fantasyfootball,removed,are you retarded
fantasyfootball,removed,charles is coming back huge week imo i think once hes back ware will be obsolete obviously you should only drop him if hes the worst on your bench though hes a good stash for those who dont believe charles will play out the season
fantasyfootball,removed,do not
fantasyfootball,removed,for those telling the guy to go to the adddrop thread youre more or less wrong this is applicable to enough people that its worth the discussion in the open as opposed to singular for this one guy ie a significant percentage of us own charlesware additionally this goes to the conversation of the value of the handcuff as for the question im holding on dropping ware we dont know how jamaal will perform or how ware will be included that being said i own duke johnson as well
fantasyfootball,removed,would yall accept edelman for ivory and tyrell williams then would it be worth flipping edelman for mckinnon
fantasyfootball,removed,because of the comments on this post im wondering if i should pick up hogan and ertz but who should i drop qb car rb mccoy riddick j charles morris powell dixon wr cooks crowder woods diggs landry jones te rudolph
fantasyfootball,removed,a couple weeks ago i would have said coin flip now i am leaning freeman hell also have an uncontested workload this week albeit against a stout denver d
fantasyfootball,removed,i would probably avoid the trade all together but if i had to choose freeman
fantasyfootball,removed,philly d is available now wondering if i should grab them and drop the texans
fantasyfootball,removed,if you need an rb this week and this is your only choice go with freeman coleman has sickle cell and would have trouble playing in high altitudes den he would either not play or be incredibly limited
fantasyfootball,removed,your wrs are pretty good why not try to trade for a more reliable rb id probably try to trade away fullerfitz for howardmckinnon if not id go with freeman freeman has looked like the better back and his composure is that of a major competitor he has that why the fuck is this a rbbc look on his face after any big play haha
fantasyfootball,removed,im wondering whether to pick up jonathan stewart off the waivers hes been there since his injury and has cleared twice seems like a bargain but i have no idea who to drop ertz is the logical drop for me since i have reed but that seems like ill be giving away a top tier te
fantasyfootball,removed,i like my mans freezing coled
fantasyfootball,removed,freeman has been shredding you simply cant choose coleman over him
fantasyfootball,removed,dropped tajae sharpe for zach ertz have kelce on a bye now im wondering if i should drop hurns or a morris for moncrief im lacking at wr i know hell be lucks main target when he returns
fantasyfootball,removed,should i pick up bilal powell or dontrelle inman swapped for someone on my roster those are the two best pickups left on the board
fantasyfootball,removed,trade edelman for dt
fantasyfootball,removed,bahaharyanmatt ryanis a free agent in your league bahaha
fantasyfootball,removed,in an man league yes
fantasyfootball,removed,pretty much everyone is droppable in
fantasyfootball,removed,lol league
fantasyfootball,removed,there is really no trustable consistency in te beyond olson and reed this year you will also give gronk the benefit of the doubt when he finally starts running routes beyond that the tes are all boom or bust
fantasyfootball,removed,id take enunwa if i were you im in a position where my only options on the wire are chris hogan or victor cruz and im giving tyrell one last chance against a poor oakland defense before i cut ties
fantasyfootball,removed,im sure he will have the occasional big week but dont expect any consistency from him making him a likely bench warmer week after week as you lack the confidence to ever flex him drop
fantasyfootball,removed,im plugging him in this week one more time since arob is on bye if he doesnt put up decent enough numbers i will drop him
fantasyfootball,removed,no idea what to do with him sammy coates is available as a free agent and its really tempting to pick him up should i do it
fantasyfootball,removed,tied for most red zone targets with ty hilton allen robinson brandon marshall all have behind only jordy nelson and emmanuel sanders tied for most red zone completions behind just ty hilton and jordy nelson keeping him one more week and trying to convince others of his value
fantasyfootball,removed,you own eifert and pitta and you are still holding gates yea clear that spot and roll with those other two
fantasyfootball,removed,unless its a league where you get points for being a fuck face on the internet you overpaid
fantasyfootball,removed,umhe had a hamstring issue with an average week recuperation time you should have dropped gates the minute he was injured and not carried tes through multiple weeks as far as how far along he is in healing we will just have to see the practice reports
fantasyfootball,removed,dont you come in here with a sorry ass receiver like crabtree
fantasyfootball,removed,in a man standard league ive been offered eddie lacy devante parker michael crabtree for travis kelsey isaiah crowell matt ryan i have cam im lostthink that i should hold crow
fantasyfootball,removed,trying to get either ezekiel elliot mccoy bell or david johnson have hopkins fitz crabtree r mathews j hill baldwin freeman cooks charles would any of those combos work
fantasyfootball,removed,derrick henry to a demarco murray owner
fantasyfootball,removed,make antonio gate again
fantasyfootball,removed,you have tes in your line up ouch you seem to have pretty good alternatives with eifert and maybe pitta just drop or trade the man
fantasyfootball,removed,well they get their best player marcell dareus back this week so it should get better
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont know but with the last waiver position i just somehow grabbed them and eifert this week and next week vs the niners are for sure a lock
fantasyfootball,removed,id probably go keenum
fantasyfootball,removed,if other owners are like me crying naked in an drained bathtub while wearing highheels
fantasyfootball,removed,i would go with flacco think he is the best of that bunch
fantasyfootball,removed,im stuck between him and jameis cant decide
fantasyfootball,removed,i gotta think he will put up high low numbers if he is healthy would anyone fire mathews up over hyde thursday or forte
fantasyfootball,removed,mathews or artie payne standard
fantasyfootball,removed,drop sims for matthews
fantasyfootball,removed,hmm well im a mathews owner who picked up smallwood in the event he doesnt play this week ingram is on bye and my rb situation is not great to say the least someone in my league just dropped arian foster should i redrop smallwood for foster or hold on to him just to be safe and drop ware for foster i am not a charles owner my rbs are melvin gordon mark ingram ryan mathews spencer ware and now smallwood
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont think so were not sure what to expect out of mathews at the moment and mckinnon played pretty well last week i dont think you should burn a waiver just yet
fantasyfootball,removed,if you have brady and dont start him you dont deserve to have him stick w ryan in trades
fantasyfootball,removed,proves himself hahahhhahahah
fantasyfootball,removed,start the whole bears offense report back next monday thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,enunwa is more likely to get more receptions he has a higher floow royal is more boom or bust
fantasyfootball,removed,until brady proves himself hes already proven himself as one of the best qbs in history i dont think theres much else to prove
fantasyfootball,removed,i trust him with my unborn kid
fantasyfootball,removed,id leave him in a room alone with my wife
fantasyfootball,removed,i have matt ryan as well and i trust brady against the browns i kind of feel bad for the browns this week ryan hasnt played an elite defense yet so hes on the bench for me this week
fantasyfootball,removed,lmao start brady of the time every time always
fantasyfootball,removed,been hearing about white expected to miss an extended amount of time picked up royal this morning plus he returns punts so there is possibility of a random pts
fantasyfootball,removed,need to pick of rbs to start would you start him over matt jones or mckinnon
fantasyfootball,removed,its tom brady and hes playing the browns this week what more do you need
fantasyfootball,removed,absolutely with how few and far between rbs are you have a starter sitting there available ill take just about any surefire starter rb off the wire
fantasyfootball,removed,team full ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,mckinnon is a good starter this week but if you can hold mathews in your bench i would
fantasyfootball,removed,i fucking hate these threadtopping posts about loads useless tired and not funny anymore ever but this one isnice have a complement but im keeping my upvote for what god intended
fantasyfootball,removed,so do i start him over howard
fantasyfootball,removed,is it worth bumping charles sims car out of my flex now that mathews is healthy man ppr league
fantasyfootball,removed,my jordan howard decker booker for his dez cobb in ppr he has cja
fantasyfootball,removed,should i drop randall cobb for him
fantasyfootball,removed,who could you potentially drop for him
fantasyfootball,removed,well yeah man its kelces bye dont you need a te
fantasyfootball,removed,i think it depends on your team needs are you strong in the rbwr area do you have solid backups if your starters get hurt if youre comfortable where youre at i would go for it the bengals have been awful in the red zone eifert will fix this i promise
fantasyfootball,removed,send ware and maclin for dez dez owner is also charles owner my only hesitation is if charles goes down again or is for some reaosn ineffective i have mccoy jennings rawls lewis dixon and could get smallwood my wr are julio marvin michael thomas
fantasyfootball,removed,drop matthews for c michael
fantasyfootball,removed,ive got blount and hill starting at rb this week for flex do you think i should start matthews orterrance williams assuming dez is not playing no ppr
fantasyfootball,removed,go shoot yourself
fantasyfootball,removed,whos better terrance west or ryan matthews
fantasyfootball,removed,antonio brown is the man this year the only rb close to him value wise is david johnson
fantasyfootball,removed,mathews over mckinnon at flex in ppr i have crowell and shady in my and slots
fantasyfootball,removed,i traded him for diggs im scared now
fantasyfootball,removed,i just dropped him if he turns it around then so be it but hes too inconsistent and lately hes not getting any targets and is mainly just a punt returner kick him to the curb
fantasyfootball,removed,i dropped him last week if i recall his teammates said that he was playing through a torn pcl
fantasyfootball,removed,in a ppr returns league is incredibly difficult to drop him but that torn pcl and jimmy graham coming alive too hard to trust him
fantasyfootball,removed,my zero wr strategy has really paid off this year i grabbed marvin jones crabtree and fuller all late in the draft decker is the only dissapointing one but thats due to an injury so i cant blame him
fantasyfootball,removed,do i feel comfortable starting nuk no but im not not gonna start him
fantasyfootball,removed,no im not comfortable with the matchup at all im benching fuller v
fantasyfootball,removed,foster is available in my league should i drop derrick henry for him i just cant bring myself to drop derrick henry yet team standard scoring qb russell wilsonkirk cousins wr brandon marshallty hiltondesean jacksonmichael floyd rb david johnsondoug martincharles simsderrick henry te jimmy grahamzach ertz k mason crosby def seattlenew england i am going to try to offer new england to someone after this week and just roll with seattle ros
fantasyfootball,removed,i really need this to be true deciding between mckinnon sims coleman and powell this week
fantasyfootball,removed,i just turned down my miller for foster r matthews and demariyus thomas should i regret it
fantasyfootball,removed,id pick him up if i needed a rb i just might still i have cj anderson matt forte jonathan stewart and isaiah crowell
fantasyfootball,removed,im in desperate need for an rb and can trade cobb for arian what do you guys think
fantasyfootball,removed,drop stew for foster
fantasyfootball,removed,should i pick him up in a person league i have derrick henry just sitting on the bench waiting for murray to go down
fantasyfootball,removed,in short i wouldnt do this also you have to post these types of request in the dailies
fantasyfootball,removed,someone is gonna come in here someone is going to make you feel bad all because there is a spot for these type of posts its the trade thread fwiw dont do that though
fantasyfootball,removed,no and use the correct sub
fantasyfootball,removed,use the trade threads you are getting fleeced

fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,i proposed a trade to give my mckinnon and m floyd for doug martin he is and in need of mid tier players im doing well and can afford to stash and wanted to free up a bench space i asked the lm to push the trade through so i could claim off waivers because i didnt want to have to drop a player and instead was for he said i needed a majority of the approval later that night people said they didnt approve of the trade being pushed through because it was unfair the league commish even said he vetoed it as a player not a total commish veto i didnt expect this because this isnt the use of a veto or the reason for the trade waiting period so i had to drop pitta to be able to claim woods since eifert was back now that eifert is possibly injured i need a te filler just in case if im able to grab pitta back up i wont mind sine it would have ended with the same team i intended is it fair to call him out on this if pitta goes elsewhere i know i prematurely dropped him but at the same time they are completely misunderstanding the point of the wait period as well as the veto votes the trade is still going through tomorrow which honestly makes it more annoying since they say they wont approve of it being pushed through but they arent going to veto it to cancel it am i in the wrong here to assume that a trade should just be pushed through if it is determined that they wont veto it and it is obviously not collusion
fantasyfootball,removed,then accept before he changes his mind
fantasyfootball,removed,team standard cobb vs nyg or parker vs ten
fantasyfootball,removed,my devonta freeman and hopkins for zeke randall cobb and rawls
fantasyfootball,removed,was debating dropping a foster or rashad jennings for ertz this week i have olsen at te but could use ertz during the bye or as a flex i have other rbs lacy jhoward mckinnon matt jones ertz was good with the yardage and wentz is tossing tds
fantasyfootball,removed,makes sense and thanks
fantasyfootball,removed,graham
fantasyfootball,removed,i like graham because the offense seems to really be recommitting to him and we know the talent is there i think they probably will end up with a similar floor but the ceiling on graham is much higher
fantasyfootball,removed,kyle rudolph
fantasyfootball,removed,im wondering this too i understand hes injured but you dont drop him also gordon and floyd for olsen really
fantasyfootball,removed,david johnson
fantasyfootball,removed,david johnson
fantasyfootball,removed,david johnson even though gurley would be a great keeper david johnson in the round is even better value plus you could possibly draft gurley again and you will have no chance to draft johnson in the reasons why to keep johnson better qb for the time being better ol better defense maybe rams d has potential arizona did not change coaches and have a better offensive minded head coach rams offense is not very good and will have to throw a lot if they get down early arizona is good enough to score a lot of points quickly to get up on teams which inreturn will give them more opportunity to run the ball also arizona will have a higher chance to run the ball more because their passing game is better than the rams
fantasyfootball,removed,gurley and its not really close for me dj might be the value pick but gurley doesnt have any competition unlike dj
fantasyfootball,removed,thats true but theres so many things that go into each play that its difficult to try to truly benefit the player for their effort what if the yard play was a td catch where the defense completely blew the coverage and there was no contest even got to slow down as he entered the end zone because there was nobody within yards id say thats a much easier play to execute than an yard fade to the corner of the endzone with a cb draped over the wr making a toedrag catch in the corner with insane body control
fantasyfootball,removed,chugga chugga choo chooooo
fantasyfootball,removed,wow
fantasyfootball,removed,sorry this isnt a trade question but i honestly dont know what thread i should post it in does anyone know of a good android app that will let me important my team manually or otherwise and more specifically allow me to view my lineup for future weeks for lanning for players bye weeks looking at matchups to come etc nflcom fantasy doesnt let you do it and its driving me crazy
fantasyfootball,removed,wew lads
fantasyfootball,removed,can you guys believe someone traded ty hilton for matt jones we asked him about it and he said he likes matt jones keeper league ty is a third rounder matt jones was on waivers last week i dont even know anymore

fantasyfootball,removed,the cosby spikes for me
fantasyfootball,removed,aw id totally go for this if there wasnt a woman in my league that i know would rip my head off for this
fantasyfootball,removed,
fantasyfootball,removed,i have been calling my team fourth down syndrome for the past few years i need a good logo to go with it
fantasyfootball,removed,who are your other options
fantasyfootball,removed,depends on your other options and how many keepers everyone else gets
fantasyfootball,removed,unless you have other viable options do it in a keeper league everyones already going to snag the high value players anyway
fantasyfootball,removed,i dont think its worth it too much opportunity cost cam will be a good qb probably finish top but i want to be loading up on rbs and wrs while theres a lot of dependable talent up for grabs you can platoon qbs from the late rounds for of newtons production but youd be very lucky to be able to swap around rbs from round to get of a matt forte
fantasyfootball,removed,im in the same position except im choosing between the upside of jay ajayi for a or the safety of newton for a my other two keepers are devante parker and devonta freeman looking to the future since the league drafts in reverse order of finish from previous season i finished second and snakes only in the first four rounds my gut says newton
fantasyfootball,removed,round
fantasyfootball,removed,overall he will get heavy usage low injury risk sure he misses the first few games but hell be back in time for the payoff push
fantasyfootball,removed,heres my take on why josh gordon needs to be taken by the round
fantasyfootball,removed,gordon
fantasyfootball,removed,too small of a sample with the possibility of outliers for an average to be useful his rushing tds are directly correlated with how many plays the panthers get on the goal line of his tds last year were yards or shorter and all but of those i believe were yards or shorter all it takes a few yards difference on a number of plays and his chances of rushing tds goes way down as was seen on
fantasyfootball,removed,gordon probably in round six tbh
fantasyfootball,removed,how can both of your wrs be gordon tho
fantasyfootball,removed,ya deangelo saved my team early on before bell came back and i traded for zeke im just a little worried on how many snaps hell play
fantasyfootball,removed,im not convinced he plays yes he is good good enough to play a role in a game that matters games that matter are not occurring in pittsburgh this week
fantasyfootball,removed,you think the new regime will risk mccoy id be careful there gill is your man there but i have no clue what those idiots are up to up there good luck
fantasyfootball,removed,lol i get here and read all the comments about how great the post is and keep thinking to myself why would he delete it then did he fuck up some analysis or data point and get embarrassed nope it was automod
fantasyfootball,removed,you okay pal sorry to piss you off so much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we are in a team keeper league where you can keep up to players in the round in which they were originally drafted the year before ex david johnson was a round pick last year so this year i get to keep him as my round pick this year instead of having a round pick my round pick last year was ap who i am not planning on keeping this year another owner offered me his round pick for ap to use as his round keeper thoughts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if youre definitely not keeping ap then absolutely trade him for a thats a very fair offer the guy making the offer is essentially trading his and his for ap since he has to use his to keep him you can either have a round pick or not have a round pick just because youre not keeping a player doesnt mean you should give him away for free this is not giving ap away for free in what world do you think someone is giving up their and for ap the only way your offer could get better is if someone goes to a or offers you a and a later pick this is a very fair offer for a player youre not gonna keep whos also gonna cost another team a
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think it is hard to lose ap at a round pick but if you are set on not keeping him then i would see if you could put feelers out there there may be someone willing to give you a rounder or rounder for ap if not may be worth it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if your not keeping him thats pretty decent return his value is decreased as a first round keeper and gives you zero value of holding on to him beside the opportunity to redraft him if you hold out for a for example the team getting ap will be spending his and on ap if you can get it great but that other owner would be wise not to do so
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with onefortwo he is spending his and on ap its hard to imagine you getting a better offer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hi mom
fantasyfootball,not_removed,welcome to brett favre phase of ben roethlisbergers career
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes just still salty that he was awoken at on saturday night
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it should also be mentioned that the steelers have basically said with ben thinking about retirement this might be a smart move for the steelers browns stock falls without big ben get the most you can while hes still young i guess youll still have bell eli rodgers coates bryant ladarius green and whatever qb maybe landry jones or whatever qb they draftsign still pretty good if ben retires and brown stay in pittsburgh his fantasy value falls a bit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nothing to see here has a
fantasyfootball,not_removed,big ben being big ben he just wants the whole management team to be like oh ben we need you to come back you are the piece that we need to win the afc and go to the superbowl i cant see a world where he doesnt come back he was one game away from the sb with bell green full season and bryant on the field there is no reason to think that they cant get back to the championship game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a big dynasty player with a superflex league this could be very interesting i would love to see what kirk cousins could do in pit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont buy it he loves he game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this would be a bigger story if he is saying this in like may of course he is going to look at all his options but he didnt say how hard he was going to look imo there is maybe a chance he does not return next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if ben retires he will need to cut a check to the steelers for signing bonus hes going nowhere
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please fire my incompetent coach now you may say mike tomlin has had a great run here but this goes back to the old saying of the worst employee is someone who doesnt take you to the next level but isnt bad enough to lose their job that is mike tomlin what a bozo going into gillette with a zone defense that everyone and their mother knew brady could pick apart like a thai whore on an expat its tough having arguably the best rb and wr in the league alongside a top qb and not making it to the sb every year but instead the rooneys have no balls so we must play identity politics and keep the madness going
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kaepernick to the steelers confirmed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pleasego now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,old people dont like it when you wake them up then they have to pee and its hard to get back to sleep
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bring on michael vick and his wolf pack
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe landry jones bwa ha ha ha ha thanks for the laugh if my team had a hot young backup qb and ben is going to retire id be putting a deal together for said qb and ab landry isnt a starter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this isnt going to happen his contract is hella steep even if they got a rounder for him idt its worth it hes still the best receiver in the game they made it to the afc championship game and it wouldve been way more competitive with a healthy bryant and bell big ben is still capable of being an elite quarterback he just had a bad year to his standards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rodgers is shit coates is shit green is not good and bryant is good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and the young defense definitely seemed to be getting things together
fantasyfootball,not_removed,some steelers fans in rnfl suggested tyrod taylor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he loves the attention
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think thats how that works he had million in signing bonuses on his last deal but thats all fully guaranteed money on the year deal he gets million each year so he has million that he has yet to collect i dont think he got all million up front im no expert in nfl contracts though and could be totally wrong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as someone who likes both sf and pittsburgh please no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as long as kaep leaves the niners im happy niners fan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it would help landry get overpaid
fantasyfootball,not_removed,antonio brown no way httpwwwspotraccomnflcontractswidereceiver alshons franchise tag average of the top was this year and brown is under contract for salary bonus next year there are plenty of teams that would like to have arguably the best wr in the game today for that price for one year teams like the titans redskins or eagles who think they are or pieces away would gladly take that for one year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,unlikely but imagine the shitstorm if romo were to be moved there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj regressed to last year he had more than a few frustrating weeks standard such that you didnt even know if you could start him anymore and this was with full health still i expect him to return to form as with a better floor with the departure of sanu targets and jones especially targets theres a lot of volume for someone to grab green wont get it all to be sure but he will certainly get a sizable chunk combine this with the fact that eifert will almost certainly not reach tds again and teams will finally focus more on him in the red zone it opens up more scoring for green even if the offense as a whole becomes less efficient probably safe to say since it was really clicking last year and now lost good weapons the volume between the and the opportunities for tds should return to aj his adp now is behind hopkins dez and robinson but in front of nelson jeffrey cooper evans i think this is a fair valuation maybe slightly undervalued i expect he finishes ahead of dez maybe robinson maybe hopkins in the best case scenario
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why was this thread deleted mods
fantasyfootball,not_removed,isnt this kind of disrespectful to their run game they have arguably the best run duo in the league not to say that the daltongreen connection is anything less than reliable but they have rarely been a pass first team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,perhaps this attitude is more of a problem than a sign of confidence
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lets not pretend sanu and jones are stealing targets anyone replacing those guys will take the same if not more targets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they were passfirst last year eifert on the field more meant less blocking te meant less powerrun formations perhaps with sanu and jones gone this year theyll be forced to bring in that extra te and run a little more with hill but last year was the best their offense has ever looked in recent memory and hill was ineffective gios runs were from spread formations for the most part
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green most definitely does not have an attitude problem far from it all he is saying is that in the absence of jones sanu their offensive coordinator and for right now eifert he and dalton are the veteran leaders of the offense and theyve developed great chemistry over the years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wont green just get even more coverage than before
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if their replacements are of equal talent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did i say they were stealing targets they earned them they are good football players
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i guess get it but i thought it would prompt some good player discussions on andy dalton and aj green especially considering that there isnt much discussion in the middle of the off season thanks though for modding its a lot of work in this community
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah ill have to do that in the future thanks man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also this a few weeks ago but have httpwwwkeepertradecalculatorcom for keeper leagues too basically does the same thing but makes some adjustments based on whos being kept reflected in who is available to pick and uses the aavs of players themselves to compare amongst picks it actually has all the functionality of the calculator posted above but this new version should run a bit faster for nonkeeper leagues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love the this site and have used it to get what i consider a massive trade in my favor the issue i run into for the keeper leagues are this getting a player with a great keeper value ie i get obj who i can keep for a round pick his value should be more then just his normal value it doesnt take into account the draft order ie i can trade my second round pick for obj cause i pick overall so i have great options there weird league set ups so im in a qb league and it doesnt change their value for that which isnt just you its almost all sites with adps maybe a suggestion option i put in the trade its lopsided maybe give me options of things to add in to make it more equal maybe a way to denote your keepers but love the site and have been using it since you posted it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely love the idea behind this and seems like a reasonable approach it will be interesting to see how it works for others and if its evaluations seem fair i kind of do a similar thing when making trade offers in my keeper league but it is amazing how varied peoples evaluations are on the value of picks so its a tough thing to quantify
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is great
fantasyfootball,not_removed,awesome glad its working for you to your points you can do this but you have to sort of hack it say youre trading gronk kept for a and want to trade for gurley kept for a if you trade gronk youre essentially getting and your opponent is giving up a round pick so add it to the other side of the trade youre getting gurley but now youll have to give up a rounder so you would add that to sent on your side so basically youre trading the equivalent of gronk and a and getting gurley and a you can see what else youd need to add actually add it to your sent side though to make it even also make sure you enter in everyone who is being kept because thatll make a difference too it does take into account draft order if you pick overall with a snake youd have the pick in the second round the notation for the site then is with teams thatd be the pick so you could also enter if youre entering in just or thats not your first or second round pick thats and overall hopefully that didnt affect your massive trade ill keep in mind not sure why would be helpful i am working on a way to save keepers so you dont always have to enter them in every time you come back to the site again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive noticed that it places less value on top picks than people are initially comfortable with i think it may very well be similar to the nfl where teams i think we tend to assume best case outcomes on picks that high but in reality its anything but just look at the that said and while i definitely stand by the approach and reasoning you should always try to get the best deal you can where were at now with fantasy apparently overvaluing high picks i think you can usually get a substantial premium for a top pick so thats what id look for personally
fantasyfootball,not_removed,re it is amazing how varied peoples evaluations are on the value of picks i agree which is why i think this is a huge way to add value to your team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks appreciate all your free tools too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have zero faith in him the injuries are really limiting him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im dropping him if he cant score double digit points against the saints he isnt worth owning
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im dropping him ive had way too much fantasy disappointment this season hopkins ingram rawls and langford tough year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,start dalton after their bye
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dropping him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,grabbing romodak and hoping
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not an owner but my friend is i told him to stash him for now and play winston im pretty sure hes just going to drop his ass though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if winston or mariota are available in your league and you havent replaced wilson by now you should seriously be thinking about it if not you should be looking for a trade a few weeks back i shipped away riddick enunwa for derek carr because the carr owner was desperate the same week i picked up mariota there are too many other options at qb to be sitting on a mediocre one halfway through the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just traded him for christine michael
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes hurt its obvious when you watch him play i think hes worth a stash but his pos is that great either tough call but he could win your league if he gets hot like last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,russell wilson is the qb equivalent of jeremy maclin this season both of them consistently fail to hit their projection by a long shot you gotta know when to let go regardless of the name attached to the stat lines and now would be the time to do it im way too proud to give up either of them to watch them inevitably go off so i will stubbornly let them ride my bench
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i posted highlighting the over hype for wilson this week considering how bad hes been and his injuries it didnt get approved until today which is why there isnt any discussion he still has fantasy value but youre going to have to be pretty desperate for a starter or stashing him in hopes of a breakout game his rushing has been down all year and the offensive line is pretty bad this year wilson has some decent matchups in the near future and there is always the chance he turns it on like he did at the end of last season hell be a stash for teams that can afford to keep him on the roster but i cant really see him as a viable starter until he shows us otherwise
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes not worth owning look at his career s if you sub out his rushing production and replace it with league average rushing production hes like every year except last year this year on ptsg avg in standard hes like for real
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i picked up winston this week and started him dropping wilson for sure after todays bomb todays game against new orleans was supposed to be his time to shine and dispel any doubts about his recent performance yet he looked terrible vs a defense that is very porous against the pass he hasnt had a td in weeks or any meaningful rushing yards all season looking ahead hes goes against new england buffalo and phillyto name a few his playoff schedule is also very brutal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im starting jameis winston over him from here on ouy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gonna get carr off of waivers and rivers as well and roll with them rivers cuz that playoff schedule and carr cuz he has that hot hand rn
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dropping him im confident running with rivers ros
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yesterday was make or break for him starting josh mccown next week unless someone better gets dropped im in a team league so there isnt much available
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cry pray to the football gods that romo will play and stay healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i might just let me lineup sit and not log in for the rest of the season im with wilson ware who got concussed this week jamaal charles who may never play again mark ingram aka sir fumblesalot deandre hopkins tevin coleman jaquizz rodgers who hurt his foot today and more disappointmentsinjuries my league also has a moves limit and i have been scrambling week to week and only have left for the rest of the season man i drafted like shit this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lot of people in here dropping him dont have the luxury to do that in my league just gonna stream at qb for the meanwhile and pray that wilson gets back to speed or romo gets put in for dak within the next couple of weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keep him on my bench incase he gets hot like last year but i would drop him if i could pick up another rbwr but my league limits it to and
fantasyfootball,not_removed,think im gonna run with cousins or tyrod cuz man this dude is not good this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ride matty ice boat to the end and leave russel on the island
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dropped him midgame never looking back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,d r o p c i t y
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i took him in the this year first year playing fantasy matt ryan wasnt drafted so i picked him up week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,be really upset because hes a rd keeper in a team qb league and i cant trade him when hes playing injured
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drop and stream even cousins is looking better heh or foles if smith is dead
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have him in a qb league and will be benching him until he figures it out if he does ill be starting mariota until further notice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had mariota on my bench just waiting in case wilson didnt produce today
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if mariota is available on your ww drop wilson for him i did it a couple weeks ago and havent looked back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not an owner this year but just keep in mind that this dude went off at the end of the fantasy season last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im trading i think someone in my league will value his name at least i want to believe hell get past the injuries but he cost me this week and i cant let my stubbornness and his injuries cost me any more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sitting him just played him over carr and im barely winning the week im from seattle so the homerism crept in a little not a huge fan but i like russell a lot hell be a bye week fill from now on and injury insurance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,his oline is consists of turnstiles and a guy who has and his production is directly linked to his ability to scamper about like a greased mute now he has a bum ankle bum knee and bum pectoral im dropping him he may start producing consistently if he can get healthy but ill bet that would take a month and thats assuming that things go smoothly and he doesnt get sacked so hard that he explodes into a fine red mist of ligaments before then my seasons already in huge trouble due to other injuries i cant afford to keep him on the roster
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keep losing probably
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dunno what to do tbh got tyrod on my bench who has been playing pretty well but he has seattle next week and then a bye after that best qb available is probably mccown so may have to give him a shot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he just cost me my second loss im dropping his ass
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gotta start him next week just because brady is on bye d
fantasyfootball,not_removed,use my other qb matt ryan dropping wilson for mariota or something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just traded him for jamis winston
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drop him this was supposed to be his breakout game but hes not there with his injuries and terrible oline
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i picked up big ben after someone dropped him right after the injury hopefully roethlisberger comes back this week and i can just keep wilson on the bench as a safety net or trade him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dropping him and going with rivers the rest of the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,after the draft i was most happyproud wit my drafting of russell wilson now hes just a bye week fill in for matt ryan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,giants seahawks fanrussell wilson fan here we have the worst offensive line in football its never been a good line but wilson was able to mask it because he could scramble and help the blocking with the zone read hes currently playing through a high ankle sprain and a sprained mcl so he cant move the way we are used to him moving and its hurting us a lot on offense the only chance is that offensive line starts to gel together similar to last year when they caught fire or wilson starts to move around more as his knee and ankle get stronger as far as fantasy goes you shouldnt sell wilson for scraps because he is really good and i would never count the guy out but if you can get a good qb back in a trade id probably do it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i flat out dropped him fucks given
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes screwed me all season and im likely going to be after tonight so im just going to keep rolling him out there and lock up the pick for next year my new team name is
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drafted him in two leagues i bought the hype and hes screwing me in my two biggest money leagues will pick up a qb on waivers wednesday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes droppable there are enough streamworthy qb out there that you can get bye wilsons oline isnt helping him hes banged up and hes simply not producing regardless of matchup especially with roster spots so valuable right now bye weeks unless you absolutely need to start him there are better options
fantasyfootball,not_removed,through weeks last year wilson averaged points per game the last games he averaged no one can see the future but im not dropping him until i absolutely need to
fantasyfootball,not_removed,at this point i have to drop him im averaging by far the lowest average weekly qb score in my league keeping wilson around is almost single handedly sinking my season its been weeks time to move on
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a tough schedule might actually help him seattle is always getting out to leads early and that doesnt put a lot of pressure on qb to get ball down the field
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think even the most optimistic approach is to stash him for a few weeks and see if he gets back to full strength i wouldnt lose sleep over dropping him for a good qb if you need to
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dropping him injuries have ruined him this season and the oline isnt improving any time soon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im dropping his ass you cant trust him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i traded terrance west for derek carr this morning i plan on that being my solution
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wilson owners are eliminated from playoff contention so they dont care
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dropping him for cousins and rolling with cousinstygod the rest of the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he didnt look limited by the injuries tosay im actually encouraged he threw hard had some more mobility just a bad game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thought i made out like a bandit traded mckinnon and flacco for him in ppr league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,meh supposed break out games are tricky everyone dropped golden tate after his supposed break out game and he dropped yards the next week wilson has the talent to be a solid fantasy qb so it really depends on your league hes worth owning in some where the waiver wire is thin and most good handcuffs are owned if you can afford the bench spot then hes worth stashing currently treating him like an injured guy and starting stafford over him which after the ankleknee and pec strains he pretty much is starting him these past weeks have been akin to starting an injured guy despite what the bs practice reports saythey always list him as full but the mcl sprain isnt going to get jesusd away
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ay buddy we have the same lineup started russ over bortles this week and ty mont over jstew lost by im shipping ar off for the vikes d and crowell i got lucky cuz i havent had a d score positive points since week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drafted hopkins keenan watkins moncrief foster and i feel bad for you cause youve had the illusion of hope all year lolol at least with me half my players were out by week lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same
fantasyfootball,not_removed,two people that have a good eye for the future im assuming youre backup is decent and hes rb loaded
fantasyfootball,not_removed,depends on your roster league honestly i agree with you that hes worth stashing especially in mine where most good handcuffs are owned and theres not much on the waiver wire
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im trying to package them together as a poisoned apple for some poor smuck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats what everyone said last year around this time of year before he went off
fantasyfootball,not_removed,automodding here is awful shame you had to go through it to post that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,are you a paul charchian listener they brought this up on a recent episode and it was pretty interesting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,carr should not have been on the waivers for the last several weeks maybe all year on standard sized leagues if hes available pick him up yesterday and i say that before any of todays craziness
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont carry a backup qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i played wilson over carr but ill start carr from here out probably drop wilson for another qbbench player as needed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im running out rivers too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,literally the same situation for me mccown lit up with pts on my bench even with a two turnover game smh russ
fantasyfootball,not_removed,set your lineup dont ruin everyone elses experience just cause your team sucks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pts for not making any sense with that first sentence
fantasyfootball,not_removed,haha i know youre getting downvoted but this is me to a t
fantasyfootball,not_removed,paul allen might disagree
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes still very limited when it comes to running still looks like hes running through mud when he takes off
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just a bad game one is bad two is bad games out of the this season is horseshit he did this last year too and then when i finally traded him he started scoring points per game well theres a worse line and no marshawn to keep defenses honest i have a team league with a dearth of qb options this week i drop wilson and pick up mccown at least i know what to expect and work on the rest of my team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,imo only having some mobility seriously limits wilson he needs full mobility to be as effective as he has been in recent years yes it may be encouraging seeing him move around slightly more but if he cant run around and escape pocket pressure like he could in the past he just is not that good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a hawks fan he looks about out there he cannot spin out of the pocket cleanly or run for the first down yardage realistically the injury shouldve sidelined him for weeks his own words im afraid this will affect him all season now and potentially longterm
fantasyfootball,not_removed,someone in my league dropped him in week and i thought i was such a stud for swooping him im dropping him this week too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man if i were the vikes d owner i wouldnt take that trade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,haha i actually drafted keenan and after he went down traded for kinda a lose lose situation
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well i have bortles and i was able to scoop up tyrod taylor so not that impressive but one can only hope i honestly thought bortles would be a top qb this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,partly why im holding on to himi dropped him last year right before he exploded and im not tryna go through that heart break again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not ill have to check him out my opinion about this crystallized only recently as i was trying to browbeat a leaguemate into taking either ryan or rodgers off my hands haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well there is no one on the waivers worth picking up in my league honestly lol i also have evans obj hopkins c coleman as my wrs rawlscmike quizzmartin freeman and crowell as my rbs im stacked everywhere honestly and the best players in my man league are like john brown and will fuller for flex and over the people i have i wouldnt start them im probably going to pick up williams because for some reason the bell owner in our league doesnt have him but other than that im good honestly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,unless you play in a qb team league then you should always have a backup qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,of course i will i just feel like that today silly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey it limits him sure but i think this is the bottom call it a hunch but i think the combination of the tough upcoming schedule where he will be forced to lead good drives and wilson getting healthier will make him better russell wilson is not this bad of a player i understand wanting to separate from him and it being reasonable to do so but im staying the course as someone who bought low on him and is at i may start someone else next week of course but better days are ahead he looks better and this is about the time frame that youre about fully healed from a knee sprain dont be surprised if he has tds next week to keep up with tom brady and the patriots
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got lucky man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seriously both of those are better than allen robinson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wish people in my league would make trades like that for me thats a straight gift for you i kind of wanna see a screen shot of proof of this trade lol jk i will take your word hell of a deal for i wouldnt even trade crowell straight up or the viks to get ar
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who would give arob for someone with a blown knee
fantasyfootball,not_removed,vut
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no way you would get dez now that he put up numbers i just traded em for a buy low candidate i like terrell pryor and i got tannehill on the off chance that the new oc isnt shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why its the easiest position to replace if you pay attention to the matchups hell ive won leagues and streamed a different qb every week just look at every week and you will see serviceable guys for instance this week it was mccown never carry a back up qb never carry a back up def or kicker and its debatable if you should carry a back up te but a lot of people dont i do sometimes save those spots for wr and more importantly rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no i traded someone else for arob to replace keenan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,could be a keeper league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i hope you didnt down vote me maybe i phrased it poorly that is my first offer and i am expecting him to counter with something less which i would likely accept he has rodgers as his starting qb so wont play winston and he benched dez this week so values him that much although things obviously change after that game he also dropped tevin coleman after the point game vs denver because tevin coleman wasnt a big name at the beginning of the year for some owners the name is more important than anything else
fantasyfootball,not_removed,were going into week no one in any league is going to give up dez after holding him through injured games and a bye for draft busts thats why people downvoted you not because they didnt understand you but because they realize that your suggestion is impractical starting low in trade negotiations is a good tactic this offer however is just ridiculous you would be lucky if i even sent you a response
fantasyfootball,not_removed,those rules dont apply to a team qb league its a different beast every week you have to start qbs so that leaves qbs that can be on a bench that leaves teams that dont have a qb on their bench and there are never qbs on waivers when theres an injury if you dont have a qb on your bench and if someone picks up the backup qb before you on waivers you suddenly find yourself with an empty qb spot not every league is like yours this situation actually just happened in my league to the big ben owner he couldnt get jones didnt have a qb in his bench and ended up having to trade ab in order to get a qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh i might have read your comment wrong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the simple truth is get better owners this isnt fantasy baseball its not a daily activity if you dont make it if you arent committed to at the very least fielding a full lineup for weeks in each league then dont play if someone does that in one of my leagues they get kicked out its happened before but not recently as over time the crop of owners has improved to the point where everyone cares im in leagues and this problem hasnt happened in at least years the fact that you have teams completely not caring is a huge problem i know it may not be easy to replace teams but ive found that small monetary incentives for teams out of the big picture arent enough to matter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what kind of league is it keeper or redraft if its any type of league that carries forward what weve done is do seperate playoff brackets a money bracket and a draft bracket anyone making the real playoffs goes into the money bracket the loser bracket plays and stays interested because the winner of said bracket gets pick in the following years draft picks and so on then with the winner bracket the draft is set in reverse order of finish champion picks last runner up picks to last and so forth i guess even if it a redraft league but its your same group of friends or coworkers this is still a plausible formula that or just get people into the league who arent shitbags another thing weve done in one of my redraft leagues is upped the buy in by add to that each fa pick up and waiver pickup costs at the end of the year we divide the money by regular season games and each team that was high score for the week gets of the prize pool we have guys in that league so not counting the pick up money each weekly winner wpuld get at least dollars we had a guy last year win games all year but he still got over bucks at the end because he had really good weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we have two ways first the final week of the season is rivalry week guys will generally keep participating in order to not hear the shit talk from their rival the other thing we do is allow the league champion to pick draft position first followed by the secondplace team etc the lastplace team gets last choice of draft position just moving up a few spots is usually enough motivation to keep guys in it all season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive always liked the top scorer each week renames the bottom scorer for the week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our last place finisher gets hunted by the other with paintball guns for an hour we have no problems with interest
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we do a live draft every year and last place has to wear a dress to the draft party edit all guys league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,give them a free vcr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had huge problems with this in a league i was in once so when i made my own keeper league i slanted a lot of rules towards making sure there was no incentive to tank and a lot of incentive to keep playing weekly payouts for highest scoring team continuing through the playoffs if you lose by the guy who beat you gets to change your team pic to whatever he wants for a week next years overall pick is won by winning the consolation ladder plus its written in the league constitution that not setting a roster etc is can be grounds for removal never had a single player tank a single game in years and people are invested at the end of the year as well trying to win the pick for next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like having a prize for weekly high score winning your head to head it takes a chunk out of the prize pool but the engagementopportunity to make is there all season long regardless if your in or last
fantasyfootball,not_removed,put up a sacko rule the last spot has some kind of punishment coming
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you cant get better team owners i would suggest adding weekly stakes for example team with the most wr tds in week gets maybe start during week and have the pay out at the end of the season that way they have something to play for
fantasyfootball,not_removed,moneys due at the draft our commish will also fine teams throughout the year that dont set a valid lineup which goes into the pot we also have a running high score contest whoever had the highest weekly score by the end of the regular season gets money ripping on each other with absolutely no mercy helps too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,weekly winners highest point total of the week wins a certain amount of money
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the winner of the consolation bracket gets to chose their draft position for the following year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in my team league top make playoffs the team that comes in gets pick next year everyone continues to compete vying for the coveted pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in my league the bottom for the season gets dinged a fee for sucking it adds into the total payouts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we actually pay at the following years draft but the league fee depends on what place you came in we pay x your regular season finish so place pays pays and so on the difference between finishing vs is so its a decent incentive our league has been together for a while though and the turnover is pretty minimal which lets us get away with paying the following year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we have a losers forfeit stand up comedy makes the lower half of the league way more interesting than the top
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i replaced two managers going into this season purely on the basis that they did not try last season if you fail to set a lineup barring you dont want to drop someone because a kicker is on bye for at least three regular season games it is the commissioners discretion to remove you from the league beyond that whoever wins the loser bracket gets to have the first choice in draft pick for the next season the loser also has to endure some grueling punishments handed out before the draft by the champion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,last place punishments such as the rest of the league naming your team for every time you start an injured or bye week player unless theres some crazy situation where you either couldnt get your lineup edited in time or your entire bench is not playing in reality though you just have to play with people that are going to be committed to it and people who you know will be back in the league the next season at least those people will respect the integrity of the eagle enough
fantasyfootball,not_removed,weekly power rankings people love that shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,these are all really good ideas what about payouts looking to spread out more of the money rather than just to the champion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good owners is key we do a man and man keeper leagues you get keepers who have to be drafted after round you get two in season claims off of the waiver wire who are round if undrafted or round drafted in keepers should you choose and otherwise keepers move up one round each year and can be claimed until they reach a round pick the waiver wire priority pauses when that players game starts until the next wednesday and waiver priority is determined by worst record to best record so bad teams have first shot at claiming good waiver wire players and therefore keepers also draft pick trades are allowed so a bad team may trade their best players for picks next year and then load up on potential keepers it creates a system where each week there are reasons to pay attention also there are a ton of in league rivalries that have developed over the years and bad owners are voted out at the end of the season if they fail to meet demands there are also girls in the league who are not slouches in my years in the league they account for playoff appearances finishing below them results in escalating penalties
fantasyfootball,not_removed,collect money at the beginning
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the simple truth is get better owners came here to say this there are lots of things you can do to maintain competitiveness throughout the season but it shouldnt be the responsibility of the leaguecommish to do that if somebody cant take an hour once a week to set a lineup and cruise through the recommended free agent pickups that every website suggests they shouldnt be in your league simple as that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i completely agree with this make it clear to the league tho a good way to do this is by setting up a rulebook great templates of which can be found on this sub then notify the owners they will be replaced if they do not follow the rules be firm but fair in the first year you do this some owners wont take it seriously replace them and the next year people will set their lineups pretty consistently if you are in a league with people you cant kick i suggest a last place punishment that is bad enough to really make people not want to come in last also in these types of leagues sending out reminders to slacking owners can help
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is unique and cool i might want to try something like this in the new league i want to start
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good idea i dont think ill convince my league to do this but i like it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if the last place owner doesnt care enough to update his lineup hell probably just drop out rather than do a last place punishment a sacko punishment only works when you have a relatively tight knit league even if everyones spread around geographically they should still be familiar with one another that wants to keep playing every year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sounds like a great plan to me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes this is the way we do it its a tight knit team league rather than just punishing last place we have a loser bowlof sorts where the teams that didnt make playoffs bottom of teams play each other while the winning teams play each other for the loser bowl its easy simply win once and youre out of the loser bowl at the end of the loser bowl the last loser standing is the one that ends up with a punishment that the whole league voted on before the beginning of the season it makes the real playoff and loser playoffs very exciting and keeps everyone engaged the entire time examples of previous punishments bar hop with a leashed live chicken dress in drag and bar hop get a full brazilian wax change your license plate to whatever winner wants for a year etc
fantasyfootball,not_removed,light em up boys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,annnnnnd he smokes a celebratory blunt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,grabbed him last week of the waivers in my keeper leaguei think i just did an aerial somersault as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes been out of the conversation so long that his value is going to be tremendous i foresee a josh gordonmartavis bryant conundrum in next years draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how does this affect josh gordons status
fantasyfootball,not_removed,weird ive never seen anyone use a bar like that for bench i wonder if its better for your shoulders
fantasyfootball,not_removed,will absolutely be trying to get a late round steal with him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hows putting on pounds of muscle going to help him wont that slow him down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im hyped weve seen bryant do it weve seen the steelers try to find other options in their passing game we know the window is closing in pitt bell franchise contract ben thinking of retirement so theyre going to use their best weapons the opportunity makes so much sense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol trampolining the bar off his chest just take two plates off and do real presses
fantasyfootball,not_removed,light em up boys yeah come on lets wait a second uhhh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i didnt know this was a josh gordon thread
fantasyfootball,not_removed,isnt that just a front flip
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so did i but i also have antonio brown and now im not sure if i want to pool the risk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,martavis has still been going in the the last few weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its actually called a football bar and is easier on the shoulder and harder on the triceps
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its more about the grip because his hands are in a thumbs up position it alleviates stress on the shoulders same thing has been around for pull ups forever palms facing each other instead of chin ups or standard pull ups this also has a more natural motion for blocking so im not sure why martavis is doing this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah me neither pretty narrow grip so some serious tricep strength
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he aint going in the later rounds in my league someone will grab him third round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not necessarily it could make him more explosive ever see a sprinters legs and it could help him fight off cbs at the line
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he was already hard to tackle this will make it more difficult he can also beat jams at the line more easily
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it could
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aerial somersault looks like you are correctto preform an aerial you need to keep your legs straight an aerial somersault is an oxymoron as you cannot keep your legs straight and do a somersault httpwwwbuzzlecomarticlesgymnasticmoveshtml
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they both make each other better antonio had a good year last year but he wouldve had a much better year with another wr threat that the defenses respect they double covered all season hurting his numbers pretty obvious in the playoffs too ne almost completely shut down ab dont think they wouldve been able to do that with martavais on the field
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sell him now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id grab ben too and go all in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats a tough oneyoull be pretty confident when ben throws the ball youll put up points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,actually the narrow gripelbows in is what makes it easy on your shoulders supinating the grip would theoretically allow your triceps to contract further similarly chinups stretch your lats more at full extension than pullups do so if you dont have good lat mobility it could be harder on your shoulders of people dont use a full range of motion on pull ups or chin ups in the first place though so thats a pretty moot point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that would be ridiculous
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he aint going in the later rounds in my league hes not going in the later rounds in most leagues once hes reinstated and the narrative gets going his draft position will start to climb he will be a midround pick in most leagues and will be picked with players in a lot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i too live in steelers country homers are funny
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely a boost for ab totally agree coates just wasnt the consistent threat that martavis was due to injury and talent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sad thing is they can shut both down now with gilmore and butler heres to hoping one gets injured
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats what i was thinking hell be with the guys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,heres to hoping one gets injured saying this is a sign you need to a reevaluate your life or b continue to be a shitty person
fantasyfootball,not_removed,neither is a shut down corner both good but far from shut down corners
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nah
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes cause my fantasy talk is super cereal guys judging someone on one joking comment means a reevaluate yout life or b continue to be a shit type person what a fun game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you seem to have gone with b
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you seem to have gone with b
fantasyfootball,not_removed,honestly its been a while since people were this bearish on qb i think its a bit foolish that rodgers and wilson are going as late as they are cam i can see regression they wont win games again im a huge proponent of waiting on qb but if i see either rodgers or wilson there in the im pulling the trigger that value is stupid to pass up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if cam or rodgers are around in the im pulling the trigger but id rather see if brees or palmer are available in round that said it depends on your league if youre playing in an office family league with people who take qbs really early then obviously not waiting that late
fantasyfootball,not_removed,here is the thing qb is a deep position and you are better off waiting and streaming your qb however qbs are usually a very safe position to draft rarely suffer a significant injury and usually perform as expected so i would say that anything past the fourth round is a steal for rodgers cam wilson luck and brees only because youre not giving up much by drafting them there all the top flightreliable rbs and wrs are probably gone by then
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree on taking one late and im usually the last guy to draft one one thing though that no one talks about is safety how many of your round picks bust probably half do whats worse taking wilson in the or your round wr busting i understand the math and the reasoning but i think we as a community have taken the wait on a qb thing a little too far myself included
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill take a qb when i no longer have confidence in the players available at other positions which usually happens in round id much rather lock up a stud qb than guess on a wr or a rb or settle for one i dont think will be that good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,their adps are early round right now i would say if you could draft them in the late or early it wouldnt be a terrible move
fantasyfootball,not_removed,or round but ive never been in a draft where the first qbs ever fell that late someone always reaches on the first of a group
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how so improved receiving options more volume and a switch to focus on him more in the offense we cant expect a clip like he did the second half of last year but he will be a monster for sure
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is about my limit on stud qbs hard to pass that up i think at cam rogers brees wilson or palmer are a hairtrigger grab for me i just cant help it ive had success trading them once i get a good waiver qb so it usually ends up being worth it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cam round rodgers late or early brees mid or early luckwilson anytime after the round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i havent seen either make it past the in any mocks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,only thing i can see regressing with cam is the passing yards go back and look at his career stats he really is that good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,at the same time though if you draft one of those guys you are starting them every week when i stream i can usually get to which means regardless of when i take a qb there is probably better value somewhere else i only take a qb if i think they will be or and they fall to the im pretty sure that wont happen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think that its likely that wilson performs as a mediocre fantasy option
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wouldnt be terrible i think were going overboard with the qb hate getting a qb that easily has qb potential in the or round is great youll be hard pressed to ever find a top qb on waivers i get that you can be fine streaming qbs but it can give you a huge weekly edge to have cam or rodgers in your lineup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good luck with that rodgers hasnt even sniffed the in any draft ive seen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wilsons adp is on fantasy calculator
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yep im getting them in the in all of my and many leagues snatching up a lot of shares of wilson and rodgers all the people playing for money are waiting on qb and its a great opportunity to grab some awesome value edit just checked i have wilson in mfls rodgers in cam in wilson i got at and rodgers at cam at all great values imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i mean he had a career year and i would put huge sums of money on them not winning again usually teams that lose more games see some qb regression
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yup exactly where i am with qbs realistically i only see luck or brees dropping to the but even then im not counting on it people always get qb fever in my leagues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree that because more and more people are jumping on the wait on qb bandwagon its going to create more value for the top end qb normally the top qbs in previous seasons have had adp of what or round its pretty crazy that guys like cam and rodgers even have a chance of dropping this far edit a word
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you might think you cant find a top tier qb on waivers but bortles showed its very possible also cam was a late roundwaivers guy last year sure id take him in the but drafting a qb early is mathematically the wrong decision the difference between the one and the twelfth guy isnt comparable to the difference between an early round rb and a late round one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bortles and palmer both ended up being top qb last year and were either drafted extremely late or not at all
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just to play devils advocate cam went undrafted last season in a lot of leagues so did bortles and luck and rodgers went very early
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah they wont be on any of my teams at their current price im a huge advocate for waiting on qb and normally dont take one until round but the question was how low is too low and if for some reason they dropped that far you would almost have to take them there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh yeah thats awesome for a mfl mentally i relate everything to a standard ysually its cam then rodgers in the and wilson in the those are the top three i see though is amazing value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cam and palmer went extremely late last season in most all drafts brady went way outside of the first rounds in most drafts as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for sure if i saw rodgers or wilson that low fuck my current strategy thats amazing value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well these are mans too ppr and wr so that certainly pushes them down a little bit certainly havent seen them go as early as though i think thats silly for those guys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,luck and rodgers both had adp of late early during august last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there are a packers fan and two panthers fans in my league i guarantee you rodgers and cam are gone by the end of the second ill come back after the draft next month and post a screenshot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my league is packer fans and there isnt a chance in hell rodgers makes it out of the second cam might go earlier but it will trigger the inevitable rush its easy to see why you should wait but some people just dont understand the reasoning and see the big points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,landry is ppr gold
fantasyfootball,not_removed,landryparker discussion starts around
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im a huge phins fan and i must agree with omar is like those aweful gossip magazines you see at the checkout line in ralphs publix or wegmans he says controversial things just to drum up stupid discussion until i see other writers i respect such as beasley say similar things im not going to believe that parker is having any difficulties at all omar is simply trying to set up parker vs laundry arguments for who is the real no receiver in miami even though they have totally different skillsets even if parker cant get totally open thats not his job his job is going up and catching the ball which he excels at
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jarvis landry was an every week wr last year in ppr ill reach a little for him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck omar kelly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,coming from a phins fan take anything omar kelly says with a huge grain of salt hes very critical for the sake of being critical and plays favorites its his thing hes best friends with miko and brent grimes and made excuses for brent all season even when hed get torched however continually blocks people on twitter and threatens to leave over tannehill discussion because he refuses to acknowledge that the offensive line has anything to do with his lack of success so far hes a child really this is the same guy who continually wrote article after article about how miami needed to find a true running back when lamar miller was on a tear last season and then came back and tweeted that how could we not offer lamar money to keep him hes a top back hes clown college
fantasyfootball,not_removed,any news on caroo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats kind of a weird statement isnt it when does landry not want to be open and why
fantasyfootball,not_removed,trope alert trope alert trope alert
fantasyfootball,not_removed,omar hates miami rarely has anything positive to say pay no attention to him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats so damn hard about learning how to run routes i just dont get how receivers have so much potential but cant do something so fundamental
fantasyfootball,not_removed,despite the some posters saying omar kelly is a hack i still believe this i remember matt harmon saying parkers looks like bambi on skates on the field cant run routes ill probably stay away from parker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,usually omar kelly cant be trusted completely like when he said theres nothing special about juice last april now hes biting his tongue so dont be shocked if devante does better than what omar says obviously juice is the top wr but there is space for a especially if ajayi can take pressure off tannehill basically i think in a man league that landry is a late rounder and parker is a fair a or round pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not terribly surprised i thought the parker hype train was starting to pick up a little too much steam based off the small sample size from last year his inability to get open is probably slightly exaggerated but he would have had to improve by a large margin from how he looked last year to overtake landry as the dolphins top wide out this year could be one of those guys that comes on strong towards the end of the year but i wouldnt really feel comfortable with parker as my i like him a decent amount as a though for the upside
fantasyfootball,not_removed,from what i can tell omar kelley is harsh but not often wrong he may exaggerate deficits but his info is usually good whatever you make of it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,noooooo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,landry was a beast its the amount of receptions he got last year thoughts on his production for
fantasyfootball,not_removed,reading the title to this post made me imagine the remaining players from the dolphins beating the shit out of a writer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a omar kelly likes headlines more than facts hell say whatever suits his narrative i wouldnt base fantasy opinions solely on what he says b devante hype should be tempered a bit juice is stll this teams most talented target parker could be a good wr this season but his success is being projected off too small a sample size and a lot of question marks i think hell be a solid wr but i dont think hell outshadow juice and i dont think hes worth reaching for if the adp is right sure but i wouldnt reach too far if the o struggles i dont think he gets the targets he needs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when tf did parker become the on that team did they completely forget about landry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i put landry in the same conversation as alshon jeffery both suffer nagging soft tissue injuries if hes healthy hes going to be a huge target in that offense tann may not lock onto him like cutler does jeffery but that may change as the season progresses
fantasyfootball,not_removed,interesting what brad evans had to say about paul perkins you think thats realistic
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol parker will be the biggest bust he is this years charles johnson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had him in dynasty and dropped him for short term needs then immediately regretted it so this is great news
fantasyfootball,not_removed,even more so if your league does kick returns as well landry is damn near top with those stats
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this times
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this so much no one should put any stock in anything omar kelley says
fantasyfootball,not_removed,grabbed him under budget in my dynasty league and couldnt be happier hell be on my team for the next three years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,came to say this source is trash
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is the same guy who continually wrote article after article about how miami needed to find a true running back when lamar miller was on a tear last season and then came back and tweeted that how could we not offer lamar money to keep him hes a top back complete bullshit the dolphins are averaging rushing yards per game the thirdworst running attack in the nfl after two weeks sept similar their running game which is averaging a dismal yards on the ground has been abandoned early consistently this season and a onedimensional dolphins offense is a mediocre one lamar miller who rushed for yards last season and scored nine touchdowns has gained just rushing yards on carries miller who sprained his left ankle in the dolphins sept loss to the jaguars is averaging just carries per game sign a fullback in the vonta leach mold and begin to develop a power package that benefits the team in goalline and shortyardage situations how many times are the dolphins planning to run a jet sweep to convert a was it really wise to throw the ball four times from the line last week against buffalo run the damn ball the dolphins should make sure lamar miller touches the football at least times a game and im not just referring to his carries hes averaging per game miller can also do damage catching passes out the backfield and ryan tannehill should check down to the backs a bit more lamar miller tried his best but struggled to hide his disappointment that stemmed from the first month of the dolphins season where the offense featured the secondworst rushing attack in the nfl the threeyear starter who was coming off a season where he rushed for yards and scored nine touchdowns was barely getting nine carries and gaining rushing yards per game in the seasons first month the dolphins had a laundry list of excuses of why miami wouldnt couldnt and hadnt run the football but none of them made much sense lamar miller who had total yards and scored two touchdowns against the texans despite only playing in the first half is finishing runs better than hes ever done during his fouryear career the end result is bigger running lanes for miller whose yards per carry average will challenge for the nfl lead this week not bad for a tailback who averaged yards per carry two weeks ago millers rushing yards were the most rushing yards in a first half since baltimores jamal lewis rushed for yards against cleveland in september of imagine the type of numbers miller could have had if campbell hadnt decided to rest him for thursday nights game against the patriots stay committed to the running game for the second straight season the dolphins rank second in the league in yards per carry but they throw the ball percent of the teams snaps offensive coordinator bill lazor cant call another game where miami doesnt have rushing attempts campbell has been pretty consistent about saying he wants the dolphins to be a physical running team but lazor seems to be ignoring him over the past two weeks the most disturbing part of miamis struggles running the football in the first half was that the dolphins rushed for just yards on carries before injuries got lamar miller benched and chipped away at miamis starting offensive line miller suffered a quadriceps injury in the second quarter and only got two carries in the second half thursday i asked him why hes not the dolphins thirddown back considering he has the best hands of any tailback on the roster and is an adequate pass blocker im not sure miller responded have they ever explained why im never really asked miller said certain play calls are for certain people it depends on the package so the dolphins are basically saying damien williams is a better pass catcher and pass blocker than miller and that it is wise to take the teams best offensive weapon off the field on the most important down really also goes on about how the dolphins have never used him to the extent they should have given his talent it appears that miami has thrown in the towel on retaining the and is shifted its efforts towards pursuing other tailbacks the dolphins must find a multipurpose tailback because gase plans to lean heavily on that position in miamis new offense the bears ran the ball times last season and averaged more rushing attempts than all but five teams last season i havent gone through his whole twitter feed back to september but you get the message
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely hearing some not so great stuff about him on twitter as well however a few other guys who are very well respected seem to agree somewhat that releasing vs press coverage has been an issue for him i was just tweeting with matt harmon he did say that even though kelly is known to say some wacky things his assessment of parker is right in line with what he put on the field last year matt waldman also mentioned his release vs press coverage when he retweeted the link with the comment parker still has to prove he can win vs press i love his upside this year in the gase offense think i remember hearing gases x receivers consistenly get a huge target share so he should have every opportunity to breakout i guess even if the original beat reporter isnt any good he does seems to have brought something up that according to some actual good football minds is somewhat of an issue for parker still so early but could be something to keep an eye on
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you so much for this parker is one of my targets this year and this article was a bit scary
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you just got yo lying ass called out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck that guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well somewhat related kelly said that kenny stills has looked like one of the best players at otas obviously not good news for carroo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im assuming hes just saying that as a hyperbole to express the gap in route running skill between the two of them but to give your answer a serious question there are a couple times plays where hes not getting the ballisnt the primary read think screens short passes right up until he makes his cut so he can leave his man behind and gain yac plays where he needs to draw the safety coverage and theres probably more theres a lot of blocking he can do without ever touching anyone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yep he confirmed it to me on twitter after i tweeted this at him to get his take
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think youre over valuing parker especially because if you view landry as a late im assuming youre not in a ppr league were rolling out a brand new offense again in miami and a lot of uncertainty comes with that in the you could probably get a receiver with a much lower floor personally id stay away from parker until you have or receivers and are comfortable taking a wait and see pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if healthy jarvis should be an easy catch guy he was my top sleeper last season and helped me win my league after being mocked while my other wideout jordy nelson tore his acl during our auction if you are ppr in fantasy you have to have landry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i know in dynasty fantasy leagues parker is considered a much higher asset than landry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what did he say
fantasyfootball,not_removed,on the same show brad evans says that paul perkins could be this years david johnson thats a hot take imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think thats a bit of a stretch johnson never had the talent or offensive situation to warrant such hype same reason i feel laquon treadwell is getting overdrafted if parker busts it wont be because onfield ability it will be his ability to stay on the field he has a history of lower body injuries and those tend to derail a wrs season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is exactly how ive been feeling this offseason parker is being way overrated by most people i dont get it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,parker had rec for yards and three touchdowns in pretty limited action last season targets snaps i dont see how if he gets snaps and targets he could do any worse than yards and tds not a must own stud but hell be serviceable
fantasyfootball,not_removed,at least neither of them are corrdarrele patterson fuck that guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they have to throw the ball somewhere landry will start to get stacked on parker has the talent just cant run routes from what i heard about him and his college years i live in kentucky i had a kid in class who was the guys biggest fan and would keep going on about how he just needed to learn his routes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pff released their top graded return men last friday and landry graded out as the return man in the league lockett finished second and quan bray
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kick return yards or tds because kick return yards ruins fantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pretty sure he was overall among wrts in my return league last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a miami fan i dont think hes going to be returning kicks this year between the additions of grant and drake and how valuable he is to our offense i dont think the dolphins risk it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shhhhhhhhhhhhshhhhhhhhhhhhhhes my steal pick with lockett welp not any more i guess
fantasyfootball,not_removed,grabbed him as my wr in my dynasty startup draft this year and im so beyond pumped
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow thats a helluva writeup thank you for the detailed contradiction of op
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have to say that was impressive as fuck unless you are actually this omar fellow in disguise
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this was serious dedication lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,omar kelly is that you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,while omar says a lot of really stupid stuff and i really dont trust him as the scout that he thinks he is he was pushing for more miller last year got to also remember this is the same guy that spent an offseason on twitter hyping legedu nanee he puts great stock into subjective made up stats kills and routine says contradictory statements on twitter and will block anyone who questions them hes just sort of a dick anyway i dont think its a secret that parker has to work on his routes and suddenness to create separation but also recognize that hes a very big boy who did a very good job using his body to his advantage at the point of catch so his physical size and abilities help mask the fact that he might not be getting wide open
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ahh yes the frank isola of dolphin writers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,found omar kellys account
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good writeup a lot of dolphins fans hate omar because he constantly questions tannehill and writes what he really thinks instead of pandering to fans is he always right no but he does have an eye and id wager hes right more than hes wrong if you follow omar and get distracted by his personalnonfootball posts hell rub you the wrong way quick his football tweets are generally on point though if hes saying parker is having issues getting open id believe him he doesnt blatantly lie about what he sees but his predictions arent always on point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gettem
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow good shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,people complain about him because hes negative on the team when they deserve it hes not the phinsiders who blatantly pander to the fans because the team owns them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no it felt real good thanks for bringing that up man hey my parents died when i was ten would you like to talk about that edit has nobody seen the wedding singer comeon man gotta have a sense of humor when you get burned like that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah caroo may be a year away from fantasy relevance i expect him to start in wr sets with parker on the outside and landry in the slot sooner rather than later
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe i am but i think hes a player worth the risk cuz of hes long ball potential at ypc late last season and i was definitely talking about standard not ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we dont do ppr but stillsuper consistent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its because he had some good looks at the end of the season last year i think hell be a monster next year maybe even by the end of this year but people are looking at games of essentially garbage time seeing some potential and believing that guarantees to translate to a whole regular season the dude does have talent though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kr yards do not ruin fantasy unless you really try to make it ruin fantasy it improves fantasy and increases the nuances in strategies going into each week and the season as a whole
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont know about ruins but i certainly dont prefer it i have landry and lockett in my dynasty league and voted down return yard points this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,many dolphins fans have a hatehate relationship with kelly hes not always wrong but hes extremely confrontational and to add to it hes friends with and defends miko grimes edit spelling
fantasyfootball,not_removed,even if he is pretty legit defense of the lamar accusation didnt really talk about anything else though so prolly just a big fan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no way this is omar he would block everyone on this sub
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes pretty dam bad his football eye is on par with matt murdocks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if the dolphins had a more forceful rushing attack that might not have happened miller is presently on pace to gain rushing yards on carries if he stays healthy and keeps his yd per carry average and every tailback ahead of miller in rushing has had significantly more carries than him eagles tailback lesean mccoy who is in the offense this one came from has more carries and more rushing yards on the season miller is on pace to rush for yards and touchdowns on carries if he plays all games and remains on his carries per game pace ive hit the article limit but i think you get it id never seen the guy before today but it seems hes a big fan of miller actually
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no i dont want my pants to catch fire
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would still definitely wait until at least the since hes far from a guarantee but yeah he does have some upside potential
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yep landry had a few games last year where he didnt do much on offense but returned a td and ended up with points love kr stats
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow one of my league mates would call that possessing the abe lincoln gene good for you i def dont have it in fantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id actually never heard of him before this just wanted to check the veracity of ops claim its easy given news sites link articles to the writers name ie httpwwwsunsentinelcomsflomarkellybiostaffhtml
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh is he a mod
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whoa whoa whoa he obviously meant last season starting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you can always pm me if you have any questions im happy to help heres my suggested approach look at every player within the same tier denoted by shading as having roughly equivalent value look at players in other positions that have similar tiers these are the guys youre going to compare against look at how many players are left in that tier and the positional scarcity value to determine which position you should draft look at player value and ranking the newest version of the sheet includes fantasypros ranking to determine which guy you want also look at the historical performance to see if anyone stands out ultimately its about picking the team youre happy with theres nothing wrong with going wr heavy is a viable strategy and since its a ppr league you end up with a ton of solid wrs and less exposure to the rb position which is typically more volatile due to injury
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would look at the column that describes the value left after that player is gone and what the trends are in your draft if half the teams in your league have gone wrwr to start and most of the rest have gone rbwr or wrrb then you might want to grab a rb because many will be looing to grab one soon and only a few wr will leave the board before you come back around you want to not just look at the value of a player at that time but also the value there if you forgoe that player or position and wait until your next pick example you have pick youre not sure hilton or forte both have adp near middleend of round you go hilton because higher val between this and your next pick rb qb and wr leave the board youre left with a wr with and an rb with well it would look to me that you made a mistake because the value at rb dropped more than at wr if you had picked up forte you would end up with more value in the end you get a better feel for that in mocks and you can see it develope during a draft with trends tldr look at value now and expected value at your next pick based on trends and your league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,put up your rosters lets have a look at what you ended up with
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i always get d and f as well but thats because im reaching in the later rounds for guys i like and not taking a k or def until the end
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id be interested in seeing your drafts because im finding mine are all very similar and i have gotten as and the lowest is a b im not saying im a draft god more that i think their system may be flawed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beersheets are my secret to cleaning my league out every year dont worry about automated grades stick to the sheets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fantasy pros is garbage with those ratings they graded my draft an f last year and i was averaging points a week team non ppr by like week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks for the reply with above are you implying that i should compare round wr round rb to be about the same at least when im filling in my starters in the few rounds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey ive never heard of this before do you have a link to these
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im getting fs and ds every time unless i have the pick then its as every time weird
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its not so much about rounds as it is about value and tiers for example if you look at youll see that the tier of mark ingram through matt forte has a value that roughly overlaps with alshon jeffery through demaryius thomas the comparison isnt perfect for example i wouldnt automatically take matt forte over ty hilton even though forte is in a higher tier but its a good starting point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,check my post history
fantasyfootball,not_removed,interesting maybe with the pick youre more likely to go bpa since theres such a big gap between picks when do you go k and def
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i go kdst in the last few rounds but i always end up with an aboveaverage combination and still get ds and fs i just dont really trust it because i always look at the top ranked teams and theyre usually not very goodat least in my opinion and i think most here would agree
fantasyfootball,not_removed,two leagues brown or bell bonus for yard games bonus for yard td ppr obj or zeke standard ppr thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man ppr keep round jordy round mccoy definitely keeping at this spot round ty round kelce
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bell and zeke set for life
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mccoy and ty
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats tough do you have to make the discision now if not i would wait and see if anything changes later in the offseason as in can bell stay off the weed if you must choose now i would go bell but im probably biased since ive had him the last years in my keeper league you probably cant go wrong with either
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr i would keep bell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,exactly where i was leaning too i really just wanted to talk some ff thank you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,anyone still here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fucking week championships this sub is a ghost town already
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill mail someone five dollars in quarters if they play and win week starting mark sanchez
fantasyfootball,not_removed,saw a dude running on the treadmill in jeans at the gym just now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dalvin cook is gonna be a beast at the next level
fantasyfootball,not_removed,think im just gonna prep for fantasy baseball and enjoy the playoffs maybe even pay my gf some attention now that im richer cheers guys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what yall doing with demarco granted hes been fantastic all year but the last couple weeks have seen henry vulturing touchdowns and carries on lots of drives mariota is out which isnt great for their run game theres a good chance houston stacks the box against tennessee to try and get them to throw not sure what tennessees playoff status is at the moment but if theyre out i dont know why they wouldnt rest demarco there are more appealing matchups with guys like zenner mcfadden jacquizz and dwilltoussant floating around demarco has well exceeded his adp and probably got you to your shitty week championship but do you trust him this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yo been checking roto all day in hopes that demarco sits
fantasyfootball,not_removed,does it have to be a standard league because im down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,go noles not impressed with michigan so far but still have a half to go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theres a chance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes old in a worthless game im sitting on derrick henry and id like start him over my current fire line up of zennerbluetouissant
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre welcome
fantasyfootball,not_removed,slightly better end for this iteration of the boston te party thanks for the memories black unicorn
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i read that as real possibility he exists
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so what are the pats gonna do at te with bennett leaving and gronks power core winding down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just when i thought njoku would slip by under the radar
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so basically a team is going to overpay him and hes going to severely under perform at least from a fantasy perspective got it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is this really news if you asked me after the super bowl i would have told you his odds of staying were around i dont think anyone in boston is expecting him to return
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we all know bill will pick up toss away players and turn them to contributing players larry donnell jermaine gresham to patriots confirmed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hope the giants grab him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i thought this was safe to assume already when he sat post game and uttered something along the lines of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow poor new england i hope they can find a te boo hoo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its a quality te class for the back end of the first round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,leads me to think that pats will target a top te in the draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nobody cares
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not quite confirmed yet though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he does own the imagination agency
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the te class in the draft this year is very deep howard njoku everett engram and butt all have the chance to compete right away so i wouldnt be shocked if the patriots draft one within the first two days
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ne can flex and rotate their tes like most of us do in fantasy football draft one te pick one up early and one more at roster cut time in aug let bellichick pick which te he wants to throw the ball too like he does with rb work gronk into the equation too i dont know how durable he is anymore
fantasyfootball,not_removed,zac studfeld try number two
fantasyfootball,not_removed,see thomas julius
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i doubt it he essentially said he couldnt wait to get to free agency for more money im going into free agency as a super bowl champion you know they overpay super bowl champions bennett said on nfl network
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i disagree hes an athlete with a small window to perform hes already won a superbowl whats left time for him to get a massive contract so he doesnt have to worry about money once his career is over
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if he can be valuable on a team with the best te in the league then every other team would love him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think gronk could stop laughing long enough to play if they pick butt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont forget jeremy sprinkle
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did anyone even pick him up for fantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agree if you already have the ring its all about the pay thing actually its always about the money so they can afford a honey
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ieo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im saying who cares about this its speculative the draft hasnt even happened yet and no fantasy drafts will happen until several months from now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,throwing all my support behind drafting butt just for this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gronkbutt would totally bro out together tho
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you mean butt the tight end of the year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he started the season off as one of the best te
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dude its the off season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why are you here other than the few amount of trades that happen every offseason the only thing we talk about here is speculation until fa starts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so youre uh putting all your weight behind butt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i should absolutely not be here none of us should theres nothing to talk about until the draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah im hoping my support can thrust butt into a hole new world
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes not alex smith
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just because you have no interest doesnt mean no one else should people are in keeper and dynasty leagues as well and may want to make moves based off whats happening now maybe i want to roll the dice and trade for bennett now while hes cheap and hope he goes to a good landing spot maybe i think jt will have more success in miami than he did in jax and trade for him maybe im just bored as fuck at work and want to see whats up with ff community maybe i just like football and while rnfl is great for news i want to see what the ff community thinks about a certain event or speculation
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you basically have two choices if you dont want to see fantasy talk in the offseason unsub until july or bitch about how everyone on this sub should act the way you want them to i see you have opted for the latter but that is the wrong choice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,stop puns arent funny go back to rjokes with the other kids
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think we are arguing over semantics the title of the post was equivalent to bennett might change teams then again maybe new england will resign him he signed a oneyear deal so this was implied im not seeing how this merits attention as if it is some kind of new story i think its fine to talk about tangible things like past player production situations reasons to be bullish or bearish on a player etc but saying a guy on a one year contract might change teams after his contract is up who the f cares until he does and then lets talk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cmon of fantasy football team names are puns i will not apologize for rudolph the redzone reindeer or lambeaughini mercy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you could say hes the butt of every joke on here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chiefs d or seahawks d
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dan bailey or caleb sturgis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rudolph ebron or d walker standard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gostkowski vs janikowski vs hopkins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,houston ten or washington v nyg
fantasyfootball,not_removed,standard scoring pick ertz vs dal ebron vs gb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pick one kai forbath v chi roberto aguayo v car graham gano v tb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,standard scoring pick one jordan reed questionable vs nyg or dennis pitta cin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tough choice but i would go with ertz he is playing dallas
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aside from his last game ertz has gotten or a td in straight games plus dude gets a ton of targets and dallas is pretty weak against tes im really leaning towards ertz this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please tell me you started ertz
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dumped brown miller big ben and melvin gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,uhhh no shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nonissue ware will play andy just wanted to chat about ribs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats totally fine more for reek the freak
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wares value is purely volume since he doesnt score anymore reek has nerfed his value a lot too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,playing against ware take the week off dude youve earned it pls
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rest up ware no need to seriously injure yourself we have next year to look forward to
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i see c west on my waiver wire but im not that intrigued his ypc is nothing to write home about seems like a type of play are the chiefs unable to run the ball or is it ware wearing down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ware is awful anyway
fantasyfootball,not_removed,should i plug in d williams instead
fantasyfootball,not_removed,confidence level
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh my god yes i have hill and am playing against ware for the championship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its more the playcalling a lot of short passes a lot of tyreek hill jet sweeps and alex smith rushing too they keep getting ahead and just resting imo ware looks good always has just hasnt had the chances nor faced weak ds in good situations
fantasyfootball,not_removed,half a slab
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crazy to play west and hill if west sits in the ship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,your risk man west was awkward when i ran him one week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,best i could think of is go to pfr do team drive finder do only and go youll get average number of plays and time of possession per drive so you can get an idea of pace
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in my mind the sweet spots are teams make playoffs teams make playoffs seeds get first round bye
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im part of an nfl standard team we have play off spots
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we have spots in our espn league and we went with the default
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team top make the playoffs weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our ppr has top seed gets a bye
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in mine first place gets a bye edit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team league used to do with rounds this year were doing team sudden death with and getting byes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,of mine have spots has and has
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jebus my team has make the playoffs its stupid but ive won out of the last three years and lost the championship game by point in the year i didnt win so i guess i shouldnt complain i just didnt realize we were so different from the norm
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man espn we do man playoffs and man sacko playoffs we just take the scores for each week and keep track of who is where in the bracket manually
fantasyfootball,not_removed,size spots or more rarely
fantasyfootball,not_removed,httpwwwrototradecom will tell you your odds to make the playoffs based on your current record once you enter your team in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you just blew my mind
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in a man definitely league we usually pull people off the street and force them to create a free agency team its rough but its a living
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i refuse to play defiantly leagues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team league and we have spots definitely seems like a lot but its been working for years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats how we do it in our just makes it so too much of the league loses a reason to care late in the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats how mine is and i also agree with the keeppeopleinterested aspect we have a and already inactive i know idgaf when im that far behind i just like talking shit so i set my lineup if i was new to fantasy why would i care once im out of the playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,out of make playoffs what is this the cfl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we do a man sacko i think having only the worst be eligible means that those lower places have more to play for down the stretch first week of playoffs the and seeds play then the loser of that game faces the seed in a week matchup so the person who does finish in last really earned it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what are the chances andy reid only ate three meals today
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the colts are pretty soft v the pass this year if smith misses more time maybe but theres a reason smith is the starter and not foles foles looking decent over a single game isnt going to do much to change it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,foles has the pocket awareness of helen keller i doubt smith outright lost his job smith may have scrambled eggs for brains after today though how they let him go back into the game is beyond me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,andy reid fell for this before
fantasyfootball,not_removed,difference is that kaepernick looked dynamic and electric while smith was out foles just looked okay
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe im just shit posting or maybe i drank a little too much either way im probably definitely wrong ftfy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,give him a break hes bulking
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he had a yard bomb to hill in the second quarter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cultivating mass
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jordy is the best of those i love his super high floor and ceiling aj green seems to have a lower ceiling dez bryant has a bottomless floor with romo being fragile alshon jeffery has injury issues of his own
fantasyfootball,not_removed,heres how i see it aj has to be first theres no downside really high ceiling high floor dont get cute dez will be great as long as romo is healthy high ceiling mediumlow floor mediumlow because i think a rookie qb would be better than the steaming pile they had at qb last year jordy could be great or he could have some trouble coming back from the acl or he may have lost a step due to age or the too many mouths to feed narrative could play itself out too many variables for me mediumhigh ceiling mediumlow floor jeffery is in an unknown offense with a marginalerratic qb and is pretty much their only offensive threat now that forte and bennett are gone mediumhigh ceiling low floor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id lean toward green because of the departures of sanu and jones also eifert will not be healthy week green doesnt have as long of a injury history compared to the rest late round i want someone who i can trust and feel comfortable taking a little bit more of a risk in round if ap gurley or dj falls to you though id take any of those guys besides the consensus top wrs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez in my opinion has the highest ceiling but also the lowest floor we saw last year what happened when romo went down with no capable backup and injury issues of his own dez was a complete disaster however hes also the only wr on this list that i could realistically see going out there and scoring tds dez could absolutely finish as the top wr or he could finish outside the top jordy is my personal favorite of the group as i think he has a great floor along with the highest ceiling weve already seen jordy finish as the twice in his last healthy seasons and everybody saw the packers offensive struggles without him last year as long as all the news remains positive im not concerned at all about his knee as weve seen many players come back just fine from acl tears and i also dont think his age is a major concern as plenty of elite wrs have continued to perform into their early aj green is primed for another big year as the bengals now need to replace targets with jones and sanu gone and i expect green to be very close to his totals when he received targets and parlayed that into catches for yards and tds my concern with green is that its possible that dalton was overachieving last year and that hue played a big part in the bengals offensive success if they would return to being an average offense green may not reach the ceilings that the other guys on this list have but he does feel very safe jeffery is easily the guy that im the lowest on this year when healthy hes a phenomenal player but that was a major issue for him last year i dont mind as much when a guy suffers a freak injury like an acl tear or collarbone break but those nagging injuries that keep building up are the types of injuries that can return year after year i know a lot of jeffery owners were driven crazy by his constant gtd designations last year no matter how well he played when he actually suited up i need guys i can count on early in the draft and i want to see jeffery have a healthy year after those recurring injuries last year before i take him with my pick i dont think his ceiling is really any different than anyone else on this list but he feels like the least safe its also slightly concerning that gase who is a great oc is no longer with them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have aj as my player overall in ppr week to week hes boom or bust but every year he is basically a lock for catches yards and tds and with them losing sanu and jones he could have his best season yet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj first he could be in for more than his usual big load no more jones for andy to incomprehensibly throw bombs that whiff times a game when aj is the deep threat jordy next pretend its for him lacy cobb and arod dez next but i am not happy about it dissapears if tony gets hurt and is a crybaby heartless prick jeffrey is a baller he will prob out score all these guys if he stays healthy cutler has his best year my prediction white healthy and royal back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why is no one talking about arob dude has a trigger happy qb and went last year albeit some of those tds were awarded during garbage time i say hes going to go given that they have a more balanced offense and better defense aj mr consistent jordy mr rodgers but coming off acl tear and arob baller dez dependent on romo injury prone jeffrey dependent on cutlet no run game injury prone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj dez alshon jordy imo hell i would even have arob above jordy maybe equal with alshon i would also have mike evans and keenan allen above jordy but they arent going until the early
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think jordy will be a top wr on par with beckham and julio green bay when healthy is the best offense in the league and hopefully now that lacy lost some weight he will be similar to his old self when lacy plays well the whole offense does rodgers connection with jordy is fucking psychic and i think they will pick up right where they left off i think jordy is a solid late first roundearly second round pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i will never ever touch alshon jeffrey again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not sure if the too many mouths will affect jordy i think him coming back helps out everyone in that offense and jordy is always going to get his randall cobb caught balls for yards and tds in the best year of nelsons career if theres any offense around the league that can support elite receiving options its the packers under rodgers i honestly think the only way he comes close to disappointing is if he if he just cant be the same guy after injury but weve seen so many players come back from acl tears and perform with no drop off that im not that worried also isnt really an age of concern for me when it comes to wrs many elite wrs continue to perform at high levels into their early and sometimes even their
fantasyfootball,not_removed,targets to make up for in that bengals offense and green has already never had less than yards in a season and has scored tds in of his seasons i do think the bengals offense may regress though as i think hue played a big part and dalton may have been overachieving at times not to mention the fact that theyre replacing their and and possibly need to replace eifert for a number of weeks i think its pretty tough to rank dez aj and jordy right now since theyre all so close but my personal favorite is still jordy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree he is consistent but so is jordy when he plays last years with games he has almost identical numbers to beckham
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so youre saying dez was adezaster
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in terms of arob i saw some crazy stats about bortles that makes me think the step back might be more likely down to i forgot all the specific stats but the general idea was not only did bortles lead the league in garbage time passing and tds but also in red zone pass attempts and touchdowns i think having someone who can score fromthe with attempts this year will change the offense quite a bit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in jordys last healthy seasons hes been the and why so low on him the packers offense looked almost completely lost without him last season and he seems to be on track after his injury im not sure if theres a better deep threat in the game and i absolutely believe that packers offense will rebound in a big way in large part because of nelson mike evans is in a worse offense has a worse qb and scored all of tds last year while badly struggling with drops alshon jeffery battled nagging injuries all of last year and in my opinion thats much more worrisome than a freak acl tear the bears also lost gase who i think was a big part of their offensive success
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj dez jordy jeffery in that order i dont think white and jeffery will compliment each other like jordy cobb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,alshon was hurt last year but barely missed any games before that and put up good numbers avoid him at your own risk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chris ivory can score both receiving and rushing tds in the redzone and this is going to pull from the tds going to the wrs in my opinion i expect a regression from both bb passing tds as well as receiving tds for hurns and arob
fantasyfootball,not_removed,alshon watch was admittedly painful i might still sign up for alshons wild ride this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes also been the and the past times hes played games the packers offense will almost certainly be better than the bengals offense this year and weve seen many players come from their first acl tear with very little to no side effects isnt even that old for an elite wr to be honest randy moss caught tds at age im not saying jordy is a no brainer pick over green but i absolutely think there is a legitimate argument to be made that jordy should be going right beside aj if not in front of him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how many year old players have come back from torn acls with little to no effect im genuinely asking because off of the top of my head i cant think of any and theres a pretty big difference between a guy in his earlymidtwenties and a year old
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crabtree will be drafted as a and finish as at least a i guarantee it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i definitely think all but tyreek will belong in the top i think rishard will be a beast he can run the entire route tree he runs intermediate routes and a ton of deep routes taking the tops off of defenses he started the season off slow because he was forced to split time with andre johnsonhe retired week yea its a run first offense but he is the receiver who reaps the benefits
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes to michael thomas although i might be the only one who is a little concerned with brees turning yes to devante adams i watched him play and he isnt a fluke gb is still going to be a pass first team no matter what with jordy nelson getting older i see adams continuing to get targets especially with jordy drawing the top corners
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thomas and adams have the best fantasy outlook for next year crabtree will be a suitable hill and matthews will be flex level options all are draftable of course
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think in the offseason the chiefs will work to make tyreek a feature in the offense he is their best player on that side of the ball but was only playing of the snaps even after his breakout i feel like with maclins talent fading tyreek will be treated as a legit wr and not just a gadget play threat
fantasyfootball,not_removed,davante adams top rodgers raw talent michael thomas yes physical athletic wr on a stacked offense being lead by one of the greatest qbs of all time michael crabtree top more of a bold prediction i see cooper getting more involved tyreek hill yes speed kills he really does it all rishard matthews yes towards the half way point of the season that offense looked liked it clicked
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thomas yes no to the others
fantasyfootball,not_removed,absolutely pick of thomas in the draft if you can get him at a worthwhile point tyreek hill is also a very good pick specifically if you play in returning yard leagues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in the order youve listed them davante formerly known as brick hands adams suddenly learned to catch and is now the red zone target for aaron rogers behind jordy nelson i would take him in the round or later if hes still there in a team draft basically replace cobb from this years draft with adams michael rookie of the year thomas round for sure i expect more out of him next year than he got this year as hes still learning the nfl style more snaps more targets more tds and even more skill michael crabtree same as he ever was i think his ranking is a bit fluky due to high tds but oakland isnt showing me much in terms of wr depth after cooper and crabtree so if carr is still throwing the ball next year crabman should be a fine draft round tyreek hill if your league gives you return yards he should go in the first round he was the wr overall in my return yardage league behind only jordy and julio i expect his usage to increase as it did throughout the season and more designed plays specifically to get the ball in his hands without return yards id take him in the late or early round while i expect his performance to increase hes not on a passhappy team like michael thomas is so his opportunities are capped by gameplan rishard matthews im not a fan here he doesnt look as explosive or talented as these other players and i think the tds were fluky id expect regression while id guess hell still adp around the round i would not take him before the personally
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tyreek could be big
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if im ranking them thomas matthews adams crabtree hill reason being that thomas for me is a great wr he offers you the ability to go off if the saints are on fire but he also gets a solid amount of targets that mean he has a relative safe floor and you know the saints are pass heavy matthews at the moment is going to see alot of the passing yards in the offence sure it might be a run first offence but that is the best friend for the pass i would expect to see more yards less tds not sure if those are going to even out adams has played great this year but you have to combine that with cobb not performing with jordy cobb and adams to feed i think he will get some action and really im putting him here because of arod and also cobb jordy will miss time to injury being ineffective i love crabtree especially given where he will go in the draft rz target for carr and will get alot of yards too only thing that worries me is the age and if carr is going to be back to how he was hill i struggle here yes he was great to watch but he really scored his points on those gadget plays where he gets the ball in the backfield and then just runs and runs till he scores for me his ranking is dependent on scoring tds on big plays which he might but for me i see defences adjusting to seeing him in the backfield and he really stops getting those big plays
fantasyfootball,not_removed,imo here is how id view it which puts only thomas in the convo unless the t folks all drop out of consideration brown evans julio odb ajg nelson cooper baldwin dez hilton cooks thomas edelman consistent floor will keep him in convo dt did enough this year to end up in this tier imo t injuryfabust hard to tell where they will land hopkins arob jeffery watkins adams hill r matthews crabtree k allen t gabriel landry t williams k benjamin pryor moncrief sanders fitz if he comes back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,love me some thomas as a round keeper next year edit shit matthews too could be a for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt count on tyreek and rishard for next season but the first three guys you mentioned will definitely belong in talk next season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all guys i like davante is poised to become the number in green bay maybe not quite this year but it is going to be a type deal with him and jordy the guy has all the tools hes got the qb he could be alshon jeffrey he just needs to stay healthy that was his main issue last year and the drops were from him being in his own head questioning his physical tools from being injured
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes great for that got him in the in two leagues this season and put up some solid games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its the age people get nervous that a small injury can mean he is taken out of action for a long time i love crabtree especially with the capital you have to give up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,okay so your top is then brown evans julio odb ajg nelson cooper baldwin dez m thomas d adams r matthews crabtree with the last spots going to some combo of hilton cooks dt edelman hopkins arob watkins jeffery interesting list haha yes wr is that deep
fantasyfootball,not_removed,completely agree with everything you said my only real fear re rishard is if the titans go for a wr like alshon in free agency the titans have tons of cap room and could easily throw down a big contract for a bigname receiver that said imo titans should be spending their picks and cap space all on defense as that is the chief issue holding them back as a franchise basically the only thing holding them back at this point rishards tds might regress next year basically one td per game played as a starter was always going to be tough to match even if he is a total stud in the rz but down the stretch he showed his prowess as you said running the whole tree and racking up yards up and down the field assuming some td regression but also better yardage due to more games played as the starting i could definitely see him as a highend next year in the range with room for upside if mariota picks up directly from last year and the td train continues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont agree about tyreek he was a boomorbust player but thats because he was on for about snaps a game i think his snap count will only go up read this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im definitely not concerned with a yo brees when a yo brees put up at least pts almost every game all season long for me and had a pt ceiling in good matchups at home mans a beast
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes to devante adams i watched him play and he isnt a fluke gb is still going to be a pass first team no matter what with jordy nelson getting older i see adams continuing to get targets especially with jordy drawing the top corners i dont know if i buy this he has had some serious drops this year i think volume has definitely saved him this year and even then it was a few big games not really a guy you can count on week to week i feel like cobb stepped up big in the playoffs and jordy found his groove too i think they are both better and most importantly more consistent than adams i think they dont chuck as much next year either id rather take cobb than adams next year personally
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i fully agree with you hes one of the most explosive players in the game and shifty as hell the chiefs showed at the end of the season that they were already designing plays for hill mostly endarounds and jet sweeps but hopefully they get him more involved in the overall passing game next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pretty much feel that thomas is the only surefire bet as well adams is the one who i go back and forth on the most
fantasyfootball,not_removed,any guesses on thomas adp round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kc doesnt go for big plays enough that it makes me worried if defenses scheme for hill he could have some terrible weeks so i wont take him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pretty much agree though i think youre underrating hilton moncrief takes tds but hilton still racks up yards i would switch him with baldwin i think edelman is also a bit risky in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id put ajg in for consistency reasons
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hilton watkins and keenan allen are in the top rishard matthews is out imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pls take cooper way ahead of crabtree ill wait not much will change this season from last both will only finish about spots apart
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keenan allen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hopefully the titans are smart and use that money to add some building blocks like dlinemen etc the offense doesnt seem to be a problem and spending big on alshon would be a really dumb gamble
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed free agency and that high draft pick they have may change our opinion come training camp lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea i agree but he literally has to hit that wall eventually over the next few years and there may be no warning of it until it is too late
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jordy had his groove all season he lead the nfl in tds and was top in fantasy amongst wrs depending on scoring davante definitely benefited from cobbs injury but wasnt reliant on it as a fan who watched every game i am really excited about how much rodgers trusts adams and his potential moving forward the number of options rodgers has with nelson cobb montgomery cook and even allison looking good is the only thing that scares me i still think davante gets the look on most plays and has the highest ceiling amongst packers receivers outside of nelson i would draft adams a little bit ahead of cobb next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drops are a big issue with adams but he is a fucking beast probably the most athletic wide receiver in the nfl rodgers is going to throw about touchdowns next year and i expect adams to catch about of them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cobb was garbage this year i held on to him all year waiting for him to get worthy of a start and he never did
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes an enigma he makes the toughest catches look easy and drops the easy surefire tds its like a case of the wr yips or something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,his inconsistency scares me however his production when he plays well is that of a low end
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id think most people would be okay taking him midlate in the round getting him in the round would be really nice and id be extremely happy with it as always however make sure to not tunnelvision into picking one player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,idk what yall are thinking here and would appreciate some explanation i love thomas game and owned him all year i would never draft this guy in the round whether hes more talented or not hes playing the colston role even in brees prime i wouldnt take inconsistent colston production in the especially when many of his weeks were very tddependent he may not even be the in a receiving corp next year he screams late to me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beginning of late would be my guess atm
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i can see him maybe going as early as round but if he does i will not be taking him if he falls the tho he would peak my interest no doubt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,again as mentioned edelman is consistent thats the only reason hes in the debate i probably do underrate hilton i never trust him enough to draft i do think adams is at the top of the list by the way and i wouldnt blame anyone for taking him as in the draft as a safer option than the tier guys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,his target share is very high though him and nelson are like really
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i like keenan myself but most people i talk to are super down on him hopefully it stays that way
fantasyfootball,not_removed,true but i feel like hes got at least another good season before we start to see any kind of dive
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably the most athletic wide receiver in the nfl what i dont think you are watching the same nfl games i am
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cobb had a variety of injuries this year i think expecting more of the stat line is acceptable going forward
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he was which is why i think he will be a better value pick next year he looked good in the playoffs and rodgers and him have good chemistry when healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its why i worry about rodgers trust in him he wont not pass to adams but i think it contributes to him being such a boom or bust wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as soon as rodgers picked up his play davantes numbers were right up there any inconsistency he showed in were normal everyone will put up some single point efforts i felt confident every week that he was going to put up points any given week and was right most of the time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that makes him a surefire top wr i would take any of these guys over him would you not ab julio obj ajg evans nelson hilton dez cooper dt baldwin edelman landry probably allen hopkins watkins diggs and arob but thats because im expecting a regression in tds to
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes an option for me as a keeper thats why i ask im leaning him due to his low round cost as i grabbed him off waivers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with you in the sense that he could be an inconsistent guy who could be drafted too early but if his adp is late enough he could be great of anyone else he could have a huge sophomore grab em season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id take him anywhere in the i think
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id rather take nelson or dez above him edit spelling
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think you realize how athletic he is im not saying hes the best wide receiver but he plays with a hall of fame quarterback in a pass heavy offense he is going to be great next year imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would take thomas before dt baldwin edelman allen landry hopkins watkins diggs and arob
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id take him above arob dt baldwin edelman landry hopkins watkins diggs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,depends on factors like what round pick youre giving up how many other keepers do you have and what are your other options
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he is professional athlete im glad he can dunk but the difference is i dont see him making between the legs football tds he looks very average even in the yard multiple td games i mean he makes the catches but id kind of expect most nfl wrs to make those catches ive never looked at him and thought man that guys is just dominating its usually more of wow rodgers threw a great pass and adams was wide open sad part is sometimes he drops those too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dt baldwin edelman allen landry hopkins watkins diggs and arob if houston does something smart at qb hopkins could bounce back big
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keeper out of keenan allen cj anderson thomas and watkins ppr theyre all round keeps due to weirdness in this first year of a keeper
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what smart thing draft class is bad and there arent likely to be any worthwhile free agents i dont believe in osweiler or savage
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cja and keenan allen have highest ceilings but ol and injury risk makes thomas the best expected value on your list imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,after thinking i got a huuge steal with keenan allen at man this past year ive set my keenan expectations back for the future i think being in la will just somehow make the chargers worst and phillip rivers is actually getting older now beneliphil honestly all had poor years if hes keenan the receiver obviously he has huge value but i think tyrellhenrygordongatesifhealthy emerged enough to decrease allens value it entirely depends where kennans adp could be for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you can still loosely use the budget values just convert to percentages multiply percentage by and youll get a value that matches your leagues salary budget example antonio brown is a value in a salary cap league thats of a salary cap league budget multiply by and antonio browns recommended value in a league is again this is a loose calculation there are variables like roster size and league size that can shift those values also check out rdynastyff
fantasyfootball,not_removed,given y solve for x good luck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,multiply budget values by multiply budget values by easy peasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this belongs in the wdis thread

fantasyfootball,not_removed,harold and kumar scene with freak show immediately came to mind
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did someone say terrelle pryor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr league espn keepers no other rules players i am going to keep qb aaron rodgers jordan howard jordy nelson players in consideration for the last spots rb robert kelly rb dion lewis rb giovanni bernard ir wrrb ty montgomery te zach ertz wr stefon diggs wr tyrell williams
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team standard league keepers players i am going to keep ben roethlisberger unless he retires lesean mccoy greg olsen players in consideration for the last spots sterling shepherd martavis bryant michael crabtree mark ingram thinking i should keep shepherd and crabtree i have mccoy already for rb and i have the pick in the draft guaranteed so im hoping to end up with alvin kamara dalvin cook or donta formean
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think kelly is a must dion lewis seems like a good gamble ne rb are often inconsistent belitricks and all but lewis is something special ne committed to the run more this year and blount might be gone id pass on gio montgomery is likely my other pick its a high risk high upside pick but i think he is the rb for gb moving forward no on ertz he showed flashes but not worth it over your other options diggs and williams both have promise but i think its easier to find wr of that caliber than rb so id rather load up on the rb depth and see who pans out while drafting wr early
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kelley lewis and montgomery or diggs depending on how the offseason shakes out there is no situation i would consider keeping ertz
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would keep ingram and crabtree over olsen and roethlesberger i would keep olsen over roethlesberger and depending on how the offseason goes would very likely keep bryant over him as well given that list my would be mccoy ingram crabtree olsen bryant
fantasyfootball,not_removed,those were the three i was leaning towards keeping but i was strongly considering ertz as well due to his late season surge after injury he seemed to really find a groove with wents and i was hoping it might continue into next season a good te that can get you points is hard to come by and he was i think ranked in our league at te i was considering keeping montgomery over lewis based on the fact i have no idea if lewis will get more touches next year because he was injured most of this past season i really just want to be able to field solid rb depth because i went through peterson simms charles and bernard before i made the series of trades and waiver claims to get the stable i have now and its a pretty decent stable with tremendous upside
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i can get behind keeping ertz as i know how tough te can be and he really was coming alive at the end of the year he was my te too after being burned at te plenty i just have accepted im going to draft one late and make due so i wouldnt keep a te outside the top tier ones which i dont think he is quite yet but could be montgomery and lewis are both tough calls they both have huge upside but for one reason or another go with your gut though as it is your team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks for the help i might end up just stocking up the rbs and making a trade before the season because they are great bargaining chips
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well he did have his best go when he was playing under gase in denver albeit he had peyton throwing to him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,back with gase and having a solid qb he could be a good pick up next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no he can be orange julius and teal julius
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn dolphins have so many playmakers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a dolphin fan thomas should be a nice little late round pick up in gases offense where he absolutely loves to utilize the tight end and with tannehill getting better and better thomas could thrive big if but if thomas stays healthy he has upside for sure
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dolphins where broncos offensive players swing by after their careers in denver
fantasyfootball,not_removed,stealth impact of this ajayi should be downgraded jt is atrocious at run blocking take it from a broncos fan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think this is a great spot for him the dolphins offense looked really good last year even though they seemingly lacked a red zone threat in the passing game correct me if im wrong here so it appears julius could be back to the td machine he was in denver
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good news for hurns and lee
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all i care about is how well will thomas block for ajayi
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wonder how this will affect landry jt was better at the seam routes in denver but a receiving te could hurt a possession wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill pass for every game he plays its hes out with an injury hes breaking down if not broken down already
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is jordan cameron done or at least done in miami
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i hope he has a good retirement
fantasyfootball,not_removed,year of the dolphin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can you super bowl bound
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think the impact on fantasy for this move if it happens has a bit of a wide impact youve now got another mouth to feed on offense which may effect the draft value of landry who is liked because of the sheer volume that he gets the running game im not sure on i could see it go either way youve got jt who cant really block too well so could fall apart or could mean lbs have to give him space on the edge incase he beats them past the edge on passing downs well what the d thinks is a passing down i think who im most positive on is ryan tannehill second year in gases system new te maybe a bit of a running game im thinking im gunna pick him up late and then hold for matchups
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well i guess it can only get better right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who dudes nobody without peyton
fantasyfootball,not_removed,with tannehill still under center this does little for his value dude cant stay healthy either
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he want stay any more healthy in miami lucky to play games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,neither are close to payton but it seems like tannehill is an upgrade on bortles at least for the te position even if bortles bounces back to seems like the downfield wrs will benefit more unless that offense changes drastically under the new regime assuming bortles even starts i love way to early speculation but thomas in miami could end up being a sexy round pick or a hype train could run out of control and some idiot will draft him in the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,clay had a pretty season with tannehill so id take a flyer on julius given his adp but im not expecting too much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they were in need of a te if they stay healthy it could be quite a year for the old porpoises
fantasyfootball,not_removed,uh besides thomas who else is there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but while ajayis blockers did good work for him at times they could have done better according to analysis from kc joyner of espncom ajayi last season finished fourth in rushing with yards and seventh in average at per carry but joyner tells us ajayi received good blocking on only percent of his carries which was among qualifying running backs — meaning running backs got better blocking that ajayi did ajayi averaged yards when he had good blocking he averaged just when he had bad blocking slightly above the league average not like ajayi had the best line in the league to start but i agree the addition of thomas isnt likely to help the running game they also need guards and a healthy pouncey without some talent on the line i think ajayis numbers will drop next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,blocking is only half the math lbs that fear getting beat will back off the line
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you mean peyton payton is the saints coach
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he is done
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seems pretty early no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with everything you say except for draft position everyone sleeps on the dolphins i could easily see both tes going undrafted
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think if you reach for him it will be in the or adp probably settles into the late round leading up to draft day
fantasyfootball,not_removed,round pick maybe in a team league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,problem is orange julius has his own injury problems
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is jordan cameron retired probably should if not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brandon marshall for a couple seasons and knowshon moreno for one but thats all i can think of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,marshall moreno
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the flirted with cja last offseason as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i really really wish that was how it worked ive never seen one player so completely destroy run success rate like jt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes not fast enough to scare anymore either take it from another broncos fan hes not the same player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah im thinking like round in a teamer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hopefully but im in a keeper league so things get weird with qb and te because nobody tends to use keepers on them if the hype train stays on a semisane track hell probably be ranked as te somewhere which in a rational ten team draft would probably be at least an round pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think he has severe concussion symptoms
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brian greise
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sounds like a shitty comedy central show about a black guy and a mexican
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont worry none of our run success is from blocking anyway its all ajayi
fantasyfootball,not_removed,considering teams rarely take two tight ends i think thats pretty safe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theres a hype train
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there is no hype train my dude
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would watch it does it come on after black and decker decker and d thomass nickname for their receiving tandem their idea
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there is a thread for this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,vikings defense to get points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,first monday night all season that i had no stress at all feels good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need vikings d to score one more point than kyle rudolph to tie two more points to win
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need an extra person in my lineup to score points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need points from matt asiata
fantasyfootball,not_removed,down by points in standard i have vikings defense they have jordan howard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for bradford to get less than points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,up by in against zach miller
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need diggs to score or less in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,from another thread less than points from diggs and my friend doesnt wake up until tomorrow night mid game to put a kicker in his line up sad thing is he really might not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,vikings d
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need alshon jeffery to score points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,vikings defense to score or more points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cordarelle outscores alshon by
fantasyfootball,not_removed,alshon scores less than points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for vikings dst and asiata to combine for points in standard hoping cutler pulls it off for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im up points and he has asiata and rudolph tomorrow im safe right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need diggs to get approximately points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need the vikings d to outscore kyle rudolph by atleast points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,vikings d to outscore chicago d by points easy ive won
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need out of zach miller in ppr not impossible but highly unlikely vs minnehaahaas d a loss puts me in a way tie for second in my team league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he has alshon and i have thielen team odell on bye lost keenan allen im already down points and we have ppr with point bonus for catches and every yards basically i need alshon to get concussed and thielen to have a career game on to next week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,down by with vikings d diggs and carey left to play my opponent is done is it possible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theres a monday night miracle thread posted every week for this exact reason
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey i need diggs to score less than so im cool with rudolph going off if it keeps diggs quiet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats it called
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need and some of it needs to come from a fumble by howard on his first carry of the game and a touchdown from the recovery and then the bears kill howard in a ritualistic sacrifice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,never start a wr whos questionable for mnf unless you have his cuff yikes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not too bad a chance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,official monday night miracle thread
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id drop him for theilen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that would be a one game fix but if hes available id do it too im flexing him tonight actually
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that last second cordarelle screen pass just saved me from low score of the week sick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hahahahahahahahahahahahahahhhah
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wat
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol hasnt even scored a td
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ty montgomery is going to rush for touchdowns
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tydainian tomgomery
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id drop agholor for diggs sharpe dorsett and maybe fuller but i think dorsett will have a decent year ty and moncrief will both demand constant coverage if they play dorsett out of the slot i can see him getting a lot of dump offs so they can rely on frank gore more for his running and blocking as a realistic estimate i can see dorsett getting yards and tds this year agholor id say like tds yards diggs id put above all of those guys normally but with the news of bridge water i dont think hell be getting the yards i was expecting sharpe is an interesting prospect i just think his td number will be very low its a tough choice but anyone but agholor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,with moncrief and ty ahead of him and the shitty colts oline id say no maybe diggs idk how hell be without teddy though i know a lot of people are high on fuller too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wr sets is base package and ty has injury history
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i hope you own booker because anderson will not be the starter by week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what exactly are you basing this off of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,history of cj anderson failing to carry the load as a bellcow elway recently said that they had a second round grade on booker booker was graded as the second best running back in the draft behind elliot pro football focus compared his game to arian foster who became in elite running back in kubiaks zone blocking scheme kubiak is now the head coach of broncos and drafted booker but did not draft cj anderson booker is also known for his good receiving skills which should give him a role out the gate and he could become a safety blanket for an inexperienced qb on a team that will probably be playing from behind a lot you should pick him up if he is on waivers just to be safe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,denver also just signed anderson to a yr mil contract with a mil bonus i dont think theyre looking to give him a backseat to a rookie at best i can see booker getting snaps to give cj a rest and may vulture a few goal line tds however i do agree its smart to stash booker in case cj goes down which isnt impossible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well they drafted booker after the cj anderson signing his contract is also extremely front loaded so they are not as tied to him as you think
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tyreek hill or diggs both cost about the same we get keepers my other being jordan howard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in a team ppr and all are the same price e decker cam meredith martavius bryant
fantasyfootball,not_removed,came here to help recovering from surgery and bed ridden but ill thow out my situation to get some good input from all of you my league is teams five keepers point pprhere is my roster antonio brown no brainer demaryius thomas spencer ware paul perkins kenneth dixon mark ingram ty montgomery davonte booker hunter henry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my keepers come from the round they were drafted in so if you draft a guy in the you lose your the following year then etc waiver pick ups cost you an diggs was a rd pick so id lose a both hill and howard were waiver pick ups for me so id lose my and rd picks this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,• man league •no ppr •maximum of two keepers minimum of zero •whatever round you drafted the player you take them the round before lamar miller round demaryius thomas round cj anderson round ryan mathews round michael crabtree round travis kelce round giovani bernard round sterling shepard round derek carr round thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,trade emmitt smith and keep joe montana edit why am i getting downvoted for making a joke football season is over fantasy is months away
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hill better upside his adp is also higher so you have a good shot of getting diggs back in the draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hill also take into consideration diggs cant stay healthy and wasnt very good at less than
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what does it cost you to keep them hill is going late in current mocks which makes sense for where he finished if you expect he can duplicate that next year if you want diggs hes going in the right now you can probably just draft him there if youre paying round for your keepers i wouldnt keep hill nor diggs and would only keep howard if youre going late in the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,too early to say decker is a free agent merediths role is unclear a jefferyk white and bryant is coming back off a suspension this is an instance where you need to see how camp and preseason shake out if possible if forced to make a decision today decker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for my money id go bryant he is a freak of nature and has put on serious muscle during his suspension he didnt get by on stellar routes rather his athleticism which hes improved so i wouldnt worry too much on him being removed from the game i can see him being a high with low wr upside
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if all reports are accurate and alshon jeffrey is no longer with the bears cam meredith will be your guy he had top ten scoring weeks in and will be the wr in chicago i would then go bryant then decker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,meredith and bryant
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brown thomas ingram are the top options and definite keeps imo ware perkins and dixon will probably fill out your last two spots going to depend on offseason movement any one of the teams could bring in serious competition for those rb which would drop the player value montgomery booker and henry dont make the cut for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id keep hill and howard no doubt great value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in order kelce crabtree shepard carr i might even flip crabtreeshepard because of the difference in cost
fantasyfootball,not_removed,depending on what season you are watching replays of to play ff id go emmitt most likely
fantasyfootball,not_removed,will be the wr in chicago impossible to say with any certainty meredith was undrafted and entered the year low on the bears depth chart he was forced into playing time because of injuriessuspension white royal jeffery while jeffery isnt likely to be back white will be returning from injury and the bears will add wr through free agency andor the draft meredith has upside but by no means is a surefire option you mention his top games he also had weeks scoring points or fewer his adp is also the lowest of ops options by far so selecting him as a keeper gets absolutely no return meredith can be acquired in the draft very easily
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks buddy exactly my thoughts my hope is a couple of those guys will hold a little trade value right before the draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you may i ask why you think shepard is more valuable than somebody like gio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah qb is deep and emmitt is a once in a generation type player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,btw i hate you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,should i bench george blanda
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i guess it depends on the keeper cost if it costs him a mid to late round pick to keep him then to me hes worth it im not nearly as high on white as most people are even before the injuries i worried he was a torrey smith mike wallace go deep only route runner i could be wrong on this those subpar weeks are disconcerting for sure but for someone who is likely going to be chosen in rounds in redrafts that is pretty awesome upside
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have no use for a gio bernard or a theo riddick type player in a non ppr league those guys are just headaches not consistent weektoweek starters and their upside really is capped simply not the type of player i want i think shepard has a chance to be a legit fantasy this season i would much rather have him on my roster
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he specifically said all are the same price it doesnt matter if its a high pick or low pick the fact that merediths adp is significantly lower than the other two rules him out completely there is no reason he would be the keeper selection
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i missed the all the same price bit i disagree about the price not mattering some keeper leagues make you give up your first pick if you keep a guy that said i still like meredith pittsburghs getting crowded with brown coates rodgers green bell and bryant in the passing game while decker was out robby anderson and quincy enunwa put together some nice games in chicago even if they add a wr in the draft and fa meredith still has a leg up in the offense and its unlikely theyll add a name that will be substantial enough to minimize merediths role imho
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so if op had to give up his round pick youd suggest keeping meredith your initial reply didnt say anything about well it depends on the cost you simply endorsed meredith you can praise the player as much as youd like meredith has upside this is a strategy decision not a talent decision there is no scenario where today he is the right pick at any cost there are two players with significantly higher adps which makes them the correct keeper option right now op can keep decker or bryant then acquire meredith cheaply in the draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats not what i meant obviously i wouldnt rec giving up anything beyond a mid round pick for him my bad for the misunderstanding there adps are important but dont tell the whole story especially in february i appreciate your opinion on it for sure and have enjoyed the discussion weve had so far here you may be right time will tell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the adp is average draft position not position they get drafted in each league but average take it into account a then adjust it accordingly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i understand that but how significantly would you say it improves their position
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats crazy to me is that he had total yards and tds through the first weeks of the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,forte pass catching back with down ability powell pass catching back with down ability apparently forte powell career lows for forte
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had forte allen robinson and deandre hopkins on my money fantasy team this season did not go well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,had him as one of my keepers going into the draft this year swapped him for a overall and a on draft day i used that on demarco murray couldnt have worked out better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but is that a career low for him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,even as a jets fan and forte owner this year he really wouldve been better off as a third down back to bilal taking the majority of rushing snaps the mismanagement of talent this year on this team really was astounding
fantasyfootball,not_removed,poor forte came to the jets expecting to be apart of a winning team and what a failure we were gailey is to blame on forte having career lowsthe other is on the horrific line we had running him only up the middle and rarely using him as a receiving back were total misuses looking back it makes no sense why they even brought him on if they werent going to use him to his strengths
fantasyfootball,not_removed,which he had on a career high carries
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i traded forte times this season even though it was a down year good on you matt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,high careerlow
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nynj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hofer or ill eat my hat
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this forte kid is pretty good i bet he has a good career
fantasyfootball,not_removed,does anyone know where that ranks in his career
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats this do for powell next year good keeper option does he take the starting job
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats because hes been one of the best backs in the league sincehe showed up undervalued underappreciated and then sent away by a farce of an organization disgruntled bears fan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im starting a man keeper next year with next year being a fresh redraft you think targeting him for a potential keeper would be a good idea or do you think he is getting too old
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats just likeyour opinion man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he also had touches through those first two weeks including thirty carries on tnf in week his weeks where he scored over in standard came with carries carries and carries could be that running him that much is what lead to him slowing down and getting injured late in the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had the choice of keeping forte or freeman i didnt trust the jets so i kept freeman those first few weeks i was so mad at my decision then it got better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and whats annoying as shit to me is that i traded jordy for him after those two weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah they didnt really use him as a pass catching back how couldnt they see that running him up the middle every time wasnt nearly as effective
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they are both down backs but the jets rarely ever used forte as a passing back which is retarded along with only running him up the middle of the time made no sense to me why they even brought forte onto the team when powell could do everything and is younger
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so are you saying theyre both three down backs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i did too lost in the first round of the playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how many keepers cause demarco wasnt going near the first in most drafts iirc
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its a career high low
fantasyfootball,not_removed,holy shit in my league we are lucky if one trade gets executed every year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how in the world
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it is a high career low some career lows could be in the tens due to injuries early on in the year forte is a beast
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no way does forte make the hall of fame hes httpwwwprofootballreferencecomleadersrushydscareerhtm in rushing thats good but the hofers who have fewer rushing yards than him mostly played a long time ago forte also only played in playoff games and never had rushing tds in a season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes almost done with his career
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the highest point of his lowest
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you forgot an uh in there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with you but no coach or running back would have wanted to pull back on the workload with that kind of production
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they clearly didnt want to waste fitzpatricks amazing throwing abilities with dumpoffs to the rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,spread the word to end the word
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a bears fan who watched every nfl game of forte until this season i called this out before the season started and got downvoted to hell forte is only special because he can be used in all phases as a run it up the gut back hes league average or worse
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but about forte its kind of funny a lot of us refused to touch him because of injury concernage and he did eventually get hurt but as a round pick he actually did pretty solid work for almost the whole season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keepers each teams i was short on rbs coming in and was afraid he would actually go higher than but his performance last year scared people off it was a bit risky but man did it work out well for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just tried typing out all of the deals but its way too complicated listing individual deals haha basically i traded for him in preseason then i packaged him with a bunch of rbs for a package of wrs in week then my rbs went to shit and his wrs went to shit so i traded one of his wrs back to him for forte weeks after that and then i moved forte again week because i needed to cover his bye
fantasyfootball,not_removed,high careerlow is redundant is what im getting at here you can just say career low
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes also one of the best all around backs for the last decade rushing receiving blocking you name it he could do it he shouldnt be penalized just because he was on a lot of losing teams but im biased as a bears fan and huge forte fan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im fairly sure he was being sarcastic
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sure i might do the same if i were bowles its just a concern moving forward
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol he averaged ypc through the first weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not really he was great for or games and horrible for an equal amount in ppr id far prefer riddick over him even though he had less total points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you basically got demarco for a fifth then thats a damn good deal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what the whole point is that his career low is substantially higher than one would expect they are saying he was a superb back for years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the point of the post is to show that even though forte had a career low it is still a very high number
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i watched fortes career too and i agree that forte is a good all around back but there is one thing i can name that he cant do short yardage running his situational numbers in short yardage was terrible fortes receiving and blocking is definitely a plus mark but the number one job for a running back is to carry the ball an offense can throw to wrs and tes but only the running bac can advance the ball on the ground a hall of fame rb needs to be great at running the ball not just good like forte was when yards is a modern era rbs third best season that isnt good enough for the hall
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck jokes on me then
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ypc is more of a offensive lineblocking issue than fantasy issue melvin gordon had a low ypc but had the volume so it didnt matter ypc on runs yards vs packers rb who had ypc and had rushes a game david johnson had ypc against the hawks still put up points in ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed every week i benched him he went off every week i played him he was a dud
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he was great for and average in another cant boom every game the games he was irrelevant were largely the games where jets fell behind big
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think we can imply that ourselves not sure why people need that spelled out for them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it was in the tweet and hes just stating a fact does it go without saying that yards as a career low is a good career low yes does it really matter that he emphasized the point no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i feel like this is a coin flip theyre all able to do ok espn standard just trying to figure out who to go with only points behind in the championship week matchup and im a nervous wreck deangelo williams jerick mckinnon alex collins kenneth dixon mike gillislee jj nelson dontrell inman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr pick i have d williams and f toussaint vs cle dixon cin jj nelson la alfred blue ten tyreek sd or marqise lee ind im leaning tyreek lee and blue but pit has a juicy matchup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr flex pick one ezekiel elliott phi darren mcfadden phi robert kelley vs nyg allen robinson ind
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pick team standard league arob watkins tymo rawls
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr tyrrell williams v kc or ty montgomery det
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i feel like id go deangelo in this situation with bell not playing he should have a decent floor if he does end up getting the bulk of the carries he has potential to go off
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like inman here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like the starting pit rb over lee but agree with the other options
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im going with kelly must win game and the giants are going to rest their starters for at least most of the game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would go with a rob tyrod wont be able to play this week and the chiefs defense is real good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,most of the top lbs start going in the round kuechly l david jj watt historically goes a little bit earlier but last year he wasnt really worth an early pick imo once someone takes kuechly then everyone else starts picking lbs the lb position has a lot of good players this year so i wouldnt worry about having to get the top ones dbs should not be drafted early as the position is too volatile
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jj watt was first defensive player off board in our league in round after that there was about one a round until round thats when we began to see more being taken regularly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,at minimum you want to have all of your starters before you start getting defenders with a man roster id prob carry idp since you are in a team league i dont think that you have to worry about defenders running out so id wait on the defenders so what im saying is grab all your defenders at the very end of the draft maybe grab one lb stud after you have bench guys id make of my last picks idp there are always going to be defenders on free agency there isnt going to be backup rbs on free agency so its better to get the rbwr at the draft i want to also mention kickers since your roster size is so massive dont wait forever on the kicker id snag mine around round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,considering your scoring system and the stats from last season unfortunately i dont have the data to dt and de so i will use dl position here is a comparison from the top dl to the dl and the top lb to lb because its the worst titular in the league the difference from jj watt to geno atkins was points its similar to eric decker to julian edelman points lamar miller to theo riddick points greg olsen to antonio gates points the difference from lavonte david to daryl smith was points its similar to tom brady to philip rivers points jeremy maclin to julian edelman points matt forte to theo riddick points i know the last season was crazy with a lot of injuries to key rbs and i know that the performance on last season isnt the best number to evaluate next season but judging those numbers jj watt had similar value to a and lavonte david had similar value to a and other notable names luke kuechly and muhammad wilkerson points tavon austin benjamin watson and carson palmer navorro bowman and tyrann mathieu points amari cooper darren mcfadden and travis kelce
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you very much this is what i was looking for i was thinking about round for outside the top lbs i feel like and round there will be a run on them everyones pretty new at this i appreciate the feedback
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i appreciate the feedback
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would even wait until the or and target good everydown lbs like kwon alexander eric kendricks jordan hicks i really dont see a point in spending round picks on defensive players as long as you are okay with trying to find the idp waiver wire pickups throughout the season im telling you the lb position is super deep de is not that deep but they dont score enough points outside of watt to justify an early pick either go for a guy thats projected to do well instead of a guy coming off a huge season and use those round picks on rbwr how many rounds will your draft be
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rounds person bench its a keeper rounds leauge
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wish i had a dollar for every thread this mentioned
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a total eclipse of the knee
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wonder how often the acl is only partially torn and if it has any effect on recovery timeline
fantasyfootball,not_removed,have partially torn acl right now doc said i dont need surgery and it would heal itself in weeks doc was full of it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably correct sine they graft the ligament from elsewhere elbow achilles anyway to replace the acl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as someone who has done almost every scoring type im a huge advocate for ppr it makes pass catching backs more relevant without making them overpowered also decimal scoring is a must
fantasyfootball,not_removed,decimal scoring half ppr all touchdowns worth points all turnovers worth points keep the rest of the default scoring system
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its almost preference there is no objectively good scoring system
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my main league uses ppr and per carry which is pretty good ive gotten to where i dont really play without some form of ppr but i prefer or to full
fantasyfootball,not_removed,of course you cant do that at espn
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr a little boost but doesnt give players too much just for catching a ball yard touchdown bonuses decimal scoring
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i keep the scoring pretty standardespn set values in my league as it definitely helps if an argument arises also i poll the entire league before making any kind of change ex most of the guys are completely against ppr so we keep it standard just ask your league mates and determine scoring as a group about a month before the draft i send out a message asking people to suggest possible changes then they get put up for vote its a pretty fair system and allows everyone to have input edit word
fantasyfootball,not_removed,still boggles my mind that so many pundits either talk about ppr or standard ppr is the new standard and has been for quite some time as for decimal scoring i feel like the inclusion of decimal scoring is like an for fantasy football its like hey what do you need for a fantasy football league players teams decimal scoring lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would also add faab to this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also agree all tds should be worth points thats actually on my list of dealbreakers if a td is any number other than points i wont do the league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,while i agree there is no objectively good scoring system there are certainly objectively bad scoring systems and you do not want to use one of those
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drives me crazy that espn doesnt account for it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its kind of shocking how decimal scoring isnt standard yards enjoy your points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,faab is a must also but its not a scoring system
fantasyfootball,not_removed,even for qbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,last year my commish left it completely standard for espn your defense loses you points for yardage and scoring which was absolutely ridiculous make sure you change that up pick one or the other not both
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its a personal thing but i dont like decimal scoring i like nice whole numbers i wish there was a site that let you round up yards being points for example but i just hate looking at decimal scores at the end of game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well it is in yahoo for sure which is the only format ive ever played having never played espn i was absolutely floored when i learned that nondecimal scoring existed and i continue to be floored that it not only exists it is standard in espn
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you for clarifying
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes even for qbs the points for turnovers is a good check against point passing tds becuase qbs turn the ball over more than any other position
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is only one mans opinion but i never understood why a touchdown defined by the nfl as points should award me fewer points if my qb throws it than if my wr catches it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was like that at first but what i dont like even more is a rb with yards to get the same points as an rb with yards it also makes ties less likely
fantasyfootball,not_removed,part of nflcom as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just to try and balance out the scoring an average qb will have tds in a season think about how good a rb would be if they scored tds for you and even with points for a pass td there will still be qbs in the top overall players in a year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not having ties is one reason i dont like it ties happen in football rarely they should happen in fantasy football rarely as well playing with decimals basically make ties never happen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,every team has exactly qb and whether its point pass tds or point pass tds no one takes qbs early where exactly does the imbalance lie to me its a slippery slope once you start adjusting tds for qbs then you have to do it by position should we make a kick return td because thats proportional to how often that occurs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the whole reason the nfl has ot is to try and avoid a tie as much as possible another point is if you have players whos scores end with a is thats fair points youre deprived of a qb who throws for yards and doesnt get credited with it is frustrating certainly everyones entitled to their options but i personally would take fairness and every yard counted over aesthetics especially when you play for money
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agree with everything you said
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you get points for yards from scrimmage catches turnovers sacks etc youre already on the slippery slope
fantasyfootball,not_removed,those are all fair points but playing with decimals seems as unnatural to me as playing with no defense of quarterbacks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its up to your league to set those rules
fantasyfootball,not_removed,usually in espn anyone can still pickup and drop players throughout the playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its reverse of final standings after the whole season for the rest of playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,right but i cant seem to find where those rules are listed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a way to implement this is to set a transaction limit number then manually add or whatever to the teams out of the playoffs this will lock them out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not sure espn league manager leagues their most customizable have those settings so it might just have to be enforced by the commish
fantasyfootball,not_removed,again this is just an index thread please do not use this thread to ask for help go directly to each thread to discuss and ask for help all comments on this thread will be deleted thank you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fantasy football talk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio plays through pain which is a problem in my view hes undoubtedly a maybe the when healthy but he was a rollercoaster this year to own and cost me some pivotal weeks you cant predict injuries but you can discern the attitude of players and look at their injury history julios a guy who might run on a bad ankle for weeks and you start him because you have to but then end up with disappointment id rather have browns consistency and reliability with the knowledge that if hes hurt hell be out not teasing the hell out of me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im still going brown julios career high in td is browns low over the past years theyre both target machines but brown just has more consistency and fewer injury concerns editclarification julios career high is so its browns lowest i think beckham will go ahead of julio next year and in some leagues evans will sneak up there as well picking anywhere in the top should be nice of course someone will bust due to performance or injury
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brown for me but i do love julio brown scored more points in my league this year and i believe has done so in prior years as well hes and im not too worried about aging if shanahan leaves that will also matter a little bit to me as i am conservative with my round picks and thus i dont want any moving parts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a falcons fan and ab owner this past season antonio brown julio is a monster and id vote for him as the best receiver in the league but ab appears injuryproof and is way too consistent from a fantasy perspective
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when hes healthy theres nobody id rather have out there than julio but thats the problem hell have lingering injuries all season hell pop up on injury reports randomly late in the week and he wont always be available to you i had the team wire to wire this season and then julio missed the fantasy playoffs and i was cooked brown is locked in as the wr in football and he has none of these concerns i think youd have to be crazy to draft julio over brown at this point even if julios week to week ceiling is higher
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio gives you the highest predictable ceiling of any wr its not unreasonable to assume julio can throw up on any given week but he can also throw up a dud pretty easily do to playing through injuries ab is less likely to throw up a monster game on any given week but gives you such a solid floor and it pretty much a lock for even on his bad weeks theyre and in my mind and it really depends on what you value and how the rest of the draft can fall pairing julio with a couple solid floor players can go really well as they can cover when julio throws up a dud
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gotta go antonio very little injury concerns also less letdown games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,give me ab julio always puts up a few goose eggs and gets hurt for one or two weeks every year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,browns and evans over julio for me red zone targets injury history sure i could see julio scoring more but i could also see him missing a few weeks and getting a total of tds and finish behind both in scoring
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im still going to watch what happens with martavis bryant guy is a stud when not getting high might affect abs targets slightly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why would you expect julio to get double digit tds if he only has once before and they now have the most balanced offense the falcons have had his entire career giving ryan the option to spread the ball around to whoever is open
fantasyfootball,not_removed,antonio odbjulio greenevans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,antonio dont underestimate the value of kyle shanahan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mike evans in my opinion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go brown all day still tds are there and im not as worried about injury
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill take whichever one comes to me ab first then julio but i wouldnt be disappointment in getting julio at all
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got dem dirty birds call me julio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think its a bigger issue of who they get reports are that if kyle shanahan leaves atl will look to bring in chip kelly who knows what hell do and how hell fuck up that offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for me my league is ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for me julio will always have a little asterisk next to his name that will note that hes likely to miss a game or im taking brown
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chris hogan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,antonio then odb evans jordy aj then julio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,to put things in perspective in our league julio only outscored justin tucker by pts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,idk why you guys sleeping on evans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ab obj julio in that order
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chris hogan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ab obj julio thats my opinion at least julio is a monster sure but i think the pattern of julio being a sky high ceiling and low floor continues that offense doesnt run through him anymore
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in a team standard league i would say itll go bell johnsonzeke johnsonzeke then after the third pick who do you go with risk d murray freeman martin or do you go with a top wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id take ab but more likely a top rb and then get evans and dez or something everyone laughed at me for grabbing evans a little early but it was him or cooper and we know how that played out scoring wise last season the guy is a beast and winston is a gunslinger also dez had a pretty underrated year for the amount of time he was actually healthy and playing i think him and dak showed theyre on the same page now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in my league which gives a small amount of points for returns brown has been the the last three years ill stick with him for another year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,love julio atlanta resident here but matt ryan has way too many hes throwing too and we run the ball quite a bit now as well he just doesnt get enough catches thrown to him to be a fantasy wr overall
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ab has never let me down julio has i go ab without a second thought
fantasyfootball,not_removed,going into next year its still abobjjuliohowever i am a steelers fan however i feel julio evens green hilton etc
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brown julio will get you in a week you only need then and the weeks you need him the most
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theyre both streaky but brown is the guy in terms of fantasy julio is a solid second
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id probably still pick brown over julio based on volume and especially red zone targets but i could definitely see julios red zone production and usage increase next season another viable candidate for could mike evans as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ab
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if were talking first overall it has to be bell or johnson nobody came close to their production then elliott and then the wrs julio ab evans nelson then sprinkle in some gordon freeman murray then you can always expect some sap to pick gronk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,avoid glass bones jones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if martavis returns next year the steelers offense will be obscene and leveon and ab will both benefit you cant guard all three id go with ab if martavis returns
fantasyfootball,not_removed,are we sure shanahan is gone or is that speculation
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brown no doubt julio is the definition of boom or bust
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio has the higher ceiling brown has the higher floor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mike williams
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i know it may be unpopular but i honestly thing dez will improve to a potential first rounder the more he plays with dak having zeke makes this offense really balanced but also opens up the passing game which suits a size style receiver like dez also dez scored tds this year and of them came after their week bye he also had games over and over during that game stretch you could see the trust building between them and if that continues i can see less boombust and higher floors for dez going forward
fantasyfootball,not_removed,still a firm believer is drafting rbs first
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well first off i am not doing wrwrwr again next year cause that worked super well this year for me arobdezwatkins if ab falls to me then i will likely pick him over julio cause that offensive should be significantly better next year with a full year of green and bryant that should help ab get better coverage julio is constantly injured and misses weeks while being a game time decision either way i would rather have a rb in the first
fantasyfootball,not_removed,antonio more consistent and doesnt get hurt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,leveon bell will be the top performer next season on yardsgame he was just second in both rushing and receiving for heavily used rbs rush yards a game and passing yards a game thats points without touchdowns stats aside i still think hes set out to prove to everybody hes the best hes going to have his first full season in seasons which this last season minus games he almost topped his career high steelers just franchised him again if i were him id be a little bit ticked and hes now going into another contract year this next season were about to see a bell with a chip on his shoulder if that aint scary i dont know what is personally i have never gotten into the wr draft heavy ive stayed fairly in the middle since my days of rb heavy drafting im leaning towards more rb heavy drafting for a big reasoning if a star rb is hurt he sits minus shady if a star wr might be hurt he will probably play for decoy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,antonio brown he plays the browns and bengals twice a year already and doesnt get hurt as often if big ben ever stayed healthy we might have had our first receiving yard season ab especially in ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my dumb ass friend traded his and round picks for gurley in our keeper league right after week he ended up last in the league long story short i have the and pick next year and im gonna try to snag em both 😈
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just won my ppr keeper league on the backs of julio and mike evans despite that id trade julio for brown in a heartbeat for all the reasons stated by others here that said i think id rather have evans than either one we havent seen his ceiling yet yeah he gets a ton of targets but him and jameis were both very inefficient this season still room to improve
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mike evans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,between these two id go brown id probably even go beckham over julio mostly due to being a julio owner this year and his bipolar play was the reason i was the highest scoring team in the league and missed the playoffs his yard game was great but his less than yard games screwed me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had julio last year and antonio this year and the bottom line for me is that theres no wrong answer they both have infinitely high ceilings neither will disappoint you in the end barring injury so just go with your own personal preference ive made the playoffs with each of them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brown only because julio is more injury prone julio has that long body that is more seceptible to injury versus brown who is low to the ground and generally avoids big hits down the middle just look at the hits julio absorbed yesterday watching those hits were making me and the atlanta sidelines nervous
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio if he can be wrapped in bubble wrap so brown lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,antonio brown is the most consistent wr to ever grace ffb ill take him all day every day
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio because i dont trust big ben to stay healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,antonio more receptions and tds but it is close
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i admittedly might be a little bias as a steelers fan but i would draft antonio brown first hes a huge focal point of the offense and with bell healthy and martavis bryant returning hopefully itll free him up even more brown has been a model of consistency and excellence for many years julio jones is a close imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio looked like hes played hurt this entire season im going brown
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think id take julio dont think you can go wrong either way and my gut is telling me ab wont have a good of a year cause i feel like big ben will decline a lot next season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,neither how often do receivers not named calvin johnson end up producing consistently after a stellar year id say go w mike evans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,first and foremost i know this is a stupid question but reading all these injury concerns i just need someone to tell me im being dumb in a team ppr julio is a must keep in the round right i got ware in the thats the only reason im considering it theres no way julios value sinks lower than that is there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hogan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im sticking with good ol jordy nelson hes extremely reliable and the reason i won last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im going running back first round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why is everyone focusing on wr like its still we have slowly moved back into the rb era
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its still ab two reasons julio is a ticking time bomb waiting to finally break down and ryan is due for some regression next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,antonio is so consistent and doesnt have he injury concerns that julio does id stick with brown
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but if we are talking about possible first picks shouldnt we be picking meta
fantasyfootball,not_removed,until big ben decides whether hes returning brown is up in the air if big ben decides to hang it up who knows what the qb situation will be
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so well ignore the week season and use the post season as our indicator going forward you assume hell get double digit tds next year although hes done it once we dont know what either line will for sure look like next year but the answer as of now is ab ryan was historically great at spreading the ball around this year and who knows what the oc change brings next season too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i get keepers in my league im keeping both brown and jones won me the league last year got me third this year brown and jones tanked our first week of playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brown over julio hes more consistent and less injury prone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im taking a chance on nuk he can only go up from here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think julio is better in every aspect of the game not by much but still better however atl is getting a new oc no more shanny 😞 so i gotta go with ab
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wes welker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jewelio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio will get you to the playoffs brown will win you the championship definitely not science but i saw this trend in leagues this year definitely going brown over julio if given the option
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio is an injury machine hes had ankle and foot problems since day one in the nfl he has wr potential but i wouldnt take him in first round i know im in a very small minority
fantasyfootball,not_removed,darkhorse opinion follows with all likelihood youre not going to get a top pick and they will both be gone furthermore you dont want that pick id much rather be in a position to pick obj and get a second pick sooner or even later and pick up zeke because everyone is going too hard at wrs now they are both great they are both potential hofers but id prefer not to be in position to put all my eggs in either of them with the health issues that linger in the nfl id rather draft late in the first round and pick up a young guy then a second young guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it must be julio because his team made it to the super bowl and the steelers didnt thus julio is better sorry still upset with the packers game and everyone trashing rodgers thereafter im taking brown over julio though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,even when julios healthy the falcons just have a ton of good players they can use so the ball gets spread around too much to make julio a sure thing i saw a stat a couple weeks ago in one of the games that matt ryan has completed touchdown passes to different players this season which was an nfl record great for the falcons but not so great for fantasy for any one player on their team edit corrected thanks to beefjones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this he cost me the first week of playoffs because he didnt play the game i love the way the guy plays but i still rate antonio over him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as someone that drafted hopkins this year and eddie lacy last year in the first i would take a player that will have good weeks than someone that i have to start wondering if he is going to bounce back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the big thing with julio is he doesnt mind being a decoy just as you said he could be hurt but hell still go out there and run routes all game and net you close to nothing yes hes an amazing player but after this season fantasy wise i dont think i could draft him round ill let other people take him and go for ab
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the falcons were careful with julio this year his numbers are up in the playoffs because they fully utilizing him every time he took a big hit or twisted an ankle he would sit or not get targeted for a while even in the nfc championship he sat for a series after he landed hard after a big catch the offence is good enough to still move the ball without him it worked to keep jj healthy but he put up some dud games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agree julio is the best in the league no question but with those injuries hes so hard to trust id much rather have the consistency of brown although im starting to question how competent the steelers offense is martavis being back will help but with the talent that o should be better than it has been now i might take evans over both of them next year the better winston gets the scarier evans gets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same made me number one in the league then got me knocked out of the playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brown also has the better this is sportscenter commercial
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think evans is sneaking anywhere anymore hes was the top wr in standard this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in some leagues evans will sneak up there as well evans theoretically should be above obj wasnt he like in targets and scored the most in ppr formats not to mention he has a good qb and hes in a passing offense you could argue the steelers are less of a pass friendly offense with bell obj is def in a passing offense but he can have his lows the falcons also have a nice running attack and julio also has random lows
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hijacking top comment falcons are losing their offensive coordinator after this season not sure how much of their success is schemes vs talent but it is something to keep in mind
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julios high is not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont forget in theory martavis bryant should be competing with brown next year theyve never played an entire season together
fantasyfootball,not_removed,picking anywhere in the top should be nice i have the pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i hope the guy before me takes beckham over julio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if shanahan leaves this is a huge blow to the falcons o if he leaves they finally figured it all out and he might leave bold mode cotton
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im with you man ab all day julio is a beast but i highly doubt he was on very many winning rosters this year with his spikes at the end of the year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,honestly im not taking either brown is reliant on big ben who always misses some gabes and julio is too inconsistent id rather have evans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sinner
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree that brown is less injury prone than julio but ben is also more injury prone than matt ryan which you also have to take into account
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if anything it would improve antonios numbers that last game against the patriots antonio was pressed hard in double teams which is why he had a less than normal game with martavus those double teams are lessened as hes a legit threat and at that point the secondary is gambling on who to cover
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in the league i placed i had green and evansit was amazing until green was injured
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cause julio didnt produce without shanahan lol absolutely ridiculous to think kyle is responsible for ryan and julios relationship on the field
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree brown appears to be injury proof but ben is not ab is entirely boom or bust when ben is injured and ben seems to only be held up by duct tape nowadays
fantasyfootball,not_removed,idk why you are getting downvoted its not like you said edelman or keenan allen or other outlandish picks all of them have their positive argument whether its target share ajgodbevans or double digit tds evansjordyodb if you are looking at it from a consistent floor perspective the only questionable wr on that list is ajg the others are too reliable for tds and overall targets to just auto discount them because julio sometimes pops off or point showings while carrying more injury risk than evansodbjordy i would argue that ajg is going to be an injury risk like julio moving forward but he also got targets in each of the games he finished adding up to overall which is huge for a game stretch because he is dealing with soft tissue problems that tend to resurface id suggest he shouldnt be over jones as he is as likely to miss games now but if you really strongly feel he plays all next year and dont think julio can then the numbers say his consistency is worth it edit excluded brown because consensus already is brown julio so no need to beat that dead horse further
fantasyfootball,not_removed,odell deckham br seriously wow i cant be the only one that thinks that is criminally underrating julio everyone else is great but geez everyone acts like the departing shanahan is going to impact julio greatly uhhhh julio put up numbers before shanahan and honestly he really didnt put that impressive numbers up with shanahan in terms of his career expectations tds are probably the reason why you ranked julio that low but tds are a completely year to year dependent stat remember in when calvin johnson got tackled at the oneyardline like times again completely guessing julio is without a doubt one of the best wideouts in the league if youre really gonna let him drop to the second round then that is on you i would take julio over obj and evans just because of the qb he is playing with
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jesus what is the scoring in that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,which doesnt mean too much because the toptier kickers usually have little dispersion that means normally it doesnt matter if you take the kicker or the kicker because the difference in points will be essentially nil averaging over many seasons you can have single season outliers whereas the drop between tiers of wide receivers is quite large
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cause brown and julio have higher floors and have been more consistent for longer than evans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,doug martin i think we all learned our lesson this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,martin how high are you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,auction draft no way evans falls into the second otherwise
fantasyfootball,not_removed,even midlate first bell dj zeke gordon gone and odb is there you wouldnt take him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wrwrwr has gotten me a title and a place finish juliocooksalshon and amendola split in coopercooksdiggs and thielen split after keenan allen went down im in ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wat your logic is that receivers wont produce consistently after a stellar year well neither julio nor ab had a stellar year relative to other years who did have a stellar year relative to other years one mike evans and thats who you suggesting picking instead of ab and julio am i missing something or is your post completely illogical
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not a chance julio drops out of the first round and most likely he will go in the top overall id put bell david johnson zeke and ab ahead of him julio is definitely a mustkeep for a second round pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats there to talk about with rb the pecking order is pretty clear wr is interesting to talk about
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if we are taking away games take the packer game away too they were also starting rookie cbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think a lot of people arent taking into account that shanahan will be gone after the super bowl to be a head coach somewhere this could affect the offense depending on who they use as oc next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who said i was ignoring the week season i certainly did not i said that it could mean ryan is trusting julio more in the red zone and could lead to double digit tds which is perfectly reasonable
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just adding that he completed touchdowns to receivers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well except for matt ryan of course
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its a fact that julio doesnt catch very many touchdowns he just gets a ton of yards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and the steelers dont have a lot of mouths to feed julio was the overall wr and i think player years ago last year he missed the fantasy playoffs which sucks but oh well it happens to anyone matt ryan has proven hes elite enough a passer to keep his fed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same i was first seed and lost bad because julio didnt play and evans didnt score
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had julio he didnt cause me to lose any weeks ironically i only lost in reg season when he went off julio just so happened to do poorly on a week you lost julio is not the issue you cant rely on one player to win it for you every week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,falcons fan here thats how theyve run julio almost all year with his various minorbutlingering injuries they bring him out for a play or two after he makes any big catch or run trying to remember when that really started its been at least through the beginning of december probably earlier
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the only metric that truly matters
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey shush you keep it down over there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,true but people are not looking at him like hes in the julio brown beckham tier and he should be i was mocked for saying he would be top this season always feels good nailing a call like that lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there is an argument to be made that he received so many targets because there wasnt a lot of other options on the bucs maybe outside of brate an undrafted te halfway through the year if the bucs signdraft a legit receiver hell probably see less volume in targets although it would likely mean less of the double coverage that caused him to perform poorly around fantasy playoff time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,evans was in targets and overall in my ppr league but all the top guys were within points of each other by the end of the year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,odell leads evans by recs yds and tds through seasons so far and thats with evans performing incredibly well obj deserves to be worth more at this point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this isnt a guarantee he wont have the same success with the and i wouldnt at all be surprised to see kyle stay with a great system in atlanta and field likely better offers for hc in a years time he could take the money now but id say the jury is still out at the moment
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i get what youre saying but julio was a great player before shanny was around and hes not going to suddenly become bad ifwhen shanny leaves
fantasyfootball,not_removed,totally right not sure how i misread that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and that would only help antonio brown because he will not have to fight double coverage all game which could lead to some more screens getting blown open for him and better on opportunities
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bryant is mostly a deep threat so they will have different roles in the offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mccoy isnt a bad consolation prize
fantasyfootball,not_removed,uhhhh hes gone in every way except signing the paperwork
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if shanahan leaves hes pretty much garunteed to be gone so i dont think id want to take julio early in the first i think we all have to expect this offense to regress a bit from the level we saw this year think id draft brown and beckham before julio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its not that big of a blow they will probably hire from within which means the same system will stay in place
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think brown showed everyone this year that he can perform just fine with a qb besides ben as long as hes not named michael vick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,your league let you get green and evans how is taco anyway
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not saying julio isnt a top wr next year im saying kyle shanahans offense produces a ton of points which will more than likely step back a little next year which means fewer points to go around
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio is always hobbled hes boom or bust he finished behind brandin cooks this year at least in my standard league hes like megatron except without the red zone looks amazing talent but injuries always nag edit to add if you are looking at it from a consistent floor perspective the only questionable wr on that list is ajg julio has an awful floor as well his worst five games this year he and aj are very similar except julio gets some more yards aj gets some more red zone looks i trust ajs health more though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how about evans last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tds are probably the reason why you ranked julio that low but tds are a completely year to year dependent stat and year to year he has proven to have low td output im not sure why or how it is but he has totaled in his last full seasons full meaning at least games hes only played a full games twice in his career so hes averaging tds thats low for such a high volume receiver but it is what it is
fantasyfootball,not_removed,justin tucker outscored julio by points in espn standard scoring
fantasyfootball,not_removed,standard scoring for the most part tucker was super consistent this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,have higher floors lowest games this year player a player b who has the lower floor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id agree but he couldve been a beast that hammy just killed him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he couldve been a beast if he wouldve stayed healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it depends who youre playing with i know people who will still take peterson in the first next year over someone like evans because theyre sportscenter nfl fans as i like to call them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just thinking there is more value at wr in a ppr then there is at rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not quite current year leaders ty hilton julio jones odell beckham jr mike evans wr antonio brown wr antonio is the only one who had a worse year than evans if i were to bet who would have a stellar year next year id bet on evans over brown and jones its not based on that analysis there is some guess work in terms of ceilings opportunities whether it be w qb preferenceability and other skill players in the offense chance of repeats is certainly a big aspect too which is what i mentioned
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also if you take away all aaron rodgers tds he might have been worse then fitzpatrick o
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and im saying it isnt news to ryan that julio is the best receiver on his team and one of the best in the league and a game trend is going to be much more indicative of next year than a game sample also we dont know how the new oc will treat red zone opportunities atlanta has lots of capable weapons including two great runners so id look at the bigger picture rather than what youve seen the past two weeks ab over julio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,almost as many rbs that have played in gb this year 😂
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in what way was julio the wr two years ago antonio brown was the top wr in standard half ppr and full ppr in and was the wr in as well i believe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and the steelers dont have a lot of mouths to feed it could get even worst next year with potentially having martavis bryant back tds in his first two seasons and a healthy ladarius green plus likely improved play from rogers and coates plus bell could potentially play a full season and he took over the offense once winter hit ab could also be heading for regression as he gets close to injuries to ben are becoming more common also cripple his value there are a lot of warning signs the pros for ab is his lack of injury history and the fact that ben has no problem forcing the ball to his
fantasyfootball,not_removed,had both of those players and didnt lose that week maybe the issue was the rest of your team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all day
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks for the link hilarious
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im with this guy good thing my league mates dont use reddit 😈
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you and me both brother i was telling my league mates dont be surprised if hes top this year and got laughed at
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill use that exact logic to get other owners in my league to let him slip to the third round again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,evans worked with a younger qb though winston is only gonna get better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it makes sense for him to stay but sf is giving him full reigns he has complete control over everything not even the gm or owner is allowed to interfere with his decisions i think its too good of an opportunity to pass up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes already announced to the falcons players that he is taking the job
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ah crutch arguments
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes a big red zone target too so he might steal some tds from brown
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i mean not really their role is to catch the ball a lineman and a receiver have different roles in the offense having bryant in the offense has a verifiable positive effect on abs numbers with defenses having to respect bryants play making abilities brown had more room to operate last year and his stats showed it he had significant decline in receptions and total yards this year after having bryant in the lineup for most of last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wont draft him because if i do it will inevitably be the year he breaks down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,until hes actually gone im gonna use the word if
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if they win the superbowl is there even the slightest chance he stays they literally have the best offense we have seen in years and their d is young but should be very good next year as players develop in the offseason genuinely asking
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green was generally a midlate first and evans a mid second not sure why that is surprising
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green has tds vs julios tds and i think aj has the best hands in the game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,three year career is throw in his college stats and his role in a rising nfl offense i am more inclined to believe in the and not the especially given julios highest the past years was on a year he caught passes which isnt a good ratio for that amount of volume edit id still be hard pressed to take odbjordyajg over julio myself but i can see arguments for each my wr list in order is brown evans julio odb jordy ajg dez with hopkins tbd on houston qb situation but no higher than behind jordy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seasonlong floors
fantasyfootball,not_removed,huh maybe we have different scoring systems julio is ranked at the wr after i looked it up the past two years but he finished first in overall points in my league last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,plus we have a new toy named demarcus ayers if coates fucks up anymore ayers will probably take over his and cobi hamiltons position
fantasyfootball,not_removed,slurping noises
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i got him in the in all of my leagues last year nobody expected much from him i highly doubt that happens again but if it does do not hesitate haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i didnt know those details and honestly i wish him success but man oh man will he be regretting it if he cant pull things off and turn it around
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ah thats changed then well i cant blame him but i dont think itll end well for him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shit i hadnt seen it confirmed i still had foolish hope
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i get that kind of is a crutch argument but we also do have empirical evidence last year bryant played most of the season and this year he didnt the wrs for the steelers were far healthier and more talented last year than the guys behind ab this year and it just so happens that with bryant playing ab put up better numbers in every major category except total tds which was close
fantasyfootball,not_removed,plus no more rex force feeding him the ball plus another workhorse year plus we dont know if tyrod is going to be there whose legs force defenses to play honest opening up some running room for shady i loved mccoy this year won me championships but based on whats going on in buffalo and the emergence of a goalline back stealing his tds mccoy is a tougher draft pick this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you are making million as a coordinator and win a super bowl then are offered a step up in the company ladder control of team decisions and squad personnel and a salary raise wouldnt you take it the coaches and coordinators have professional goals too and moving up is a big thing to them as well just as any other normal white collar worker hes being considered for a very prestigious job title most of the time of course these guys take the opportunity
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i guess anything is possible but hes all but been officially announced as the new head coach of the niners it sucks for fantasy and falcons fans alike you could see last year that their offense was heading in the right direction and peaked this season minus the injury julio was great matt ryan had a career year freeman and coleman were both highly relevant even gabriel was down the stretch itll be shitty to see kyle go but if it isnt to the niners this year you can garuntee it would be to the next team in line next years off season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,throw his college stats in nah im good otherwise we can have a nice long debate about college wrs rbs and qbs who failed to produce in the nfl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what does that even mean thats a third of the season right there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn i guess the karma train ran out here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it depends how long your season was ab was number one i believe for seasons ending week and julio was number one for seasons ending week my buddy lost a bet this way
fantasyfootball,not_removed,over weeks ppr i dont know the ranks for weeks in my week standard league and week ppr league i was nearly positive ab finished first in both
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was second pick over all and picked him up at the turn this year draft went julio jones eddie lacy mike evans traded evans for brandin cooks and drew brees midyear i really needed a qb but that turned out poorly during playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i guess youre right my friend was telling me about how dan quinn left the seahawks after they made it to the superbowl kinda funny how that worked out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sure except we are now talking about a wr with successful nfl seasons with targets and yards each year id say he produced enough that his college stats have merit now too anyways its personal preference when it comes to drafting players you couldnt have paid me to draft gordon this year or alshon jefferey win some lose some ill take evans with a shitfaced grin over julio personally but i wont call anyone a moron for taking julio or odb or even ajg over evans either
fantasyfootball,not_removed,look at their stats throughout their careers brown and julio and more consistent on a year long basis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ahh thats the difference we always end week or
fantasyfootball,not_removed,evans was actually way worse than cooks or brees in the playoffs so that actually ended up being an ok trade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,successful seasons
fantasyfootball,not_removed,evans is in his year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do you play in a td only league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea brown and julio have been studs for multiple years evans one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he went from to three tds ask and nuk owners how they felt this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,evans has straight yard seasons and tds in of though evans is consistent too to say hes not is crazy i do feel more contraband with ab and julio becuase of the qbs throwing to them not sold in winston yet plus they get those numbers with other options on their team the bucsdont really have that but evans is a stud who has improved every year so far and could easily put up rec next year and wouldnt be surprising hes this season hes had better age season than both those guys as well as a better year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,neither broke yards though evans at least put up in and every year his catch total target share and yardage has increased i dont see how you can call and successful seasons but not when he improved in every metric but tds in also i owned nuk in many leagues but i took him round evans in adp was or round so i dont even get how thats a correlation
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i owned him in a ppr league in the yards is great but misleading he had a few great games and a bunch of very mediocre sub point games and i lost plenty of head to head games with him as my he went in of my draft do you happen to recall how he finished overall in i want to say he was outside of in ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he was in ppr even lower in standard when i am saying successful seasons i am talking more on an nfl level by the way yes from ff perspective was a bust vs adp but given his continued improvement i think it was a fluke i mean lets not forget megatron broke jerry rices record but somehow only caught tds that year rec yards and tds flukes happen and i think mike evans body of work so far points to that td year being a fluke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and all im saying is that you can put him in the ab julio obj class when one of his ff years was a pretty big let down and remember we started off talking about whether julio is worth the draft pick for ff
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also odb went ahead of julio in that draft with a single year of production under his belt despite julio coming off a career year with line that stat was a big reason why you cant count on him getting double digit tds and id sooner bet on evans getting than julio next year if julio didnt have a history of foot injuries yeah id take him over evans due to yardage upside over a whole season but with that and then accounting for how i feel evans will do in comparison to him in terms of tds evans is the safer pick to me neither touch ab as long as ben returns though he is a tier above
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sure you can odb was a top pick in his year with a single rookie season to back it how can evans not be in that discussion after bouncing back with a top performance this year in every scoring setting this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that is a very fair point also ezekiel was adp with zero nfl history that also seemed crazy to me but it did pan out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i avoided elliot like a plague too even at the back end of in one league i wouldve taken him if he lasted the snake though in favor of lamar miller
fantasyfootball,not_removed,which is totally the smart thing to do even if it didnt pan out make multiple smart choices like that and you stand a better chance in the draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yep same reason i had shares of gordon after his messy first year shame almost every league i was had an owner that draft gordon while owning either dj or elliot oh well d ill still keep my conservative approach in the early rounds but maybe in ill take more calculated risks on guys who could bounce back the strategy continues to evolve each year you gotta balance risk vs safety for key positions though too much of either isnt a successful formula
fantasyfootball,not_removed,working the wire got me to the playoffs this year too i retooled my whole receiver core and had to shuffle tes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,link for reference httpwwwborischenco
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cowboys vs browns next week maybe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im so sick of new englands shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cowboys v browns kc takes on the jaguars so i think theres value here especially if smith and ware are out could lead to trouble moving the ball and thus limit garbage time tds from the jags if your league uses yards and points scored
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive been burned for three weeks now on the vs browns strategy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,san diego at home vs tennessee
fantasyfootball,not_removed,does anyone have faith in the panthers dst after their great job they did today
fantasyfootball,not_removed,to piggyback your question hold ne through bye
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kc vs jax if they are still available for some reason they are in of my leagues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,browns will score in garbage time with mccown pryor barnidge and coleman coming back from injury the passing game will open up holes for the running game im confidently streaming the dolphins next week theyre coming out of a bye at home the offense is starting to clickand did i mention theyre playing the jets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cowboys and chargers are looking like decent streams in the coming weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rolling with carolina
fantasyfootball,not_removed,panthers vs rams
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what do people think of the bills d vs seattle
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i eliminated kickers from my league defense is next i think the league is so biased towards offense with all of the penalties theres very little strategy involved in streaming anymore there are like good defenses and the rest are just terrible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if your in a worst is best league the cardinals will do im salty as fuck right now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not a bad choice could end up bad if coleman is back next week though miami or san diego could be good plays too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,browns may be winless but they always put up points im going for kc vs jax
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes as someone who streamed jets this week i should have listened to my gut mccown is actually a solid game manager and will dink and dunk you to death and wont be as careless as some other cleveland qbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think thats a good point nyj didnt turn out to be a good streaming option against them this week though some of that is due to it being the jets id go with green bay or pittsburgh if theyre available
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cowboys probably wont get you a ton of points but theyre a pretty safe pick they have a really high floor but not a very high ceiling for a streamer sometimes going for the high floor is the best you can do yes the browns are getting some parts back but are you really going to be more worried about the browns offense than about philly gb or cin the last weeks where they scored and the jets did poorly against the browns but the jets are a really bad defense they got against ari against pit against sea against kc against buf they did well last week against bal but that was an anomaly of their season thus far id be pretty surprised if the cowboys dont get points against the browns which is pretty solid for a streaming defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mccown is probably better for defenses than kessler a lot more turnover prone and theyve both put up points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mariota has been playing very well lately and of course the run game will be a concern i dont think sd is such a slam dunk streamer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the bye helped get some players healthy so it looks like the pass rush is finally back im picking them back up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yupp im trying to grab them off of waivers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,normally id be okay playing a defense against sea as long as wilson is still struggling but if they get some of their defensive players back and wilson is a little healthier next week it might not work out especially considering that buffalos defense had against ne against mia and against sf in the last weeks its a risky play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im a cardinals owner and disappointed with today but theyve saved me once or twice this season get over it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theyre on bye
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i mean they were playing against a division rival coming off of a bye on the road its not shocking that they played poorly i benched them for the cowboys this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the dez owner most likely would not make that trade in a million years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol do it see if you can offer the dj owner hightower straight up too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good point honestly mccown pryor coleman healthy could make the browns an offense that can score points dallas also isnt great at creating turnovers though they are really good at stopping offenses so they may have trouble exploiting mccowns interception tendencies still theyre probably a fine play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i regret listening to the experts and dropping the eagles for them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mariota wont do better than ice did the other week san diego is looking much better with bosa in the lineup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,point against for the pat probably
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its still points against fantasy football doesnt try to determine whose fault it was that a dst got points scored against it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same as this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,plus josh gordon too right right pls say yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably kessler over mccown
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i mean thats pretty neat and all but its kind of irrelevant to dst scoring theyre still allowing the most passing yards per game and just dont create as many turnovers as most defences theyve only had fantasy points or more once this year also quite frankly i think youre underestimating clevelands offence theyre lower middle class despite starting different qbs so far their starter is now healthy and missing coleman since week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so technically still the jets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eagles have a pretty rough ros schedule though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wrong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mccown seems to have a better connection with barnidge and coleman and did fine with pryor too but hes injuryturnover prone kessler is probably better and will probably start because of the turnovers but mccown i think is the better passer and might lead to a higherscoring offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its not just because its the jets its their secondary theyre still the ranked defense against the run this season its not like the secondary is the only bad part of their team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ehh its not that bad atlanta and green bay the only lethal offenses on there they get at home
fantasyfootball,not_removed,atlanta and green bay the only lethal offenses on there thats not true at all in terms of fantasy points vs dsts the eagles face the team twice cowboys falcons bengals redskins seahawks and twice giants bottom half teams include the packers and the ravens of their remaining games are against teams that are in the top half of the league against fantasy defenses one of the remaining two is the packers who as you just stated have a very high powered offense the eagles dst has one of the hardest ros schedules of any dst in fantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill gladly play the eagles against the giants any day of the week i dont see how you dont with such a volatile offense seahawks are a no brainer as well they already played the skins at their place and still managed to score points despite their worst game defensively ill easily start the eagles at home against them again ravens are hot garbage on offense they may not turn the ball over much but they dont score points ill give you the bengals because they dont turn it over they have homefield and their offense will be better with eiffert back now as for dallas thats week so most people probably wont have to worry about that eagles have already proven they can shut down the elite offenses in the league pittsburgh and can score solid fantasy points against good offenses on the road detroit washington at home theyve been completely dominant as cleveland is the lowest theyve scored all season with last night was the only bad game theyve had all season and it was against a red hot division rival on the road that will be the exception not the norm
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill gladly play the eagles against the giants any day of the week i dont see how you dont with such a volatile offense feel free you may do well or you may not its a divisional game against a top half offense the giants have games where they look like the worst team in the league then turn around and have a game where they look like sb contenders ravens are hot garbage on offense yes theyre theyre the worst team they face so far not sure why youre mentioning them i never said the eagles wouldnt be a good play against baltimore as for dallas thats week so most people probably wont have to worry about that youre probably underestimating how many people are in standard espn leagues which all go to week eagles have already proven they can shut down the elite offenses in the league pittsburgh the team that showed up in philly wasnt elite the eagles did well but the steelers played like shit from the moment the game started they also lost a ton of defensive starters so the game was just out of hand early the offense was just not clicking it was not just the defense they were against the steelers just pulled a steelers and didnt show up on the road tldr you can feel free to start them if you want but it doesnt make what i said false the ros schedule for the eagles is one of if not the most difficult schedule of any defense in terms of fantasy points given up whether you want to play them regardless is entirely up to you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so you just chalk up the steelers game to them playing poorly like the defense had nothing to do with it you still gave no credit to the team that held them to points and can you please tell me when the giants have looked like super bowl contenders this season particularly their offense cause please go look at the games theyve played theyve been pretty bad theyve scored under points out of games this season the two games they did score over one against washington the offense looked anemic in that game particularly manning who threw two picks in the quarter the other was against the ravens in which they looked absolutely dreadful up until obj bailed them out in the final minutes numbers dont tell the whole story and the fact that philly completely dominated the steelers shows they are more than capable of doing it to any team they are nearly matchup proof right below denver minny and seattle
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so you just chalk up the steelers game to them playing poorly like the defense had nothing to do with it you still gave no credit to the team that held them to points thats not what i said at all if you read i said that i wasnt discrediting the defense but if you watched the game the steelers that showed up werent the typical steelers they have a habit of doing that on the road sometimes and its not always against good teams in fact its typically against bad teams dropped or completely missed passes poor vision on run plays wrs running the wrong routes etc that stuff isnt related to the defense playing well on top of all of that the defense did play very well but if you watched the game at all you couldve seen what im saying and can you please tell me when the giants have looked like super bowl contenders this season particularly their offense cause please go look at the games theyve played theyve been pretty bad theyve scored under points out of games this season yet theyre still in the league against fantasy defenses theyre at the bottom of the list ros but theyre still numbers dont tell the whole story and the fact that philly completely dominated the steelers shows they are more than capable of doing it to any team these two sentences are contradictory you say numbers dont tell the whole story yet you ignore my points about that game and rely solely on the numbers to prove that they beat up a prolific steelers offense like i continue to say you can start them if you want my original comment is that they have one of the hardest ros schedules that is fact you can look it up you can argue all day about whether you should start them if you want but ive never been a part of that argument i never said you should sit them i simply said they have one of the hardest ros schedules
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so its fact because youre using one stat to back it up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when the stat is literally what im stating as fact then yes that stat proves the argument ros strength of schedule is based off of current standing and games remaining if you go through and look at how each team plays against fantasy defenses this year then you look at each teams remaining schedule you can come to a statistical fact about who has the hardest sos remaining the eagles have one of the hardest sos remaining in terms of fantasy points given up to dsts i didnt say that the eagles are going to be shit and here is this one stat to prove it i said that the eagles have one of the hardest probably the hardest but i dont feel like checking every team ros schedules that is a fact
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but thats just one statistic it doesnt take into account the strength of previous opponents or the strength of the opponents from future opponents not to mention it only has an game sample size
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its exactly what i said it was its a strength of schedule how their previous opponents have done outside of the games they played the eagles have literally nothing to do with what i said if we were arguing whether or not you should play them then thats a different story if i said you shouldnt play the eagles because they are facing the team against fantasy defenses this week then in that argument youd have to consider how theyve done in previous weeks against similar teams when youre talking about sos then all you are talking about is how each upcoming opponent ranks the eagles sos is one of if not the hardest soss remaining in the league whether or not they still perform well is a separate topic which i did not discuss yet you still keep trying to push into this discussion despite me continuing to say that has nothing to do with what im saying their ros sos is one of the hardest in the league that is statistical fact theres nothing to discuss about it it is one statistical fact of many that you should then take into consideration on whether or not to play them or trade them or whatever you want to do but thats a separate discussion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,antonio tweets his
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cha ching
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good for him he certainly deserves it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he is so good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,money in the bank
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats mozgov money lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is good for martavis bryant too brown had a down year last season without bryant taking away double teams next year should see them both return to numbers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is it bad i cant help but try to avoid him now that hes paid regression incoming
fantasyfootball,not_removed,will struggle to create separation from coverage oh boy were they wrong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nah take him at the right value like any player hes probably my overall in standard and ppr and probably overall in ppr so if i can get him at or later in any draft im probably taking him no matter what
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a couple years ago someone did an analysis of this on here and found no connection between performance and contract years these guys got to where they are because they love to be the best and they work hard every day
fantasyfootball,not_removed,browns first few years in the league he was more mike wallacetorrey smith people were still unsure of his overall ability when the steelers let wallace walk odds are he worked a lot at his craft between his rookie season and now nfl prospects are rarely finished products and scouts base their judgments off of the tape and all teams thought he wasnt worth a draft choice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,potential down backs and their adps team leveon bell adrian peterson david johnson ezekiel elliott jamaal charles lamar miller devonta freeman eddie lacy mark ingram matt forte latavius murray carlos hyde jeremy langford cj anderson matt jones jonathan stewart frank gore justin forsett
fantasyfootball,not_removed,forte is a good example mark ingram leveon bell and jamaal charles just a few off the top of my head
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no powell will still see a lot of third downs they paid him as much as forte this isnt because forte cant catch though its cuz he is old and needs breaks the guys i think will be on the field all downs jay ajahi drake is known for being injured in college which doesnt translate well to pros lev bell hes a monster david johnson he will get taken off the field some but not for specific situation just because they want to rest him too but he is the down guy and the red zone guy so ingram can do it all miller probably wont come off the field now some guys who could develop this role but are questionable as of now cj anderson who knows what gonna happen in denver freeman if hes a beast again he stay on the field eze who knows ryan matthews can do everything but spoles will probably get some usage but matthews could also be on the field gio bernard i think they might just give up on hill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gurley
fantasyfootball,not_removed,down running backs are not dead wait weeks and grab one off the waiver wire
fantasyfootball,not_removed,stewart
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i doubt forte will be this season even though hes been a great receiving rb cuz of powell and his age if charles and bell stay healthy they are both are great options but i really think gurley and freeman have high potential to be down backs this upcoming season after what they both did last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,zeke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hyde
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gurley
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cj anderson at that adp is a complete steal ill happily take him over langford or hyde
fantasyfootball,not_removed,some of those seem crazy to me charles in the jstewy in the ingram in the seems crazy to me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bilal powell well be involved in the passing game forte can do it all but he doesnt have to add ap lamar miller and todd gurley to the list
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have major concerns about fortes usage this season powell proved at the end of last year that he could be very effective both in the passing game and running game and was frequently used in the minute drill forte was given a yr million deal by the jets and powell was given a ye million deal that doesnt signify to me that its going to be all forte robinson could also steal and down as hes actually pretty damn similar to ivory in that theyre both violent running grinders that can pick up short yardage well although pretty irrelevant its funny that robinson also left the saints for the jets after years just like ivory
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont really agree with a few of these backs but giving up on hill you realize he has a role in that offense and they utilize him in that role i mean he had carries last year with in of the last regular season games what makes you think they want to give up on him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ gurley take my energy ༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ
fantasyfootball,not_removed,benny cunningham is actually listed as the third down back edit according to rotoworld
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ap was in on of and plays last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all of gios stats are better gio is more versatile i think they want him as a receiving option with so much of their offense leaving while i agree hill might have role now a couple bad games and i think it become a for gio also i think the for touchdowns is somewhat fluky last year i think hills role changes from running down back to clock grinder and i dont think the bengal will be ahead as much as last year and in those two carry games at the end of the year he averaged and ypc
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i definitely agree last year i drafted hill and luckily traded for gio early and i actually expect gio to have more than this season especially with a bengals team that is still looking to throw hills big thing last year was tds but im not convinced that happens again this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,welp that happened
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i very much mean this as constructive criticism but basing value solely on last years production is generally not a great idea in fantasy which you did a little too much here with the exception of eddie lacy would you mind expounding a little on why you think these guys will repeat i do agree with you on almost all of these players with the exception being allen hurns i agree that the rookies are going to high but thats a seperate discussion hurns faces the double whammy of both his production and his qbs production being unsustainable hurns is undoubtedly a good player but his production also exceeded his talent last year imo i also believe that seattle disciple gus bradley would prefer to run the ball more and may finally have the oline rbs and defense to do that youre really getting nothing but downside with hurns and while overall is arguably an okay spot to take that its not really a value imo and id prefer guys with more talent and in better situations like donte moncrief and tyler lockett who are going behind him like i said any criticism i made is meant to be constructive great writeup and keep at it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,adrian peterson now here is a guy who was the most consistent fantasy back last season for the adrian peterson averaged and was
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brady is a tough call for me his last year was phenomenal but his previous two years he barely was a top fantasy qb it depends on his final adp for me but itll rise
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hurns was extremely td dependent last year and i wouldnt expect that to change the defense will be improved which lowers his garbage time opportunities and they signed ivory to run the ball better at the goal line i like keenan allen but is pretty fair considering he plays a volatile positionslot and that hes struggled with injuries in college peterson was td dependent a lot of the time down the stretch and his pass game deficiencies may cause mckinnon to get more work
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think in the case of hurns i have faith in his own talent but not that of the jaguars o to repeat its production last year not that it isnt full of talented players but it really was a perfect storm for production last season and if they regress i think robinson gets his and everyone else sees a drop off where i see him going in mock drafts a lot is well after moncrief but earlier than lockett i think its a wash with lockett hurns is a more well rounded receiver but lockett has the far better qb i do think theres a greater chance seattle evens out the runpass balance than jacksonville does this year so theres a similar risk with lockett too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as far as hurns goes he has now had two years of solid production tds and the jags are only getting better in a conference where he wont face any talented cbs as the wr and having a qb that will continue to progress as he shows he has bortles im high on their passing attack as a whole this year i wouldnt say that i am solely basing these rankings on last years production but it is a big factor if nothing large has changed on their offense you generally have to assume that their offense will do similar now while this is by no means always true it is true more often than not adrian peterson has always been good theres no question to that keenan allen will continue to get short dumpy passes from rivers because thats what rivers does and hes shown that he can turn them into yards because he is a good wr lacy will improve as the entire packers offense does and having rodgers at qb makes it a pretty good bet to be that way with nelson back as a threat and the patriots are probably the best team in the nfl led by a demolishing passing attack with dion lewis as a receiving back and blount only being good under certain situations id say theres no question that brady is a top qb when he is back with the addition of bennett they are trying to get back to the gronkhernandez days and brady should destroy especially if the patriots as a whole play as pissed off as they did last year i appreciate your feedback everyone obviously has different opinions as far as fantasy football goes ive spent years playing and usually with great success and sleepers in my draft plus waiver wire action usually pays off last year i went dez luck morris and still came second in my league by playing waivers and having some key late round selections
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he gets reached on a bit but ive never seen that high id still rather have robinson green jeffery or nelson than allen in that range he tends to go in early in most drafts but ive gotten him at
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he was still a starting caliber running back of those weeks he had week all season under points and weeks over
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and freeman was the only other top back to accomplish both of those had the same under over but its far more likely that ap repeats and freeman was a one hit wonder
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im loving the idea of taking brady in the or round and grabbing derek carr with one of my final picks i think carr will be the palmer of this season a top fantasy qb available at the end of most drafts start carr in weeks through sell high if he plays really well then plug in brady for the rest of the year thats great value at a small cost
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hurns was extremely td dependent last year and i wouldnt expect that to change he did finish in receiving yards so i dont think its fair to say he was extremely td dependent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they just brought in chris ivory a hard nose powerback i full expect him to get td easily this season if not a lot more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think its a wash with lockett hurns is a more well rounded receiver but lockett has the far better qb my feeling is that the floor is higher with hurns but the ceiling is way higher with lockett i feel like lockett could genuinely be the target in seattle call it somewhere between chance if that is the case you are drafting a player who could hit and over near receiving yards not even the ceiling at a very low price for where they are both being drafted lockett is the type of player i want on my roster not quite as much of a safe floor on production but much higher risk and reward payoff definitely note that i favor higher risk players in my pick spots and am not suggesting locketthurns or visaversa but different risk profiles for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he had ten games with less than yards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats fair enough im picking in the middle of the and so im taking a lot of high value players that have fallen because of their risks like dion lewis so from im looking for players on teams with a lot of touches to go round duke johnsons etc rather than players who might have a larger slice of a potentially smaller pie your strategy makes sense though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats exactly what one should expect in a if he got yards most of the time hed be a
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rdynastyff will give you way better advice on this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my wife would hate this thing so much its perfect
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our sacko made out of hockey sticks a jock and tennis balls
fantasyfootball,not_removed,awesome i like it is there any specific reason why you put donkey kong on top of the trophy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,very nice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love it but if my league mates had a trophy like that i know they would drop it thus shattering the beer bottles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ehh love everything except the bud
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that is beautiful my league has always wanted a trophy but we just never got out to buying one maybe well get together and build one very interesting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im going to go drink some budweiser
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is that the losers trophy because im pretty sure the winners trophy should have full beers not empty bottles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that was one of my goals my dad actually joined our league last year and won the damn thing so its at my parents house and my mom despises the damn thing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,heres our sacko httpimgurcomavfhhd last year i created this trophy because i won da championship in and in i was worst in da league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why not its donkey kong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fora true fantasy aspect
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had the first winner sign it the current winner will sign at the draft to start tradition
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did i say there was something wrong with donkey kong being on the trophy im just asking if there was meaning behind it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cool i was just curious
fantasyfootball,not_removed,make a reddit sub with your league name thats how we do it anyway
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i use the commish tools on espn to create the power rankings then post that image and my writeup on the leagues homepage through the lm note i also post it on our leagues facebook page which is where all the activity is
fantasyfootball,not_removed,most of my leagues have a facebook group so thats where all league posts go it really helps for polling the league organizing the draft and the most important aspect trash talk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gotta be steelers big ben brown and bell are all monsters
fantasyfootball,not_removed,steelers are an obvious choice because they will have a top rb wr and probably qb idk about for them though arizona will probably have fantasy relevant wrs plus a potential top back in david johnson not to mention carson palmer packers should be back this year and have rodgers lacy and nelson competing for top spots and cobb should be better next year in his role jaguars are probably another solid option with julius thomas blake bortles chris ivory allen hurns tj yeldon and allen robinson being relevant but i think robinson is going to be the only stud cowboys could have some top guys in romo could be a top qb if he stays healthy dez and elliot with mcfadden and morris chipping a few points in to stay relevant in deeper leagues tampa bay is a bit of a sleeper imo i can see winston making a jump and the offense improving as a whole i also see a big year for doug martin and mike evans and vincent jackson and asj should be fantasy relevant again carolina will regress i think as an offense as a whole but cam newton greg olsen jstew and kelvin benjamin should be good players with ted ginn being a good bench player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like gb to get it rolling again rodgers gets nelson back cobb will be back in the slot a healthy competition for the outside wr spot could leave janisadams as the starter opposite nelson rodgers gets a new toy in jared cook at te and lacy has dropped a lot of weight and will likely bounce back strong in a contract year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i expect the colts to return to the offensive form they had a couple years ago or at least of that if this is the case wed see fantasy relevance in luck gore moncrief and hilton for sure and dwayne allen could be a borderline as he is a great redzone target when healthy dorsett could have a few decent games as well if he stays healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no one will mention the texans both hopkins and l miller have big time top potential both were last year depending on league format if osweiller preforms the texans offense will be too spooky
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gbp rodgers jordy cobb lacy cook all potential top at their respective positions
fantasyfootball,not_removed,washington redskins if their studs can stay healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cardinals gonna produce some big time fantasy points if palmer can stay healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not gold but dolphins could have later round value ajayi parker even tannehill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chip kelly at the helm dualthreat colin under center fantasy gold
fantasyfootball,not_removed,steelers green bay and jacksonville will have great offensive seasons as far as more of a sleeper think the texans will surprise a lot of people brock will have struggles but bob will get the best out of him and hell be a consistent starter throughout the year miller and hopkins will have great seasons and we might see some production out of fuller and strong too depending on how they develop through training camp the offensive line for the texans is questionable but i expect that offense to surprise a lot of people
fantasyfootball,not_removed,steelers bell brown and big ben thats all that needs to be said if i had to pick a qb wr rb to score the most points it would be these three cardinals carson palmer was incredibly efficient passing the ball last year and their receiving corp is the best in the league in my opinion if fitz dies down i see floyd making a really big impact and john brown will still produce consistently with dj and cj in the rb position id call this the best team in the nfl patriots seeing as the patriots typically score more points than anyone else its only logical to assume their accumulate a large amount of fantasy points their points seem to be spread around a little better so its hard to cash in every week but nonetheless they deserve to be on the list
fantasyfootball,not_removed,browns will produce some sneaky above average guys duke johnson in a ppr corey coleman n barnidge both getting targets but in all seriousness steelers will have the best receiver rb n a top qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ladarius green might put up some good numbers as well being that martavis bryant is suspended hes a big target plus he has above average speed for a te
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no love for the pats from the guru brady gronk edelman lewis bennett will all be factors this year in fantasy with plenty of targets to go around
fantasyfootball,not_removed,packers defense should be pretty good too fantasy wise
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely can never count out the packers as long as they have rodgers under center with jordy coming back and richard rodgers gaining his qbs trust the receiving core put up big numbers im not sold on lacy though even though he lost weight im not sure how much james starks will eat into his carries
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who are the studs outside of reed i mean cousins is will be a good fantasy qb if he continues his play from last year but he certainly isnt elite djax is a guy you dont mind having around on your bench if you need a guy that could have a huge game but i wouldnt call him a stud anymore either matt jones could become a solid fantasy contributor but his ypc and fumbling issues have him as more of a question mark at this point than anything else
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green is completely slept on this year hes got as good a chance as anybody finishing top in the position
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if brady beats his case i definitely think patriots players will produce huge numbers i dont think garoppolo sp could fill bradys shoes however for the first four games but what do i know bb knows his shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brady will probably be gone games but after that they should be going off guns ablazing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they also picked up jared cook who could be a solid te if dick rod cant get it done
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is a contract year for djax so im expecting him to play well he certainly showed his elite play making skills last year with cousins id take the chance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,based off of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think jimmy can fill those shoes either but he has excellent targets around him and he fits the patriots offense i think that the position players will still put up good numbers with him at the helm obviously their numbers with brady will be better i still think those players will be getting their touches with short passes and creative play calling
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck jared cook
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sure djax could be a really good pick this year but hes certainly not considered a stud anymore i dont doubt that the redskins will have a couple players do well in fantasy but they dont have studs like the packers or steelers do outside of reed that is also just thought id let you know a contract year has almost zero correlation to increased fantasy performance its something that gets brought up a lot as a point in a players favor because theyll be more hungry but theres no significant relationship between a contract year and an increase in performance i can certainly see why you and many others would look at it as a positive for fantasy as it makes sense that they may give that extra to get that new deal but it just doesnt end making in difference in almost every case
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he did a pretty good job until gates came back last year and as mentioned above the steelers have so many weapons on offense that the defense cant key in on one guy and if they do that guy is antonio brown
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a contract year does give a bit of incentive to do well but overall i agree with you completely id say they let garçon go before jackson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please show something that supports this cause youre just regurgitating what youve heard here and its wrong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no it doesnt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,show me something that says otherwise youre just regurgitating what youve heard here and its pretty subjective at this point rather do well than bad on a contract year who wouldnt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,here you go also it has nothing to do with not wanting to do better in a contract year thats one of the most asinine comments ive read its the fact that a contract year has no statistical difference in a persons play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,are you trying to deflate my balls with this article let me quote how it ends the lesson is clear there is no such thing as a blanket contractyear theory there is only contractyear motivation and that is subjective not objective fantasy analysis in short you shouldnt be using lists of prospective free agents to blindly identify values you should be using them as yet another tool and a small one preferably one coupled with better tools for identifying values and they also put a subjective player list theyre actually mark the list with the word subjective as a caution why do this bro come on
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you are loaded at rb and extremely weak at wr if you could capitalize on preseason foster hype and pair him with say moncrief for get yourself a strong it would go a long way
fantasyfootball,not_removed,josh garden
fantasyfootball,not_removed,two qbs two tes and two suspended rb wr starters means not much room for injuries and ww moves
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i kept wanting to take a wr but it was one of those hes still available type deals over and over kept losing the receiver i wanted to draft picks ahead of me as well which led to this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i fully expect quarterbacks to go in the first rounds of my league while the seahawks defense gets picked up in the round or so some people in my league are good others not so much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i know that feeling im actually afraid of that happening to me in reverse in one of my drafts in my mocks i keep wanting to take an rb but theres always a wr i think is great value its the old value vs need dilemma theres no right or wrong answer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the best preseason rankings can be found at httpswwwfantasyproscomnflaccuracydraftphp where youll find this year that fbgs bob henry was the top with accuracy hes also the most accurate on their multiyear projections in terms of free resources cbs sports and yahoo are both highly ranked called beersheets that people seem to like
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beersheets is coming out soon keep your eyes posted on this sub it is an aggregate of all professional ranking services placed into very userfriendly spreadsheets for all league types is one of my favorite hidden gems they are spreadsheets posted a couple months back the only reason this post didnt blow up is because it was after the season and traffic on this subreddit was way down but it will normalize things on a pointspergame basis for you and help you find gems for example dion lewis julian edelman are both going way later in drafts than their performance suggests they should because they got hurt and missed time and also some guys to avoid for example frank gore finished last year but on a ppg basis he was only did you know that jordan reed scored the most points per game at the te position last year yup he was more productive than gronk on a gamebygame basis he was just out for a few weeks you can get him or rounds later than gronk too thanks ppg httpswwwfantasyproscomnflrankingsconsensuscheatsheetsphp is similar to beersheets gives you consensus rankings among experts it gives a little more information on whos actually doing the ranking but actually to be honest i have no idea how this is different from beersheets can someone say does it just exclude boris chen tiers evan silva from httpwwwrotoworldcomsportsnflfootballlsrotonflgnav is a solid expert that i like a lot really just good for some context around the previous three lists i posted
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fantasypros keeps track of the most accurate experts each year is the overall most accurate so i usually start there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,httpswwwfantasyproscomnflrankingsconsensuscheatsheetsphp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beersheets baby
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dynastysballerscom has a good list up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the best strategy is to use a number of different resources and come up with your own by synthesizing those opinions dont be a slave to rankings unless you came up with them yourself
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how much beer would the beer god require so that we may be blessed with dynastykeeper league rankings this year if thats not in the cards i completely understand as that is surely a ton of extra work i can find quite a bit of rankings for dynasty but nothing like your beersheets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey man love beersheets will you be releasing an xlsx version of beersheets this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what about a top type of list
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beersheets are bullshit and the guy who makes them is a tool
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks if anyones interested feel free to use redditcmnt for off a subscription
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the method doesnt work across multiple years for dynasty i would use fantasypros
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id say the consensus rankings by fantasypros are what youre looking for but beersheets uses valuebased drafting to give you a sense of the disparity between players and also encourage tiers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was coming in for the fastest downvote of all time but then saw it was the beer god himself hail
fantasyfootball,not_removed,finally someone said it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i heard the guy pees sitting down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,weve all been thinking it i built up enough karma in here that i can handle the downvotes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i heard he only drinks light beer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,take your quality content elsewhere nobody even wants you here guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man standard league one of the owners had to bail due to some personal reasons league wants to just make his team a bye week but the way the rotation falls is someone is going to play him twice should i just optimize his lineup one of those weeks also what to do with his players release them all to waivers or just keep them out of circulation altogether first time as a commissioner so want to do right by everyone thanks for the help
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is my first year doing a paid league and one of my managers couldnt come up with the entry so i told him id pay it for him so that it doesnt cancel the contest for everyone go into his account to do so enter credit card submit and nothing took a single dollar off my card but it still says he hasnt paid so in my infinite wisdom i did it again and again nothing not even a dollar taken off my card this time is this something thats going to come off my card tomorrow and i just double charged myself or is this something im gonna end up having to contact customer service about anyone know yahoo btw
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was offered a trade involving aj green and i wanted to accept it however the game had already started now when i try to accept it it keeps saying error player is locked i understand the player is locked but is there a way to still accept the trade and wait it out until it officially processes next week i would hate to have the owner see greens big game and cancel the trade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,find a new owner
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a lot of times companies charge your cc a dollar to make sure your card is active if nothing else happened id try calling your credit card company who might have flagged it as fraud
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youd have to get the ok from the owner way text between aj owner commish and you everyone agrees to the trade and its processed after the week thats what my league does
fantasyfootball,not_removed,were they colluding or do you just not like it because its lopsided
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what do the teams look like have you asked for their reasoning is the player getting sharpe a taco hard to tell if its collusion or just a bad trade without more information
fantasyfootball,not_removed,would love to but the buy in was and theyd be stepping into a pretty bleak situation he left at and his team is plagued with injuries nothing insurmountable i guess but it was pretty tough just getting the original together so im not sure if i could find another dedicated person at this point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,since i am the commissioner would that be abusing my powers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if the old owner has already paid you dont need a new owner to pay again do you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well if youre just needing someone to take over the team id probably be up for the challenge obviously wouldnt be eligible for prize money or anything but it would beat the hell out of having a bye week just an idea for you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,old owner never made the deadline for his dues i gave him a couple extra days and then locked his team he kept saying he would have them paid but then finally bailed offered to front his dues for him as well in case money was tight and we all want him to play but he said some personal stuff happened and he just couldnt play this year league is ok with the bye week but the way the games fall one guy plays him twice that would be an auto two wins for him i told him i was going to optimize his lineup for one of those weeks to make it as fair as possible to everyone ive just never dealt with this before so was wondering if anyone had any experience with this a way to make this as fair and transparent as possible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats just a lot of extra work for you as commissioner to have to do that personally i would find a new owner and they dont pay this year but theyre not eligible to win any prize money either if the team is as bad as you say that shouldnt be an issue hell ill manage the team if you really cant find anyone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as an alternative to bye weeks anyone who plays against the absent team could simply be deemed to play against the leagues average scoring for that week as commish youd just have to adjust the absent teams score for the week to be equal to the league average
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr i draft and keep shady for a or brady for a
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who are the best players you project to be available at mccoy likely an appropriate value there and better than who youd get otherwise
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah if you can get mccoy or better at pick brady is a good value in the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with the others if mccoy would likely go ahead of hed be the keeper brady in the is also a good value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nope hightower is the backup cj is a change of pace back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,would you drop dion lewis for hightower as a handcuff
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tim hightower is the handcuff not spiller he took over last season when ingram got hurt and they resigned him ingram catches passes now too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cj spiller has split first team reps almost equally with ingram in the preseason i know hightower took over at the end of last year but we have to remember he is old as dirt and wasnt anything special i think spiller might actually have some value this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think a decent amount of targets ingram got last year will switch to spiller this year i wouldnt say spiller is the backup though tim hightower is the backup and spiller will have his own role
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just feel cj was hurt all year last year he is fragile as fk but i believe he will eventually get the we all know what he can do when healthy depending on how many bench spots you have he can be a cheap steal if all goes right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,spiller was barely used last season and they signed hightower who hadnt played in years when ingram went down to injury i think that says it all
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hightower is the backup but i think id rather start spiller for a slightly higher ceiling both would have fairly low floors imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its hightower spiller gets like touches per game regardless of whether its ingramhightower as the bell cow no clue why they dont get spiller more involved considering he makes per year it makes me think spiller was hurt last season but ill be damned if i draft him now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keep an eye out on daniel lasco young blood in an old backfield that is injuryprone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hightower is doubtful to make the team it would than be either marcus murphy or daniel lasco pending who makes the roster hightower was just and team reps the past two weeeks and payton wants to keep both round picks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh yeah dion lewis may not come back until week thats a long time to waste a bench spot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as always it depends on bench size and how deep you are at rb outside of ingram
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if ingram is your then yeah thats too long of a wait for me and my team has a large bench if you are counting on dion to win your league youll have already lost it by week if ingram goes down even without ingram drop him and use that slot to trade in breakout prospects
fantasyfootball,not_removed,should i pick up robinson or is it a full blown rbbc if ingram goes down edit hightower
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as an ingram owner im way more worried about spiller than hightower hes had two down years due to injuries but it seems like he is fully healthy again people forget how skilled and explosive spiller was as a feature down back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i would think spiller would take over sproles role
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hightower is doubtful to make the team it would than be either marcus murphy or daniel lasco pending who makes the roster do you have a source for this as of last friday august has this to say about hightower hightower was the fourth running back to enter the game for new orleans behind mark ingram cj spiller and travaris cadet but saints beat writers noted that hightower remains the teams no big back behind ingram spiller and cadet play similar roles still with spiller now earning extensive firstteam playing time hightowers handcuff appeal has taken a hit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,khiry robinson dude hes on the jets now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hightower is the only other saints rb that i believe is worth rostering but i wouldnt waste bench space on a handcuff unless ingram was my
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sproles hasnt played for the saints in do you think they still have that role carved out in their playbook
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i believe hightower is going to stay on the team he did great when ingram was out and is doing great in camp murphy on the other hand is having a lot of fumbling problems
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i work for the saints media but really there isnt a handcuff behind ingram other than spiller i would just stay away if ingram goes down the saints arent keeping rbs ingram and spiller are locks murphy is the kick returner and lasco plays special teams too well to cut him both being round picks this makes hightower the odd man out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow my bad meant hightower lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah ingram is my behind l miller but i know ingram has durability issues so not sure if i should handcuff him i have foster on my bench along with r jennings and t coleman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im playing a team ppr my current rb situation is ingram mccoy gio ware do you think its worth it to pick up hightower was considering handcuffing ingram during the draft but was unsure who the handcuff would be
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it just worked well for them and when they signed spiller he seemed like the perfect guy to replace sproles role which no relied on heavily to move the chains and in minute drills however i have no real idea if that is how they will use him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you sure sean payton hasnt been especially enamored with the thought of murphy returning punts as of late
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in ppr gio is already a viable if hill goes down hes a lowend
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id pick up hightower if ingram goes down hed have a higher ceiling than gio and hes the only other rb aside from shady who at this point has a clear role on an offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr per passing td auction budget with the price to keep for this year keeper maximum aaron rodgers melvin gordon lesean mccoy jeremy hill robert kelley doug baldwin sammy watkins devante parker josh doctson martavis bryant kevin white tyler eifert melvin gordon is a slam dunk leaning shady and rodgers after that watkins is tempting but sort of a health concern and martavis seems like a great value but unlikely to be worth a keeper spot just based on assumed value vs the assumed value of the other players vs

fantasyfootball,not_removed,what pick do you have if you somehow have the throw dj back and get a keeper thats always my strategy anyway
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dj and ware if you think jc wont be back tymont will have some big games but theres some reason gb wont use him properly i think hes got some sort of injury gb is hiding or they know hes fragile as fuck idk id keep ware and try to snatch jc in the midrounds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sane
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for me shady isnt secure enough for new hc probably will reduce his huge rushing attempts and with watkins back there might be half of a passing game hill and kelley are out they just wont get enough guaranteed work for wrs i love the upside of bryant and watkins but if i had to choose one id say watkins partly because of the possibility of trading him after he has a big game which he will and then probably get hurt baldwin is too expensive and white parker and doctson wont get the work i dont like keeping qbs but thats a personal preference in summation then for me gordon bryant and watkins for a total of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gordon eifert and whoever you feel best about between watkins martavis and rodgers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gordon watkins bryantparker fuck spending money
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rodgers gordon and baldwin imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gordon for so you can keep him for next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,with woodhead coming back id lean towards jordy here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,similar boat for me but team standard round pick for either i keep flipping between the two i also have arob for a round keep so i might lean to keep lewis to have balance of rb and wr going into the draft tough to overlook rishard seemingly being the prime titans wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,michael thomas for me that value is just too good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you think gordon loses that many touches after his performance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kinda late but after super bowl seeing the game james white had i think im going with rishard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not too late im doing the same really cant trust whether or not lewis is going to get any consistent play with ne at least rishard is the primary wr for now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,raiders got a lot better by adding osemele theyll start penn osemele hudson jackson and howard though rt will be fought for in camp carr is for sure worth a late round pick especially if you want brady and i like latavius too but his adp is just a liiiiitle too high for me im pretty sure its somewhere around the or but i dont have the info in front of me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,san diego didnt make a ton of moves but their entire line was injured at some point or another last season and they should be healthy to start this season i cant imagine them not improving that should help melvin gordonwoodhead might help rivers but he probably wont need to throw times a game so maybe not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,falcons improved their oline with the addition of alex mack at center allowing them to move guys on the line to better spots from which they can improve this will give ryan one of the best lines hes had since being in the league freemancoleman julio and everyone else could be much better with matt having some actual time to throw the ball and larger holes being opened for the rbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,vikings shored up an awful ol this offseason though i still dont think that makes teddy is fantasy relevant should help diggstreadwell and possibly ap
fantasyfootball,not_removed,broncos have starters different than what they started in if okung and zambrillo can stay healthy they should be much improved but they were one of the worst olines in the league last season so they have almost no chance of being worse
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think the lions ol got better decker is far and away better than any of our other fill in tackles last year and glasgow should be an upgrade over swanson at center from a physicality standpoint they definately should run the ball better not saying theyre going to be top in the league but they definately should improve
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chicago got shuffled quite a bit bushrod slauson montgomery ducasse long leno whitehair r grasu long massie itll remain to be seen how that will turn out they are switching to a zone blocking scheme and have slimmed down significantly overall i thing the right side of the line will be an improvement but the left side will depend on how the rookie whitehair handles the transition to the nfl as a whole i expect pass blocking to improve run blocking may suffer from a bit of wheel spinning to start but id expect their spinning to catch as they adjust and improve as the season goes on
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id say the dolphins got a great deal better health plus free agency depth should make them much improved tunsil obviously can have an impact day offensively theres a lot different better i feel in miami this year ajayi could blow up but realistically i think he finishes above average this season maybe not top but close also drake could be a solid pick later on well see what happens next season bc miami being miami could suck but ive got high hopes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seattle seahawks improved the size of their line but talent remains to be seen worth keeping an eye on during the preseason
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i really feel like the carrbrady combo are perfect carr is a late round stud raider homer but still to compliment brady during his suspension
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a bears fan slauson was one of our best olinemen last year but just didnt fit our scheme anymore hell be good for you guys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do you think mack will have that big of an impact on the falcons i can see it affecting freeman a lot and for the better too since hes a northsouth between the tackles runner but im not sure how hell have a serious impact in pass protection i know hell be an upgrade over whoever it was you had last year i just dont know that itll be like the one piece you were missing to go to the superbowl kind of thing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how did the improve their line
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is massie the lt or rt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh im a giants fan but we havent done much with our oline worth mentioning
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no single player cost their team more games last season than the atlanta falcons starting center
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they go from one of the worst starting centers in the nfl to arguably the best centers are typically also responsible for calling out the blocking assignments and macks experience will be huge in that regard and should make everyone on that line better ofcourse its not the one piece they needed to go to the superbowl but they have a chance to have a decent line this year which is a huge upgrade from last season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is it the piece they needed to get to the superbowl no but i do believe that it will affect ryan and the recivers in a positive way because the center position was one of the glaring issues on the line last season we can see that the previous center couldnt hike the ball properly most times it was too high or too low and he fumbled it to the other team alot he couldnt keep pressure off ryan that well either so for them to have gone and gotten a center in alex mack who is the best at the postion is a large buff for the offense ryan will have more time and less pressure on him to throw the ball and with the pieces he has on offense could correspond pretty nicely in fantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drafted a center in the first round and i think they also added a couple of guys later in the draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think he will be rt leno has worked at lt before and all reports have shown massie to push long back into rg i could be wrong but i believe in arizona he played primarily rt as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dang was their center that bad i didnt watch too many falcons games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,unfortunately you cant really count on rookie ol draft picks to be serviceable for years it takes a little time for them to develop into nfl caliber players so its looked at as more of an investment rather than an immediate upgrade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he wasnt a bad blocker but he consistently botched snaps and stepped on matts foot when he was trying to hand the ball off to the rb watch the falconssaints primetime game tnf mnf i dont recall to see a good example of just how bad he was as a c hes moving to g this season so hopefully his talents will be put to use while masking his extreme snapping deficiency
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ryan kelly has been touted as the best center prospect in the past years hell definitely start and be an improvement over the revolving door at center the colts have employed the past few years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,didnt the pouncey brothers start as rookie centers and become rock solid starters and studs for their teams i wouldnt just automatically count out a first round center
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sure i was just saying you cant or shouldnt count on them to be serviceable
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its an indefensible play the other team has no way to even try to stop it stupid how about they connect two hoops to the top of each goalpost and if the qb can chuck it through one they get points instead of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how about if it goes through the uprights the ball is spotted at the yard line instead of the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mother tucker indisputable round g e t h y p e e t h y p e
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no fuck this idea lets think this through a team is down a td with minutes to go they drive minutes and score extra point is good tied ball game this team can now kick the shit out of the ball to score an extra point go up by and now presumably no kickoff return which would typically be a squibbed kick this eliminates some of the most exciting parts of football around return tds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like tucker but holy hell fuck the ravens them proposing this is like me being the only guy with a gun at a knife fight and proposing allowing guns
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sounds ridiculously dumb i get that tucker is a god and trying to figure out how he can win the whole game by himself with that offense but thats just absurd imo but wtf do i know i guess
fantasyfootball,not_removed,of course the coach with the best kicker wants this rule i cant see it happening it would be the only uncontested play during the game how would the other team prevent them from scoring
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its nonsense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this rule could happen just because of fantasy football
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dumb only way it would work is if you are trying for the point kick you have to kick if off from the or instead of the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cfl has it its called a rouge its a joke up here at least to me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this came up in a drunk convo between friends one time and i still think its an awesome idea new rule whoever scores the td has to kick the extra point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,very dumb but ill entertain your question from a fantasy perspective it would slightly increase the ceilings of all kickers the floors of the best few assuming a miss wouldnt be points from a return yardage standpoint this would likely reduce overall return yards across the league as most kicks would go out the back of the end zone edit words
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he was kidding
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its the year of the kicker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id like real football to take a page out of fantasy football and score the field goal points by yardage ie points for yards points for etc
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive actually been suggesting this for a long time now i think it would be great for the game make it a little closer plus so many injuries are caused by kickoff returns maybe even a tiny bit safer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when they were trying to change the rules last year i wanted them implement a scoring system where xps were determined based on distance the further back you take it from the more points you got would make kickers more useful for just about everyone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,better rule eliminate kickers every team must go for after every td and all ensuing possessions start on the would anyone honestly miss kickers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,justin tucker seems like the kind of guy who calls fouls in pick up basketball when he isnt scoring
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a brees owner yes please
fantasyfootball,not_removed,most important factor imo theres no counter play to this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,alley oops gets points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats called quidditch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that crazy rule where you can kick a field goal after a fair catch without interference is indefensible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this i like much more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,once kickers perfect the new strategy and begin consistently forcing a return by kicking it inside the this could happen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely a better idea than the garbage tucker wants but would there ever be incentive to allow normal kickoffs in the field of play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah but it gets tucker more points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how is it any different than an extraextra point every team gets this opportunity after each score
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it also seems broken in the right conditions what stops a kicker from repeatedly kicking kickoff goals and never letting the other team possess the ball
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not only the best kicker but the offense most reliant on that kicker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kicker faces linebackers yards from the ball
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not completely
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so a yarder is worth one point less than a touchdown why would you reward a team for failing to move the ball closer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,teams down less than in fg range with only seconds left on the clock
fantasyfootball,not_removed,justin tucker owners would
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fantasy handball
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this seems fair
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in an opera voice fooooooooulllllll
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a cam owner no please unless you get points for sailing it over the hoop by feet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no its not tell the punter to kick it farther or dont go and out on your goal line this you literally cant stop it could be the opening kickoff and you are already down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what is this rule i dont get it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no but i think the nfl wants to reduce as many returns as possible because of how violent they tend to be
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id keep him in my dynasty league if they did this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,extra points can be blocked see saintsbroncos no one is blocking a kickoff
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think he saying the kicking team gets a point but then the opposing team takes possession as with any kickoff that goes into the endzone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,with no roughing the kicker penalty
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tell that to bills fans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well if thats your reasoning wouldnt the defense of the point kickoff be not letting them score in the first place to earn a kickoff
fantasyfootball,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikifaircatchkick if a team calls a fair catch on a kickoff or a punt they have an option to attempt a free kick from the spot of the catch which the defense cant interfere its essentially like a kickoff formation but if it goes through the uprights its points like a regular field goal you rarely see it because its only useful in very specific situations for one thing kickers and punters are very good in the nfl and very rarely is the fair catcher even close to field goal range secondly even if they were in range might as well just drive down the field so that you can possibly get a td or just get a closer field goal so really it only works if there is very little time on the clock to do anything else and if it was fair caught in field goal range which that combo hardly ever happens
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why wouldnt you keep him in a full dynasty sounds like a keep some league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,before the extra point rule change extra points were something like percent and were almost never blocked nobody is kicking what amounts to an yard field goal with close to that consistency
fantasyfootball,not_removed,exactly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they kickoff to start the game or the half regardless of how the defence does
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pretty sure harbaugh is the only coach to try it in recent memory
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man keeper good call
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah and each team gets guarunteed chance to do it that seems fair to me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i feel like theres a decent number of kickers who could do this and it would just even out to be on guaranteed kickoffs but idk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when did i say it wasnt fair it would have to be fair why not give each team chances to hit an yard field goal but there centre has to kick it if they hit it its points thats also totally fair good thinking
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well you implied it wasnt fair when you were saying that theres no way to defend it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mind showing me where i said that also how on earth is something being indefensible unfair its stupid i didnt say it was unfair anywhere its a stupid idea
fantasyfootball,not_removed,your beef with the rule is that they get a free indefensible shot for point after they score i took what you said as the other team doesnt have a shot to atop them from scoring which could be considered unfair thats what it seemed like you were saying but clearly you care far more about this hypothetical rule proposition then i do so have fun
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its okay to be wrong about what you thought dont worry it happens to everyone dont get worked up about it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,doesnt mean anything for fantasy but luck is about to get paid definitely deserves it heres to hoping they can protect him last year was brutal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they havent released the details of the yet but i bet its huge im expecting a monster year from him this year if he can stay healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,million for years whoa
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well ive certainly seen contract deals being a distraction in general and arguments though now debunked that players perform better in a contract year so it certainly cant hurt his fantasy value that he has security in his job through just sayin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,canadiansandgoggles draft sheet best thing out there imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you are doing yahoo you can click their name and their lineup will show up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just make an excel spreadsheet ahead of time with a column for each team and a row for each position we roster then as the draft goes along i fill it in accordingly that lets me see what teams still need to fill what positions for example obviously more columns for more teams positions team team team qb wr wr wr rb rb te wrt k dst bn bn bn bn
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i added each pick to a custom clickydraft board online as it went did an espn online draft while also crossing names off the beersheet really helped me visualize and see how other people were drafting and easily determine if i could wait on certain positions just like in a live draft with a real draft board nearly impossible to keep up with in mocks i tried because so many people leave by round and it autodrafts instantly so it goes too fast but in a full league with real people making picks you should have enough time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if im in a position near the turn but not on the turn i always know how many of what position the teams have before its my pick again do all of them have a qb if so then ill take one with my pick around the turn and get talent now that wont be avaliable then
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like using httpwwwvirtualdraftboardcom for my drafts its a little tedious and sometimes you have to click the crap out of the buttons to get the player dropdown but it definitely helped me zig when everone else zagged in of my drafts so far
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if youre doing a fleaflicker draft you can print out the draft board ahead of time to make notes with
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i print out beersheets when drafting and cross players out when drafting even when online sounds dumb and simple but i havent found a way to keep track effectively and fast enough within my computer yet pen and paper works best for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,right but for example if i want to track picks across all teams so i know if i can wait on rb because the other teams have drafted a lot of rbs already what is an easy foolproof way to do that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just have a tiers sheet where i cross off names seems to work pretty well or if you use beer sheets just print them and mark off names
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i do a hand drawn chart and fill it up it up as the draft goes the chart has the same layout as httpsfantasyfootballcalculatorcom
fantasyfootball,not_removed,click times
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is really closeim gonna give a slight edge to lamar hes a few years younger hasnt had the injury history and i think bob is gonna give him the ball a ton in houston he finished as i think the rb last year in ppr and barely got the ball in miamiprobably would have been lower if jamaal stayed healthy though you can say you have no clue how miller will be used but im gonna guess similar to how arian foster was used in houston if i can get either of them in the second round though im going to be happy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,while i think lamar has the potential to finish top this year i cant help but be cautious of a relatively unproven running back in a new system then again jamaals knee scares me so its a toss up between the two if theyre still there at pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,exactly its a toss up im honestly thinking if i have last pick in a man that i take miller at and charles at
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr drop sterling shepard add tyreek hill

fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr drop maclin for peterson i know i shouldve dropped him a long time ago rb zeke martin freeman coleman morris wr evans crabtree r matthews moncrief maclin i think there maybe be more upside to peterson than maclin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj owner drop boyd for tyreek or hold thank you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,standard add gabriel drop parker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,which one of the following would you want on your team for the rest of the season team ppr randall cobb dontrelle inman tyler boyd thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i currently have the arizona cardinals and the kansas city chiefs defense but they have hard weeks this week should i drop them for another and in the case that i do ravenschargerspatriots are all available thanks for the help
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my only te is martellus bennett should i add vance mcdonald or ladarius green i need to win this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there is way tie for first in my man standard league qb cam rb lat murray ingram booker hill lewis wr julio tyrell cobb marvin shepard sammy watkins te ebron and gates def miami dropping shepard for capernick i dont know who to drop for a kicker marvin jones cobb ebron or booker or lewis there is also tyreek parker avaliable too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,standard need to drop either vinatieri or lambo picking up golden tate who do i drop vinatieri has been disappointing lately and lambos matchups look good ros but i have a hard time dropping vinatieri
fantasyfootball,not_removed,add dontrelle inman or taylor gabriel kinda leaning towards taylor gabriel atm
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr top waiver pick and need to decide on my te for ros do i drop austin hooper for w tye j gresham v mcdonald c walford im leaning towards gresham
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man standard clinched playoffs im a tyrell williams owner just added djax off waivers but inman and t benjamin are fa should i drop djax and pick up one of them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team standard should i drop devante parker might have an injury for malcolm mitchell i feel like i should take a flyer an mitchell but im not too sure what are your thoughts edit i just saw that charles sims is on waivers too im a doug martin owner should i drop parker for him as a handcuff
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr drop dion lewis for kenneth dixon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a preliminary matter i couldnt make any moves until aj was moved from ir to bench stupid doubtful designation so i had to drop boyd added san diego dst for that sweet week cle matchup dropped jarvis landry simply cant trust him in mias runfirst and often offense doesnt even have a serviceable floor anymore wrs include fitzgerald dt watkins aj please come back soon dsts miami sd place hoping to clinch a bye with a win this week thanks and good look everyone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr drop newton for winston have stafford starting this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team standard te reed fiedorowicz drop fiedorowicz add vdavis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team standard drop k benjamin or r mathews add tyreek hill playoffs weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,some guy has decided to drop ty hilton just now for whatever reason how should i handle this he is among wrs so far but his schedules good matchups at this point are just jets now and raiders at the end
fantasyfootball,not_removed,would you rather keep ebron or marvin jones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,add taylor gabriel and drop sss i already added davante adams for mike wallace
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tyreek sanders dropped bc of a short bench and malcolm mitchell are still available i managed to scoop up gabriel and had to drop dion did i make the right choice or do i pick up sanders its standard and my team is carrmariota ajayigoremartin kelvinwatkinsadams eifert dan bailey denver sd defense is also there please help me choose im in a must win edit kelvin is finally droppable so i dropped him for tyreek since hes facing dick sherm this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,should i drop pit eli rogers and pick up chi marquess wilson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sounds about right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mos def
fantasyfootball,not_removed,deleted
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same thing im wondering between coleman or desean for gabriel coleman is getting the targets just not producing and desean is still considered the im just worried theres too many targets in atl to allow gabriel to keep up this production in your situation id personally drop sproles to take a flier on him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how many rbs do you start i dont think id drop dion for hunt he may even be a better start than hunt anyway id play murray and coleman over hunt anyway i think miller is probably going to play regardless
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i havent seen dion do anything and i am not seeing him doing anything anytime soon they want to use blount and wont cut back whites touches as he is still doing fine that backfield is too crowded i am fine with the hunt switch then i feel the bills are trying to go pedal to the mettle to make a playoff spot i like the wilson switch too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is vernon davis taken and ppr or standard i like brate for the schedule and upside but rudolphs schedule is good ros too beside week jax i would say put a claim in on both brate rudolph
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what about vernon davis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brate with the better schedule and better offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brate times no in the playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,def drop cook for mcdonald i dont think you should roster tes so you should see who else is on the ww and think about dropping bennett he hasnt done much to earn your trust and i think hell have one or two good games ros but itll be hard to guess when
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id drop cook but bennett is also struggling with his ankle issue and i think he is also droppable if you have other te options
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like that move i think hill is a much bigger part of the offense and has a lot more upside than beasley
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes and keep fiedo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drop thielen i prefer inman and his potential schedule down the road also depending on tyrells shoulder health i also like fedora with his schedule also because they want to force feed the ball to hopkins when it should go to fiedo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id take brate over fiedorowicz but im not sure if id drop olsen for either theyre not performing that much better than olsen edit just remembered about the panthers this makes olsen look even less favorable edit with your wrs i would probably pick them up in the order you have it inmans schedule is the best and with travis getting little love from rivers and tyrell potentially being injured labrum issue i think hes a good pick up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would drop tyrod for keap both have solid ros schedules but i prefer kaep a little more than tyrod i really dont think you can go wrong with either though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for playoffs youre going to use rivers all the way for week id use taylor and not feel bad at all
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keep rivers and kaep
fantasyfootball,not_removed,edelman bruh no brainer there tyreek may score more but edelman is the safer play ros brady is lights out and loves edelman chiefs have been known to go weeks without passing tds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id actually go hill for standard edelman has had only one game with fantasy points the entire season and hill has had games over the past weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,edelman is available go for him then try t hill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,deleted
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes youre not going to play thielen over any of your other wrs then youll have kaep in week and kaepstafford in week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,of course do that switch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kaepernick has a better floor vs the saints d is actually getting better but is it possible to hold both and see how that rolls
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wait why do you need d willy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have about the same receivers and in your case drop alshon for dwill i would start your other receivers over alshon when he comes back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,depends on your current set of wrs and players available what are they
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like brate better generally speaking although technically cj has two very good matchups in a row id say fairly even but i give brate the edge based on red zone targets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id pick up brate over cj just because brock is god awful i guess cj is the only one actually connecting on some level with brock on that team but still
fantasyfootball,not_removed,without doubt patriots have put up one very good game and one decent game this season theyve had some cake matchups already and done shit with them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,might not get him in a team league if your team is deep id consider dropping good money on him not a faab expert but if you can survive one of your top rbs going down on depth then you are reaching a point where you dont need to hang onto much of it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think it depends if youre going to make the playoffs if so id drop crowell as hes underperforming compared to the other two
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id drop crowell if you want to take the flyer for him in the playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt mike wallace is a proven talent marquess wilson is points chasing he might be great next game and yeah you miss out but he might be shit too he had some drops barkley is still unpredictable who knows if next game his target of favor is cameron meredith etc edit i dont mind being downvoted exactly but id rather have a discussion im open to having my mind changed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,too many qbs drop eli if you ask me id drop the steelers for the chargers i would not drop gostkowski for mcmanus
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think you are on the right track if you are looking for someone to talk you off the ledge it aint gonna be me i say jumperrruhh push hopkins instead
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ya bro he can sing he can dance and hes got jokes to boot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yuppppppp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think cjs only eligible for return in week and there is just no way on earth you can start him in the championship game add sims for sure
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dropped alshon as soon as he got suspended since i probably wont be confident enough to start him when he does come back depending on who your qb is kaep could be a good insurance policy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tyreek production is highly dependent on maclin being out so i wouldnt spend too much on him stanford has a good playoff schedule and i wouldnt want anyone to have wilson i would drop stanford over wilson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id say the only two viable ones are vance and henry the others are just miserably inconsistent or injury prone ertz is pretty solid though he can be frustrating but thats the nature of tes in general literally no te has been a surefire money in the bank play this year gronk is close obviously and kelce is having an extremely respectable season and delanie walker jordan reed too outside of that its a messy scary place
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id get dwill just bc hes a higher upside backup sims has a higher floor ros and a good schedule but i dont see him getting any starts over your guys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,burkhead is the safe play ap is the gamble wouldnt touch bibbs even as a handcuff situation personally so if you like safety or gambling you know what to do
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id play rivers in week and cousins in week but he might be worth keeping just so your opponent doesnt get him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think youll play any of those waiver options over anyone you currently have
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i probably wouldnt make the switch but i could understand dropping smallwood or even coleman for one of them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i probably wouldnt drop him for watkins but in a return yardage league i could see hill being a stud but im no expert in return yardage leagues so i could be wrong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i personally would drop matthews for watkins the bills offense is a bit better than the eagles one and sammy is the clear there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drop matthews for watkins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,looks like youre doing well id drop boyd for tyreek probably keep winston but thats a close one i wouldnt make changes on the others
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drop the giants for tyreek broncos are gonna kill it moving forward
fantasyfootball,not_removed,adams from gb if hes available drop boyd immediately for him drop snead for t hill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would keep crowder over tyreek
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id definitely go with enunwa of those options i like his week and he should have some upside over the others
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats tough of the two id have dropped boyd for hill but owning aj id probably stay tight with boyd and not add hill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,depends on your roster weakness probably but just looking at upside id go with henry personally hes looked great when he has opportunities and rb depth can be a problem if injuries happen late
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nobody else you can drop
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if its yahoo you can keep him in the ir slot until you need to add someone else
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id probably drop lewis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same about gabriel and inman im thinking gabriel
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dixon has an immediate impact i would take him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thomas seems to be the more stable out the two but both are in spread the ball everywhere offenses
fantasyfootball,not_removed,michael thomas has some juicy matchups coming up and he has a really high floor go with him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thomas imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nope id definitely keep cobb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a backup to reed id pick up davis if not for owning reed id probably go fiedorowicz for just overall point potential rest of season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no youre absolutely reasonable there id do the same
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drop stafford for either one rivers has a great matchup this week as well followed by a cake playoff run kaeps weekly floor ceiling are bonkers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,better than eagles d thats for sure
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if peterson comes back it would be week against packers in his first game against gb with the vikings o line and his production in the first two weeks could cost you the playoff game i dont see how you start over your rbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,depends if you need a win now in week or week in playoffs when cin plays browns i dont think tyreek will get as good of production if maclin is back but green could be back soon as well is another thing to consider
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like gabriel play off schedule and ros of more i think hes worth the chance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,boyd
fantasyfootball,not_removed,vance has the safer floor but green has the better upside but awful floor if hes not utilized
fantasyfootball,not_removed,vance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tyreek now doubt about it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,are you starting booker this week and tyrell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drop vinatieri the playoffs look awful for him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drop vinatieri
fantasyfootball,not_removed,quincy has a good playoff schedule and has great chemistry with fitz wilson is still unproven to be the number targer but woudl be my second mitchell seems dependent on gronk being out and hogan still domiantes snap counts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,both seem like the same type of players of low volume and making big plays but i like gabriel better because i think he can succeed even in a game like kc where the top cb is on julio again and overtake sanu i just think chargers besides tyrell and gates everyone gets a field day every once in a while tyrell injury doesnt look severe and benjamin is coming back to form
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i personally like vance the best cuz kapernick is hot and hes the number target
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i personally wouldnt djax seems to be back and cousins is slinging the ball around like a mad man id say keep him inman has some injury and benjamin is just a boom or bust player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,depends on your other wrs are you ever going to play parker if not grab sims
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dixon will have the better floor but lewis has the better ceiling
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would for sure with those no games coming up also car put of their centers on ir yesterday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would better offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well both kc and ten have denver during play off weeks i think benjamin has the better playoff schedule but i rather keep matthews because hill production rely on maclin being out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you do everything in your power to get him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wth you get that man asap
fantasyfootball,not_removed,start two with one flex i think youre right i just know a couple podcasts i listen to were saying to handcuff miller because of injury concernsbut i like dion over hunt even if miller is out and i feel like i have enough depth to justify not handcuffing miller thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sorry this is standard i believe davis was taken oddly enough
fantasyfootball,not_removed,would you say its worth it to drop bennett for kaepernick my starting qb is brees but you never know
fantasyfootball,not_removed,would you say its worth it to drop bennett for kaepernick my starting qb is brees but you never know
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks i was thinking the same thing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks man i wasnt really considering dropping olsen more so if i should prioritize one of those tes over wr depth with only dropping thielen dont want to drop anyone else i think im going inman mitchell brate fedora wilson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks just what i needed to hear putting in the claim right now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i probably shouldve been more specific i meant drop tyrod i think im gonna roll with kaep tho
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if bell goes down i have a proven
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man bench qb mariota rb listed already wr brown evans watkins te gates d broncos dolphins k bryant holding dolphins for the week matchup broncos have vs ne
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill have to drop the steelers but the next guy would have to be eli in your opinion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think i will do that thank you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,haha yeah i want to drop him but seeing that percent owned is tough i really hope he doesnt burn me in the playoffs if i drop him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre right thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive got rivers for starting qb as of right now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed with this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats who i was leaning towards as well thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,other wrs are ab ty pryor and watkins pryor has been pretty consistent and has a bye then cin buf and sd
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would be picking him up as a backup in case one of my rbs gets injured between now and then thats pretty much the role maclin has at the moment
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thinking the same thing i realize hes boom and low targets but the upside is so great
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who would you drop for him i would need to drop for the kicker and one for tyreek
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i could start booker over lat murray or flex him cant bench tyrell uness hes out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea i just remembered maclin thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thought so im still confused as hell what he was thinking but i already put in my claim
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had the same reaction thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but i like dion over hunt even if miller is out and i feel like i have enough depth to justify not handcuffing miller i agree with this keep dion over hunt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ya dont drop dion u could be kicking yourself for years if you do hunt aint going to make or break you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes if you dont have a backup qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,absolutely i would play kaep over brees just once week when brees is ari but id drop marty b for kaep no doubt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no complaints here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you could try to add some wr depth but i cant say im crazy about either rb drop id lean towards booker dropping if you wanted to though probably most would disagree with me what are some good wr ww targets you could get
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think so brady and kaep is a pretty damn solid ros combo and i think you really have to struggle to put eli ahead of either of them except maybe if youre hesitant to start brady vs denver and dont like kaeps matchup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,unless he starts throwing the ball to himself thats the kind of player you hope someone picks up and starts against you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like all of these more than tyreek long term if its an issue with getting into playoff and need immediate payoff tyreek is playing atlanta this week too id sit tight if that were my team if you feel like taking a chance i would drop matthews or watkins of what you have edited team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im just saying maclin will come back earlier but i dont know if he will show up at all like tyreek as i rather pick up sims to martin then ap if you want rb handcuffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,like i think the same script for cardinals game can happen for kc kc lets wr score a lot them rather then rb so freeman wont be getting as many tds having peters cover julio again plus parker still injured
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drop jones and enron
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ok thank you we have a similar lineup so just inquiring
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but if you need a play this week tyreek is a top add
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i appreciate the input good luck in your league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its hard to drop either but once i list a few ww targets youll see why im thinking about dropping both with my league having only about super competitive teams as others lost interest from losing a lot of games early and having only a man bench the ww is stacked with wr wr on ww mthomas dadams rmatthews and thill i think are the best options available oh and i forgot i need to drop for a qb this week and possibly for week with ten vs den
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe i can sneak another qb in the spot or i have solid depth at wr and rb to play a guy in the op spot ill drop eli then dangit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats a pretty good point chances are he wont put up more than in a week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tyreek just played denver kc goes up against atl this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,add michael thomas immediately how is he still on waivers even on short benches i would almost certainly imagine him an everyweek starter after him adams then matthews then hill in that order imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you atlanta this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,alright cool thanks for your help
fantasyfootball,not_removed,things to consider adding thomas is a massive block from your leaguemates too and against detroit this week thomas might even be a good starter over watkins whos still gotta get back a little more and has a road matchup against oakland
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you took the thoughts right out of my head thats exactly my main reasoning for wanting to just rid of the rb im not going to use these wr have better upside and block my opponents from getting them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sometimes thats just as valuable as a player you might start
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you guys only have yourself to blame if you let an auto drafter get johnson and zeke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,someone traded obj for christine michael
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a guy drafted cam newton first overall he didnt even start cam newton the first game of the season he started matt ryan instead
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not this year but last year i dropped dj like an hour before he had his first big game last year in a dynasty
fantasyfootball,not_removed,someone in my league drafted cam newton with his first pick brandon marshell with his second matt forte with his third erick decker with his fourth and the jets defense toward the end
fantasyfootball,not_removed,guy traded dj before the first week for crowell and riddick in ppr we are still giving him shit for that one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,traded away ingram for lacy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,two things both me i traded delanie walker had reed for ty montgomery the day before he got his rb tag in yahoo i drafted lamar miller over david johnson with the pick in the first round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a guy dropped jordan howard a week too early and no one put in a waiver claim for him i woke up early to grab him off fa and has been my since week and my when melvin gordon went down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was in a ppr draft and chose hopkins over aj greendjzeke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i helped my gf in her work league person espn standard i dont think ive ever seen such terrible picks the first half of the first round in order cam newton zach miller aaron rodgers seahawks d andrew luck ty hilton then we take antonio brown the team we got antonio brown aj green allen robinson lesean mccoy jamaal charles dropped for ware cj anderson dropped for booker then tyreek hill jarvis landry ryan mathews jeremy langford dropped for howard marvin jones dropped for michael crabtree based gordon dropped for diggs then thielen rashad jennings philip rivers dropped for matt ryan travis kelce so yea there is a lot of shit in there like how were we able to get every big name free agent how was crabtreeware undrafted why would you ever take zach miller in the first round why would you take a defense in the first round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it would have been the capstone of his season if he had accidentally grabbed zach zenner instead of play zeke and crushed him in the ship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team gets david johnson matt forte spencer ware jamaal charles team gets mark ingram lesean mccoy and eddie lacy after week wtf another trade same teams team gets jordy nelson team gets jamaal charles after week another trade team gets mccoy promptly traded him team gets gurley another trade team gets obj team gets woodhead and lockett after week week team roster looked like i traded for david johnson missed playoffs wanted keeper so team had httpimgurcomaodzcp roster in the championship round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,showed up late to my draft because i was on a date couldnt get on wifi on time and auto drafted first round spot got dj won the ship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,might be late to the party but after travis benjamins first point week ppr the melvin gordon owner traded for him traded melvin gordon for travis benjamin straight up i screamed i emailed i texted i said he could take any player from my team in exchange for gordon anything to get him to trade melvin g to me he said no said tbenj was the guy to own in sd now ignored the fact that benjamin is the exact same boombust player he was in cleveland ignored gates return and henrys rise ignored gordons floor fuck that guy he admitted his stupidity in week or so but still fuck him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,at the time it had potential to be an even trade but it was a disaster for the guy i traded with i traded jamaal charles and a round pick for latavius murray and a round pick ended up beating him our backtoback defending champion in the wildcard definitely got the better end of that one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a guy in our league traded leveon bell to our commissioner week for russel wilson and theo riddick edit commish had picked up wilson off of waivers that same day and the guy who traded for him had the higher waiver priority
fantasyfootball,not_removed,traded ryan mathes and enunwa for demarco murray and eric ebron the demarco steal is my highlight and his lowlight killed his season carried mine
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got tom brady pretty close to the end of the draft because of his suspension sat on him for the first few weeks and lo and behold my boss needed a quarterback not only that but the pats were about to play the browns i traded him tom brady and jamaal charles for leveon bell i dont think it was an unfair trade the stars aligned and i saw my shot to get leveon but thats a trade i never would have done from the other side
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drafted hopkins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i made the worst move in my work league this season i dropped melvin gordon before week one we all know how that turned out lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,someone dropped leveon bell the week he came back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dropped ajayi after his crappy weeks early in the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,autodraft david johnson week trade m evans for a robinson win championship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dropping dak for cmike
fantasyfootball,not_removed,one of my non money leagues had a guy who dropped leveon bell because deangelo was doing so well they wouldnt bench him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i traded melvin gordon and djax for jeffery and matt jones this was the week before matt jones lost his job we also had a guy who traded dj for a hurt gronk and kenny britt take your choice which one is dumber
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was in ppr draft and took ap over juliodjgreen and then it came back around to me and i took charles over mccoyfreeman still made it the championship but damn my team wouldve been unstoppable with juliomccoy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,guy in my league dropped jordy nelson for davante adams after adamss game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr league i had the pick in the draft was planning on taking julio jones because obviously ab would go number he takes todd gurley lol i end up with ab and first place in the league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,k dixon and a foster for d freeman and j hill the trade was made before foster retiredwas like week or of our season this trade is obviously lopsided but we have a no veto policy this trade and how we handle trades will be reviewed in the offseason meeting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i traded next years and round picks for jay ajaiyi for my title run during the bye week after his back to back yard games i missed the playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,someone dropped shady either his bye week or a week i think he had an injury it was at the beginning of november
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i traded josh gordon for michael crabtree ten minutes after hearing gordon admitted himself to rehab
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i traded christine michael and cole beasley for tom brady
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id say its my entire league that let me draft lev bell with the pick and then proceeded to give me shit for drafting a suspended player giving me julio and bell i finished in my league shouldve have won but fucking rawls and sanders cost me the glory also i kept josh gordon on my roster for the longest time first as a legit hope then as a joke and the finally dropping him for the lotto ticket sammy watkins who i started sanders over because i didnt want him to succeed against my dolphins i put my team over my fantasy team and thats how ships sink
fantasyfootball,not_removed,friend traded his leveon bell for aj green the week before aj green went out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,someone drafted dion lewis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our comish with the week championship i have ab and leveon went and will probably lose this week oh btw on the line
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also losing a match by points because i started jeremy kerley vs ne instead of desean off an injury vs gb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dropped edelman before he decided to start producing won the ship without him though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,traded latavius after his td game with bmarsh to a guy in need of a wr hoping he would break out for lev bell rode lev to the championship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i traded zeke away for dez and newton didnt work out for me one bit i cite that the reason i got this year and not first
fantasyfootball,not_removed,someone on my league dropped ty hilton after the first two games picked him up so fast
fantasyfootball,not_removed,obj for floyd and fleener made me happy though since i was on the receiving end of that one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the autodrafternever set his lineup got first place this year this was after i went undefeated but my lineup tanked in the semis yes he had dj

fantasyfootball,not_removed,i traded away derek carr and latavius murray in week for matt jones i had deangelo williams and latavius as my big two rbs to start the year but bell came back and murray had turf toe i figured carr wouldnt be a bad trade because i had brady now and i was desperate for a running back worked out well for a week or two but then kelley took over finished out strong though making it to the semis tradedtraded fitzgerald for ware near the end ends had kelley but that trade was not my finest hour of fantasy foosball

fantasyfootball,not_removed,rosterwise our seed djfreemanjulioevansgordonrodgerskelce started malcolm mitchell over brandin cooks or jarvis landry in the semis he lost by three points scored the next week playing for third place would have been a championship win otherwise draftpicks going to have to say someone taking latavius murray in the although me trading my for ap last year and someone keeping martavis bryant in the are also options
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i traded jordy for booker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my money league we had a gal drop bell week i believe because he was suspended and didnt have the room for him on the roster guy in last gets him because he had the highest waiver guy goes from to winning the ship because of it i believe this season might be the last for the gal that dropped bell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for the first time after years of seeing people take gronk early and thinking what the fuck hes a te then consistently hating myself for not taking him by the time the year was up i finally took him in the first round with the pick this season and by the time the year was up i hated myself for taking him sigh so i guess im just going to hate myself by the end of the year consistently its the one constant

fantasyfootball,not_removed,how about someone offering me deandre hopkins for tevin coleman in like week it got vetoed but he is a savaant
fantasyfootball,not_removed,after adrian peterson got hurt but before we found out he was going on ir if i recall correctly the thought was that he would be out a few weeks and then come back my cousin traded for ad and tyler eifert in exchange for jarvis landry devonte freeman and ty hilton a terrible trade even if ad didnt get placed on ir he never heard the end of it then later in the year week he traded melvin gordon for allen robinson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dropped ty hilton and dez early in the season that was dumb what was worse was benching baldwin and thielen in week baldwin because he let me down all year and thielen because i was nervous that diggs would steal targets i also grabbed and played simms when martin was a surprise inactive instead of rodgers i lost the championship to my leaguerival by points because of those decisions

fantasyfootball,not_removed,traded away matt ryan for jordy nelson and demarco murray worked out great for me edit drafted tom brady so i traded away matt when brady got off bye

fantasyfootball,not_removed,guy in my league offered another guy antonio brown for terelle pryor when that was a thing total furtada

fantasyfootball,not_removed,i traded lacy and josh gordon for peterson and we in week everybody lost

fantasyfootball,not_removed,friends league he traded d johnson for gurley
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man league with bench spots we play standard with wr spots point paswing tds and we give return tds and points at i know we really should have reduced the bench size players stayed on my team matt forte because i wasnt dropping him the last weeks he deserves a ring david johnson if you dont own him you dont get it happy birthday jesus jordan reed same as forte and ne after i saw the jets start imploding i wanted to hold them i made trades all to teams fighting for playoff spots while i was sitting high i held place all season after having the highest pf week week i traded away lesean mccoy and emmanuel sanders for julio week i traded away brandon marshall marvin jones and isaiah crowell for leveon bell week i traded away jonathan stewart and spencer ware for deandre hopkins and jameis winston week i traded will fuller and matt stafford for bilal powell week i traded away doug baldwin davante adams and walker for alshon jeffery the last trades were colossal fuckups we start wr and i had solid ones but wanted another stud instead of playing the guessing game every week cutler was coming back i really had a hunch hopkins was going to step up in the second half of the season thought i was onto something oops the other trades i was deep at rb and wanted to handcuff forte while betting against my saints doing well against winston the first were golden and together wiyh drafting dj overall won me my league my championship team was qb winston rb dj bell powell flex wr julio crowder tyreek te vernon davis k vinatieri def ne bench dixon forte watkins clay reed kc sd and marshawn motherfucking lynch i tried my hardest to lose by playing crowder over watkins but it all worked out standard league with return yards beat my younger brother who had aaron rodgers and zeke he posted we were both and had gotten byes week had agreed to chop the pot if we were in the ship way back in week because we didnt play each other on the regular season schedule extra bet of on the championship game if it happens it happened very fun christmas good year in all i highly advocate making package trades for studs early on if youre doing well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in the final and the person im playing against dropped bell after the first week with the highest waiver pick i scooped him up thing is this person has dj so she could have had a wrecking ball of a team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was desperate for a rb lost ap and foster early i was wr heavy i thought gurly was due to breakout rams d was keeping scores down and i thought that would mean la could gain momentum in the running game i asked for gurley she wanted eric decker decker is so consistent i didnt want to give that up i countered with mike evans she took it evans goes on to have a career year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drafted in order todd gurley alshon and keenan allen i finished
fantasyfootball,not_removed,had a dude pick the jets defense overall i wish i was joking
fantasyfootball,not_removed,guy in my league traded shady for carson palmer i received shady so dumb move for him 😬
fantasyfootball,not_removed,guy drops bell after week one to pick up phillip rivers to trade for obj i snagged bell after seeing him on the waiver wire and have beat the guy that dropped him every time ive played him this season including the semifinals weeks before the championship when bell went off for points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,passengers holy shit that movie was garbage and way in left field
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn i thought this said worst movie you saw this year and i came in ready its suicide squad but for real seeing someone trade martellus bennett for mike evans was pretty bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dropped drew brees mid season when i could have traded him matt ryan and kirk cousins were my other qbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,elliot was my first pick i had the last pick elliots and gordons performance got me to the finals unfortunately my championship is this week week and elliot isnt really playing and gordon is out picked up mefaddenjacquizz rogers and deangelo williams dont know who i should start
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i passed on david johnson not once not twice but three times in the draft he fell to and i had the pick in a man league i picked antonio brown allen robinson and jamaal charles over him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,traded deangelo williams for derrek henry it doesnt matter much now but i probably could have won some early season games with dw
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and this is why you dont have snake drafts folks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,auto drafted got johnson then zeke then evans league went qb crazy the first rounds got dalton and bortles in like the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that isnt the question here op clearly said that they failed and didnt blame anyone for it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,motherfucker that was my league too lmao
fantasyfootball,not_removed,coupled with not having an auction draft auction drafts eliminate shit managers that auto draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a bunch of real drafters allowed me to get zeke and gronkwho i traded for julio i went
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man that really tells the story of the over reactions to objs relatively slow first weeks people werent dumping him for peanuts but he was getting shipped off for way less than his actual value patience is a virtue
fantasyfootball,not_removed,found the sacko
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he must be on this site a lot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my league would never allow that we would all think they made a deal on the side
fantasyfootball,not_removed,obj for jamaal in my league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes a top receiver he had a bad year but for a backup running back for the awful seahawks running game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sounds like collusion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had a guy offer to trade me julian edelman for michael crabtree the same guy had the luckiest record and was almost a lock for the playoffs a week later the guy playing him was mia so i sent him an email offering to trade obj during objs byeweek for michael crabtree as a means to essentially poke him to get his attention to set his line up hoping he would see it so the guy didnt get another lucky win i didnt expect him to accept he accepted literally edelmen crabtree obj in one weeks time also the guy lost that game and his next gamesand missed the playoffs with a record due to pf tie breaker feels good man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a commish i would have blocked that just too lopsided
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tbf that second part was the right move
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the guy on the wheel in my draft picked cam and carson palmer worked really well for me in the seat
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in my league the guy that drafted cam in the also drafted russell wilson and dak prescott he had the worst team by far
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we had a guy draft cam overall and benched him week one for tyrod taylor safe to say he lost that week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in a dynasty wow this is some rthreadkillers shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our league is keeper and guy got dj last year for a so he gets him as a for years until they resethe also got bell in the second this year so will probably have a first round pick with bell and dj already locked upugh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,someone did that in our keeper league too i picked up dj the week he had a break out beat the guy who dropped dj in the finals this year i won the garbage bowl last year and as a result got the pick and drafted zeke keepersteam so options were limited i get dj for more season and zeke for two year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,someone did that in my dynasty last year as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my condolences
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brotherinlaw traded me dj in a halfdynasty league last year for stevie johnson he threw in ryan mathews i almost feel like i should toss him some of my backtoback championship earnings almost it was well before dj exploded but it basically ruined any kind of trade possibilities for lottery ticket young guys in our league i tried trading for sterling shepard before week and the owner wanted demarco murray jordan matthews
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i also did that luckily i was able to pick him back up but i has to keep him for a rounder adp instead of the where i drafted him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i almost did this in a draft was basically going for best available in the positions i wanted and went julio marshall and forte really wanted decker but just couldnt pull the trigger first picks would have all had the same bye with of them on what ended up being a dumpster fire of a team decker went to my brother at the next pick after he drafted ap keenan allen and doug martin he didnt do well this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how is that even possible crowell was nothing but a lateround flier and riddick went undrafted in a lot of leagues dj likely went first round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drafted dj with overall pick and got a little flack over it from some that thought he was a bit overvalued also took crowell later crowell did great for the first half of the season and dj pretty much won me the championship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill never understand why people will trade round picks for guys that they could have just drafted themselves ive heard of people doing for trades of higher picks for lower picks before the season even started if you want a particular player fine but then just draft that player because at least that way you arent helping another team get a high pick for assets they used way later in the draft in this case a person got the best player in the league for a couple of fairly low picks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wellim sure it looked good in week or something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drafted lamar miller over david johnson with the pick in the first round bad move in hindsight but at the time i dont think it was that crazy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if it makes you feel any better which it probably wont i drafted dj granted all but pick in front of him was defensible at the time but then took lamar miller at over bell i could have had dj and bell dj pulled me to the championship anyway but i would have felt a lot safer with bell there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got lamar miller over zeke in the round hindsight is a bitch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was in snake redraft leagues this year and never saw dj get past how does this even happen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dropped my kicker for jordan howard the week he took over bears were on mnf or snf i forget because i thought i would win easy ended up having to drop howard for a kicker to win because im a dipshit never got howard back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,causally grabbed him off waivers the day after claims went through we was my flex ros and was the best pick up i made this season overcame a point deficit on halloween to win thanks to him killing the vikings love jordan howard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a guy dropped jordan howard a week too early and no one put in a waiver claim for him i did that cause delanie walker got hurt at game time and i couldnt drop anyone else then i wasnt allowed to put in a waiver on him the next week since i dropped him on sunday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dropped jordan howard too people shouldnt forget he was a bit of a train wreck in the weeks before his break out game against minnesota kadeem carey was getting a bunch of touches langford was getting healthy ill draft jordan pretty high next year depending on what the bears do for a qb in the offseason if they do a patch job—ryan fitz for example ill pick jordan in the second hes gonna be dj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not even zach miller would take himself in the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please say she won the league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol look at the position ranks for everything but dst and kicker and even then you can think of sea as a top dst given the fact that they are generally so solid do you even bother to continue playing when a team looks so good that jordy nelson is at best a flex edit oh gronk goes down no problem just replace him with jimmy graham and let youre entire team of round quality players pick up the slack
fantasyfootball,not_removed,howd he get zeke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,even had gronk wow
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in half point ppr holy shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so basically dj and ware for ingram and mccoy thats not that bad at all
fantasyfootball,not_removed,howd the date go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same thing happened in my league the guy still couldnt get wifi by the round and auto drafted bell his first year playing ff and he won the championship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow that is surprising i was overall pick and took dj loved what i saw last year and in the preseason i didnt win the ship but have no regrets i have one of the best teams in ff history to not make the play offs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that sounds like more of collusion rather a than what a dummy move
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seriously this happened week if this was money league everyone should be leaving this league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a guy in my league drafted bell first round then announced early in round that he wanted tom brady and would do anything to get him so the guy with the next pick takes tom brady and trades him for bell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had this exact choice in the draft demarco or mathews and i obviously chose wrong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dropped melvin gordon before week one but why he was like a round pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dropped ajayi immediately after the draft i autodrafted him on accident
fantasyfootball,not_removed,someone in my league dropped him the week before somehow caught my attention and i picked him up but i sacrificed the week for him worth it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drafted foster and ajayi then dropped ajayi a day before ajayi went off because foster was coming back from injury and i needed the roster spot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got julio and bell in both of my leagues julio in round and bell in round two i ended up second in one league by points when i was up by with his kelce and tyreek left i was so sure i was good but low and behold i was beaten i even went and won the regular season the other league i went and won when my opponent kept zeke in along with mccoy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is why you never have a week championship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i did the same with jimmy graham dropped him after week for pittaful and as a result streamed like tes throughout the season got impatient also won the ship despite that dumbass move very proud of my team managing this year other than that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i did this but stafford no instead of bortles worst move of my ffl career not only missed playoffs but if i started stafford would have won most pts to buyin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not to mention all that time gates has until retirement
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gates for mccoy had to be collusion or something good lord
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i took cam second because im a homer and im stupid
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sorry but thats retarded
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dj at insane in the membrane cypress hill michael scott
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what do you suggest as the fairest way to draft for leagues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,league went qb crazy the first rounds holy shit your league mates are dumb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,didnt auto draft but the guy before me took gronk and i took zeke after laughing at him so season i stomped him in the championship was up by five monday he out of players and i still had zeke to play left him in to twist the knife
fantasyfootball,not_removed,got johnson zeke bell heh didnt make the winners bracket feelsgoodman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so does having everyone there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,should have seen this kids team after that trade he took brown first overall then zeke and evans at the turn nobody wanted zeke then arron rodgers in the so his team was rodgers zeke brown obj and evans in dude dominated surprisenly got upset in first round though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i thought so too until games later arob and nuk were still riding my bench
fantasyfootball,not_removed,patience is a virtue on the other hand i held on to doug martin all year and look what that got me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yup i traded obj away early and really regret it i got aaron rodgers kyle rudolph and some week rb scrub i was in a bad place and needed some wins i ended up winning the championship because of rodgers week domination so its hard regret it too much but he was my best keeper
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i traded obj and cja for bell and foster turned out to be obj for bell straight up after weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i almost swung a trade of matt forte for obj straight up during his dry spell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in my pseudodynasty league i traded of next years draft picks for obj i already have antonio brown so i thought it was worth having a rebuildingdraft purely on upside year next season in exchange for indefinitely keeping two of the top fantasy receivers in the game its ppr too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nah those dont get along the best and its a nonmoney league so they have no incentive for that one dude is just made the dumbest trade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so you gave him crabtree for edelman then gave him obj for crabtree
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the point is he shouldnt have drafted someone overall if that player isnt going to be on your lineup all weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,howd you know
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh man your brother had terrible luck this year while this was definitely not the year of jets wrs his problem was not paying attention to bye weeks almost half his starters all had the same week off he ended up with about points in ppr that week regardless terrible season considering marshalls numbers deckers injury and cams inconsistency not his fault tho
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have no idea right when it happened he got so mad people were trolling him that he didnt speak in the group chat for like a week both teams made playoffs neither won the ship though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you got flack over that he went in my league also and the concensus was that it was a good pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats what i thought when i made it lol fuck me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drafted devonta freeman over david johnson with the pick in the first round not terrible but the season would have been completely different if i took dj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeahmy best friend picked him right after i pickedit stung throughout the year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got mocked for taking dj at over gurley ironically i played the gurley owner in the championship game and won by
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the receivers went ab julio odell then people took gronk hopkins zeke ap ingram i know we gave him shit and dez then it was me and i fucked up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably a ppr league and fell behind ab obj julio hopkins and dez
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i can possibly see him getting past but we are talking about at least here he went in my league and i definitely had him in my
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ouch been there before
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt go that far he needs to work on catching the ball he couldnt catch for shit also he doesnt have break away speed hes more of a bruiser think lev bell light minus the catching
fantasyfootball,not_removed,idk yet week championship oh yea theres that too lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,even more insanehe should have lost in the but our commish put in homefield advantagethe dumbest shit ive ever seen and this guy barely won i bet the commish is regretting it now because the homefield advantaged allowed the stacked team to advance and the commish got crushed in the httpimgurcomafapzt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was eliminated from the playoffs and traded zeke and mccoy for dj and hopkins league wanted dj no trade deadline again the commishs fault theres a reason ive been pushing to let someone else commish next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no it was basically ingram and mccoy for dj forte and ware
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it was a great finish
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same here pick dj i am in a team ppr league and i would have taken him with the first pick luckily my league went big wr first dj and bell won me the ship this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yep thats straight up collusion had an issue with my commissioner making a bullshit trade too after week he traded hill dez and john brown and got bell julio and marvin jones im not joining this one next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had him all last season and he burned me so bad people were high on him this year and he fell to me in like the then the news came out that charles was injured so i wanted to grab ware i was stupidly stashing josh gordon and didnt want to drop anyone else from my bench i drop melvin someone else grabs him woodhead goes down and the rest is history anyone else getting hungry i smell tacos in here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah thanks got it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes gonna get some traction out of that te huh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nope just someone set with rb who lost ertz and his back up te that week short term thinking
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im a jags fan and wanted robinson badly and before the season jamaal charles was right there with bell as the best dual threat rb in the league unfortunately he couldnt get healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,without a doubt auction everyone gets a fair chance at any player sure there is strategies but you still can go after anyone you want in a snake youre at the mercy of the draft you may get lucky your player falls to you also of youre drafting next to bad managers youll get a lot of good players you pass on but other managers dont get that same benefit i loathe snake drafts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,could be a point td league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,true but shit managers make things way easier for good managers in snake draft auction draft a lot less luck what youre missing is the fact that those managers present had no clue what they were doing so having everyone there likely wouldnt fix that im trying to explain an auction draft that wouldnt happen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow that trade killed his playoff hopes and dreams it sounds like obj was such a big part of my playoff run this year i know evans put up a massive dud in week didnt rodgers and brown do the same too i remember was the snowstorm week bell went off
fantasyfootball,not_removed,me too brother i held on to rawls and sammy watkins too i also impatiently dropped jimmy graham after week but i was patient with obj and perceived his value at still a top wr instead of dumping him for marginal value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why do you even play in non money leagues theyre not fun to me at all
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had edelmenthen traded for crabtree then traded for obj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks captain obvious
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he also had jordy nelsonbut actually came third place he fell flat in the semi finals
fantasyfootball,not_removed,because no one takes cam newton first overall
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nobody thought riddick was gonna be a top back before the first week his stock didnt really rise until abdullah went down no way you can justify that move
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i can see that but if you picked dj also great in ppr in the first round i dont see how you dump him before the season starts for guys you could have drafted much later i guess next year i need to start proposing trades before the season starts if people are willing to give away rounders that easy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ah yes the guy with less than yards from scrimmagewhat a beast
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dj is like or in ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he didnt speak in the group chat for like a week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if its any consolation ingram was a headache to own and i doubt many of his owners were able to reap his good performance in week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same for me i ended up trading freeman for obj because i didnt think his numbers could hold up in the rbbc the falcons where using
fantasyfootball,not_removed,took gurley over dj had a decent season still but probably would have won league with dj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i took dj as high as in a league but more impressively how did the gurley owner make it to the title game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the pick took gurley then i took dj at i mocked him for it at the time and ive continued to mock him all season i dont understand how gurley was taken over dj in soooo many leagues did people not see dj play last year once he was made the starter did people not realize that the rams have no pass offense and the box would be stacked every single down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,possibly but dj is great in ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow ive only ever seen home field as a tie breaker which even then is stupid thats among those most ridiculous things ive ever seen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for some reason i saw forte and thought bears which made me think langford who got injured right away
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont know i think theres a big difference between collusion and just stupidity ive played fantasy for a while and ive seen a whole lot of stupid
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do you play with a really short bench how is dropping even a rd pick even able to be justified barring catastrophic injury in practice or preseason game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea you trade for gates because he has the starting job for the next right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,commish shouldve vetoed thats a round pick for a guy who often went undrafted
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fair enough but i meant more the league as a whole i dont agree with the two you took over dj but i can see it i cant see players over dj though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he should have mentioned that if it were the case and no one would wait till the round in a td league to draft andy dalton sounds like he was in standard or ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not if bortles and dalton were available in the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i still dont know how the scoring was set up honestly turned out to be some form of crazy ppr style qb however qbs did put up crazy numbers was a last minute family for fun league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i see your point and its completely reasonable im just saying that if every manager is gonna be there that it just comes down to preference in which draft is better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nothing about the nfl made sense in week most overalls were eliminated because the top players except bell all looked like amateurs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its with my best friends from high school its been going for years lots of shit taking and a trophy we pass around its honestly funnier than my money league where no one talks shit im in the championship of the money league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,your story is confusing you say you traded edelman to the guy for crabs then you say you sent a poke trade to the guys opponent but then say the trade was accepted but it was accepted by the guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aaahhhh that was funny
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you called
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no he was rb last year in ppr when abdullah was healthy the whole year he was still emerging in the offense going into this year some people were definitely thinking he could catch more balls than last season even with a healthy abdullah he absolutely had ppr value before week one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,any lions fan knew his value to the team even before the injury to aa
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dj is overall in ppr and half ppr not among rbs overall in standard only rodgers passes him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had a lovehate relationship with ingram this year he would absolutely dominate one week then lose it for me the next still havent decided if i want to keep him for my dynasty over sterling shepard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol if you think that was a headache try my other problem at wr when i was juggling dez alshon watkins and tyrell they were just randomly missing games and the media talks were screwing me bc they took up bench space that could have upgraded my rb depth while being too valuable to drop
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can confirm traded golden tate and frank gore for ingram in one of my leagues and i wish id have just stood pat on that ingram could give you numbers or he could give you bad flex play numbers and there wasnt really any rhyme or reason to guess which you were gonna get its all the whims of sean payton he was my most agonizing startsit choice every week rb isnt really a position i like to have boombust players in especially when ingram was going in the first or second round in drafts you draft rbs because they give you consistent points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drafted leveon bell w his pick and melvin gordon in the round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,some people thought they might use a split backfield in arizona with dj getting the majority of carries but ellington chris johnson playing roles and the fear of a sophomore slump i suppose gurley seemed like more of a sure thing to some people
fantasyfootball,not_removed,from bj to dj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well the dude that did that trade proceeded to not set a lineup for the next weeks so im pretty sure its collusion there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all the sweet sleepers bro honestly id rather go without a kicker for a week than drop a starting rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,at least maybe even
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think no one thought he would keep up from last year i know for me personally i didnt like that he had johnson and ellington behind him i thought they would get a lot more touches than they did but as you said bad move picking players over him especially since i scrambled all season trying to get a number back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre right dunno why people downvoting you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it could be qb league with crazy qb scoring as well plenty of options i agree it cant be a qb league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i see thank you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that was the strangest league wide fantasy week i think ive seen in my years of fantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same happened to me evans zeke big ben and jordan reed all had season lows in the same week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was pts leader by over the place pts average was all year lost round to the guy who won a way tie breaker to make the playoffs who autodrafted by a lot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats cool everyone cares about it every non money league i have played in people end up not paying attention to it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sorryill be clear i had edelmen guy offered me crabtree for edelmeni accepted and got crabtree later in the weeki poked the guys opponent offering him crabtree for obj he surprisingly accepted so now i got obj during his bye week the guy lost that week to the guy i gave crabtree to the guy lost in a row and went to and missed the playoffs i ended up winning the league on the backs of david johnson jordy nelson and obj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the what are you a buckeyes fan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fantasypros listed him as the in ppr formats generally drafted round crowell was for ppr anyone trading away their pick for those guys before the season starts is just a taco
fantasyfootball,not_removed,one of the very few benefits of team bench spot league gotta start people and hope for the best
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thatll do it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats what i thought good shit man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont get me wrong the trade is still garbage im just saying that some people were higher on riddick than you are making it out to seem i saw his name pop up frequently in sleeper articles for ppr formats
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol according to you i deserve it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol ouch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah but if he liked riddick so much why didnt he just reach for him and keep dj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i never claimed this guy was smart or good at fantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this may be common knowledge for the subscribers to this sub but i just found this out so i thought id mention it rashad jennings was apparently rated as the second best pass blocking running back in the league last year this is probably the best explanation of why jennings runs so much compared to guys like perkins who most would say has looked better so with that in mind i think perkins will be involved more next season because the pass blocking ability seems less valuable when eli is declining i think mcadoo and the giants will look to balance out the offense and run more with perkins but its a tricky situation and theres a lot of factors to consider beyond which of perkinsjennings is getting more yards per carry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for me he is worth a late round pick i think he will be more involved next year i think and the giants have a relative easy schedule for the run based on the stats my questions would be do the teams they are scheduled play against do anything to stop the run how many snaps we actually think he will see with jennings there are we going to see committee but yes late round i dont mind picking him up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keeper value depends almost entirely on the rest of your roster but if perkins is in line to get a majority of the giants workload i cant imagine many situations in which a young rb starting for a decent nfl team isnt worth a lateround pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,heavily dependent on how the giants improve their oline in the offseason and if the giants bring on anyone to compete as a keeper hes not a bad bet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i personally would not as of now hes still not the clear cut and although he looked decent in games this year he wasnt anything amazing ive stashed him myself to see how the offseason shakes out though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,depends on what the giants do the bad news here is that if they get rid of jennings or any other positive news comes out about perkins his adp will skyrocket i wouldnt gamble on the giants backfield except in the late rounds if he is there late he is a great rb flier
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was a fan of perkins coming out and as much as i want to see him succeed im concerned that this draft class will wash him out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would stay away from giants rbsalthough everything points to giants rb having more production next year i still believe theyre just not meant to run the ballelis arm is fading they barely have an offensive line i just dont see the giants having a rb that will make you happy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a giant fan i am big on him but all i keep reading about is that we need to draft a rb which i dont get also yeah then theres the oline late round pick up for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im honestly fucking tired of years of mediocrity at the rb position from this team every couple of years i think hey this giants rb looks pretty good then i think wow look at the value of where i can buy or draft him i thoroughly invest myself in this plan and im inevitably let the fuck down the last real deal potential on that team was david wilson and he ended his career after like games outside of that this teams strategy is to block for eli manning and i will be surprised when they finally get a fantasy relevant rb out there the last ones i can remember were boldenbradshaw and essentially they were both value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a giant fan i think they will draft a rb which will force perkins into a change of pace role like gio bernard or charles sims
fantasyfootball,not_removed,paul perkins is simply a scat back without real top end speed hes very small framed for the position and doesnt have the strength to push the pile or break tackles his main strength is his vision and ability to make moves in space something this giants oline is never going to get him hell never be a workhorse or quite frankly even a solid lead back thats why alot of experts still say the giants need to draft a rb perkins is a really high end utility back who can work fine in a true committee but will break down and not succeed if hes asked to carry the load for an entire season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if the giants invest in oline help im gunning for him he may go a bit earlier than expected because im sure experts will pick him as a potential breakout
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes worth it as long as they have obj shepard that passing game will setup the run game for a young rb like perkins who has good vision power
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im keeping him for a round pick and i couldnt be happier even if the giants keep jennings i see perkins taking over and jennings being there for downs i think the giant want to get younger and will spend some draftfree agency capitol on the o line i project perkins going in the round next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,imo the only player on the giants roster worth drafting is obj now playing the ww is another story but ill let the first few games of the season determine if i take any other giants the o was just so bland and not there last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,out of curiosity whos the first
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why the hell would pass blocking me less valuable as he gets older
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a giants fan i think an additional but most important question is will the offensive line improve
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think the giants are done waiting on jennings or if not they should be imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think that most giants fans see jennings getting cut this season but the important question is whether we improve our line
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theres been talk that jennings will be cut if so i would say hell yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jennings himself has already publically said that perkins is the starter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,block for eli manning edit stand in the way of the defenders and hope they dont hit eli manning
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just so theres no confusion on your end as to why youre getting downvoted perkins will most certainly not go in rounds in of leagues next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sterling shepard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,honestly no idea my dad said one of the fantasy football nfl guys he follows tweeted this when asked about jenningsperkins id imagine this is based on some pff stats but i didnt look into where anyone was ranked
fantasyfootball,not_removed,only because passblocking would be more important the more you pass and if eli is declining then youd imagine theyd be better off running more obviously hed still need pass blocking but jennings pretty much kills their running game so i can see how his value would decrease if they cant lean on the passing game as much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont even know if that as much of a concern as you might think just because the rb position for the nyg was not awful it wasnt great but it wasnt a dumpster fire edit typo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jennings already publically said the starting job is perkins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i know its not a popular opinion but thats where i have him projected right now jennings adp was right around the end of the round that was due to the fact he has been inconsistent injury prone and that they drafted paul perkins i believe jennings either gets cut or sees a very diminished role next year so its very likely that perkins adp will be higher then jennings was last year thus putting him in the range i stated i think would be reaching but free agency and the draft could change a lot of things
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if he was actually on the field for a meaningful percentage of snaps this might hold water jennings is a trash rb whos only big gains come off draw plays on and nyg needs to move on from him and start running the ball with a purpose with a better back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that article is from well over a year ago giants undeniably were bottom in run blocking given we were top in least rushing yards per game and the steelers had one of the best lines in the league this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you watched their games thats not the case at all stats in football are great to support discussions but theres more to it linemen were falling down on the ground before perkins even reached the los
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont know youre getting downvoted for providing objective info the guy below you stenzycakes is literally complaining that your opinion isnt sufficiently subjective fucking rff man if all i wanted was an eye test i wouldnt scour the internet for discussion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont want to trust any giants rb that much maybe hes an but id be more comfortable with him as one of my late round upside picks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah theyre not helping their defense when they force the pass and turn the ball over if they could run the ball effectively and control the clock they would be a much bigger threat
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my fault didnt notice that it was that outdated
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he was downvoted because that source is a year old basically taking information from the seasonnot relevant to their performance for this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my bad didnt notice that it was that outdated
fantasyfootball,not_removed,while he may not start week i think this has an impact on pretty much all fantasy players on the giants as well as their defense eli will benefit greatly from this the giants went from having one of the worst units in the league to a mid tierslightly above mid tier line by adding a competent tackle he might not be in game shape to start the year but make no mistake he will likely be starting by the mark of the season this may help rashad jenningspaul perkins as well vastly improving a tackle position will allow them more room to run which has been a massive problem for the giants in the mcadoo era i can see this theoretically hurting vereen as an improved run game may shift some of those rushing attemptesque short receptions away from vereen the giants defense which added many pieces via fa and the draft and looks improved in the preseason may also be a bit more of a viable option for streamers if the run game improves by sheer virtue of simply keeping the them off the field with increased clock control by the offense but this mostly will impact eli and by extension giants wrs objshepardcruz
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh resign he didnt resign ha whew
fantasyfootball,not_removed,refuckingsign
fantasyfootball,not_removed,erick flowers has ability but is overmatched at lt if beatty can play with any competency and allow flowers to move to rt it could upgrade both spots for the giants the giant offense has been atrocious this preseason and the line is the major cause of that despite to good young players in justin pugh and weston richburg this was a sorely needed move for the giants
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the only way this helps eli is for the deep ball so maybe a few plays this season hes been top every year sicne mcadoo was here in least qb hits taken yes giants fans are whiny about ol protection but they suck in run blocking pass protection they are average but yes for running the ball beatty is a huge addition
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jfc im sorry its a god damn typo lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but would the giants actually resign beatty
fantasyfootball,not_removed,giants fo consider flowers the lt of the future this might change by the end of this season if he still shows no improvement but i would be incredibly surprised to see flowers anywhere but lt for the foreseeable future also in case you didnt know one of the reasons the line has been so trash in preseason is that pugh hasnt been playing because of a sore shoulder at least with pugh we could count on one side of the line holding up but with him out its just turnstiles standing around richburg
fantasyfootball,not_removed,imagine if eli had more seconds to place a better ball on all those quick releasesjust because he doesnt get hit doesnt mean he feels no pressure or doesnt feel rushed on a lot of throws plus pughs absence in preseason has shown us that we are only injury away from having perhaps the worst o line in football
fantasyfootball,not_removed,macs offense gets rid of the ball fast that does not mean eli is not constantly under siege he is generally good at getting rid of the ball when things fall apart
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well newhouse is awful to begin with secondly beatty played well for most of his giants career he was solid and above average he did play poorly after his big leg injury but bounced back seasons after the injury and like i said he is far far far better than newhouse that alone makes the line much better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no player in the nfl ever resigns this is the most asinine ongoing syntax argument ever we all know what the fuck it means
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks i guess i need to pay closer attention to whos actually on the line i kind of assumed theyd revert to their plan which was beatty at lt flowers at rt now that i think about it though youre completely right that theyll probably stick with flowers hopefully he improves but to my eyes he just wasnt quick enough though i think hed make a good rt and an even better guard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am agreeing with you lol a team also wouldnt resign the player in any situation lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you lol i dont understand the thought process or point of making some nitpicky correction like that everyone knew what i meant and i was just posting it before i left my apartment
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think calling beatty a turnstile is kinda unfair but yeah the main point is how much directly better he is than newhouse
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no beatty had mediocre years and a couple great years but he was far from a turnstile newhouse is legitimately a turnstile this is an improvement even if its just going from steaming pile of trash to mediocrity
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beatty was a top lt before the injuries you are no giants fan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah im directing that more towards the nitpickers above you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea i dont get why everyone needs to be grammar nazi when it literally never causes any confusion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not all giants fans most of us know that he has been a very competent tackle youre the only giants fan ive heard call him a turnstyle js
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i know of a certain quarterback who gets a bad rep for one bad seasoncome on dude you literally said from my memory he is a turnstile so you were in fact arguing that he was bad and you are wrong with the exception of his injury season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,while i would prefer that they find a trade partner for tony romo this may be the only thing that can work that said this is the time for misinformation the team may be leaking through the media that they are going to release him so that teams who dont want to get in a bidding war for his services start looking to make a trade for him not saying thats the case but jerry jones is pretty smart when it comes to getting out information or misinformation to work the market
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is there truly a market for romo though i mean other than denver who is just a qb away i know the argument is that any team can be there with the right qb who else is a contender that would make an offer ive heard the bills redskins and bears mentioned but i just dont know on his market for full disclosure im in the uk so it can be difficult to get nfl news
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i cant see tampa going for him likewise with the jags i thought the jags hc was taken in part because he said he could fix bortles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,romo is the carmello anthony of football they both can put up great stats during the regular season and thats all youll get they wont bring you the ring their fans will rave about their stats during the season neither is a lebron james or tom brady type when the playoffs roll around
fantasyfootball,not_removed,releasing him is the most they can do for him he gets released teams who want him enter a bidding war and his price goes up if hes traded he doesnt get to choose his destination the cowboys do and hed have to play on his current contract or theyd restructure it where hes taking less money cowboys will do what is right and release him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,houston is a qb away
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is a weak qb draft year and there are teams desperate for a qb upgrade im bored and work is starting late today so now you get my full evaluation afc east ne and miami arent going to drop their current qbs and i doubt the bills will drop taylor but i could see it happen the jets would love a better qb but romo will want to win so he wont go there afc north honestly even cleveland is probably okay with their qb situation based on their overall expectations going into the next year not like romo would sign there anyway he doesnt end up in this division afc south tennessee and indy are fine houston has too much money locked up in brock lobster jacksonville actually has some great pieces and could be a playoff contending especially in this division with romo whether they get him or not ill be shocked if bortles is leading this team next year afc west denver is the only team here unless phil decides to retire instead of move to la denver could win with him now and give their young guns time to develop under a true pro but their rookie tandem wasnt so terrible last year maybe they decide to just roll with it nfc east yeah hes not coming here manning cousins and wentz are going to stay put nfc north same thing here rodgers stafford are obvious locks minnesota doesnt need a starting qb and chicago is just too bad to capture romos interest nfc south so the nfc definitely has better overall quarterbacks than the afc atlanta no and carolina have of the best quarterbacks in the league romo would be a big upgrade to winston who isnt terrible but isnt good enough to win and they have a decent supporting cast i could see romo here nfc west seattle arizona and la are set and sf is well competing with cleveland for the toilet bowl so yeah no tldr in this order id bet he goes to jacksonville denver tampa or buffalo ill be shocked if he goes anywhere else edit ill add that ive heard the washington rumours too i wouldnt be too surprised if he does but i just cant see them dropping cousins edit redskins use exclusive franchise tag on cousins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree thats best for tony but there is a way to get both
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yup if jerry jones really does love romo and wants to do right by him hell release him to improve his options in terms of location and
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea but they arent going to pay for qbs so i didnt really think about them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no way does he go to tampa winston is their future period
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hou could get him for a back loaded contract
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there were rumours at the end of the regular season that maybe tampa would look at moving him if they could get romo winston is a nfl quality qb but unless he gets notably better he wont carry them to a superbowl romo could though his window is smaller anyway the whole thing is just my personal take if i was a pro at this analysis thing id be on the tv discussing it instead of on reddit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would like to see jameis to the bears and romo to tampamake things interesting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah winston isnt going anywhere please keep your weak ass rumors to yourself
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that was definitely not a rumor i ever heard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,k good for you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont get so defensive you come on here and put this long post about everyones qb situations and who wants romo and then when people so much as hint at disagreeing with you rather than discuss you just say youre not a pro and its a personal opinion thats weak sauce your take was bad and you need to own it theres no way tampa would want romo cleveland is probably ok with their qb situation on what planet youre dismissive of several possible destinations like houston chicago san fran and new york for various reasons that seem off ill be shocked if bortles is leading this team next year there hasnt been a lot of talk that jacksonville is moving on from bortles so being shocked theyd stick with him when hes still on his rookie contract is some serious hyperbole
fantasyfootball,not_removed,alright re bortles thats a rumour ive heard multiple times ive watched him play hes underperformed years in a row in a real bad way the jags were called to be playoff contenders before the season on par or better than oakland but here we are did you watch them bortles is their biggest weakness with a good qb jacksonville actually is a decent team houston is one thing i get they might make cap space for romo but you want to talk about jacksonville sticking behind bortles and talk about houston is moving on from brock bortles and brock had of the worst qb ratings in the league last year neither player is safe but i personally doubt houston will move on from that contract so soon theyre too invested jacksonville on the other hand has a qb on a rookie contract whos underperformed since he came into the league and i personally dont see a contender like romo who wants to be in the playoffs and has his choice of cities to go to signing with a dumpster firerebuild like sf cleveland nyj or chicago disagree on that if you want but romo knows he only has a few years left to get a superbowl hes not going to want to commit a couple years to a rebuild he wants to win sorry you didnt hear the tampa rumour but come on add a comment of value argue on logic use real points not just uhhhhhhhh but i didnt hear it so it cant be true which is basically how what you wrote reads unless you happen to know some people high up in their organization im sure theres rumours about them you miss and theres rumours that i miss thats a part of the sport might as well get used to it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,atta boy whipping it out and putting it on the table weve all seen him play and i agree bortles is garbage but to lap off the jags problems onto just his lap is definitely misguided his running game was horrible their yeldonivory punch never materialized they were in rushing defense was definitely better but they still gave up a bunch of points and while i wasnt an avid jaguars watcher if there was one theme about them i remembered it was everyone bitching about all the drops just a quick google about it and i saw that robinson hurns and lee had the most drops of any wide receiver trio in the league according to an article from early december i agree bortles sucks but when the rest of the team sucks it makes sense to roll the dice one more time on the lowpriced bortles and see if marrone can turn his career around my houston take is mostly based off of all the tv experts and talking heads talking about it as a top option they basically would have to swallow paying a ton to romo and lobster this year and after this year they can cut lobster for next to nothing or maybe even nothing they have a championship d and maybe replacing lobster with romo gives them the best shot against the patriots theyre going to have to make a run soon while they have this great defense i agree with you on cleveland for sure he wont go there likely not on nyj either i think they need a total rebuild the bears to me are a bit interesting because he may like their weapons their oline is okay and they have a crazy amount of cap room like million plus that can maybe quickly retool a defense plus romos ties to illinois because he played college there i dunno if that is a factor at all and san fran is a total crapshoot to me to because as you can see with cousins people like shanahan if romo thought shanahan could turn things around with the offense they have even more cap room than the bears like mill plus a nice stadium and nice facilities plus a high draft pick to get a potential cornerstone defensive guy if they can get the right qb in free agency or trade whether cousins jimmy g or romo i think there turnaround could be quicker than some think yeah man this is just legit the first time ive heard rumblings about tampa not being sold on winston as their franchise guy he certainly had some highlight games this season and he played tough despite having like everyone getting injured around him like always he had his interceptions and while he didnt make the pro bowl this year he had slight increases for his yards tds qb rating qbr thats yd seasons to start his career and i watched a couple of his games this year and thought he looks good he takes chances and makes plays in that way i think he may have a little too much of that gunslinger attitude in the favre romo cutler type of quarterback but that attitude has its ups and downs i think they are nowhere close to moving on from him theyll give him a few more years and see what he can do if his playmakers around him can actually stay healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so i still think youre wrong about romo going to tampa but i was definitely wrong about tampa being hugely sold on winston and wanted to come back and own up to it reports out that they are offering glennon huge money to stay as the backup shows they arent sold on winston cuz im not sure you offer that big backup money if youre sold on your starter if glennon leaves likely means they arent standing pat with winston and some runofthemill backup qb so kudos on your insight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,haha thanks i was wrong about washington too though with the current rumours its starting to look like theres a good chance he ends up there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,romo at washington would be weird and potentially a disaster because they seem to be losing all the weapons that surrounded cousins if i were romo id just be praying that palmer decides to retire that seems like the perfect spot for romo on a yr deal maybe a yr option
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do these people get banned
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wdis threads
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think you should use the wdis thread
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wdis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like benjamins matchup honestly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so many options it depends who goes in the first picks but without any other info i would be trying to target aj green or ad if he falls
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kinda depends on who takes who but i like aj green in that spot i might even take lamar miller in that spot because i truly believe he is going to be a fantasy monster this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats the situation in cincinnati this year ive been seeing a lot of aj green talk but i had him last year and would touch him in the first two rounds based on what he did for me last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what scoring you have to mention it in order for us to be able to talk about it in my half ppr obj ab peterson julio hopkins gronk gurley green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jonathan stewart he is a consistency king
fantasyfootball,not_removed,antonio brown or steve mcnair cant decide
fantasyfootball,not_removed,coby fleener probably
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea i like miller but feel like he is a little bit of a stretch at im currently stuck between him and green and maybe elliott if he slides to me but idk if i like elliott yet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pretty much all the other wrs are gone and eifert is hurt as a bengals fan i expect aj to have a season similar to
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he said standard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah elliott is really hard to gauge because hes a rookie behind the best ol in the nfl call me crazy but id pick miller before him because we have seen what miller can do with a mediocre ol and how much of a playmaker he is with the ball in his hands i also believe the texans were top in rushing attempts last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea im really between miller and green maybe hopkins elliott is to much risk for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a niners fanstay away hyde is rosterable in most man leagues as a low end in good matchups vance mcdonald is worth a look as a late round pickup in deeper leagues but the guy has brick hands so have fun screaming at the tv when he drops passes in the red zone shaun draughn is interesting because he was a fantastic pass catching back solid as hell in ppr last season but his use is hampered with hyde back only worth looking at in deeper leagues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,might be a record
fantasyfootball,not_removed,heres the in order of targets torrey smith catches of targets vance mcdonald catches of targets shaun draughn catches of targets quinton patton catches of targets jeremy kerley catches of targets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats a long title
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats a shitload of catches
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that title though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it looks really bad ellington was a bright spot now hes out for the season torrey smith had like target through three preseason games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wtf do i look like i can tell the future who knows
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sorry busy right now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its gonna be another rough season for us
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats how i read it as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its interesting how this analysis makes smith look like a major sleeper his career ypc is catches yards by that measure which would be an absolute steal at his adp same for vance mcdonald using his ypc this puts him at yards both these guys have tanked in drafts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good comp for the is the browns torrey smith travis benjmain vance mcdonald gary barnidge shaun draughn duke johnson quinton patton brian hartline jeremy kerley andrew hawkinstaylor gabriel
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is really ideal go abjulioobj with your first pick then with your second pick you can grab a running back like lacymiller with your third pick you can get an elite young receiver like cooperevanswatkinscooks if its full ppr id go wrwrwr and then target pass catching backs in rounds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,search through the subreddit for recent threads about this ill say what i said in those previous threads establish a top tier of players you wish to select say there are players in that top tier go for pick or to account for injuriesthe unknown for example my league is standard not ppr my tip tier includesab obj bell julio jones hopkins gurley david johnson ap and zeke my top tier has players so ideally id get pick choose whoever is left over and still have a reasonably high round pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have to lean towards pick probably get obj assuming brown and julio go maybe someone like keenan allen damaryius or edelman or cooks in rounds and then grab some pass catching backs in such as gio woodhead duke johnson sims etc pretty good base there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pick and get brown julio or obj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i always prefer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,two ways to look at it for firstsecond round combos id say choose one of brown julio odell bell gurley johnson and nuk otherwise you want be or over the course of the draft having two consecutive picks or makes a big difference youre never going to wait and lose your guy going back to back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id say it depends on your draft strategy if you want to get a top tier rb you may want to choose if you want to secure a couple of stud wrs you can go a bit lower higher in recent years ive been shying away from rbs in the first couple rounds its mostly worked but i have been bitten in the ass by it as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in ppr the elite tier with no question marks basically consists of guys odb brown and julio maybe if you are in love with hopkins i would go for the pick get one of those guys and take good wrs or a wr and rb in the late and early third round you should be able to get a really solid start to your draft that way
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i personally like to pick because it provides a consistent number of off time between picks kinda old school but ive been doing this for years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,forte in the could be possible woodhead in the is a great value dude is always a top rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id look at bell over odell at i have odell as a keeper so i loooooove odell but leveon bell is perfect ppr pick hes an exceptionally good rb who also is a ppr back odell makes big things happen but with any ppr he isnt quite as good as julio or antonio although in standard give me odell over julio injury is a risk but if healthy hes basically a lock to be like freeman was last year from a statistics standpoint thats worth a pick imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this so much i cant emphasize the importance of tiers enough it just makes drafting in the rounds so much easier and then its playing the board from there its also a good exercise in establishing and identifying your own feelings about the top players
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you could also choose or i think tier one consists of julio brown obj hopkins and bell if were talking ppr find out where you draw the line for tier and take that pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like back to back picks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wont down vote but i disagree you always are guessing who will be there having back to back picks is huuuuuge no guessing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and the top waiver claim
fantasyfootball,not_removed,looking like a real keeper in the round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they should line up myles garrett as te immediate redzone threat
fantasyfootball,not_removed,even over josh gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive been loving coleman since pryor left and even before his talent is legit and they didnt draft him overall for no reason go watch his college tape combine and pro day he ran a and has a inch vert more importantly he looked good when on the field his rookie year browns defense is still gonna suck next year they will be throwing a lot as they play from behind they also greatly improved their o line the browns are going to utilize him a ton and it doesnt matter who is qb is if he stays healthy hes going to put up numbers pryor was their last year and did just fine on a garbage team that should improve a bit this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well yeah who else is it going to be
fantasyfootball,not_removed,totally different players coleman is lbs pryor is lbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whod you rather corey davis or corey coleman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why did the browns not try and resign pryor im curious to know from a browns fan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn i wish im out of keeper options had him but wasnt feeling anywhere near confident
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the draft capital they used for him it would make sense to give him the opportunity to be the who is throwing him the ball again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol wait till brock starts and skips him passes like he did nuk last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,by default
fantasyfootball,not_removed,debating keeping him or carr i want to believe in him but fuck that qb situation
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not worth drafting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,considering with what cock osweiler did to hopkins an arguable top wr i guess il have to avoid any browns wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,still a browns player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hoping that foot issue doesnt bother him he was a beast when he was playing early in the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,manziel gonna throw to him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you joke but jj watt had five tds in edit of them were receiving tds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,week one browns first possession coleman lines up in the spot hue calls timeout just before the snap timeout on the first play not looking good for osweiler stadium lights dim what the the next episode by dr dre blasts from the speakers bah gawd thats josh gordons music
fantasyfootball,not_removed,josh gordon transcends depth charts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea this is blasphemy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dude osweiler turned nuk into a bum it does matter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kenny britt just signed a year million dollar deal my guess is he wont be riding the bench
fantasyfootball,not_removed,could be one of their roughly two hundred picks i suppose i think thats unlikely though their skill corps certainly isnt perfect but they have dire needs in other areas that i expect them to invest in first
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont know if i understand what youre implying pryor isnt with the team anymore it doesnt really matter how he and coleman compare all that matters is that coleman looks to be the showed some good signs as a rookie and is in line for a chunk of targets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why didnt they resign pryor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,corey feldman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we did we gave him a year million dollar offer if he was going to sign long term he wanted million a year we balked and let him test the market market for him and quite frankly for wrs as a whole was cold so didnt get the ideal long term deal he wanted went to washington got their offer and instead of coming back to the browns with their offer and see whether we would counter offer him he signed his prove it deal disappointing to lose him but glad we didnt overpay for him to stick around
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they did he wanted like years which they laughed at rightfully so so they let him walk he didnt get any bites even close to that they also i believe offered him a slightly better short term deal than one he ended up signing with washington
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who are your other options carr is a weak choice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it all depends when hes drafted i mean round is insane but if hes available in like the its not so crazy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he wont be their qb its already confirmed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he never had a foot issue he broke his hand early in the season which held him out he also strained his hammy before the season started but managed to heal up for game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,noooo thats why they picked up that hot free agent the broncos were too stubborn to negotiate with wait what year is it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvweystmizjkw
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am aware of that and i dont believe that will be the situation the browns took osweiler off the texans books to buy themselves a round pick we know osweiler isnt good and so do the browns they are still trying to trade osweiler if they fail he will compete with kessler and whoever they draft and probably get beat out i will be shocked if osweiler ends up the starting qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brock lobster tanked that entire offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes not supposed to be the starter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea if anything we will see the return of gary barnidge
fantasyfootball,not_removed,osweiler aint the starter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can you imagine leaving the rams to go to the browns the man must be making too much money to care about winning
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre right the guy could mean anything i was just implying that they are different types of receivers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no i see what hes saying coleman isnt gonna get the looks the pryor did because of the size difference britt is meant to fill pryors role as the big guy so coleman will mostly keep getting the same types of looks just more of them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they offered him a fair deal he took a cheaper deal in washington
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,because pryor is the worst and turned down a good long term deal to get a prove it deal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,any takers on corey haim
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cory baxter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wonder how much was guaranteed too it might not even have been all about the yearly value but if it was setup so he could be cut easily after years then hed be more inclined to take the prove it deal not saying that the yearly amount had no effect clearly he wanted more per year too but nfl contracts tend to be made or broken on guaranteed when it comes to long term especially for younger players id imagine if his offers were mil with guaranteed vs mil with guaranteed he wouldnt be too inclined to take the mil still
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well if you are going to take a year prove it deal you should at least know youll have a legit qb throwing you the pigskin bar injury
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is it still a weak choice if they sign ap if they have a running game that defenses have to respect carrcoopercrabs are going to ball out next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,those two like i just stated
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i rather take a rishard matthews or malcolm mitchell in the then coleman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,where if its not the lobster then do they draft trubisky either way im not drafting this cat before round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bullshit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh right that was it i confused him with another player i had in my roster that went down the same week with a foot issue whoops
fantasyfootball,not_removed,except they just did that for the pick and dont actually want him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,was hoping for blueberry yum yum by ludacris
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do we really believe the browns know what they are doing at qb suddenly brady quinn brandon weeden johnny manziel i like the new regime but everybody liked pettine as well after year and we know how that turned out im starting to believe in the browns decision making after they found a qb who can at least start solid games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the browns have a history of starting all kinds of guys who arent supposed to be starters
fantasyfootball,not_removed,britt has somehow worked his way from the bottom of the barrel to under it titans rams browns
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kenny has had an interesting nfl career honestly i think hes just happy to continue to have a chance to be in the nfl its just gravy for him to actually be wanted by teams three knee surgeries bad work ethic etc he really grew up and is making the best out of it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id be willing to believe that most players dont really care about winning tbh how many teams are legitimate contenders for the super bowl every year maybe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he left the titans before that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wait really i dont know a ton about nfl free agency but how does that work was he forced to accept the next best deal after turning down cleveland or did he willingly choose a worse deal because he didnt want to be in cleveland
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got on corey hart
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its guaranteed with available in incentives dude needs an nflleading year to get a better deal than we offered him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no doubt im not saying he made the wrong choice just clarifying for the poster that the browns did try to keep him within reason
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes qbs are dime a dozen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id rather take the keeper flyer on coleman than a qb you can get great qb production from the wirer and late rounds late round wr are much more miss than hit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,your team didnt have any studs or your rules dont allow it if youre big names are coleman and carr youre not in a very good spot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theres way too many mouths to feed in new england with the addition of cooks at least we know coleman will get plenty of targets and whichever wr the titans draft will likely be the i think id be pretty cautious with matthews
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol cody kessler
fantasyfootball,not_removed,per rotoworld browns coach hue jackson claims he is preparing as if brock osweiler will be on the team this season obviously hes a player on our team and were going to treat him just like we do all of our other quarterbacks until hes not said jackson its classic coachspeak and really doesnt mean much of anything assuming the patriots hold on to jimmy garoppolo the browns should select a quarterback early in the draft possibly as soon as overall the browns have shopped osweiler but releasing him is the more likely outcome hes not long for cleveland it doesnt say that he wont be their qb but theres a good chance hes not on the roster come week if he is it doesnt sound like hell play at all if trubisky is there at i think they may draft him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i know that trade was just for the pick but are they really not going to use him i know he is bad but who do you start over him kessler a rookie either most likely will be better but dont you at least give brock a shot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,get ya lighters roll it sticky lets get highhhh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hue jackson has a different pedigree then pettine and his resume proves it i do think this new regime has a plan cant wait to find out what it is but i dont believe the plan includes osweiler
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is an entirely new staff from ownership down and the ownership is no longer a part of drafting despite the team going this is the best ive felt about the browns future in the years ive been a fan we have a good coach and a fo that is properly building a team also i wouldnt sell short he graded very well as a rookie who almost died behind our line put kessler behind the dallas line and i bet hed have a similar or better season than dak edit a lot of us definitely didnt like pettine after year onebut most wanted him to stay for consistency
fantasyfootball,not_removed,underrated
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this contract with guarantees basically hes set for life now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all players probably care about winning but not enough to pass up millions of dollars
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we offered him years million he took a one year million deal in hopes of having another great year and getting an even bigger contract
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he thinks hes worth top money despite not putting up top stats he did improve and looked good on a bad team with poor qb play though he turned down clevelands yr mill contract to test the market seems like every other team also believes hes not worth top money either so he signs a yr mill deal which has most of it tied to incentives i believe where he essentially has to ball out to make the full mill top type stats to get the last mil and is basicallt gambling that he will get better this year and not get injured so he can sign a bigger contract next year he is takin a huge risk imo sure theres a chance he improves with cousins throwing to him but hes not some year old with a shot to recover if something happens he was a qb and wasted a few years of his prime until cleveland essentially transformed him into a receiver and helped him come back from obscurity now hes about to be before the season starts he gets injured this year theres no way he sees any decent contract as a yr old wr coming off an injury personally i woulda taken the mill per year longer contract but hey maybe he proves me wrong and is julio jones edit here are the receivers last year who would get the full of pryors contract name team t hilton wr ind j jones wr atl o beckham jr wr nyg m evans wr tb a brown wr pit j nelson wr gb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,corey from trailer park boys comes with free trevor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mil only really then uhhh no he doesnt really need a killer year to come out way ahead for example or even better id wager pryor is significantly better than sanu and on par with or better than mjj and there will be even more cap space next year it wouldnt be a surprise that if he just has a top season that he could pull in years for mil with mil guaranteed which is significantly better and even if hes just a top option hell still probably milk out mil guaranteed anyways just with less per year value available basically if he doesnt flop he should be able to get far more than mil with mil guaranteed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he was probably the best player theyve had since josh cribbs they have the cash shoulda kept him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you mean like tajae sharpe lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a lot of people mention that and i agree but mitchell is much more of value pick because of the ne receivers being old and injury prone however i highly doubt the titans will draft a wr with their overall maybe their but even so i think matthews has value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well to be fair that doesnt confirm anything its just a rotoworld take i highly doubt that the browns can flip him for a pick im not firm on the lobsters contract details but do they browns recoup any cap space by cutting him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would see the browns grabbing hooker or another defensive piece for the secondary at they maybe grab one in the but if not they roll with kessler next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they dont really care theyre going full hinkie which is the right move imo the word is that theyve been trying to move him for anything to avoid paying that salary but theyll live with it if they have to
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably amass picks and lose for one more year with a cheap qb before drafting the franchise guy ideally
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah it seems like hes playing the long game he had a good year despite the browns cycling through different qbs he sees opportunity in washington by stepping in the whole left by jacksongarcons departure hell also have cousins instead of likely another turnstile of qbs in cleveland hes betting on himself having a even bigger year in and entering the market again with a lot of hype as a skins fan it feels kind of like a super model dating me so she hopes hanging out with me will introduce her to my richer friends it feels kinda crappy that it probably will just be a thing but hey a super model is a super model
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it comes out to the same per year but his one year deal might allow him to enter another contract at a higher yearly more guaranteed if he performs well which he should with cousins throwing to him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,time will tell but this offseason seemed to send a different message than last years i personally think front offices are seeing how the wr market is overvalued and arent willing to spend huge money on it like they were when multiple receivers take proveit deals that says something to me there are plenty of wellpaid players but that doesnt always mean the next ones to come along will have the same success hey if he plays well he should get paid but i think we made the right call
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why would they overpay to keep him when the team sucks theyre trying to do a complete rebuild and allocating that money across various needs is much better than sinking it in a one year performer they inked kenny britt if flash comes back wr is a strength of this team despite losing tp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,titans have the and not and
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they just grabbed cooks mitchell is undraftable for me hes like on that team coleman is on my board around
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cleveland will simply absorb his contract and move on they have a ton of cap space so its not a big deal and i agree although it doesnt confirm anything theres a pretty good chance of him ending up elsewhere but going into the fantasy draft i wouldnt worry too much about osweiler hurting colemans production the browns could try to package their first round pick and the second round pick they got from the texans for garoppolo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the process
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nice summary
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah but once the other super models see that youre rateable material and treat her well they will start flocking over but in this case i hope the redskins only date trolls
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im looking forward to the cousinstp connections this season going to be fun to watch also fun fact despite both players being freshmen in at osu and msu they only played each other one time in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,could be a reaction to ab setting the market too if they felt they should be valued close to him and didnt get that then they were like okay ill show you i can ball out with any qb in hopes thatd get them closer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,by extension of that logic they should just keep all their shitty cheap players and save up in hopes of someday getting someone good holding out for gordon is idiocy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im mistaken ty
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they only eat his contract for this year since its pretty much no guaranteed money after that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so why are you so sure theyre cutting him i doubt theyre gonna have two for sure better options than brock why would you eat mil and not keep him on the team im pretty sure i read a couple weeks ago that they said theyre gonna let him compete for the job since theres no real harm in it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,possibly i dont see why that theory is any less valid than another personally i think its because his agents told him he was worth more and when they were all shown to be wrong they decided to gamble instead of going back to the browns as a sign of showing they misjudged the market tbh my high hope was him and flash lining up acrossnext to each other with coco too and crowellduke barnidge as our tethats a pretty sweet receiving corpsbackfield regardless of the qb then you tag on our ol improvements i mean that offense is legitimately scary now our offense has seemingly improved at the line but fallen in weapons but then again we gotta see what hue does with the wrs we currently have on the roster im still quite excited for the upcoming season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wrs are so over hyped in football though they rarely if ever make the difference so many other parts have to go right before a wr can really be that difference maker you need a good qb rb defense and ol you also need at least another legitimate wr threat or youre probably double teamed and your threat is greatly reduced i was really pulling for us keeping him but he wasnt invested in us and we got higher priorities than over paying someone like that maybe we regret it and maybe we dont either way i think we made the best decision with everything we now know today
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they got britt because they saw him as a comparable replacement to pryor they made him a solid offer of what they thought he was worth and he declined nobody made him a better offer theyre not just gonna throw almost double his value at him because he had nice season and well thats all they got general consensus amongst browns fans was approval of the fo not allowing themselves to be strongarmed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea just iirc
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i mean im not sure theyre going to cut him its just my best guess after reading articlestweets from people close to or with good knowledge of the situation im pretty sure i read a couple weeks ago that they said theyre gonna let him compete for the job i saw that too of course hue is going to say brock will compete for the starting gig how would it look if he said no he wont be competing for the job at all why would you eat mil and not keep him on the team the point of trading for brock wasnt to keep him they wanted houstons pick per usa today it allows them to sweeten a possible trade offer for patriots qb jimmy garoppolo and it helps the team get closer to the salary cap floor teams have to spend at least of the cap per nfl rules without having to hand a risky longterm deal out to a free agent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i really wanted to dispute this point but short of herman moore larry fitzgerald and maybe josh gordon im having trouble thinking of a wr who thrived longterm without consistency under center which makes guaranteeing pryor a long term deal for a ton pretty risky
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shocking
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well they paid antonio so yeah
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it literally doesnt matter what team this guy is on for fantasy purposes anyways going to feast
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the juice is locked down i suppose
fantasyfootball,not_removed,duh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bears do shit in the woods
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keeping rff relevant
fantasyfootball,not_removed,say that when he gets traded to the browns
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but the chicago bears shit on the field
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this isnt true
fantasyfootball,not_removed,didnt they tag antonio brown earlier today im expecting ben to renegotiate his contract for a more team friendly one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well crowell rushed for yards in a shared backfield on a team that had one win and was playing from behind a lot and this may just be my opinion but hes a better rb than crowell so i would say hed be fine on the browns
fantasyfootball,not_removed,true very very true
fantasyfootball,not_removed,great point how much of a shared backfield was it in cleveland this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah new information means that the tag should go down yes as they did use the exclusive
fantasyfootball,not_removed,duke johnson had carries for yards rec for yards crowell had carries for yards rec for yards so probably around a split i cant find the total snap counts quickly so just ballparking it but total yards is not too shabby
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i dont blame people who dont watch the browns much for assuming they have an awful offense but theres definitely talent there crowell is a good back and with a healthy coleman its a very solid receiver unit cleveland is one or two new starters on the oline and a consistent quarterback away from scoring a lot of points the running game was hamstringed to a degree this year because they were always playing from behind
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so the keeper rules of my league are you can keep players rookie and vets i drafted derrick henry last season knowing i wouldnt get much out of him but hed be my rookie keeper so i need some advice on my vets i have ap cj anderson and jay ajayi that i have to keep of another note is this league is a team league and i actually have the and overall picks in the round and the overall pick of the round in the upcoming draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ajayi is a definite i could go either way on the other
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ajayi and peterson for me depending on where peterson lands obviously
fantasyfootball,not_removed,clive walford sammie coates deandre washington deandre smelter will tye tyler boyd paul perkins jordan todman zach zenner keith marshall and a couple others that are escaping my brain right now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eric ebron overall pick years ago and now megatron is gone he lost this offseason in anticipation of having a bigger role this upcoming season in team mock drafts he is consistently falling to the rounds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kirk cousins is currently going at according to fantasy pros but in team ppr mocks hes been sitting there in the i typically go the stream qb route so picking him up there would be a huge low riskhigh reward opportunity also tyler boyd is in an excellent situation to produce but i think the hype is going to build and push him up the draft board
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im looking at martellus bennett in the if he busts no harm done but hes got major upside depending on how hes used if brady is there for week well find out real quick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kenneth dixon cj prosise cruz
fantasyfootball,not_removed,check dynastysballerscom they have a really good too list
fantasyfootball,not_removed,adrian peterson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i also add to this list kevin white sterling shepard leonte caroo malcom mitchell arian foster due to no team signing him yet marvin jones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like ebron this upcoming season going to risk some sleepers in the mid rounds instead of reaching for olson like i usually do ebron in the late rounds is juicy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont see kevin white or marvin jones falling past rounds shepard is unlikely to fall to but its certainly possible so he works on that list as do the others
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they will in a team league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agree its hard to find non qbs with ebrons draft pedigree at his age that late in a fantasy draft megatron leaving isnt baked into his adp at all jameis winston is worth a flier also for a similar reason could be a cambig ben hybrid this upcoming season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you are right about white and jones but ukvnklly provided some interesting names
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just a little explaination on my picks i like sterling as a sleeper but can be boom or bust every week if cruz is healthy jones your tight may not fall but i feel will be good at some point but not for a full seasonits all pending on who stafford will throw to or if they treat him like the new megatron and how carroo i see going right into mathews place in miami also was my teammate in high schools cousin patriots have a history of putting their first drafted wr right into the fire arian foster is arian foster
fantasyfootball,not_removed,right but i usually never worry about a qb in my team league i also like eli manning this year two crisp route runners possible cruz return redzone threats in new tight ends and a european specimen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr league keepers are kept for one round ahead of where they were drafted drafted in keep for a undrafted players can be kept for halfway between round and their projected adp eg undrafted previously but an adp of round means keep in the round two keepers possible right now my only locked in keeper is lesean mccoy for a second rounder options for my second keeper amari cooper for a larry fitzgerald for a tyler eifert for a matt ryan for a my main choice would be either cooper or fitz the others included are really my only other options of any value whatsoever
fantasyfootball,not_removed,refresh rff constantly for news updates people here are deadly quick with updates
fantasyfootball,not_removed,listen to podcasts if you stay in forums you get sucked into the that fits what i want to hear so it must be right mentality almost all podcasts worth listening to have multiple hosts and they go out of their way to provide an opinion a reaction and a countopinion its formulaic but it does help keep the hype train at bay
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if your league has custom scoring this site helps a ton httpappsfantasyfootballanalyticsnetprojections it was passed to me just sharing the love if you add this with what the others are saying about the podcast you can zig while others are zagging hope this helps good luck this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fyi smart is a poor adjective for intuition which means insight without reason
fantasyfootball,not_removed,poison
fantasyfootball,not_removed,collusion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is a big one not only updates but there are a lot of awesome people on this sub who have posts that help with which kickers to pick up which defenses to play which wrs have better match ups that week compared to others what players are going to be hot on the waiver wire etc etc subscribe to this sub and check it often if you can get through a lot of the circle jerkingconfirmation bias that goes around there are some quality posts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what he said and something to notify you of news like twitter or sleeperbot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what podcasts are some of your favorites
fantasyfootball,not_removed,heres my dilemma before the start of the season i told each member of the league friends of mine they had to pay their buy in money before the draft or they forfeited a pick a week each member obliged and i collected from all but one member whos in tech school in the usaf i told him he could pay me when he gets back over winter break by the time he was back he was guaranteed a finish so i let him keep the place money and pay me the rest he owed after this last weekend he won first place for the second year in a row due to an amari cooper stat correction the rest of the league is pissed because hes arrogant as heck now heres my problem they say that because he didnt pay the full money to me then have me give back the third place money its an illegitimate year because of this but i believe its just their disdain for the winner everythings fine right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and this friends is why we dont make exceptions to rules
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,top post in sub history also
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im josh gordon and i approve this message
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think the case for zeke was evident if you saw the pro bowl starting line up for the nfc lineman had stars on their helmet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think zekes floor is higher but a much lower ceiling bell has the injurysuspension risk and dj is stuck on cardinals who seem to be trending in the wrong direction if im in a ppr league im going dj bell zeke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in a way hes a safer pick than bell or dj this guy now has a year under his belt and the pass attack will improve with dak no longer being a rookie so teams cant just stack the box also towards the end of the year zeke started catching more passes than most rbs not named bell and dj all of these guys are elite and i know zeke is going first in my leagues since everyone here is cowboys homer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,any case would have to come down to durability offensive line and overall team strength
fantasyfootball,not_removed,offensive line deangelo williams doesnt come back standard scoring only
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if palmer and roethlisberger were to retire you could make a good case for him otherwise the pass catching is going to give bell and dj the edge
fantasyfootball,not_removed,zeke is poised to be one the best for ff next year as a zeke owner this year i watched a lot of the cowboy games his first two games were nothing special in terms but then he flipped the switch the games against cleveland lions he was benched for half taking away a full game of potential extra touches he is too good not to get the ball on some more screen passes i expect him to be right up there with david johnson next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,after dalvin breaks loose next year theyll be saying zeke who
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theres always the chance he gets more catches next season weve seen hes a talented pass catcher he just didnt get much usage there i wouldnt be surprised if we saw him pick another couple passes a game and have his ppr value get pretty close to bell and dj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in standard leagues as long as his oline remains the same i could see him going dj is a no brainer though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would consider taking him overall even in ppr simply because his floor is so high and solid
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lot to look at if the cowboys retain lance dunbar zekes receptions out of the backfield will continue to suffer because for some reason the coaching staff feels like dunbar needs to be out there every and long
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in non ppr leagues im going with zeke number
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dj and leveon both got injured at the end of last season z edit also ben might retire which would hurt leveon and carson might move on which would hurt dj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,david zeke someon someone bell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had a hunch on zeke and picked him number overall this year not upset
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no in a or ppr league receptions are just too valueable in a league the difference between belldj and elliot in the receiving category is something like catches and receiving yards for a total of fantasy points that is rushing yards and tds worth of points there is just no way elliot is that much better as a runner to close that gap even in half point ppr that gap is too much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go zeke based on what he did his rookie year i would expect similar results in year if not better dj is that entire offense but uncertainty at qb makes him a bit riskier bell is always a wc super talented but suspensions and im always worried about an injury but really cant go wrong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so much this zeke is also getting more patient terrifying as a giants fan if he can keep learning to wait for holes to develop and take a page from bells handbook the guy is going to go ballistic next year that said teams will absolutely be more ready next season for the cowboys anyone with them on their schedule will have an asterisk next to them because you want to shut down the top team in the nfc i wouldnt say hes in for a sophomore slump or necessarily a todd gurleyesque our entire gameplan is stop this man type regression but you can bet your ass that other teams will be trying their hardest to stop him and force dak to throw the question is will zeke and that line be too good for the other teams to handle
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we should know the outcome before next preseason but zeke is a suspension risk too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just wondering how you can be so confident the passing game will be better i understand dak was a rookie but their have been example of nfl quarterbacks having good statistical seasons early in their career and then regressing once the book is out on them injuries i know nick foles bortles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,full games week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is his floor any higher than dj or bell though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its because zeke sucks at screens
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dunbar going out on and long is so obvious i like dunbar but he can only one thing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the question is will zeke and that line be too good for the other teams to handle i agree with your point but this is the crux when you are that talented as a group even if they scheme against you it just drops you from elite to good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am sure teams will plan for it but they knew this year the cowboys are going to try and run the ball more than anything they still couldnt stop zeke if i were to hear in training camp they are focusing on using zeke in the pass game more i may instantly jump him up to first best offensive line developing qb with a star wr qb can also run as well and watching zeke if he gets more passes at top speed i have more confidence in him breaking it away than even bell or dj zeke just has insane strength and speed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,atlanta is the top team in the nfc
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you arent wrong but from what we know the investigation was washed away due to zeke having damning text evidence that his exgf was planning to ruin his career
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dak hasnt shown any signs of being reckless with the ball like those other have having a beast of an oline and run game opens it up for him too he has strong receivers in beasely and dez that are theres really just no reason to think things would get worse
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we dont play week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,considering the aging defense deteriorating around dj and bell with his suspensioninjury concerns i feel like zeke is the safe choice i could be wrong though edit aging offense not defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea but if you drop from elite to good you aint going at
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its only one play and simple as can be but with all that talent youd have to be insane to not run this play twice per game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,she shouldve claimed she got him high
fantasyfootball,not_removed,love it had the pleasure of gathering the young pup this year sadly i wont be getting a top three pick this year but his talent and build is insane
fantasyfootball,not_removed,take that point floor and be happy hes ranked the te still and the only tight end i think id take over him is reed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and reed has a grade shoulder sprain which is no joke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,actually forgot about that since he played through it in that case olsen is the option and i wouldnt take him out of the lineup consistency with a high ceiling is something you wont find anywhere else at the position especially with injuries
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you ever get any tp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey this is pretty cool work i think you can be a bit more accurate if you for a teams lbs calculate by each game instead of per season for example the steelers lbs may be low this year since bell started games and deangelo but either were used heavily when they started calculate the offensive share of the lead back say a team had offensive snaps in a game if the lead back ran times and caught balls his offensive share is this is quite useful because it will show how much running backs are being used not just on the field my personally belief is that last year was an anomaly that will skew the draft towards wrs do to recency bias its going to be great picking up in the round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont want to be wined and dined by cj his suaveness anderson and the gary kubiak offense but my god that opportunity gets me going
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would say the downward trend started before if i had to guess can you go any further back with this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i hope this is the case rbbc makes sense in theory but god i love watching spectacular lead backs i love rostering them too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think the answer is both rbs had an ugly the good news is theyre all pretty cheap this year because of that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you miss the top wrs go rbrb this year the value is higher than it has ever been charles is practically free and you can pair him with a guy like freeman name another year when you could get the prior years top scoring rb that did not change teams is still young and hungry and expected to be in the same role this late
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beautiful this is why i love this subreddit thanks man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes and yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree on all fronts i just didnt have the time to do that haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,like i said this is what football outsiders had available i didnt see any other site with percentages
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i put in an edit but the title is not really a boolean question i realize its a bit of both im just trying to point out that there may be a rise in lbs from last season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is technically correct but people seem to say that most teams in the league are going to rbbc and that just isnt completely true
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would think pff at least has the snap counts if not you could probably perform the same analysis on rush attempts rather than snaps obviously you might see slightly different results basing it off a different metric but it might be worth exploring the option with more data
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that just isnt completely true this is a very good point everyone is gunshy because of last year but there seems to be more bellcowesque teams this year than at any point in my fantasy career i count teams that are virtual locks barring injury to have one feature back ari dal car gb hou ind la mia min nyj oak pit sea sf tb and another that are likely to feature a single back bal chi det den kc no ten sd was
fantasyfootball,not_removed,completely agreed like i said this was just a little thing i did at work
fantasyfootball,not_removed,breesus christ forgives all sins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,doesnt change the fact that payton is a man child
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ingram and i got no beef if he bounces back big time against a vulnerable sf
fantasyfootball,not_removed,everyone except the coach eh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for some weird reason i regained confidence in mark
fantasyfootball,not_removed,followup question drew would you start him on your fantasy team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have a gut feeling hes going to go fucking apeshit next week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,awww drew is so darn nice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not blaming op but posts like these are getting ridiculous what is he gonna say fuck this piece of shit rb brees is known to at least in the medias eyes be a nice guy and teammate that with coupled with getting the win of course hes gonna at least be nice what would be more telling would be if he had nothing to say when asked but very rarely are teammates going to talk trash about each other to the media its getting to the point that were gonna start posting what the equipment manager thinks his jersey was extra sweaty even being benched he definitely knows hes gotta do better with that said ingram tds per game ros confirmedpleasepleaseplease
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you drew at least someone believes in him fuck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i see ingram has trumps endorsement
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my two players are in a bromance and thats cute
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brees loves mark ingram well that makes one of us
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a game against san fran is a good confidence booster for anyone this is fantasy and we must play the matchups and this is the best matchup for ingram all season these things happen like mr brees said so keep him in your lineups unless you have an even better matchup that you feel safer with
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love mark ingram some of my best friends are mark ingram
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the ball is going bounce back right out of his lap more like it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what the hell is brees supposed to say ingram has low end value at this pointif that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i hate mark ingrammark ingram owners
fantasyfootball,not_removed,have dj on a bye next week and really tempted to somehow buy low on ingram with a juicy matchup next week against sf
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wish i played football with drew brees
fantasyfootball,not_removed,am i missing something he definitely had a really bad game against a team where not much was expected from him but why are people treating him like the bomb in batman is it just because his coach is an asshole is it unheard of to come back from back to back fumbles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i swear to god if they sit him when he goes against the im gonna be pissed i need him for dj and lamars bye
fantasyfootball,not_removed,should we bench him next week at this point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,breesus king of the drews
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tbf to payton they won the game and maybe ingram even learned a lesson edit well didnt they
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i always tell myself to stay away from saints during the draft because i know sean payton will make a decision like this at some point i already had to suffer through a game where ingram lost goal line tds to john fucking kuhn and now i had watch him ride the pine after one fumble sean payton has an anus mouth and looks like a weasel
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hell probably rush for yards and have a td called back for a penalty then fumble in the quarter and tim hightower will rush for yards and a td
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a vulnerable sf d but they are coming off the bye not like they magically grew a few lbs in that time but still
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its the drew effect
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i still cant brees has no impact on the decision for ingram to get in the game in a meaningful way unless payton allows it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,asking the important questions
fantasyfootball,not_removed,considering hes playing the niners that would be a yes a yearold amputee with mono could get yards on the ground against us
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fair enough but despite the buzzy quote there is some useful info in the article he wasnt carrying it loose payton said of the fumble against the seahawks they were able to just pull it free well be back to work with him payton said not fumbling had been a point of emphasis for ingram after the previous game which explains the quick decision to go to hightower
fantasyfootball,not_removed,make nola great again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was expecting to see some trumpish comments
fantasyfootball,not_removed,isnt this schedule about to suck i know playoffs against bucks are good i think tb actually has a good run defense but he might look like crap up until then fantasywise
fantasyfootball,not_removed,because a healthy starting running back is rarely benched an entire game for fumbling once in the first few minutes of a game and once last week too i suppose makes you wonder if the head coach is ready to move on
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they were lucky to with how trash hightower was on the goal line
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it wasnt one fumble he fumbled in the redzone last week and may have cost us that game while usually not an issue hes had ball security issues this year going back to training camp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you say that like john kuhn is garbage goal line work is a big part of his job and hes good at it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe draft players who can hang onto the ball
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pls dont do this to me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nah its fine they still have jim oneil as there dc he couldnt come up with a good run d no matter what players he had
fantasyfootball,not_removed,didnt he talk up jimmys role years ago before they let him go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sooo anyone but todd gurley
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if he gets the work i think sf and den are both good matchups for him denver has been beatable in the running game giving up most fantasy points carolina and la arent great and youve already addressed tb my gut says hes going to get his starting job back and be a high end end but this is an unpopular opinion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ready to move on hard to say if it was the right move but if they had lost that game peyton would have been canned with an exclamation point at the end of the year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah he wasnt great on the goal line carries but whos to say ingram would do better it was against seahawks who probably knew they would be running it if anything kuhn might have been the best choice hightower still had and yards running against seahawks thats pretty good all things considered and when it works huge win payton should get the benefit of the doubt even though it hurt your fantasy team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,every single time they were on the goal line i squinted to see the number on the back of the rb behindnext to brees cried inside and proceeded to burst out laughing all times lowtower got stuffed by the time i sounded like a person hanging by their last thread of sanity
fantasyfootball,not_removed,was he trash on the goal line or is seattles goal line run d just that good there were no holes created for him in those situations he even got hit as soon as he revived the ball on one down as a saints fan i can assure you mark wouldve likely faired the same way there hightower ran better yesterday than mark has in most of his games this year the move was a solid one and im hoping mark bounces back going forward
fantasyfootball,not_removed,david johnson wasnt very good on the goal line against them either
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that wasnt hightower in any sense at all the hawks covered every gap on every play ingram would have made no difference did you watch the game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ingram hasnt had an issue with fumbling before this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,too soon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea ingram has had his own goal line struggles in his career too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,even though it hurt your fantasy team thats the critical thing everyone forgets no one gives a fuck about your fantasy team nfl coaches care about winning football games thats fucking it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you know how rare it is for us to have a yard rusher and against a top defense too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have drafted mark ingram so many times in the last few years and every time payton ends up using three or four backs and using them well is that abt to happen again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i watched it and think he could have done more with the carries he had just my opinion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nobody forgets it and not a single person in history has ever mentioned it without jest most people just like to complain online about things that effect them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,couldnt agree more i feel like a lot of people in this sub dont follow football because they enjoy the sport they follow it because of fantasy football which is infuriating because apparently everyone thinks a game plan is shitty if their player wasnt involved professional nfl coaches know a bit more than your average redditor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,everyone commenting otherwise didnt watch the game and doesnt watch the saints often
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not gonna say that hightower didnt perform well in the opportunity yesterday but he got carries ingrams most this season is the backup against one of the best defenses in the league gets fed carries while the rb cant even get that many in games against less than stellar run defenses
fantasyfootball,not_removed,considering the post that logo was surprisingly well done

fantasyfootball,not_removed,bye week hell ty mont not playing today i needed a spot start so i grabbed adam thielen changed my team name to are you thielen it mr krabs for the week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jamaal the way down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hahaha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,got him for like in my auction draft satisfied
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats great thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fftodaycom
fantasyfootball,not_removed,top really isnt all that important as the cutoffs are fairly arbitrary for example using those cutoffs a wr that finishes each week would project as a when in reality hes probably an extraordinarily desirable and valuable top wr just use standard deviation to measure consistency its easy to calculate by hand and a program like excel makes it even easier
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks a bunch for anyone else wondering the consistency calculator at fftodaycom is exactly what i was looking for you can find it httpfftodaycomtoolscrankphp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you do make a good point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how close to him is a target within
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh man dont we all surely love daily random stats relating to deandre hopkins lmao
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes been killing it in my point per target league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the worst part is he will be on my bench and most rosters when he does go off for a big game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah he was a outrageous bust depending on scoring system and where drafted him and gurley have been a crap shoot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also that running game in atlanta has really put a dent in julios usage subtract that yard game and julio isnt so much of an elite still but more at the ranking amongst wrs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes not the bust its the qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,finally pulling the trigger and dropping him this week i need a delanie fillin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he is going to be a steal next season the dude is talented as hell this season obviously not so much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pawned him off for a round pick and john brown my team had no chance of making the playoffs turned out to be a great trade its sad really he was a key part of my championship team last season the volume is there and typically that means hell turn it around but with osweiler maybe not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh what could have beenif not for the lobster
fantasyfootball,not_removed,targets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im going to start him this week my options are slim the matchup is there he at least gets a few catches so we will see what happens wishing i wouldnt have lost aj green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rock lobster
fantasyfootball,not_removed,biggest bust i dont know my friend todd gurley would like to talk to you about that given his adp i think he might be a bigger bust
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and half of those turned into interceptions
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drafted hopkins and am now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dropped him this week i thought it was about time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and yet he has fewer yards than david johnson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,reads thread title downs rest of beer wipes tears off keyboard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brock osweiller fucked your mom and didnt call her afterwards espn probably
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah hes great in my ppt league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,got that fool in two leaguesso infuriating
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah and julio lost me my match last week in fact my playoffs basically start this week for me since this week decides if im in or out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,god give me a sign that its okay to drop hopkins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,random stat of the day deandre hopkins qb sucks balls
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no keenan allen was the biggest bust this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i thought i got a steal when i traded ab and ryan mathews away for nuk and cja after week one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,starting him this week in my flex over booker martin rawls tate and t williams ive benched for about months but the momentum gives me a gut feeling that he will score this week he has a high floor this week at a minimum
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have both of these guys i keep playing hopkins like hes gonna explode one game but alas fucking brock im so i guess i will keep doing what im doing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im still possibly foolishly hopeful that regression to the mean will bump up his production in the fantasy playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,divide the field into quadrants
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey get mad at osweiler for that not poor innocent nuk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,targeted at his foot maybe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i couldnt tell he was having a bad year by just being an owner of him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all he has are random stats unless you look at all of them then he just has stats
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fun fact people who drafted deandre hopkins on average have a worse record than a random owner
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a real stud just like jerrick mckinnon in my point per carry league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that was a hopkins target
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks for that made me laugh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,benched him the last few weeks first time i benched him was when they played against minnesota while they were hot and he ended getting a garbage time td i said never again and for the next few weeks i played him for single digit points in a made some trades and picked up some wrs so hell continue to sit regarldess of who they play now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,havent benched him yet hes in my flex now thanks to trades so if he keeps getting the or so in ill be happy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when he does go off for a big game lol hes had game points in scoring but i think most people are just using him as a flex like i am and even then hes not worth it most weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,proud of myself for drafting him and gronk and still am somehow going to make it to the playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so glad i own both
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gurley at least isnt that far off from a solid obviously not but still worth a plug just on volume alone nuk isnt even close to playable
fantasyfootball,not_removed,subtract games from any player and their ranking falls that yard game is what makes him elite
fantasyfootball,not_removed,every top wr this year has a signature massive game that has put them in the top take that huge game out of their résumés and theyre all in that range
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its not really the running game as freeman ran like a monster last year matt ryan is just utilizing manugabriel much better than he did roddystone hands last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if a player doesnt perform to their adp or whatever metric you want to throw in here theyre objectively a bust in my mind doesnt matter what the reason was injury—yes im including injury— different schemesituation lack of opportunity etc you invested in a player expected that player to perform to a certain level and they did not hence they were not worth drafting where you drafted them bust
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn i didnt realize people have been dropping him i barely have the balls to take him out of my line up let alone drop him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dropped him last weekhe does no good for me on the bench
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im very worried about a holdout with him next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wont osweiler still be the qb next year if so i wouldnt touch hopkins until maybe the round and probably still wouldnt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crunchy or puffy cheetos
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hello margaret this is god your period is natural and wonderful also drop nuk i went double or nothing with satan over that job thing he said hopkins wasnt qbproof i said dude tj yates brandon weeden do your worst my bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive got him sitting in my bench just hoping he pulls some miracle around
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for like halves the long way brock threw it to the same side of the hash marks guess hes targeting hopkins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am which is why im asking to define a target sometimes nuk get balls at the defender into the ground over the sideline and its called a target
fantasyfootball,not_removed,osweiler is shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its so upsetting because if he was living up to expectations i would have the unquestionable best team in my league i have bell evans shady brees vikings d and had cj anderson as a rb until he went down if i was even just under what hopkins was averaging last year i would be unstoppable instead im and i have to gamble on receivers like steve smith desean jackson etc having a good game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks mitch hedberg
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i know youre joking but mckinnons sucked just about as much in my point per carry league as normal scoring formats
fantasyfootball,not_removed,at least gronk had like weeks when healthy and when not you could start a te instead of getting the from dhop haha this from someone who owns neither
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i can still make the playoffs after going hopkins and keenan allen long shot but still possible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hopkins first and keenan allen second in a team league somehow holding on to a playoff spot this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you take away julios catches from last week he scored points absolute bust i cant believe this sub is still so high on him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hypothetical say youre trying to plan a budget that you want to set for yourself every month you look back at your spending over each of the last months and see the totals as and this gives you an average of about per month in this situation would you plan your monthly budget to be or would you recognize the outlier for what it is and calculate around it obviously julios situation isnt anywhere near as extreme however the message is the same when looking at ppg its usually used as a sort of predictive stat if your average values are thrown off by outliers why would you plan them occurring sure they do happen sometimes but outliers are by nature anomalous the safer more grounded route is to recognize that one cannot expect outliers to occur in my opinion a player that can get you points every week is much more valuable than a guy that will get you points a week with an occasional point performance for whatever reason people hate this argument around here maybe im misinterpreting what people use it against but this seems to be the most common way i see it presented
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he is an elite boom or bust player most elite players have a much higher floor every week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im just saying with respect to last year i feel like his numbers have declined somewhat significantly i think he is on pace for less yards and like less targets at least we knew he would decline but it certainly has me worried
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but yards is a massive outlier in the history of the game massive if you keep that as still an elite game lets say yards that drops him into the middle of that second tier of wr but hed also have games under points no other wr in the top has that many total busts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it was a joke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not mike evans hes had a few mediocre games but is typically putting up the wr numbers for the week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont get me wrong i agree im just saying its not his fault he is as good as a first round pick unfortunately his qb is holding him back from being one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i get what you are saying and i agree with the sentiment but bust typically implies that underperforming in an unforeseeableunexpected way ie hopkins gurley in my opinion injuries are not unexpected i assume at least one of my players is going to get injured every year in a significant way this year it was cja not only that injuries can often be attenuated or prepared for ie booker in a way that busts usually cannot granted this is just semantics
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes a boom or bust mostly bust wr id rather take my chances with some other wrs ive managed to pick up at least if they only put up points i wont be as disappointed since theyre a waiver pick and not a first round draft pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hard hitting question im going to say crunchy i dont like how the puffy cheeto sticks to roof of my mouth that being said tank my dog prefers puffy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its me again im trying to pick up tyreek hill and sammy watkins in place of jeremy mackiln and deandre hopkins ps thanks for boobies the grand canyon and saturdays you da man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im probably going to keep playing him and either go down with the ship or benefit from a rebound i would rather lose with hopkins playing than lose with him posting a big number on my bench
fantasyfootball,not_removed,throw at is generally the definition doesnt have to be catchable
fantasyfootball,not_removed,someone posted a video of osweiler missing cjf a tight end by overthrowing him while he was wide open by feet deandre hopkins was wide open in the middle of the field as well they are getting open and he is missing them that kills drives which kills opportunities its infuriating
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hopkins might as well be an aspen with brick lobster back there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,some people dont think it be like it is but it do
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i find it distinctly not pretty neat
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same here i basically had one of my first six picks left since i drafted hopkins charles l murray decker maclin and j gordon still almost managed to make playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill be here all week ill be here after that too but ill be here all week as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats been my issue in one league i had hoprobinson i keep rolling these guys out over and over and over while my leaguemates are starting guys like tyrell williams and fucking kenny britt and smoking me i need to learn to cut my losses earlier haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you must be a waiver wire wizard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you take away all of brandin cooks targets from last week nothing changes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i know ur joking but just for visibility normally when you take out outliers you have to take the top one and the bottom one out or change them to the and percentile scores take away his yard game and his yard game youre still left with games under points while now you have no games above points change his yard game score points to the percentile score which would be points and change his yard game points to his percentile score which would be points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bro i wish i could afford a monthly budget of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no no doubt this argument is valid its why guys like decker last year were so lauded despite being the receiver on the year julio has been disappointing for me this year mainly because of his games this year have been complete busts thats and disturbingly high but would you trade julio for someone like jordy nelson in my ppr league nelson receiver has had just one real bust with points and a mediocre game with no other game has gone below points would you make that trade i dont think i would and throwing away julios point game is not an good way of adjusting his true performance i think pushing it down to say a would be a better option then he and jordy would average almost exactly the same ppg fantasy is a game of ceiling and floors they both can win and lose you matches
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is definitely the truth i aim for players that i am pretty much guaranteed to hit double digit points with weekly i will take from each player on the roster and be happy just takes one guy to go off to secure a win if the team floor is
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but if you consider a yard game an outlier for julio then shouldnt you also consider a game where he has like catches for yards as an outlier its a bad argument for julio this season because i think he has or underwhelming games but my point holds true for the general argument you are trying to make
fantasyfootball,not_removed,like who theres very few receivers this year who have been consistently good week in week out aside from ab and maybe evans nobody has given you consistent production every week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre basing this off of julios ridiculous season he had last year theres no elite receiver this year that havent put up stinkers obj has had a pretty down year considering expectations and has several shit games aj green is hurt but put up a couple bad games hilton is boom or bust even ab has a couple single digit games in ppr wrs this year just arent having the year they did last year that doesnt speak to julio individually watching him play hes as good as hes ever been theyre spreading the ball a little more and are a better team so way less garbage time points besides evans i would love to know where these elite wrs are that have such a higher floor than julio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id say his yard td game was his signature game the point total in ppr says it is
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yup his worst games were points in standard and points yards pt conversion i consider stinkers below points or if a has like or games in a row like that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre trying to ascribe value to whose fault it is but it doesnt matter whose fault it is in the slightest
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with everything you said there but taking in the situation is part of evaluating a player no wr plays without the help of their qb qbs need to be evaluated when considering the wr we can agree all day that its not hopkins fault for being a bust but bottom line is that he is one and its solely due to his situation so it has to be accounted for during player evaluations saying things like its not his fault avoids the core problem
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea i see what you are saying i just cant bring myself to do it haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,correct answer you can live
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he probably said that at a show a week before his death
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah but what if next week is the week he goes off
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drafting melvin gordon helped out a lot picked up crowder and jordan howard traded for dez too im just more pissed about what could have been we have tiny benches so ive had to drop people i didnt want to drop often led to me dropping ajayi beasley and rob kelley earlier in the season so theres been hits and misses hahah
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fun fact you can square the number of cooks targets and yards from last week add it by divide by and nothing changes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i also have to add i tried to find a wr in who had at least points a game he doesnt really exist this year outside of the top who all have at least single digit games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i would also advocate for that no doubt however i think lowrange outliers are a lot more common for any player than highrange outliers so it may be worth taking the low numbers more into consideration as always though it depends on the player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it doesnt hold true because its not an outlier when it happens in of his games julio has or fewer points over of the time you cant just say outlier to that you can say outlier when its data point representing of his games and a near historic feat yards is the highest in history thats an outlier in football history not just for julio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,his floor is lower than most he has games with or fewer points no other wr in the top has more than no other wr in the top has more than
fantasyfootball,not_removed,contrary to popular belief odb has actually had a pretty good year jordy too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well when you take away those two
fantasyfootball,not_removed,amari cooper tyrell moncrief these past few weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes other wrs put up bad games but not nearly as many at such a low score julio has games with or fewer points no other wr in the top has more than no other wr in the top has more than
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe not this season but in general it certainly does matter if for some reason the texans qb situation changes next season deandre hopkins adp would go up compared to if osweiler is again next season because hes a great wr and it wasnt his fault that he wasnt getting points if he was a bad wr that wouldnt be true and his adp would sink
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it does in my keeper league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keep em comin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,closest youll get to that for a non elite wr is crowder his low scores were very early before the team really found its high usage role for him but for straight games hes been that guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i literally mentioned in my post how this argument shouldnt be used for julio this season because he has so many underwhelming games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what is the point of adding moncrief he got you points for half the year i guess that is pretty consistent though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,amari just got points last week in standard lol hes had plenty of duds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id say is pretty near to and
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cool good point its not helpful for his fantasy value but it is helpful in evaluating him for the future
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the general argument is that a single outlier can be disregarded or at least devalued your counter was that low scores should be discounted which would only be true if they were an outlier which they arent meaning your whole point is not applicable also consider that in fantasy most people take the stance of mitigating risk high outliers are good so dont usually need to factor into a risk assessment whether a player scores or the owner will be happy with that output the height of the ceiling isnt as important low outliers on the other hand are very very bad and that floor is likely going to hurt more from an elite player whether a player scores or that will get very different reactions from an owner so even though the difference in score to vs to is the same the help vs hurt often isnt because elite players are supposed to be able to mask possibly low scores from lower players
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its vs times vs times over the course of the year thats the difference between going and all by changing a single player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and his future effects his current value in keeper and dynasty leagues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont understand that argument really floor and ceiling can both win you games they are both legitimate strategies i dont understand how reactions from the owner are supposed to actually mean something julio may have lost me some weeks but he definitely won me some
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well thats what youre getting with a lot of the top receivers this year a lot of boom or bust i agree hes been pretty disappointing in a few games at the same time if youre depending on him to single handedly win you every single week your team probably isnt great to begin with and the argument is moot those few stinkers hes had hes had double those that have single handedly won you weeks or put you at a huge advantage those record examples dont hold any water when hes done so well in the games he has shown up which is of them and has been better than basically ever wr in the league those weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well first of all julio winning a week has only really happened once this year his only game with was that yard week so thats a a gamecosting a game ratio this whole thing is also assuming you have a good team lets say everyone hits their projections at roughly the same rate so it averages out if youre projected to get every week and every other team projects to then whether julio gets his projected or hits doesnt really matter you win either way however it does matter if he hits or a vs a would result in a loss vs a win while a vs a just results in a bigger win julio is costing owners games at a rate because of his low performances being happy with an or a isnt just about how the owner feels its about the likelihood of those numbers leading to a win while a likely leads to a loss
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well thats what youre getting with a lot of the top receivers this year uh the whole point is that no youre not seeing that level of bust as consistently even in the top let alone top at the same time if youre depending on him to single handedly win you every single week your team probably isnt great to begin with and the argument is moot this is completely the wrong way of thinking you arent expecting him to win it single handedly but a from a stud hurts a lot more than a from a flex player and can lose you a week single handedly the whole point was that weekly differentials are often small enough that a player expected to get points every week getting less than that will be the difference between a win and a loss with the rest of the team staying exactly the same those few stinkers hes had hes had double those that have single handedly won you weeks or put you at a huge advantage how many of his win you a week on his own would the team have won with just a point performance hes also only put up ie winaweekonhisown type numbers numbers once so thats win he gave single handedly gave you to games he probably lost you those record examples dont hold any water when hes done so well in the games he has shown up this seems like you just dont get math him putting up or less in weeks amounts to a rate of likely costing you a win if he did it times then hes costing you a win at a rate if he did it twice then hes costing you wins at an rate games in a season lost at a rate at at this is meant to show that if you had an undefeated quality team they could turn into an team because of julios bust rate
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes but you need to consider the replacement value of the player you could theoretically plug in instead
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes put up far more than one point game in ppr hes has yard games outside of his yarder you can make any argument you want on how bad you think hes been but the fact of the matter is youre not looking at it in the context of wrs as a whole this year evans and ab are the only two wrs id even consider rather having than julio look at obj for instance hes had a couple single digit stinkers and several more point games hes basically lived up to his boom potential or so weeks hilton and cooper are in the class under the elite wrs in that range and theyve had numerous garbage games as an owner of julio last year and this year its been a disappointment in the scope of him individually when you look at it from a positional perspective hes been a top wr for most of the year i dont know how you can legitimately complain about him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the whole point of this discussion isnt whether you should sit julio its about whether hes worth drafting where he has been looking forward the replacement value would be another stud who will have put up similar numbers just without the super high yard game but also without the duds and this year id argue there are wrs who fit that bill now it should be noted that of those have had injury problems this year and so would be knocked down and id still prefer julio but their consistency when healthy bench player may possibly still be preferable
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio was the receiver drafted in my ppr league and most likely all leagues no doubt i would also take mike evans before him now so ignoring injuries who are the wrs you would take before him just to add this lets say we plug in other top receivers this year into your projection scenario jordy nelson the receiver this year has had games of and thats losses and a ties ty hilton the receiver has had games of thats losses davante adams the receiver has had games of and thats losses earlier you said a vs a would result in a loss vs a win while a vs a just results in a bigger win by that logic i could say a vs a just results in a smaller loss youre cherrypicking stats to fit your narrative consider julio and jordys stats arranged from highest to lowest outputs juliojordy when arranged in this order julio has outscored jordy in weeks i know this is out of context you claim that julio has cost owners games at a rate this year which seems fair but claiming that someone like jordy has put up a year that created fewer losses seems incorrect when both players have good games julios games are better their very biggest busts are the same and points second biggest a spread of points the next two is where your point is strongest as jordy outscored julio by points in each but would this create a win maybe but if is the cutoff for a tie than no it wouldnt but you also claim that davante adams has cost less games than julio julioadams this doesnt seem to be true i still think i would rather have the receiver who outscores the other on weeks than go with one whose busts are and points higher and to round it up lets check compare julio and tys lowest outputs juliohilton their lowest games were complete busts but ty outscored julio in every single one will the points prevent a loss doubtful but sticking with the model the next games result in losses for ty i dont know where you will find receivers who have outperformed julio this year besides the two drafted before him and the previously mentioned mike evans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go with mccoy less severe injuries along with less competition char and ware are both great back ups so i see touches being taken from charles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lesean mccoy lacy possibly ingram and doug martin still around all are pretty good options for a at that stage
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how many teams and who would be some of the top backs left if lacy is there i grab him yeldon anderson ivory jstew johnson arz
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mccoy lacy forte anderson were all available rd or later in my most recent mock id have no problem with mccoy as my a little concern with lacy or anderson and some concern with forte once youre passed lacy anderson forte i personally look for steady eddy guys for the next two picks i love poring woodhead with hill jstew or murray and also really like gio for the spot i think those guys will end up top rbs even if we dont know how consistent hill will be or what murray will look like later rounds i also target jennings and ivory because i know theyll get catches lastly if i go wrwr i actually try to target deangelo even tho many people will disagree but if i know i can get a great weeks then who knows what trades i can work out to fill a hole even if that trade doesnt involve dwill with games down usually someone else will emerge that has value on your squad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in my draft i got mccoy and rawls in the third and round i had the third pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what round would u target deangelo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont get me started on rawls that guy is next beastmode in sea
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like him as early as preferably the moment im wondering who else down these rankings has more upside than the low potential im looking at thats when its right for deangelo for me others disagree that hes on weeks but hes only weeks for now its not like bell is the post child for health even a week loss later in the year for bell and you just got another week out of dwill how many guys after will ride your bench most of the year just waiting for them to hit dwill has a higher likelihood of hitting weeks than many rbs drafted before him edit all of that is if games suspension is confirmed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in espn mocks i keep getting him the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love the guy i trust him as much as anyone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr teampick brees ingram woodhead dak
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brees and ingram normally avoid qb keepers but a top option at a great price in format is worth it ingram is a real nice value in the too for a backend
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shit my opponent has robinson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chances arob goes off again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this ends my season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its remarkable i made it to a championship with arob as my early round pick and now this is the guy that i feel is going to make or break my team this week some good news is ivory looks fit to play and denard robinson will also be back colts run defense isnt very good so jax should be able to open up the offense dear bortles just throw it up there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who s
fantasyfootball,not_removed,psa hurns only really played like twice this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i picked him up yesterday in the second week of the ship cause everyone else stopped paying attention yay week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im gonna start him i think its him or sss eli rogers and tyrell i like sss for stories sake but i think arob gets another targets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you got this brother i too drafted arob in the as well as alshon in the and maclin in and was able to eek out a victory in the ship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drafted hopkins in the and arob in the still made it to the ship this week hopefully arob can carry me to an unlikely victory
fantasyfootball,not_removed,steve needs to pass tim brown for all time ravens beat reporters were saying he could get targets lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drafted arob in the second as well picked him up off waivers right before the game last week with big ben bell and obj probably not playing im carrying the into the final battle
fantasyfootball,not_removed,paying for fantasy advice is like paying for porn only your crazy uncle still does it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,skip the bullshit wwwborischenco
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wwwfantasyapecom does the top two experts on each position though who knows if theyll continue to do it now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,f
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it looks like they changed their payment model where it include all sports and the draft and inseason tools are bundled i will definitely be jumping back on their train because of that the old way was stupid
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and im sure in both cases your crazy uncles have convinced themselves that its worth the price
fantasyfootball,not_removed,or other people pay for it and you get it for free
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but this isnt paying for advice its paying for draft and inseason roster management tools
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it wasnt until recently that boris chen did his rankings from ecr experts in total since moving from ecr his rankings are from john paulsen jeff ratcliffe pro football focus justin boone thescore jake ciely rotoexperts mike clay espn patrick thorman pro football focus sean koerner stats sablich brothers down fantasy im sure a lot of these people are great and some might not be as strong but i like being able to compare peoples perspectives
fantasyfootball,not_removed,too bad boris doesnt do tiers of dynasty rankings
fantasyfootball,not_removed,porn definitely is its hard to find a midget with a ssbbw in a lesbian love session
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im sure a lot of these people are great and some might not be as strong i believe boris chen selected them specifically because theyre among the best over a period of time at what they do from his site the experts in the select pool are chosen based on individual experts accuracy and have demonstrated consistent accuracy above the rest over several seasons
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats basically all the deep web is
fantasyfootball,not_removed,looking into how these guys did over the past few years led me to where a compiled list of experts ranked by accuracy it exists and httpswwwfantasyproscomnflaccuracy on fantasypros ill just look into the individuals on my own it looks like clay and the sablich brothers had pretty off years last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i thought the deep web was just cheese pizza
fantasyfootball,not_removed,due respect this exact question has been posted almost every third day for the past weeks there is a search bar to the right to look for such topics of which there are multiple posts and answers to your question
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good post too bad its been asked every mins today
fantasyfootball,not_removed,denvermiami probably gonna have to drop miami to scoop vernon davis since reeds arm is apparently gonna fall off
fantasyfootball,not_removed,are you shitting me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i did exactly this earlier today although if reed is a go im a little nervous starting him against az who has been absolutely shutting down tes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah theres no way i sit reed if he plays if not ill go davis or stack brate with evans to hedge things a bit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,speaking of those i loved the cartoon heads of all the players i would love to see those again if anybody has them or knows a link or if that guy that made them is still around here any new ones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,something like that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nfl used to put these up on their fb feed throughout the season if im not mistaken
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team dynasty we are allowed keepers at the cost of rounds i was offered lamar miller mike evans a round pick for leveon bell alshon jeffrey
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team dynasty ppr my antonio brown for his mike evans latavius murray kenneth dixon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is confusing its not a dynasty its a keeper league but you have a rookie draft or are you saying you get his first pick of the main draft next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if everyone is keeping players thats guys off the board by my understanding the most valuable players in the draft would likely be the top rookies but you dont really know what youll get yet you could get lucky and have fournette or chubb fall into a great situation but its a year out and a lot could happen so in a straightup millerevans vs belljeffery id lean belljeffery but its not drastic depending on how youve seen the drafts go previously the might be enough to be worth it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mike evans is only and will bolster your team for a long time but murray and dixon have no guarantees if you are in a rebuilding phase its an alright move but i would want more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would do that evans is about on my list compared to brown at its a little bit of a drop off this year but will help so much in the future oakland seems to trust murray and dixion is a first round rookie draft rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,post your whole roster for a better answer in general i think ab can command more but its a good trade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sorry for the confusion but yeah players off the board and i get first pick of main draft and we have a seperate draft each year for rookies
fantasyfootball,not_removed,first year of the league so im not real sure where to go here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also this is a dynasty because we dont lose draft picks if you opt to not keep any players it doesnt make a difference in your draft position next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that fact that theres a main draft makes it not a dynasty league this is a keeper league with a rookie draft which is weird but either way id keep leveon and alshon if it were a first round rookie pick i might lean to the evans side but i dont want what is essentially an round pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jared cook might be ebron could be maybe james jones from the steelers now that ladarius is on the pup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,witten is reliable to get you pts per game practically no ceiling with a decent floor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,which one of the two of us has access to your waiver wire go look there how are we supposed to know
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you gotta feel for the guys high on that list whose names we dont know
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eagles fans should check out the class of dgb and agholor clearly havent lived up to their potential
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just went through the last ten years most notable things i saw were julio and ajg at for their respective year as well as ab being completely overlooked
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this list is impressive i looked up some of the names i didnt recognize trey had off the field issues farmer has been on and off the seahawks practice squad with some time on the roster the top is outstanding later you have sammie coates at and devante parker at cody latimer at phillip dorsett at michael thomas at ty montgomery at brandin cooks at moncrief at and the top is outstanding i mean they arent all fantasy studs but thats an impressive year for high school wrs this has got to be better than average
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ab wasnt ab back then its not like the scouts missed anything on tape he developed through hard work into one of the top receivers in the game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the guy in my league with dj mike evans doug baldwin sanders matt ryan jordan reed stefon diggs finished i really dont know how actually the projected team finished in dead last
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr qb rodgers dalton rb d murray mccoy sproles wr ab fitz thomas benjamin sanu jackson te fleener henry dst cardinals jets k vinatieri finished overall highest pf
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pick in the draft julio evans rodgers lacy kelce tate gordon gost freeman keeper dj keeper landry keeper seattle dalton treadwell ebron henry diggs the keepers made up for a poorish mid round section and he had a typical starting roster of rodgersevansjuliolandrygordonfreemandjkelce added cooks tyrell rimatthews and mitchell in fa lost in the semis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team nonppr qbop league essentially qb guy drafted david johnson in the first elliot in the second nelson in the third and gordon in the seventh ran away with it i could never be so lucky as to draft the top three backs right off the bat my backs get injured end up in committees or beat their children
fantasyfootball,not_removed,standard draft qb brady brees rb dj mccoy gio bernard spencer ware wr jordy nelson ty hilton brandin cooks emmanuel sanders eric decker devante parker te gary barnidge k gostkowski dst philadelphia won the regular season playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,half ppr snake draft qb brees rb zeke rb gordon wr evans wr baldwin wr m thomas te olsen flex d freeman def carolina k crosby bench blount coleman jones other fillers best record currently fighting for place in week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,guy in a team league got brees brown evans and shady lost in the first round of playoffs to the team with dj bell an gordon rip
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brown bell nelson d murray m gordon does it even matter after that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dominated the season but lost week with this team julio dez evans demaryius murray brees kelce gore blount team ppr picked up matt ryan jordan howard devonte adams midseason
fantasyfootball,not_removed,httpsimgurcomgallerypnvjoit wire to wire though had to sweat week of playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mine
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah the best teams on paper fell flat on their face in a lot of my leagues the experts were off on so many top fantasy options this year murray forte blount etc you honestly could have autodrafted and had a decent shot of making the playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,projections lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably an or team league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow that team is insane who did he keep this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,added cooks in fa
fantasyfootball,not_removed,only busts were from injury barnidge wasnt great insane draft though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i picked up the exact same guys haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i auto drafted in my man league i just happened to miss the draft playing for the championship this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its a but thats not a crazy drafted team really dj evans lacy moncrief reed baldwin ben roeth sanders matt jones ne dst diggs tj yeldon ginn jr jay ajayi dropped him early i picked him up graham matt ryan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we declare in august probably gonna be gordon dj and freeman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dropped by someone after a bad weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah decker was the only serious injury mccoy also missed games and barnidge got dropped for kyle rudolph at some point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not bad ajayi went much lower than id expect though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not evans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea i guess he was pretty inconsistent that upside though had to be hard for him to the worst player on their team ah well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drafted in the second itd cost a first to keep him this way its
fantasyfootball,not_removed,her team at the end of week was qb luck cousins rb gore miller rmatthews dwilliams hyde wr dez jeffery cooks maclin mjones austin te ertz fleener k hasuchka def kc ertz was shitting the bed fleener had a bye and her wrs for the most part looked solid cooks was on bye and had combined the past few weeks for points she did cooks for martellus and dropped ertz for a def over kcs bye the logic is a bit hard to defend which is why she finished of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i get that youre right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn i like this idea and tried to contribute but there are too many damn trolls gonna be tough to fix this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol cant wait to see romo throw for yards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i didnt know the vikings had a guy named stefon dicks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not totally clear how this works so the rankings for the skill positions are determined based on an expected split in workload between players and the amount of points the team scores against defences
fantasyfootball,not_removed,weve done it reddit today i cried a tear of joy as the trolls became tired and joker mcjokersons red bull wore off you guys did marvelous
fantasyfootball,not_removed,click the link pick a team go thru and project how many yards your teams defense will give up type that number into the slot provided rankings complete
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for the most part fixed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and the rest of the nfce for yards i feel theres some bias in there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also there were two anonymous people on perhaps even working on edits when i switched the shared status if that was you i apologize please send me a message and i will complete your edits
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is why we cant have nice things
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did you consider making a google form as a data entry means and then averaging the data input to gather a wisdom of crowds value for each of the defence allowed yards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah but i reasoned that being able to mod anything on the page i think got more people involved if you had to go thru and just fill out teams stuff i dont think it would have gotten such a good response
fantasyfootball,not_removed,got a bit of a crazy one team standard keeper league team a has good keepers but only keeper spots team b won a weekly challenge that awards a keeper spot and can trade it who wins team a gives david johnson who can be kept for a rounder then costs rounds higher for the next years so draft he will cost round round round their pick this coming draft the cost to keep dj their pick next draft cost to keep dj team b gives jordy nelson who can be kept for a and then in draft for a but that is it the third keeper prize for this coming draft only their pick this coming draft the cost to keep jordy their pick next draft cost to keep jordy is team b giving up too much should they drop out the draft pick swap in draft and jsut do this coming years or is it not enough for locking in dj for the next seasons potentially trades involving keepers are always a tough nut to crack so just curious what others takes on this one would be
fantasyfootball,not_removed,to me the pick swapping is a wash you are getting to keep the player you get for free so it boils down to david johnson bs jordy and an extra keeper spot i take that all day you want david johnson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah thats my take on it as well thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i cant quite wrap my head around the exact value of the extra keeper prize unless i know how it would be used but keeping dj for cheaper and possibly longer than jordy looks like the winner here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,till he pukes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,number overall
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they are going to run this poor kid into the ground
fantasyfootball,not_removed,coach wants to get the ball to best player on the team shocker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whose his handcuff
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hnnnnnnng
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rip anyone in a keeper league who doesnt have dj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,huge load
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fully erect
fantasyfootball,not_removed,arians also said he wanted to get andre ellington touches a game a few seasons back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,more years of this beast on my keeper team then ill trade him away for a kings ransom right before he is worn down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,paging cj spiller
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no doubt about it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they are going to run this poor kid into the ground they ran lt into the ground and he still had a great career but seriously i hope dj does yoga or some shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for fantasy purposes ill be perfectly happy for the next few seasons taking him with a the top pick if i were a cardinals fan though id hope theyd get him some help so hes not done before
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how bout a keeper league where dj is a round pick last year i also have jordan howard for an rounder what are my chances you think
fantasyfootball,not_removed,leveon he was averaging more touches when he got back and is on a better offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes turning this year because he was older when he was drafted too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre set up nicely good on ya
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you dont win the league your friends get to talk shit for the rest of eternity i think unless dj and howard both die week but man am i glad i set our keeper rules to be more expensive on consecutive years with a tenth round cap our guy had dj for a tenth last year but he costs a this year if he wants to keep him next year itll have to be for a second rounder
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love them both i just like dj a little bit better im praying for or pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im keeping both bell n dj in my auction league but itll cost me about of my total budget think its worth it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah guys in my league have been doing it the same way for years and they dont like adjusting the rules when they get exploited ill be riding howard and johnson into the playoffs for years to come i can auto draft at this point and would still be in the money every year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have pick and im still undecided its so close between the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have no idea how auction leagues work but having bell and dj sounds pretty unfair
fantasyfootball,not_removed,percent of your budget seems very expensive for those two unless your league is very shallow in my league and what ive seen elsewhere the top picks last year went for around pc so that does not seem like a discount at all how much did the top picks in your league go for last year and is your league a low roster size or man league my comps are based on man rosters and man leagues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jesus no limit either enjoy your golden goose my friend hahah wouldnt be surprised to see them attempt to change it after you stomp them a few years in a row
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dj might get more touches but the steelers run whole drives that are literally give it to leveon times score td
fantasyfootball,not_removed,readdress it after the draft i could see either team taking a rb in what looks to be a solid class theyll remain and of course but that will give you a better idea
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not when you see how the rest of his team is going to turnout
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man league budget highest player last year zeke and he went for i paid for dj last year my mindset is that both bell and dj put up a consistent pts a game floor with some games at if i can score a half decent qb it would be a damn consistent team assuming neither gets injured lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agree with this also im more confident about the state of the steelers offense overall vs a declining carson palmer who might be easier to gameplan against
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just hope he stays healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,l e v e o n e v e o n
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i hope he announces hes going to rehab right before kickoff no im not bitter about josh gordon s
fantasyfootball,not_removed,feet are too nice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wasnt fortunate enough to have him on my team this year but im damn excited to watch him play again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jesus his footwork and vision are amazing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the way he cuts man is like watching someone scoop icecream with a blowtorch super smooth its almost like hes skiing without any on the way he sinks into his legs right before a cut but lightning fast and smooth as all get out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do not forget to buy super low on d will in a few weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wont believe it until sunday after today im afraid hell join josh in rehab
fantasyfootball,not_removed,juice is loose
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the bell is ringing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just like with allen and countless others in the past i feel like he is going to reinjure himself almost right away because he will start going right from the get go and you cant do that after being away for so long
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i own williams in both my leagues bell in neither i hope bell stays healthy the guy is a pleasure to watch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,b e l l e l l
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im just picturing tom brady announcing hes going to rehab xd
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with rice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and the fact that he seems to just shrug off nfl defenders like graders playing crush the carrier
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its his cuts which i suppose involve footwork he pivots on a dime so smooth such low center of gravity but hes always moving south to north its incredible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he has already been dropped in my man ppr league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and someone made a good point in an earlier thread about how he doesnt just run through holes he hesitates and then bursts through them hes unreal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,been in this league for years super competitive espn keeper keep up to players players kept equals rounds my players potential keepers rodgers lacy latavius murray tevin coleman tyrell williams jamaal charles trade offer i give rodgers and j charles i get jordan howard and m ingram my thoughts rodgers i like have an elite qb i had one year where i had to play matchups with qbs and it wasnt fun i like the security of the setnforget at qb j charles i honestly thought his career was done key note my trading partner is a huge chiefs fan depending on where he ends up his value could increase j howard i know he finished really strong as a rookie but i didnt follow him too much top rb in espn scoring longterm for my dynasty keeper league ingram getting old but the saints did just trade hightower right so no competition but tons of mouths to feed in no with brees throwing to everyone those are my thoughtswhat are yours should i take this trade i could counteroffer and ask for demarco murray instead of ingram
fantasyfootball,not_removed,your keepers are bad in a league coleman charles and williams are all very subpar options charles has so so little value and could very honestly be done rodgers is great and lacy is fine you absolutely take that trade howard becomes a building block ideally for a few years and ingram is a solid if you can get murray hes an upgrade at least in the short term but i cant see why the other guy would get fleeced like that in a very competitive league just because he likes kc
fantasyfootball,not_removed,are passing tds pts or pts leaning towards accepting that trade but if its pts id second guess but id probably take it anyway youll be able to snag someone like kirk cousins matt stafford or jameis winston if they arent kept that is late in the draft i would counteroffer id rather murrays next years of success over ingrams years of headaches good luck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes reckless known for making subpar trades
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sounds super competitive indeed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,landry ended the game by dropping an easy catch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cool shitpost bro
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes doing the best he can man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,leave ryan alone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was expecting a second half comeback because thats what hes been doing as of late but the cincy pass rush and lack of any runningback worth a damn crushed ryan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did you see that fantastic offensive line
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ditto tannhill starter thank god for brady coming back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that really stung the wallet on the over rec prop
fantasyfootball,not_removed,which is weird because hes a fierce competitor but when i saw them basically give up before the minute warning yeah the whole team was deflated
fantasyfootball,not_removed,forreal tho i hate when people say shit like op did we couldnt even play this god damn game if it werent for these guys in the league besides most people assumed miamis offense was gonna be a damnnear shitshow this year anyways
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well discuss
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our code guy wont be able to change the code to weekly posting so were stuck with daily for now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,love his column although it just made it more difficult for me this week ive had davante adams slotted in my flex to start but now thinking about playing rawls over him given the matchup dont know what to do
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this doesnt help my watkins or steve smith sr choice lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is making me doubt starting tymo is my wr slot over watkins and still cant decide between blount rawls or quizz
fantasyfootball,not_removed,watch any game or play featuring rawls this season and you will have your answer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,go smith its his final game and i think hes chasing a couple milestones if im not mistaken
fantasyfootball,not_removed,okay flip question watkins or tate
fantasyfootball,not_removed,listen to podcasts outside of this subreddit its where i get most of my info also theres a website that tells you how teams do against vs i cant remember what it is but someone will post it eventually
fantasyfootball,not_removed,use a vpn
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not sure that would work since all my cards and accounts are registered in washington
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we had a guy in canada he paypald me the funds and i logged into his yahoo account for him and paid for him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im pretty sure i paid my yahoo dues with paypal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so how would a payout be handled also trusting a stranger not you youre great with my account and my money seems less than ideal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,canadians dont win fantasy football
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keeper league and can give first round pick for additional bench spot ppr i have the and am working on getting other first as well but not sure to keep and who to offer after the obvious ones to keep roster brees wr evans hilton nuk jeffery adams rb zeke gurley hyde keep all three te graham reed i am gonna keep brees evans hilton nuk i think zeke gurley hyde reed and try to move the other ones after i figure out if i want to keep adams or jeffery any and all help is appreciated
fantasyfootball,not_removed,standard league pt passing tds keep of these mike evans odell beckham aaron rodgers jay ajayi has to be evans beckham and ajayi right or is anyone tempted by rodgers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can only keep two in a ppr odell beckham jr jordy nelson davonte freeman ive narrowed it down to those three but im stuck between jordy and freeman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,standard scoring team each one of these would be my first three picks if i kept them we keep rbs melvin gordon jordan howard wrs antonio brown obj julio jones i wouldnt get to pick any players until the round im thinking ab obj and howard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team standard scoring can only keep one zeke or julio jones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team standard scoring which one would you keep as a rookie keeper corey coleman cj prosise or eli rogers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team standard scoring i can have keepers for their draft position matt ryan mark ingram spencer ware antonio brown davante adams lesean mccoy dion lewis if i keep two round spots that means i give up a round and a round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,standard team league david johnson or julio jones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shady with a or melvin gordon with a
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pick team ppr at their respective draft position julio gurly ware
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can keep up to of the following in exchange for my top draft picks team ppr julio jones mike evans spencer ware matt ryan lamar miller travis kelce
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would keep jeffery over adams i think you will get more in trade for adams recency bias but i also think jeffery is a superior talent we dont know where hell play next season so its a bit risky
fantasyfootball,not_removed,evans beckham ajayi no question about it not touching rodgers at that price with those other options
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the way i would look at it and you have it exactly right is advantage for the price im assuming not ppr or you would have mentioned it but evans is probably somewhere in the range next year beckham probably ajayi im sure will go for depending on the league rodgers just wont compete with the value you have there the way i would play it would be to keep the other three find out what else you need to complete that team then go for rodgers if you find yourself having a nice surplus of cash because of the values you kept those guys at you arent really getting rodgers at a deal for so the only reason to consider keeping him at that price is so that you arent letting your nemesis have him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id keep obj and freeman i think freeman and nelson is a toss up but keeping a rb and a receiver will give you more flexibility going into the draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,deciding today beckham and nelson track record and they wont have new oc next season there are questions surrounding freeman new oc colemans role
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree and take the two stud wr coleman is already taking away from freeman and with the change is coordinators that could hurt davonte
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im keeping those wr that is an elite group and those guys are going to all have a top adp next year theyre proven i have real concerns about gordon and howard and would not trust them over the wr options you have obviously that means they go back in the draft pool and you have to hammer rb early and often in the draft but hey your wrflex is locked up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,first of all holy shit that sounds like a stacked team anyways how many receivers can you start in your league if its a receiver league then id have a hard time not keeping brownobjjulio but if you only get two receiver spots and a flex or no flex then you might not want to keep all three also what draft pick do you have and if you dont keep the players do you get a high draft pick instead either way i think i would keep those three receivers as long as you can start all three every week and if not id keep brown obj and howard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keep all the wrs in my opinion my first thought was yours howard over julio just to have a borderline in my back pocket but ive been much better when i stick to my bpa approach and if i was being truthful whats better julio or jordan howard as my round pick definitely julio if anything you have elite wrs who you can probably swap for someone better than howard like a julio for mccoy or maybe even obj for bell or zeke take the most value deal with roster building afterwards another way to help this might be to pay more attention to the early schedules of your find someone playing crappy teams or with their platoonmate injured early on and hope for some high early returns until you can work out a trade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,three wr all day every day all first round top picks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,zeke should be a top guy in standard scoring going into next year if not the top pick julio more like top he still has his injury concerns cant really envision a reason why youd keep jones over zeke unless you just really wanted to go wr heavy and prefer the bunch of approach that some people like to do
fantasyfootball,not_removed,zeke top rb is bomb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,depends on the cle qb situation but id likely go prosise unsure of what youre getting from coleman and as good as rawls was at times before he got hurt prosise was better its too difficult to rely on the steelers wrs theyve been inconsistent for years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go coleman qb matters for sure but its not like sea is getting rid of rawls i see prosise being that super sexy offseason sleeper who doesnt come close to meeting the hype
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ab and matt ryan is my vote shady and matt ryan a close second
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well it really depends on your draft position if i was first id rather have my first round bc i can just take ab and keep another two on that list or get the best available if i was id prob go with ab personally id go ryan and adams round is super value i wouldnt want mccoy in the they might change their offense with rex tyrod gone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,david johnson for sure fairly unanimous overall pick next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gordon similar talent exceptional value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats draft round julio and gurley very strong values for both players i know the shine is off gurley after his campaign but i am investing in his talent ware has a lot of questions will charles be back will the chiefs bring in another rb will west have a workload plus he is simply not the talent that gurley is in a limited keeper league value means far less to me you want the best players you can at the appropriate value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio and enans are locks for your keepers for the third one i would go miller wares situation is still up in the air charles might be coming back i dont believe that a qb is worth keeping for a round pick kelce is interesting i would have no problem with keeping him but i would stick with miller as my third
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we play rb wrte and a flex i draft next year if i dont keep these players yes i would get all of my first picks i did have a stacked team but i lost in the semi finals because my stupid ass qb cousins crap the bed against carolina anyway thanks for the advice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,word thanks for the nice writeup too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah it is really between those three honestly ive had two coworkers also tell me i need to keep matt ryan and not do the ab and shady route
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think its ludicrous when a team league only has playoff spots but i also think its unfair to change now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,commishleague issues thread please but yeah obviously this is bs no rule changes midseason
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why does it even matter if they knew or not not like you wouldnt be trying to win anyway do i think man playoffs fit a person league no not really but thats not the issue here change it next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,didnt realize there was one my bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my two cents i dont want the cutesy bullshit front and center it seems like your central sell point is fantasy football outside of that humor is subjective and interests are varied so if you get niche you limit your market injecting personality into fantasy analysis is a very fine line if i dont think youre funny or if i think youre a shit writer im going to discount the rest of what you say
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this sounds like it could be pretty cool id be interested in some insight into salary cap and draft strategy in the nfl plus some dope josh gordon memes and a survivor weekly roundup its americas true pastime
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey thanks for the input i appreciate it i agree with a good deal of what youre saying some of the worst writing is when the writer is trying too hard to be funny and it just falls flat im not approaching this with the intent of making jokes but i do use sarcasm hyperbole and sometimes humor to make a point long story short if im a shit writer then im probably not making it far as a writer i see your point about interests being varied but i think there is some space to offer more than startsit waiver wire adds etc etc like everyone else ever throwing in some unique content to the mix might draw more people in not less anyway thanks again for the comments
fantasyfootball,not_removed,haha i like the survivor roundupif the new season of game of thrones lined up with the nfl season id do got startsit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hell no its part of ff there are sites like that auto slot your highest scoring players every week if thats more your thing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nah its a risk just like it is to the teams plus that rush you get when youre facing a nasty loss and your opponents best player goes down is so delicious
fantasyfootball,not_removed,okay devils advocate here what happens when your star qbrbwr gets hurt on the first quarter of monday night football or even snf when your roster is locked as you have no mnf players or snf when it was the qb and both mnf qbs are owned wont be a fair system no matter how you do it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no if you want to play in a league like that go with best ball format like a
fantasyfootball,not_removed,part of the draw of fantasy football is you only have to set your lineup once a week a feature like this would present a significant disadvantage to people who do things during game day such as working going to church or in some cases just family dinner this kind of change would be a major disadvantage for casual players perhaps there could be an positional backup slot on the bench that also locks at game time if a player is confirmed to not return the game your designated backup will have his points count from that point on any points after the time left on the game clock when your starter was confirmed to not return will count this way even if your backup already played or plays later in the week it could keep it fair it would need to lock as soon as the starter got injured i think to prevent being able to further decisions about your starter after your starter already played
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why would it only be first quarter if you were going to do it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nope occasionally i have other things to do on thursday sunday and monday this would require players to sit in front of their computers way too much during the week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think you should get the points of the next guy up on the depth chart as long he is unowned mitigates the sting of an injury although it would get tricky if he comes back in after the half
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is actually a feature you can pay for on nflcom
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive tossed around the idea of being able to sub players at halftime
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if something like this is possible to do without ruining the integrity of the game it would require some crafty execution it would have to be something along the lines of setting a predefined snap count before a game for each position and electing a potential substitute the substitute becomes locked when he begins playing at that point if the starter fails to reach the snap count you chose then it would automatically replace the starter with the elected replacement regardless of i think that strikes a decent balance between maximizing the available replacements particularly for players in lateweek games while also not allowing owners to make decisions in the middle of games edit come to think of it this would actually necessitate the rosters lock on thursdays since if the replacement had already performed well then it would be to owners benefit to take out the original starter and substitute in a player who isnt likely to play very many snaps such that the replacement would take effect so that might not even be a particularly valid option
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think best ball leagues best captures this it is important to actually have a bench every week not just a bunch of lottery picks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i strongly agree that there should be a feature like this but for some reason people love to keep a gigantic luck factor in fantasy football my suggestion would be that a payer can only be subbed out if they are injured and dont play at all after the first quarter and the person theyre being supped out for hasnt played yet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes because when nfl teams lose a player to an injury theyre not allowed to put in a new guy they just have to play with players the rest of the game i always found that type of logic ridiculous
fantasyfootball,not_removed,like this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is smart
fantasyfootball,not_removed,because there would need to be some limit marcus mariota got injured at the end of the kc game but put up abysmal points beforehand a team shouldnt be allowed to take a mulligan because of an injury on the last play of the game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what if your opponent drafted and started the next guy up you both get the points with all of the rb time shares this would not work unless you changed your format to team qb team rb team wr that is available on espn and mfl probably others if thats your thing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you did something like this i actually think it has to be a player who is already playing you shouldnt get to sub in a guy for a whole other game instead you can sub in a guy whos game is also currently in session but you dont get the points hes accumulated so far only the points he gets from the time you subbed him in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,luck makes everything more fun
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the logic thats actually ridiculous is well this is how the nfl does it fantasy football is not a replica of the nfl its a statistics and strategy game not an athletic endeavor if you arent comfortable with the riskluck tied to injuries when setting a lineup you can play with team qb play in best ball leagues or play on nflcom where you can purchase roster replacement services the beauty of the game is that there are options to fit every need and preference
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont get so angry bud just my opinion youre right they get to field backups
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont like the rules then get fucked and join a tea cosy knitting club
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not getting the points he has so far might work but thatd be hard to manage also you could wait until suddenly an offense with the goal line back you own is at the yard line and sub him in and get the td instead of risking a wr who may or may not get yards itd be best to get a player from a later game who hasnt played yet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if youre bad at something you want more luck if youre good at something you want less luck thus i assume people in ff who love luck suck at fantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nflcom where you can purchase roster replacement services my commish had this unknowingly active in our league my opponent in round playoff used it flipped my win to a loss luckily i complained to commish who was not cool with that hes a purist and likes locked lineups got it overturned and into ship where i lost to the dj team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,til football is not a game of statistics and strategy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,iwhere do you see the anger in my post
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i see the problem dont really like the logistics of subbing at all but maybe his way keeps things as level as it can be
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thus i assume people in ff who love luck suck at fantasy id agree with ya buddy but then wed both be wrong what you just did there is something we like to call confirmation bias you want to play on a fair playing field where the better team should win but that isnt what the majority of people prefer luck makes things more unpredictable and exciting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck that you guys screwed up having it on you deserved the loss
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whoa calm down im sorry if i misread you hope youre having a great day
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how is that confirmation bias its simple logic if im good at something introducing luck makes my being good less impactful lets say the nfl instead of deciding games in overtime just decided to flip a coin to decide who the winner of the game was dont you think good teams like the pats would be pissed that of the unpredictable and exciting luck introduced and unpredictable and exciting are not synonymous
fantasyfootball,not_removed,commish has the right to make whatever rules he wants if he doesnt agree then its his call i find roster swap to be pretty fishy in a cash league with a pot just my opinion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck you and your mother i hope you both rot in hell jk luv u
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is this anything more than standard deviation or variance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,would you mind giving a brief explanation of what this graph means im no math expert so im curious as to what this entails
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sweet clyde use variation of parameters and expand the wronskian
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it is standard deviation over average yards per game it helps to get a better idea of the variability relative to the mean ie spread
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sure i am including a quote with the source because i believe it gives a good explanation essentially the x axis has the players names on them and the y axis has the calculated coefficient of variation cv based on data from httpwwwfootballperspectivecomtoddgurleyjayajayiandrunningbackvariation the cv tells you the variability of average yards per game for each player usually a higher cv means a player is inconsistent given average yards per game and a low cv would mean they are consistent this doesnt mean that leveon bell for example is a player that is bad even though his cv is higher leveon bell gets a lot of looks at the goal line and has a much higher floor than most running backs thus interpretation is important the coefficient of variation is a measure of spread that describes the amount of variability relative to the mean because the coefficient of variation is unitless you can use it instead of the standard deviation to compare the spread of data sets that have different units or different means for example you are the quality control inspector at a milk bottling plant that bottles small and large containers of milk you take a sample of each product and observe that the mean volume of the small containers is cup with a standard deviation of cups and the mean volume of the large containers is gallon cups with a standard deviation of cups although the standard deviation of the gallon container is five times greater that the standard deviation of the small container their coefficients of variation cvs support a different conclusion large container cv cups cups small container cv cups cup

fantasyfootball,not_removed,std i have charles ware and gurley if it comes out the charles will be on a snap count and splitting carries with ware should injust start dwayne washington hes got a great matchup and some experts thing hes a must start if you need a rb would any of you do that im playing the other team this week lets call it a must win carson palmer kelvin benjamin demaryus thomas jeremy marlin todd gurley charles ware jason witten k dustin hopkins dst houston bn tyler eifrit dwayne washington kevin white jameson crowder derrick henry

fantasyfootball,not_removed,agree that you should play hyde over murray murray has looked bad apart from td a week saving his point total and the way coleman has started the season tough to put him on the bench id say hes a decent flex even against carolina
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mckinnon yeldon and ivory cancel each other out and apparently the ajax oline couldnt block a lego
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mckinnon he will get the majority of the touches and coleman has a tough matchup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gurley gotta start your studs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like crow here good matchup much higher floor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crowell in standard riddick in ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ware mckinnon us jc owners are just biding our time till charles comes back to save the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bell and johnson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dj and bell ring that fucking bell this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bell and dj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crowell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol pick out of a hat im kinda leaning towards blount but kinda hard to justify sitting any of them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lamar zeke and flip a coin between blount and murray i lean slightly slightly toward murray
fantasyfootball,not_removed,forte ingram
fantasyfootball,not_removed,are you feeling luckybold if so throw washington in there with crowell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,go with both murrays on this one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sims definitely
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sims
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like matt jones here washington has been clicking offensively and if the get a lead they will run the ball
fantasyfootball,not_removed,howard literally competition for touches
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dwash is gonna get most of the carries chi cant stop the run at all now what he does with them is another story but i lean towards a good day for him chis offense is a mess too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think you have to go with blount and gordon howard is sort of an unknown and the lions could easily get out to an early lead and make him irrelevant
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go with blount and gordon i wouldnt play howard over either of them until he shows his value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sims and forte tough matchups but both should trail and see some passes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,miller and forte dunno what the other guy means by good run d but tenn is ranked in run d miller is the easy pick sims isnt gonna see enough touches because tb will be behind and jameis is gonna sling it forte isnt a great matchup but after the shitburger fitzy left on the field last week i see short passes and screens in his future and those go to forte
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jones and washington for matchups carolinas d does look a lot more run vulnerable though so far this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crow and sims denver is a hard matchup but winston should be checking down a lot to sims cmike is in tough against a great jets run d he would be very td dependent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,darkwa will not easily outside mccoy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,vikings d is probably better than the pats i say go studs unless charles is still out then ware and gurley
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ivory and duke jr wait one more week to see how carries are split with the giants i have a feeling bobby rainey will be a big waiver target after the weekend
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i havent seen any ravens games yet this year but cap is definitely in a headed monster rbbc with fozzy in for the passing downs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i still think cap over the atrocity that is the raven backfield
fantasyfootball,not_removed,blount you must profit from his last heavy work week tevin has carolina
fantasyfootball,not_removed,freeman gore howard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hmmm im thinking chrisine michael tbh gonna get the rock a lot with a hurt russ
fantasyfootball,not_removed,blount pats will continue to use the run game to protect their rookie quarterback big game for blount pats fan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gurley and michael flex howard as the new shiny play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,has to be gurley and michael howard is the flex
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crowell more likely to find the endzone in a standard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,elliot and hyde they will be the workhorses who knows what the patriots do this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,last two
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cj lamar and ware first two are just good second is a good bet for catches and charles wont get more than a small handful of carries if that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im a match up kinda guy i like crow and sims this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ooooooh tough they say start your studs but im going to tell you to go crowell ive watched all three skins games so far and their run d is bad not sure if crowell has ppr value but he will at least score one td
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tevin by a hair jones is overrated but he is playing cle if it was standard id say jones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cadet saw targets last week and made catches for yards should be a shootout so i like cadet especially if the chargers can take a healthy lead like the flacons did the snap count last week was encouraging asiata is a td dependent thompson could be ppr relevant depending on game flow i dont see cleveland going up on the skins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cmike or crowell cmike for floor crowell for upside this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like crow and sims denver may scare you but they are against the run and tb wants to throw less and run more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gore and dwayne
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dunno how many youre starting so ill just say dwayne payne yeldon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wrong thread this is rb but id go with mccoy hes their main threat there and while ne offense has been pretty solid i think you have a higher floor with mccoy over sanders sanders is a high ceilinglow floor type just my
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hyde the other two are gonna rob each other last week was unusual not likely at all to see both go off at the same time again so its too much of a coin flip as to who gets it going
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ivory i think dwash is gonna get a lot of carries this week and the jags dont like yeldon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,haha six team playoffs in a ten team league i just gotta survive this and sneak in im lost by points last week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i wish i could trade one but my league is really bad at trading i will probably go blount over demarco
fantasyfootball,not_removed,okay thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,more than miller though with their passing game being floppy miller has gotten some good points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in the same boat between michael and hyde i feel like hyde just has the better matchup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,okay thanks would you flex howard over tyrell williams
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea but the pats still have there string qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sorry man standard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks i have cmike and crowell in now im playing my rival this week cant screw this one up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,got it thanks for the reply sounds like crow it is good point on sims i just read an article to bench cmike this week who i was wanting to go with in my flex i think itll come down to game time cmike plays at
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks for the reassurance ivory is also a solid guy when healthy i think hell definitely be the answer jags need at the rb spot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre welcome if howard produces decently this week then you might want to consider playing him over blount next week when brady returns
fantasyfootball,not_removed,titans run d has been pretty good miller should still do well not sure what your wr depth is but id be happy starting miller and forte and flexing sims
fantasyfootball,not_removed,true but their gameplan is very unpredictable ive been burnt by their backs too often
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for me its coleman crowell washington coleman has a tough matchup but will see the ball in the redzone and is the biggest touchdown threat for a standard league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no worries gl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah im definitely going to try and sell high on him howards performance this week will probably help me determine what position i try to improve since i have no rb depth after these three
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you really wouldnt start ingram
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in a man league with my best friends from high school we have one peraon take cups and fill one with vodka and the rest with water we then have a different person mix them up so nobody knows where the vodka cup is in the mixture of cups whomever gets the vodka decides where they pick after that the winner of the previous round fills the cups and mixes them up we do this until all spots are filled and everyone has a shot in them its just a fun way to kick off the night and leaves it to random chance for draft otder we figured it was more fun than picking numbers out of a hat
fantasyfootball,not_removed,user name checks out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theres a at the top of this sub on this very subject with like comments probably worth checking that out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my friends and i huddle in a circle and the first to ejaculate on a cookie gets first pick and so on and so forth last person has to eat the cookie i got antonio brown last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,last year we did something similar except shooting it beer pong style with numbers on the bottom the numbers indicated your choice of pick so if you got you got to choose your position first
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you should do x vodka and x water water chooses their pick will make it a bit more challenging to pick after or
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aww im sorry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well shit thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the ole mushy cookie jerk takes me back man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nice brown and a cookie what a day
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive suggested this before but was promptly shot down due to having to make decisions involving money haha but i agree that would make for a fun draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ounces grams sounds like a lot of weed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,glad he becomes a free agent next month he was mediocre at best
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not to mention a load of oxy whoopsy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a qp is a lot of weed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not really honestly if you rich like these nfl guys and you got a lot of friends you smoke out a qp at a time isnt bad you get a much better deal in weight you get a qp of fucking dank you now smoke blunts all the time and fatties too i can go through about an oz a month and dont smoke that much as one could easily especially one with money to burn plus if he made edibles it makes even more sense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no its really not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a former player smoking blunts all the time will fuck your lungs up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well according to any state law it is thats whats important
fantasyfootball,not_removed,actually false state laws vary especially considering you can grow plants in some areas each plant can yield roughly a qp alone if any person state official or police officer thinks grams of weed is a lot theyre mistaken hahaha thats petty weight those are the dealers that sell grams and quarters pounds is where its a lot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can all the people who post player topics during the game please shut up now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tony you shouldnt be on reddit while your team is playing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not a cowboys fan but by reading this post i can tell you that youre not a dallas cowboys fan no matter how you want to dice it up in your own head
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lets wager if dak leads a comeback you get banned
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i guess ill drop drew brees since romo should be on my radar thanks for the tip
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bullshit youre not a cowboys fan i dont know any cowboys fan who wants romo back even if romo is better you stick with dak due to team chemistry you must be a dez owner in disguise
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe his bar has been set high because he started off so well however hes playing a damn good defense and i havent seen anything close to a reason to yank him its called growing pains all young players go through it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes mah quartahback
fantasyfootball,not_removed,watching the game there were times i thought i was looking at colin kapernick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely a cowboys fan since i could walk proof still have my charles haley jersey that reminds me of the good ol days also have a marion barber jersey no random person just owns a marion barber jersey fast forward to my current state of mind wearing a romo jersey where im still clinging onto that last glimmer of hope as a cowboys fan you have to put up with so much romo bashing deep down every fan wants to see romo with a ring on that middle finger waving it to all the naysayers and saying fuck disneyworld being a cowboys fan is like a depressing schizophrenic train ride through miles of tunnels that only peeks at the sunlight for very brief moments between other tunnels so while i want dak to be a successful part of our future hes just not romo romo can move the ball throw it downfield and control the pace of a game sure the guy has had his dark moments but beyond the shadows there is still a super bowl hungry mvp caliber qb dak has bright shining moments but he isnt the guy yet to carry this team to a super bowl the supporting cast is there for a fresh romo to make a serious run at this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hello everyone i have a league that has been together for years but has grown from barely people to now we are not a super competitive group with a good amount of casual fansthe feedback i got was they didnt like how many people were in it as it limited their options of who was available should i split the league into and have them meet in the finals also we are moving to be a keeper league how many keepers should their be year to year what has worked for you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats something that the league members should ultimately vote on and decide i can see how a casual league with teams would frustrate people who dont want to do research on those midtolower tier depth players splitting it into leagues that meet in the finals might be pretty complicated though and youd run into issues with parity if one side became more competitive than the other i would suggest shrinking starting roster spots andor bench size instead as a simpler quick fix i would also want to institute whatever change you decide before switching to a keeper league itll become a lot more difficult to fix your league size issue after youve changed to a keeper league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so maybe have wr rb bench
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a team qb flex bench has owned position players and in my experience can get lopsided with a dry waiver wire and an with owned players my only other experience the teams are stacked and there is always talent on the wire the complete opposite end of the spectrum youre proposal would be close to the middle only issue for me personally is id miss the flex
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe one flex instead of a second rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nevermind that would bring it to players owned could bench players work and flex
fantasyfootball,not_removed,both viable options the shorter bench would make bye weeks really tough especially if you also have a def k but would also result in more talent finding its way to the waiver wire again its something youre league should ultimately vote on to decide
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we could also eliminate the kicker and keep a fourth spot and yes we will vote just want to make sure i bring the best options
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i also like the idea of the flex instead of the second rb we use two flex in my team keeper league and it makes it quite interesting means some teams play rbs and wrs while others play rb and wrs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wasnt counting kickers toward the ownedavailable player pool youd assume they have little effect on the skill position player pool except in rare cases where someone doesnt want to drop an elite kicker over their bye week which will lead to extra player being available pretty moot just depends on if you like having kickers in your league or not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had terrible draft last year blew up my team except for arob as round keeper obvi keeping and demaryus thomas as round keeper should i keep thomas or throw him back into the pool im a bronco fan btw and still cant figure out if i hate him or love him after his crucial dropsplayoff disappearing act i do think qb play cant be any worse than last year edit team ppr pretty competitive league with other bronco fans keepers allowed only if player was drafted and not on waivers at any point in season i have pick so in round im now thinking only keep arob
fantasyfootball,not_removed,devonta freeman for a matt jones for a thomas rawls for a jordy nelson for a which ones represent good value at this time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,need to pick keepers that will take up my first picks of the draft options are adrian peterson doug martin aj green allen robinson honourable mention jeremy langford im leaning towards ap martin and robinson i think i want to keep robinson and ap for sure so its pretty much between martin and green for the third pick any insight is appreciated
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team only keeper for the round drafted in the previous year for ww pick current candidates are lamar miller round brandon marshall round tom brady round thomas rawls round i was thinking rawls at the end of the season but i dont like the running back situation in seattle right now with so many backs i really like miller this year but a is a big price to pay and would only be around round of value any suggestions
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team standard we keep and im not sure if its based on rounds drafted or anything treat it as a minidynasty i think anyway i have tyler ervin but blount and alf morris are on waivers who do you think has the most upside whether immediate or longterm
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team keeper league w standard scoringbut im stuck on deciding between two of these three players tyler lockett stefon diggs kevin white imo there are really good arguments for all three of them but one of them will have to go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team keep julio jones lose round pick thomas rawls lose round pick kelvin benjamin lose round pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr choose moncrief in the devante parker in the tom brady in the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr keeper rules suck we keep player and its basically the first round pick qb luck wr jordy r cobb k allen k benjamin d baldwin j matthews j gordon rb rawls l murray d lewis c hyde m gordon c ivory j forsett te eifert im leaning towards jordy luck rawls murray or maybe lewis or allen but im not sure which direction i should start leaning
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr keep luck d freeman bortles carr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would not keep him for a round pick if you really want him then you could spend a round pick on him and still have your rounder
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do not keep dt for a i would need to know of team and league settings to tell you his adp but its typically early so you can do better with your i for one do not think he looked like himself last year and that it was more than just qb woes i hope he bounces back but i have him lower on my board than most so i doubt he ends up on any of my teams this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how many keepers do you get and how many people if your league allows you to keep or its a large league dt might be good value in the keep in mind that keepers mean a number of players will be off the board which will move dt up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do you know your draft order yet as well as other teams keepers that could play a role into the decision also is this a team league and what is scoring format based off what you have i cant give a great answer if it was me i would consider it i think his down year last year is over played he still had receptions for yards and tds i would be happy to have that and like you stated the qb play cant get much worse than last year dont forget that dt had tebow as a qb too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely not let one of the other bronco fans overpay for him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the stars aligned for freeman last year a round pick is overvalued if jones has stopped looking like an elite rb with a child at the controls this could work out too much if compared to the next choices rawls is a steal here sea was one of the most run heavy last year im not saying that will continue in fact i expect more balance as does everyone the question is what kind of spin you want to run in your headline to generate clicks fuck all that noise just snag a good chance at a bell cow in the peanuts the emergence of cobb and age of nelson have many worried for a round pick im not worried at all unless hes totally fallen apart physically you will get your value back hes earned targets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jordy a coming back from injury is a great value for a round pick he currently is being drafted in the i wouldnt sweat a rounder for him could be another td season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what kind of league is it to me none of these picks are total slam dunks but if its ppr id probably keep jordy in the especially if you have an early overall pick and are picking at the end of the round if nonppr jordy is still in contention but id probably go with rawls health would be the other tiebreaker for me since both those guys are coming off major injuries
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for me jordy and rawls no question freeman finished horribly and might be in a time share this year rawls is more proven than jones and is a round later jordy has aaron rodgers and was even healthy enough to play in the team softball game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe no yes yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what format freeman for example is a lot more appealing in ppr that said im not keeping him for a second which is his adp in standard while he will still be good i believe he is overvalued and will not maintain his production from last year a late is matt jones adp in a standard league currently so the price is fair not what id call value though and a bit too rich for my blood still rawls is great value at a adp is late but just know hes coming back from an injury so monitor his recovery before locking in that said i would keep him for that if deciding today nelson is also good value adp earlymid but again monitor how he is recovering from injury all signs currently are very positive so i would definitely keep him for a if deciding today
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rawls and nelsons values are the best for sure
fantasyfootball,not_removed,devonta freeman in the is around his value probably early matt jones might end up worth a round pick by the end of the preseason games but he isnt there right now thomas rawls in the is good value as long as he holds onto that job throughout the summer nelson in the is great value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would keep ap aj green and arob look at adp of green and adp of martin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely go aj green over doug martin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah it comes down to martin vs green id lean green myself since he lost a lot of competition for targets this off season but can also get behind martin since good rb are harder and harder to come by there is not really a wrong choice but id vote for green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not sure on your league size or scoring system but if me im keeping adrian peterson aj green and arobbut i think you could make a case to keep martin over arob dependent on the situationgood luck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id absolutely take aj green instead of martin and if people in your league are putting a premium on running backs see if you can trade martin for a pick if possible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green over martin because of consistency martin might end up being more valuable but aj has had yards every year of his career and double digit tds three of the past four was injured in still had yds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you should definitely keep wilson but not necessarily because of the qb scoring but because there are teams a qb is much more useful in that situation id definitely keep arob and nelson because theyre fantastic for the last pick your rbs arent really worth it so id personally go with cooper but edelman and benjamin are also worth considering so wilson robinson nelson and cooper
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for this many keepers a lot would depend on what will be available in that first round and what i want my team to look like youre picking from arob nelson cooper edelman benjamin and floyd i would consider what i want on my team and which one should still be available when i make my first pick the qb scoring is favorable but to all qbs so i dont think that makes wilson a lock but in a teamer you should probably keep him arob nelson and wilson are a lock cooper is the least risky of the remaining three and i think edelman and benjamin have more upside for this year having too many great keepers is a great problem to have
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would consider rawls and marshall both bring great value but a lot comes down to how you would feel if geno is the qb and how well rawls recovery is coming along if rawls is healthy based on every metric ive seen on him id pick rawls if you dont feel comfortable with that go with marshall miller can be picked up in the round and brady between the and depending on your league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,depends on when you have to decide if the jets end up bringing fitz back then its marshall but if they dont get fitz and theyre rolling with geno or hackenberg all season i wont feel as good about it rawls vs miller is about what you see as more important player value or draft value miller is about as sure of a thing as they come this year given the amount of uncertainty at rb leaguewide a isnt a huge discount for him but you know youve got a in the third round and can use the first two rounds to grab the best players available without feeling like you need to reach at rb rawls in the could be amazing value for a low or collins and prosise do well enough in training camp and make it a frustrating timeshare and rawls is relegated to flexvalue it all depends on what you think is going to happen in seattle but personally id much rather take the relatively sure starter of miller in the round then a potential flexgood depth player of rawls
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think i would take rawls even with all the new rbs in seattle even getting a flex starter for the round seems like a good value to me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rawls gives you a shot at a bell cow for very cheap decker seems to get it done by being the smartest guy on the field im not down on landry but compared to the other two he is quite pricey
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you can keep them again next year i think you have to keep rawls just on the off chance that youre getting a top ten rb for dirt cheap for the near future i havent played a ppr so i cant comment on the landrydecker split as well but id lean decker just because of the value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,alf morris is probably relegated to unexciting handcuff to zeke elliott at this point tyler ervin is a somewhat exciting handcuff to lamar miller blount is the potential back for ne but lets be real its still the cluster that is the ne backfield if you have lamar miller id probably go with ervin otherwise i think you have to take blount but i wouldnt be too excited about it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go rawls because the value for a is huge for a potential
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you only get i think you have to go with jordy i like a few others but hes the best
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rawls
fantasyfootball,not_removed,luck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill follow your advice i think i can win it all having all my picks until the round and drafting only rb and wr til then thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks what site do you use for that info the reason i went for martin was because people in this league tend to put a premium on rbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks for the input its standard scoring person league for what its worth
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive had similar thoughts unfortunately i wont know draft order until before draft and i have to declare keeper week before ive thought about keeping julio because him and olsen basically won me the ship last year rawls is definitely better potential value at round but i also lean toward lower risk in my drafts id pick gronk over david johnson or ezekiel elliot for example
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah having arob in the is a steal i thought i had it good keeping him for a
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have a problem and have done about snake drafts and auctions on espn and yahoo green normally goes at the top of the second round i dont really have a website for their adp but i know yahoo tracks the adp of the players keep in mind that the rankings on each site affect the adp of the drafts on that site considerably
fantasyfootball,not_removed,httpsfantasyfootballcalculatorcomadpphp and then maybe some trusted professionals rankings for example i like silvas and dave richards personally
fantasyfootball,not_removed,then i think it might be worth keeping martin depending on if your league keeps more rbs that gives you both starting rbs and a stud
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yup i think jordy is a significant enough upgrade over those two this year that it merits the selection plus you only get keepers every year youre bound to wind up with guys like arob david johnson freeman whomever that blow up and you want to keep going forward the only guys you should expect to keep each year are the elite ones and while benjamin and martin are solid players they arent elite
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gotcha appreciate your feedback
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nflcom league standard rules maximum two keepers only ones im considering right now are howard beckham brees and m thomas not sure what other information i need
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team espn league we get one keeper that we have to take a round earlier than drafted the year before if they were a free agent you take them in the round i think im going to take ajayi with my round pick but i also have demarco murray i could take with my round pick which one is the better value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have bortles and im keeping him not a question just a declaration that i fucking love bortles fuck you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id keep beckham and howard although im not personally high on howard so if only keeping beckham means you get an extra pick at the beginning before the draft starts then personally id go that route
fantasyfootball,not_removed,howard and beckham both are first round values this year thomas has a capped ceiling because of the nature of the saints offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go mthomas and maybe beckham howard is tempting but the bears are awful
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think we would have to see your draft results from last year to really give any advice ajayi is a great pick for the round id shy away from murray almost with competition in the titans backfield plus dm never broke rushing yards and only had tds after week one was a rec td week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,both are good values compared to adp talent is similar so the extreme benefit from ajayi at such a low cost wins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bold move cotton
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jags could actually turn it around this season if bortles can figure his shit out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats what i was leaning towards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,exactly this plus those are two good wrs then you can load up on rbs in the draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree ajayi in the is much better value than murray in the fourth at the end of the year i could imagine either player being ahead in fantasy points but a ten round difference is huge
fantasyfootball,not_removed,interesting how this differs from the communityvoted rankings at drafty for reference httpdraftysportscomfootballrankingsdynasty v edit i guess the drafty rankings are from endofseason so most of the voting has been biased against nuk and maybe swayed some other players too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,position rankings are way more helpful overall rankings are better for redraft leagues also dynastly lists should always have the ages listed with the names no matter the sport
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is drafty ppr or standard scoring rankings that might account for the difference
fantasyfootball,not_removed,getting brock the hell out of houston has really helped nuk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,landry isnt sexy but he continues to produce in ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theres separate httpdraftysportscomfootballrankingsppr and httpdraftysportscomfootballrankingsstandard and httpdraftysportscomfootballrankingsdynasty so pick your poison edit i guess dynasty is standard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,steelers if big ben retires
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably his ass or maybe even his head because his shoulders collar bones back and ribs cant take any more hard landings
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the nearest hospital
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have to think the texans must consider romo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im a broncos fan and id be completely surprised if they go after him elway has already said he doesnt have interest though that could be gmspeak they did it with peyton a few years ago true but peyton is much better than romo and siemian is much better than tebow was id much rather roll with siemian and try to progress him than waste a lot of cap space on romo with no guarantee that hell be healthy i bet he goes to the cards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kc denverbrowns all places where he could be a stopgap
fantasyfootball,not_removed,at years old i cant see many teams lining up to have tony romo lead their offenses thats the traditional decline in production age for qbs sure there are the outlier qbs that play elite football into their but those guys dont have the injury history romo does maybe a team like houston or denver that believe they still have a small window to get back to the super bowl in would take a chance on him but a team like chicago that is rebuilding and looking for their qb of the future seems like a poor match aside from all that why would the cowboys want to send romo packing theyre a legitimate super bowl contender right now dak prescott is the starter but he makes next to nothing dallas can afford to pay romo as an millionyear back up for another years we all know the importance of having a competent backup qb why would dallas just give up that luxury when they dont have to
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ehh i dont even know if the article is correct about the bears having terrible wrs i figured they might be terrible because of injuries but talent wise they performed well in fantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was thinking the could be a potential landing spot with kaep possibly on the out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im a jets fan and i cant help but feel like theyre going to nab him they want a veteran who can win games and romo is definitely that if you overlook the injury risk which i think the jets are desperate enough to do hes the best option out there i just really dont want to put my season on his back literally also i know we suck but we dont have the worst rbs and receivers out of those teams forte and powell are a great combo marshall and decker are great and enunwa really started to prove himself we also have asj who can be utilized in an amazing way the numbers from this disastrous season dont show it but the pieces are there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,romo is one injury away from living his life with severe problems imo he should hang up the cleats and call it a day how many surgeries has he had on his back how many on his ankle his collar bone one bad hit and the poor fuck can be stuck to walking as his major physical activity hes only on his thirties imagine a life of debilitating pain just because he wanted a shot at the superbowl i know they make tonnes of money and risk their bodies to make that money and thats the trade off but possibly not being able to walk without a limp or god forbid a wheel chair just because he thought he was still a tough guy hed be smarter to grab a minor coaching or coordinator job amd live the rest of his life the best he can also romo hasnt been elite in years and a year away from the game just compounds this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,denver obv
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if he cant stay healthy behind the best o line i wouldnt have much faith in him elsewhere he could provide anywhere from week to years worth of above average qb but its a coin flip if he survives a game wouldnt be thrilled if my team was looking at him but there is the chance that he remains healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,best landing spots would be denver or houston most likely are browns jets and bills i personally think he should retire but i think he wants one more shot had he gotten a shot to play this year he might retire but now he wants to prove something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cleveland
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pointless to include teams like the jets bears or any other team that the only realistic options like the article states are teams that are a qb away from a super bowl tony wont go to these teams he wants a superbowl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,broncos for sure few year deal till lynch gets better acclimated to the offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,something in my guttywhats says chicago
fantasyfootball,not_removed,denver romo seems like an elway kinda guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he wont this is just an unconventional way for ben to look tough and bump up the hero worship he gets from pittsburgh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,given how much ben gets hurt romo will be dead after games if he plays for them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ben will be back the minute he hears theyre going to replace him with romo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if ben retires this year he owes pittsburgh like million from the guaranteed money he got he wont retire
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why the article totes houston and denver as top places due to poor offensive play year for tsim to show his stuff probably isnt enough for denver to say fuck outta here and houston has like practically no cap space unless romo agrees to come for the bbq and dj screw fanbase i dont see either teams being a reality for him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why would they go sign the backup from the obviously lesser texas team when they just landed such a stud qb last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i think they should eat whatever cap penalty there is and just get him on the roster they can make a deep run with competent qb play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you guys have a lot of faith in siemian out there i didnt see a lot of him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i didnt even think about the cardinals whats palmers contract look like
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kc will stick with alex smith
fantasyfootball,not_removed,browns wont happen it needs to be a team thats ready for a super bowl appearance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you think an million dollar backup qb is a viable choice then you know little of the ways of the nfl thats ludicrous
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they definitely arent terrible but besides alshon i wouldnt consider them any more than average
fantasyfootball,not_removed,romos a tough guy so i dont think he should just retire for his sake but if im a gm i dont see how im spending million on a guy who might give me just three weeks of production and be out for the rest of the year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,technically every nfl player is only one injury away
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chicago fan here i dont see it happening were in full rebuild here i think theyd stick with cutler one more year before going to romo im expecting them to let cutler go though even if they wanted romo i dont see him coming to a team that isnt close to playoffs contention
fantasyfootball,not_removed,someone pointed that out to me and now i cant help but notice that he does that lol whether its on purpose or not is hard to say though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree but all of this is a big if for now if he retired i would imagine pitt is the best landing spot for any quarterback
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah if he was willing to take minimum salary then he would probably go to broncos over texans even though texans need him more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i do and from what i read elway has faith too this was essentially his rookie year in the league and he was by a lot of statistics an average qb in the league why is good for a rookie i compared his and derek carrs rookie year and siemians was better i think he can end up being a very good qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats a shame id like to see kelce macliin hill and conley with a qb like romo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if its entirely up to romo i agree but say no one thats a obvious contender doesnt come knocking then what
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree romo would retire before going to a non playoff ready team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is why i think houston is the best bet the rest of that team is ready to go they just need a qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when your starter is making less than a million a year and you finished the year as the seed in your conference and jerry jones is your owner it is very viable
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre right but a better qb than cutler barkley will elevate them all
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think theres ever been a time where ben was hurt and we didnt hear about it through the national media or ben himself lol i dont think hell retire but the steelers absolutely need to invest in a better backup qb than landry jones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but isnt the guy behind siemian the future franchise qb he looked lost out there in his couple of starts and would benefit by having an experienced leader to learn from the next two years romo would fill that position perfectly i see the cowboys playing denver next year being a bigger hindrance to romo heading to the broncos than elway sticking with siemian
fantasyfootball,not_removed,then he just stays where hes at obviously he wants to play somewhere but i dont see him leaving just to go risk injury and not have an actual chance at a sb he doesnt need to go somewhere for money and he doesnt have anything to prove to anyone the only thing he doesnt have is a ring
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do you understand what a cap is having the richest owner doesnt help the highest chance of winning the sb is to hope your rookie contract qb stays healthy and put the extra savings into fas where you are weak example seahawks when they won or you know having a top qb who is worth the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its not so much keeping romo as it is not having that money to spend it on free agents and retaining your own talents having million dollars in your bench and not in the field is a handicap for any team it also severely negates the advantage of having a cheap and productive starting qb for the next three years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,barkleys the silver bullet the bears have been looking for s but in all seriousness he did a lot better than i expected dude had a few solid games this year do you think hoyer will stay i think he could be the starter for this team imho
fantasyfootball,not_removed,big ben is only he still has a few years left plus there is no way antonio brown will let him retire
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think lynch is finished but he looked like he has strong bust potential the tools are all there but his mental game is just missing hes not the presumptive future of the franchise hell need to earn it elway doesnt fuck around on this the best players play which is how siemian got the job in the first place and sanchez got cut siemian played very well for us amidst a disaster at almost every other offensive position i expect him to be the starter next year lets also not forget that romo will be expensive where siemian and lynch are both total discounts elway wants that cheap qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lynch vs siemian has already started and siemian clearly looked like the more mature qb between the two i said this a few months ago but i think long term siemian will be a more impactful nfl player at this point keep in mind we almost made the playoffs this year with siemian and hes hopefully only going to get better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,trust me i understand he intricacies of the salary cap and its various advantages to be utilized and exploited to your franchises benefit im just saying the cowboys plan was to spend million a year on qbs through getting rid of romo would suddenly save them million they could spend spend on their de or cb needs that would leave them with back up qbs like mark sanchez andor someone like ej manuel for milyear are those the backups jerry jones wants to make his super bowl run with those are normal nfl teams backups but are they jerry jones type backups were talking about a guy who literally had to be held back by his entire front office to prevent him from drafting johnny manziel in the first round with romo still under contract for another six seasons even after the team dodged the manziel bullet jones was pissed at his own son for weeks after the draft about it im not saying its the wise or traditional move im just saying keeping romo on the team is probably the single best insurance policy they can take out against their super bowl run and a very jerry jones type of thing to do
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dude i totally butchered my punctuation due to typing in my phone i meant to say they had cutlerbarkley last year room is an upgrade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he does have a family and he has a bigger injury history than most qbs he cant break any records but is an eventual hof nominee so he can retire whenever
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the team still takes a million cap hit even if hes traded so in reality trading him opens up million is the player that you get for million worth a tony romo insurance policy in case something happens to dak ita six this way half dozen the other kind of question
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i disagree that six of a qb equals half a dozen of any other position on the field
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the main point of that comment was a million dollar backup qb versus a million dollar field player is basically a coin flip
fantasyfootball,not_removed,by the time their creditors get their money there wont be much left good reminder to cash out any winnings over the course of the season these guys arent exactly fdic insured
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would imagine that fantasy aces employees are all quite concerned
fantasyfootball,not_removed,employee wages fall under a certain priority rule in us bankruptcy codes so they should get their due wages their outta luck afterwards tho
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont get tricked into paying for that crap
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is probably an unpopular opinion but i think fantasypros is the biggest waste of this was the first site i ever started using to get better at ff and after a year realized they are quite awful at everything so much better information on other sites id rather do rotoviz and
fantasyfootball,not_removed,last season was a one time fee for the phone app and it was great cant say im a fan of this although i understand their perspective in making more money
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fp used to be better a few years ago but last year they really jumped the shark dont pay for it you can get better comparisons and advice on this reddit and other places online like rotoworld it seems like fp is cashing in on their decent reputation but they squandered it really quickly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im seeing pro annually not as bad clear your cookies or view it incognito and see if prices change lots of free options out there that do the same thing you are paying for convenience of it being under one site
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i feel like it used to be a year years ago thats way overpriced it doesnt even give you much more info than the app itself does for free
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would have paid for their two year ago content last year they sucked
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fantasypros i did the mock draft and it went great so i purchased it now the problems the mock draft makes you think you can draft from within fantasypros draft assistant you cannot fantasypros is going to bill you per month if you dont forget to cancel this is not clear when signing up dont forget the company that runs this is from vegas so buyer beware with cbssports it allows you to click the view draft assistant and then closes your draft room and replaces it with theirs where they offer a sync button to sync them with your leagues draft the big issue when starting the draft the clock starts and you suddenly realize their draft room doesnt draft and in addition their software closed the draft room you need to actually do you drafting so your first two picks are autodrafted and you end up with two qbs see the problem the mock draft and the pricing both are deceptive and misleading
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you have to pay for any content to be good at fantasy football you are just lazy there is way too much free info out there to spend any money on it you just gotta find it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the only thing you need is the rotoworld ticker for fa pickups on the fly no one needs to pay for advice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its so fucking dog shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i found rotoviz site to be total trash i could never stay logged in and i found that getting back to content once it left the very top of their feed was difficult their content on the other hand was pretty useful
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks uhowyaguysdoin feel free to use the coupon code reddit for off any of our
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it depends how you use it i am in a keeper league being able to mock draft with keepers and draft picks set up is priceless to me i do tons of mock drafts to get ready after the draft it is worthless
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it looks like the new pricing includes all the tools now though it used to be separate right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my bad i meant the mvp version
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats the deal you gotta figure out when the aggregation and tools that make it more convenient is worth what theyre charging i think theyre reaching the fuck off your value added aint worth that much point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont need to do anything the tools make multiple leagues easier to manage and some people like myself like how the draft assistant works when it comes to managing cheat sheets and pulling up additional information during the draft but whatever you say
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do you know of any free mock draft tools that let you put in keepers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its not paying for advice its paying for content aggregation and associated tools
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i liked how the manual draft assistant worked similar to the many mock drafts i would do in preparation sorry you dont approve of this and no i dont need your help some of us didnt mind spending a small onetime fee to make things cleaner and easier cute response though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like the myplaybook since i have leagues and it makes it a hell of a lot easier to do lineups and waivers the rest of the site is meh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the content and level of analysis is fantastic imo site ui not great
fantasyfootball,not_removed,note that this is for not fantasypros
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i could agree with this mock drafting is always valuable since im in dynasty i drafted once and now im done but yeah after the draft useless
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pretty much i am in leagues all with nontraditional formats i never felt comfortable mocking on espn or ffc when i couldnt factor in things like keepers specific lineup formats etc i used the fantasy pros draft wizard put in all the keepers everyone chose a week before the draft and mocked nonstop i never felt so prepared
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck off your value added aint worth that much point pretty much this the tools were worth a small fee to me but when it comes to a monthly subscription id rather pass
fantasyfootball,not_removed,are you talking about leaguesync this is the first report shoot me a dm with details
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mission accomplished everyone here thinks youre a fantasy football badass now well done
fantasyfootball,not_removed,like round for me i like to go back to back with my qbs im liking jameis with his weapons and mariota could be a solid pickup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brees if not brees then i will target rivers late
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eli in the or
fantasyfootball,not_removed,matt ryan good value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,around round id say ive streamed qbs the last few years and its worked for me last year my qb total for the year had me at or its just a really stacked position if you play the matchups
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shooting for dalton rivers ryan late
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck man im feeling very swayed by that previous post on mariota the other day i dont enjoy reaching for qbs and i would only likely reach for cam otherwise im hoping to pick up cousinsmariotatyrodcarr in later rounds no particular order and if brady slips too far past the idiots in my league i might try for him depending on how my draft looks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,last round targeting cousins tyrod mariota winston and dalton
fantasyfootball,not_removed,reasonably i mean i could say cam in the but thatll never happen team league russell wilson in the luck in the or wait until to get eli rivers or tyrod if those guys go earlier somehow
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in a team league thrown tds are points im snagging mine in the round i expect to be gone by then
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i live in seattle and i guarantee someone will take russel wilson in the round in every league i play in i hate it because id totally take him in like the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i took brady in the last year started him for half my season then traded dalton for palmer straight up and started him for the rest of the season probably going to try to snag palmer early because my friends are assholes and they know i like him one of my friends already said he would grab him and bench him out of spite
fantasyfootball,not_removed,like most people on this thread i like drafting qbs late some mocks ive done ive gotten kirk and mariota in the rounds if rivers falls to ill take him i like waiting until late to get my qbs unless somehow russ falls to the late early
fantasyfootball,not_removed,stafford andor eli round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love the carr cousins dalton stafford tyrod taylor cluster around the round i think out of those guys at least of them are going to end up being top guys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,round we play a qb league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,carr im biased but i think he finishes top this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if newton rodgers luck brees fell brees sometimes does palmer roeth eli whenever he is the last of my top and i know eli is high for most people
fantasyfootball,not_removed,auction format but this has worked really well for me last year it was cam woo hoo and bradford doh for cheap year before it was luck and some other lottery ticket qb ive forgotten that worked out pretty well if anyone cares i fucking love rivers i know hes still a top adp and mariota this season for potentially crazy value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,imo last season eli was the most value at qb for where he was taken in drafts especially during the shit show of top tier qbs last season he was a diamond in the rough i expect no different this season as the giants will have even more passing weapons and still no run game eli could have one of his best seasons definitely my pick for qb with out a doubt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got him in the to round out a completely ridiculous ppr team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have been looking around round and one of mariotatryod have been guarantees in man mock drafts id be happier with mariota but if sammy is healthy then i have no probllems with tyrod
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why do you hate that it means there is better player for you to choose from come your pick till round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rivers could be really good as a late pick but mariota could potentially be an amazing steal guy showed that he can play last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got cam last year and luck the year before that i never take a qb before round and those worked out perfect
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seriously
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just won because bailey didnt have to kick the extra point dear god
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez is back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my eagles d went from points to in one td
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i traded hopkinsjhill for dez and it got vetod this week commish lobbied his pals to do it including his brother claimed it was unfair for the guy receiving hopkins im an outsider to the league and know only person hes basically calling me out as a moron because i gave up star receiver hot rb for a guy coming off injury nobody in the league has the balls to make a trade but i had a thesis and made my play only trade completed so far we added martellus to my side of the trade already had reed and completed the deal later dezs performance just put me over the top by pts vs the leagues team who had godgers pt performance i just sent a trade proposal of cardinals d for david johnson to the commish with a nasty message attached this is peak fantasy sports for me gotta soak in the highs before one of my guys tears an acl next week fuck yeah
fantasyfootball,not_removed,god i love watching zeke i know his line helps him alot but damn if that guy doesnt run hard and make plays where there really isnt much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,romo should start next week if healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if dez looks this good wait till tono big dick romo comes back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so glad dez looked good got a ton of rz looks too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez after seeing rodgers and sanu decimate a point lead i needed you to outscore mathew and sproles you done it by dez you complete me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you based dez i almost sat you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,god bless derek carr and cam newton not getting tds saved me from decoy julio spencer ware hurt and booker getting vultured by a fb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just in fucking time dez welcome back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was surprised prescott didnt throw in more screens to elliott especially when philadelphia kept blitzing up the middle leading to prescott severely underthrowing receivers down the field i know elliott is a great blocker but i feel as though youve gotta slip him out there sometimes and get him in space
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez bryant that guy fucks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck you josh lambo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez is back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i survived carrmageddon ama
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn i lost because dallas decided to go for it on instead of kicking the field goal i mean good move by dallas but the fantasy gods can be cruel
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when is ertz having his breakout year again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,odds that alshon gets a td or at least yards against the vikings tomorrow
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think its time to move on from carson wentz three weeks in a row hes got me less than points in nflcom
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beasley and bailey came in clutch id hug them if i could right now without letting go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had already thought i lost then dez gets a td outta nowhere to win me the game by luv u
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i thought wins were only true in fairy tails 🎵 meant for other teams but not for mine 🎵 then i saw his catch now im a beasliever 🎵 not a trace of doubt in my mind 🎵 im in love im a beasliever 🎵 i couldnt waive him if i tried 🎵
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lost by on that last zeke catch to fall to ending my hopes of a good season thats the breaks but honestly that rush at the end of this game was worth the league buy in i love fantasy football
fantasyfootball,not_removed,overtime is where fantasy dreams go to die
fantasyfootball,not_removed,was and just lost to the inactive team who had bell and kevin white in their lineup thanks for less than nothing ingram
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that feeling when my r kelley and jacquizz outscores his david johnson and zeke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beasley won it for me in overtime
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just lost by cause of the cowboys last td drive less yards or less points would each have given me a win sucks even more cause i could have started dallas defense hindsight is right and jordan matthews caught mfking balls tonight too smh i give up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wont by fucking point was up with my opponent only having dan bailey left fuck me that was stressful
fantasyfootball,not_removed,after that goal line td i wonder what happened or what ryan mathews did to not even come out on the field once
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what should i do with hunter henry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,after straight losses by a combined total of points feels good to get back in the win column with an easy point win with big ben ab and landry all on bye i had been dreading this week all season and shady being out didnt improve my outlook on it any got solid games from the rest of my roster though including a season best from kelce to lift me to with most of those guys hopefully coming back next week as well as a possible return from rawls who is stashed on my bench im cautiously optimistic about my chances down the final stretch of the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got a pretty basic question for you guys how do you get over making a costly mistake
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if diggs does not get more than ppr points im gonna lose to someone who played terrance west and lesean mccoy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so why did dak go beasley blind until the very end of the game he was force feeding dez as much as could at the cost of wide open looks out of the slot that game was probably a lot closer than it needed to be
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dak didnt look good at times wonder who they will choose
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and that witten td gave me the loss
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rest in peace beasley you sweet prince
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i won my matchup despite scoring only points sometimes you have to be lucky to be good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez im so glad you are back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,barring any stat corrections won by opponent had zeke that ot was far too scary
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i thought my week was over after ingram got and ty got just but by tonights game i was down points and only had sturgis left the great one blessed me with points tonight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that last dak td helped me bring down the only undefeated team in our league i was projected to get blown out too since they have julio and evans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if ive already won by should i even start asiata tomorrow he could get a touch fumble get injured and cost me the win
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lost cuz of the eagles defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,got a point lead with minnesota left against asiata and jeffrey mostly worried about asiata
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that last quarter was awesome for a guy starting dez me against a guy with the philly defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im so mad that they dont kick the pat in ot i fucking tied because of that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i started julio baldwin and hopkins with fuller as a flex because obviously detroits defense is shit never again crowder and d adams gb on my bench and i could have flexed gill thank the fantasy gods this was a bye week against the league inactive under points from starting receivers and im going to win by less than against someone with byes awesome
fantasyfootball,not_removed,boys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,need vikings dst to score to win
fantasyfootball,not_removed,scoring this week in ppr was a first for me over phew after some weeks with below projection this was a great change
fantasyfootball,not_removed,woo eifert is a fucking stud mvp of my team this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just won by because of the philly d giving up that last td most of my starters were on bye this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is that a glitch it says dan bailey had xp on espn he didnt kick one at the end of the game and only had xp on the final drive
fantasyfootball,not_removed,had dez and philly dst going in ot vs sproles and jordan matthews was up by i thought it was but int was taken from philly dst i survived by one point i dont know if i have the heart to start a defense against my own star again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wellas a ware evans hilton and doyle ownerthank god i was playing my leagues tacoand for tom brady gag
fantasyfootball,not_removed,traded zeke to the guy im playing this week he put my opponent up by jordan howard at minnesota is my last best hope so thats a bummer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i feel like i went from being in top to almost being out of playoffs overnight i can only handle or more losses ros to survive it took me too long to get healthy rbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,will lose by because of a denver d stat correction i think is coming to nflcom denver d conceded points not like nflcom fantasy says which creates a point correction fml
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that written td put me up by and my opponent only has bradford to play please play some defense bears and the dez td won my game in another league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so happy to have dez back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dak finally deciding to throw to cole beasley at the end of the game resulted in my opponent storming back and tying me i dont know whether to be pissed off or thankful neither he nor dez got another catch to win him the match up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bengals have in my league killed me dak and dez helped me to get to points shy of winning bummer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good point not sure what kind of league you are in but we play pass td point run td for qbs so yeah dak is a valuable fantasy qb i mean look at bortles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,of course i leave at the half my opponents players go off eagles d decides to utterly implode and i lose absolute fucking bullshit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,anyone watch nfl network deion sanders is just terrible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,down by and against the eagles d need dez to crush it in ppr plllllls me hours ago thank you fantasy football gods
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i won everything went wrong this week and i beat the best team in the league by one point because of that touchdown
fantasyfootball,not_removed,up by opponent only has the cowboys defense point until the quarter and then fumble sack sack down by overtime i need the eagles to score a touchdown to tie cowboys go and scorerip julio got injured and other guy had sanu and got points at the end of the game saltiest game of my life
fantasyfootball,not_removed,was only down with diggs tomorrow until that witten touchdown now im down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,started off and unless the vikes d outscores jeffrey by i will be why do i keep coming back to fantasy football year after year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,up against her bailey beasley and witten holy shit i won by that fucking ot nearly gave me a heart attack
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just won by of a point due to sturgis going off tonight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats the value on dez right now id really like to snag him but i dont want to give too much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tyreek hill is my man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i won on dezs back and stugis leg was down going into snf vs r mathews wasnt liking my chances but it was the only seasonal league i managed to win this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,real talk over under for christine meredith tomorrow
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i came so so close lost by standard league dez and r mathews mostly dez kept me hopeful right up until the end but it wasnt enough to make up for ty hilton and marshall im hoping for a stat correction in my favor point is just ridiculously disappointing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was playing the team in our league with an owner who hasnt bothered to find his password so hes the bot i was projected to win by over points i started ware ingram julio and the jets d lost by one point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck you crapaport i need points from meredith tomorrow because you gave us all bad info on ty
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was a zeke yard touchdown rush away from winning lost by devastating
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just made the play of the season for myself so far ppr traded mark ingram for cole beasely last week to the guy im playing this week ended up winning by if he didnt trade me beasely i wouldve started ingram and lost by
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was celebrating that the cowboys scored a td in ot because the bailey pat would break the tie between me and the person im playingfuck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,holy shit i got points espn standard league this week cam newton demarco murray devontae booker amari cooper doug baldwin tyler eifert jonathan stewart broncos dst matt bryant my team is finally starting to come together
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dak prescott is definitely a at this point dude is rock solid and has been getting more comfortable even against tough defenses
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id like to thank dak and dez for putting together a terrific final minutes of that game really tied the victory together nicely much love dd
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dak be like romo look at me i am the captain now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i bet you were so hyped that they went for it on down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just won because the eagles went on third down and sturgis didnt get to kick another fg
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and playing cleveland next week woop woooop
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is catches on targets a reason to worry at all i didnt watch the game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,scandrick too timing couldnt have been better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mine too lost by points didnt they record a fumble doesnt give me the win but i swear i saw that come up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,going over points allowed is usually the pivot point from positive to negative scoring
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yah wtf is up with that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i feel ya im in a league with a lot of money on the line and am an outsider it really sucks im never doing it again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that blows vetos are there to prevent collusion not protect people from bad decisions
fantasyfootball,not_removed,plus youre basically guaranteed one hurdle per week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,zeke is physical dude has energy too i love that we drafted him so much as a cowboys fanif only i could have gotten him in my player keeper league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree
fantasyfootball,not_removed,playing the browns let him rest one more week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,romo is good id say hes great but dont hurt the chemistry of the team right now and give some negative for prescott to dwell on hes improving right in front of us
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gtfo lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he isnt coming back though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank god for carr i started him over brees this week because i thought the seahawks defense would hold him back more brees had a respectable point performance in my league but carr posted i won by points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think dak earned the starting role after tonight even after romo gets healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a dallas local the general feeling is romo needs to chill on the sidelines but hell come back well lose the game and hell get benched
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im sure they had a robber play waiting for if they started doing that more than once a possession
fantasyfootball,not_removed,every kicker i touch turns to shit my highest score this season from my kicker has been points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no fucking kidding dude i have lambo and my game ended in a tie
fantasyfootball,not_removed,me too and cuz bailey hit a yard instead of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i tied
fantasyfootball,not_removed,every year since he was drafted
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when sam bradford gets traded back to the eagles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,never lol as an eagles fan he will probably never be fantasy relevant hes an extremely talented pass catching te but he just doesnt get the targets its hard for me to see him getting significant targets in the foreseeable future considering how bad our receivers are idk why he doesnt get treated as a primary option a la graham or gronk but both kelly and pederson have refused to make him the primary option on any plays
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fwiw xavier rhodes is allowing an average of yards per game to his wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,against minny chance id say
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you should be ok unless jay cutler
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a wilson owner anything over is a godlike performance cries
fantasyfootball,not_removed,took the words right out of my mouth
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i lost by on that same catch puts me at i have lost the past two weeks while scoring the second highest point totals in both weeks and the total of those two losses are a combined points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that last zeke catch the right tackle false started but wasnt called im sorry for your loss
fantasyfootball,not_removed,amen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if i lose this week its as the scorer to the scorer my buddy put up points standard and won his match against apparently our taco who sat zeke bye last week and started eli manning bye this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you must have been happy as hell when they went for it on down in ot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wasnt watching was he literally not on the field or just not getting the ball when he actually came on
fantasyfootball,not_removed,made zero sense honestly even smallwood and barner got touches after that and mathews never sniffed the field was it a statement for mathews to realize he cant fublue or is he completely in the dog house
fantasyfootball,not_removed,try to recognize it agree never to do it again then drink at the bar and tell everyone about your mistake even if they appear not to be englishspeaking or tell you outright that they dont watch football
fantasyfootball,not_removed,remember that its just a game and that the majority of fantasy is all luck and just be happy that your probably still better than rex ryan who does this professionally
fantasyfootball,not_removed,alcohol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not only that why were they abandoning the super effective run game once they got inside the line
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im glad beasley didnt get attention i would have lost for the week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think they give romo one week if he doesnt do amazing they switch back to dak its a shame because romo is definitely talented but dak has been winning and thats what matters
fantasyfootball,not_removed,stat correction
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im sure you know your league rules but make sure that there isnt a penalty for leaving a spot empty also you should dress him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i needed from them to win got
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if jeffrey can be kept to or less id be okay with that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cheers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,me too undefeated in my division and its a restaurantbar work league of all the male staff lots of waytoofarbro type of shit talk i feel like im jynxing the fuck out of myself everytime i get smug about it aww thats cute when you guys brag to each other i feel like a dad at christmas watching his kids argue over who i gave the best present to and it warms my heart see weeks like this when my win is in the bag its fun to live the competitive life vicariously through you fellas then i walk away and they are all pissed but me most of all because i just torpedod my season worth it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what is your team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,been a bad week for defenses
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nvm it was corrected
fantasyfootball,not_removed,started hilton and evans as well very disappointing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why would you trade away zeke what did you get in return
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the scoring is correct of those points came off a trevor siemian pick the denver defence and special teams do not get penalized for that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont worry youll still win broncos d only gave up points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not sure what rules nflcom uses but ive heard on here yahoo does not include points allowed if your offense allowed the points i know san diego scored on a pick and unsuccessfully went for you may be good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,similar situation i was up by about point then starting going to beasley and hes up now luckily i have alshon tomorrow but even points in a ppr league isnt guaranteed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,congrats on the win
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cutler off the injury man anythings possible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont know the exact play but if he took off on a designed run which it sounds like the bootleg was thats not a sack
fantasyfootball,not_removed,stat correction inc
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you see that targets fuck im so high on him right now you missed your boat to buy low
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you need to buy him as if hes a or you are not getting him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,uhhh would not expect him to do well but ppr could help
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey i lost one week by and ryan matthews gave me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ty montgomery
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ty montgomery
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not sure what game you watched but he was garbage
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if romos not back against cleveland id definitely be willing to start him as a backend high end
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eh he made some pretty poor choices and throws
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he went of with passing tds rushing td one fumble recovered by dal and a goal line pick a sub completion rating does not help a backup steal the starting job imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think dallas last two possessions in regulation are the case for romo either way its a good problem for dallas to have
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think so he looked god awful through the majority of the game the game would have been over if he hits some of those throws earlier in the game which i think romo would have done i dont think there was anything he could have done this game that would have put romo on the bench for good though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its not hard to look good behind that offensive line and against an eagles secondary with glass bones and paper skin so no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dak was throwing like shit all game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dak was super inaccurate
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wonder how many of those were actual drops and not poor throws
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bad throws and miscommunication next week will have the rust shaken off hes gonna have a great game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt he was force feeding the ball to dez most were really bad throws but hes looking at dez alot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in an man league and only know person everything is fine for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,or let him knock off the rust against the worst team in the league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,exactly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,exactly dak targeted dez often but most were horrible targets romo with that o line and with zeke could be super bowl caliber and im a redskins fan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dak didnt look all that impressive imo a lot of poor throws to dez
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for for me except also with tes and at least one wr and rb have horrible horrible games and i usually regret not swapping him out for my bench guy fantasy football is becoming so much luck that its not as much fun to play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keep your hands off tucker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lost by had bailey have a point bonus for
fantasyfootball,not_removed,looking back from last year when head those stretch of games and even his highlight reel from stanford its like how are they not finding a way to get it to this guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cutler is good news for alshon owners
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have him and stafford in another league i occasionally play him if the matchup seems favorable but its bitten me in the ass every time i think theres been one week that wilson did better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in the quarter i was like wtf i thought beasley had a yard floor and then hes like oh i do
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tough breaks man i have seasonal leagues and ive lost games under points just a tough year for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn thats rough my game this week my opponent and i were about points ahead of everyone else in the league so i know how that feels haha but you still got a chance at losses is when youre screwed cause then you have to win out to make playoffs most likely
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill end up losing because i had montgomery in and gill in the bench i work so i sleep from so i didnt see he was gonna end up being out so thats fun
fantasyfootball,not_removed,literally wasnt on the field at all
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this this sounds vaguely familiar but i cant put a finger on it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,carr cooper baldwin dj ingram eifert cooks dez haushkasp and seattle i know i was kinda counter active with two no against my d but i couldnt really cut anyone to fix that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,leveon and pryor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,even on nflcom
fantasyfootball,not_removed,targets is nice but equally troubling is only rec
fantasyfootball,not_removed,targets almost lost them the game they forced it so many times they almost lost beasley and zeke saved that game spreading out the field
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah im totally worried im trying my hardest to trade for even coradelle right now lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,have an upvote
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im talking about from a fantasy perspective all that matters for ff is that he consistently puts up good numberswhich he has done
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i plan on starting him until romo is guaranteed back my main qb was russell wilson but the seattle offense is hot garbage right now so until he proves otherwise im hoping i get more starts out of dak
fantasyfootball,not_removed,indeed but you could blame that on the lack of adjustments on play calling the eagles defense played highrisk high reward blitz packages all night there are easyish ways to make them pay for that instead the cowboys stuck to the gameplan i think rightly considering the win which gave dak the opportunity to learn to trust the pocket keep progressing through his receivers and keeping his eyes down field it was a learning game and the cowboys also won
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they had so much rhythm in the first quarter and then the rest of the game was like he dipped his hand in butter before each snap
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i watched the whole game and dont remember a single noncatch by dez that wasnt either a poor throw by dak or b broken up by eages secondary
fantasyfootball,not_removed,basically get back that chemistry with dez that got them tds in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,with one padded practice under his belt why on earth would they do that dak had his worst game against their best opponent and still won hes only going to get better from here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i can really only think of one really good pass dak threw all game it was dezs first catch for yards that was a beautiful throw most of his other throws were hot garbage
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he still led them to a record a comeback victory against a tough division rival hes still a rookie but clearly the team believes in him dez doesnt make the entire dallas cowboys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it makes no sense to me its so frustrating to see the incompetence of agholor and mediocrity of matthews while we have two really good tes that are a minimal part of the passing game we should be trying to use them like the patriots do
fantasyfootball,not_removed,xavier rhodes isnt though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably that fluky jets game where nobody started him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn is this related to his fumbling i feel like hes their most talented runner and its not an offense overflowing with talent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and total points for is used in a lot of leagues playoff tiebreaker spots
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn if they didnt bench ingram you couldve had even more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well done
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i play on nflcom and those are the default rules there too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes even on nfl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well still i would imagine that as soon as he tucked it and started running he essentially established himself as a runner so itd just be a normal tackle
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that was on dak being mostly inaccurate throughout the game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah they werent exactly on the same page like he was throwing it on a different break on the route
fantasyfootball,not_removed,romo will have the starting job back as soon as he can play tonight showed dak is not yet ready to face an aggressive d every dc in the league just learned that the easy way to frazzle him is blitzing early and often
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good point in my league we play point passing tds run tds so dak is more valuable i mean look at blake bortles hes hot garbage
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats a fair argument but there were at least occasions where dak almost turned the ball over one was a fumble in the third quarter iirc that dak recovered himself the other was a pass that would have been intercepted with less than minutes to go except it hit the ground thats all well and good when youre playing the browns but the cowboys schedule also includes vs baltimore in week minnesota in week new york giants in week philadelphia week idk if dak comes out with more than one win out of that bunch romo at least gives you a chance at of those
fantasyfootball,not_removed,exactly let the dez is back hype train live targets hes gonna be sitting right next to elliot eating
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i completely agree with all of what you said except for the fact that the end result is that he keeps the starting job when romo comes back imo if a healthy romo started this game they would have won in regulation
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you sir i figured i pretty much fleeced him actually
fantasyfootball,not_removed,true but still id rather have a wr go than if you catch my drift not saying dez is looking bad rather his qb may not be helping him out a ton
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not sure if youre thinking of old romo but there is no way he beats those blitzes either now he is not mobile at all anymore and does not want to get hit not saying dak didnt look foolish but romo wasnt gonna be much better in those situations
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you could say that about just about any qb though there are only a few that dont start to crack under that kinda pressure the issue is not ever defense in the league can pull that kind of aggressive defense off
fantasyfootball,not_removed,another good point i think there will probably be an osweiler benching for payton moment wait until dak struggles fundamentally and then put romo in as a natural turn of events dont force it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,very good trade i figured you received something pretty sweet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,denbers defense in yahoo says theyre in the points scored bracket when they had scored on them anyone have this issue
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please let me know what you would do my league unbeknownst to me changed its waiver period the commish did it before the start of the season but i had no clue nor did anyone else the last time to pick up a player is one hour before the start of the first game on sunday therefore if you have a late scratch like ty montgomery and you do not have a backup plan for a late game you are screwed and cannot start anyone that is not on your bench ie grab a free agent for the sunday night or monday night game this happened to me this week with tymo and i lost by points does anyone else lockoutfreeze the ability to pick up free agents at noon on sundays the way we had it before was that you could pick up anyone so long as they have not yet played and not in a waiver period
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i didnt check this but i think i remember san diego having a pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yahoo doesnt count defensive tds against the defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is correct
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the nfl draft project nfldraftproject is a collection of some of the best nfl draft analysts in the industry each guest will break down three players all from the offensive side of the ball there are guests which equals a total of players the intent is to give you even more information from a variety of angles to help you determine who you want to draft in your fantasy football leagues owen riese riesedraft is a writer for buckys quarter as well as the acme packing co he joins host andy singleton peoplezpen to go over wisconsin rb dare ogunbowale whom owen went to uw with clemson pass catcher artavis scott and emerging vt hokie te bucky hodges
fantasyfootball,not_removed,looking for ideas for league manager type posts that can be made in offseason during the year i have game previewsrecaps power rankings and league notes i did an offseason power ranking when the regular season ended what else can be done in the offseason looking to send at least one league update each month have some rule change ideas but prefer to roll those out later in offseason
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need a huge game from dez tonight i actually kinda feel good about it its prime time dez has been itching to get back for weeks please fantasy football gods let dez ball out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,saint dez please bless me with tds on this ridiculous day
fantasyfootball,not_removed,finally a good sunday night football game brought to you by the nfc beast youre welcome fans of lesser divisions
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this game is nerve wrecking im benching beasley in favor of diggs since my qb is bradford with no confidence whatever im down by points with bradford diggs and the eagles d left to go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,any chance i can close a gap with dez and the eagles dst
fantasyfootball,not_removed,down by and against the eagles d need dez to crush it in ppr plllllls
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need pts from dez to win my gameolsen was a bum today
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he always seems to go off against the eagles especially in prime time hes gonna eat tonight then ask for seconds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,deleted
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its about time the nfc east produced something worth watching been a while
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theyre kind of working against each other
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a very very small chance tds from dez and an eagles pick perhaps it could happen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have the option to put in jmatt but i dont really trust him and wentz
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i was banking on some shootout potential and with the eagles special teams having some kickoffpunt returns but im pretty ready to accept the l this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe ap im currently evaluating my options the leagues wildcard is picking third and hes made some completely out of the blue picks in the past so im going to have to adjust accordingly my leagues draft is also late in the preseason as were doing it august so the dynamic of the first round could change if bells suspension is thrown out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gurley
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id rake ap if the top wrs are gone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is it ppr or standard in standard i would probably take ap if its ppr i would go for hopkins or aj green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i play in ppr league if top three wr are not available i think gurley is my choice close between him and ad but i think he has a higher ceiling
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre in a great spot every player has some questions but only a few have answered them yearin and yearout if im at and those receivers are off the board im taking all day all day any day of the week edit this is assuming leveon doesnt win his appeal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is it really that hard to just rank your top players like damn you people need to learn how to make decisions
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in the same exact spot and format as this guy im assuming julio ap and brown are gone im torn between david johnson ap and bell adrian is going to be great and consistent as always david johnson has the potential to be the number one rb to me and bell is the guy id want come playoffs out of those id love to have a debate on those three guys gurley is also on the mix die to pure talent but his offense worries mesame as ap actually
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oardell beckum jewniar
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ap
fantasyfootball,not_removed,been taking david johnson in a lot of mocks lately which is so so weird
fantasyfootball,not_removed,david johnson but id take ap or gurley too i just trust the other guys more than gurley because theyre in better offenses but the of them are so close its a toss up which ever one you want
fantasyfootball,not_removed,johnsongurley
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id take dj an argument can be made for gurley ap dhop assuming this holdout ends sometime soon and aj as well hell if you wanted to take zeke there i couldnt fault you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you take gurley at
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj muhhfuggin greeeeeen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green i dont see much of a difference between his talent and situation from julios
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there is a daily who do i draft thread please use that thread for questions such as this one thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i snagged julio some doof took bell at prior to suspension yes we drafted early plz dont downvote me it edit fuck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i foolishly hadnt given ap a ton of thought before posting just cause most mocksrankings have had dj gurley or hopkins ahead of but with dj lacking a long track record the rest of gurleys team sucking and hopkins new qb it feels like ap might be the closest one to a sure thing out of that group
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my bad half ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive been looking at gurley as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so dont seek advice or engage in discussion days before the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you mean julio obj and brown are gone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks this is the first time ive used this sub prior to a draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont tell me what not to do
fantasyfootball,not_removed,here have a downvote
fantasyfootball,not_removed,or early
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ap scares me a bit though yes hes a physical freak but hes got a ton of miles on those legs im in a keeper so my situation is a little bit different as i already own lamar miller ill keep an eye on leveon as even if hes suspended i still might take him at im a firm believer that hes the best back in the game right now when hes on the field
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah id probably go with hopkins or aj green normally id say bell but looks like that wont pan out i think aj is the safer choice but personally i like hopkins more i feel like aj is almost a guarantee for at least yards and thats kind of what im looking for in my first round pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sure seek advice on certain players discuss how others rank players relative to similar choices however asking who would you take with pick is a stupid question there are people everyone would take with pick and those are the top players on their personal rankings end of story people have literally asked what are your top rankings who is your top ranked rb is x worth a first round pick every single one of those questions inspires more discussion than this stupid question you posed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes good catch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ignorance is no excuse of the law
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah its hard to argue against that if he were ready week id be ecstatic about whoever out of those top fell to me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,douche
fantasyfootball,not_removed,welcome to rfantasyfootball where the same question is asked different ways every week and its not even he season yet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,like most people i assume my personal rankings and therefore who becomes my personal best player is determined by using numerous sources including this sub seems like youre pretty steadfast and thats great however im guessing you became that way through a similar combination of various sources if you dont value the opinions and discussions posted here why engage in them to address your more inspiring questions what are your top rankings if i pick at most players ranked are irrelevant to me imo this question is a difficult for many to answer b may result in regurgitation of readily available expert rankings or c the responses would be difficult to compile in order to form some sort of consensus who is your top ranked rb useful to know but not helpful to those with the pick if there are or more wrs ranked above the top ranked rb is x worth a first round pick given that this discussion pertains to the pick there are potentially other players depending on league size that are worse than the best pick while simultaneously being worth a first round pick if you were attempting to be helpful and i misunderstood my apologies but it seems like youre just really proud of how sure you are and anyone who doesnt have their personal rankings formed by now is stupid
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre literally asking other people to do your work for you this is a glorified who do i start thread its a shit post dude
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there have been a lot of these threads lately so people here have there panties in a knot over them even though the other who do i pick here were up voted and had good discussions i guess ppl finally decided they were aga isnt them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if its a shit post just downvote and move on without dropping in for your sick brag about how great of a decision maker you are and how we all should strive to be like you there are varying degrees of experience and knowledge among those who participate in and seek advice from this sub and participation while critical should still be constructive and helpful
fantasyfootball,not_removed,makes sense i started using this sub after last years draft so i wasnt aware of who do i draft reddits panties can certainly be volatile though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its over let it go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt worry its a ffb thread and youre seeking advice thats dudes a dbag
fantasyfootball,not_removed,let it goooo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love how this list is out before the draft or free agency
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i disagree with dixon at rb im not sure how he can be over valued when i doubt anyone will be drafting him early anyways also the qb list all those qbs listed should be top qbs fantasy points wise by end of season unless injuries
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you guys agree with matt ryan on the list
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a year ab own and placing twice in the money i can confirm he isnt overrated as long as ben is healthy he can single handedly win games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what makes people think dt is going to be significantly worse than last year where he finished
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i can completely understand the cases made by the analysts i like dixon at his value seems to be low risk for someone who is as talented as he is not all rbs can come in year one and be effective im willing to give him another chance especially at ryan certainly worries me at his current adp the only place im going to be owning him is in my keeper league where he will cost me a round pick otherwise ill pass if im taking a qb that high im probably going to take brees luck or rodgers but thats a big if put me on the derrick henry train demarco murray is a really good back and continues to prove father time wrong but i think henry begins to take even more of the touches in the rb group for the titans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brady is a bitch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im confused do they have multiple writers kenneth dixon appears on both the under and over values lists
fantasyfootball,not_removed,might be the most accurate overvalued list ive seen though some still are a little uninteresting because i dont think d tom is going to get picked where they have him anymore same goes for sammy and what not people are going to be off both of those guys im thinking cooper is a better over value than them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,right im fiending for fantasy as much as the next guy but this means close to nothing right now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you look at both the undervalued and overvalued articles dixon pops up on both lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you dont have to be drafted early to be overvalued ecr has httpswwwfantasyproscomnflplayerskennethdixonphpweekdraft the guy who says hes overvalued has him at not saying i agree or disagree just shining a light on the process
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i can keep him as a round value for next year while i agree with the article i think if you find a good value of him in your drafts or keeper choices he could definitely be worth it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think he will be overvalued in the sense that his value last season came from being a lowround draftee who put up top numbers this coming season we can expect him to be one of the top qbs off the board i personally believe his numbers will remain about the same they will just cost more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think hell have a great year but hes definitely going to go higher than id take a qb last year he was in that range for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nope but at the same time im not assuming hes going to put up the same numbers or better all i know is if i can draft him im a happy man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,similar to danger russ whose season was marred with injury i try to avoid players who just had historic performances ryan could regress to the mean
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no why would he be so much worse than last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes the one i disagree with the most im taking him as the first wr for sure which puts him like fifth overall for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its not about ab its about ben roethlisberger if ben retires ab takes a huge hit in production landry jones is straight awful
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wtf are you taking about theyre saying if you were to draft today its a risk taking him until you know whether or not ben will retire
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do they have multiple writers both the undervalued and overvalued list have multiple experts contributing the experts name is at the end of each blurb the first player listed blount is written by jon collins of fantasy sports lr walter cherepinsky anthony staggs and sean koerner also contributed to this article koerner i know in particular is one of the most accurate experts over the past few years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it literally says the name of writer under each players miniparagraph so yes they have multiple writers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably after all this is just some writers opinion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre here why are you here stop being here what else are people going to talk about it all means close to nothing life means close to nothing nothing wrong with selfidentified waytooearly waytooearly analysis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,round is nice i think we expect too much from rookies not everyone is going to become instant world beaters like dj or zeke or obj development takes time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why would he be so much worse than last year the concern is mostly because last year was such an outlier for him he threw td last year hes only eclipsed one other time he threw int hes only had fewer than one other time therell also be a new ocsystem in atl who knows the impact that will have editadd he also doesnt need to be so much worse to be overvalued if he slips just a bit he falls into that tier that can be had later in the draft ryans adp right now is in the round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he may not be worse than last year but the price that people are going to pay for a guy who has largely been an inconsistent fantasy contributor is likely going to leave people disappointed at the end of especially if dan quinn continues to improve the defense ryan will be playing in far fewer high scoring games which means more run for freeman and coleman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whos fourth
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ben probs not retiring
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there is no risk he isnt retiring
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh ok thanks for the explanation
fantasyfootball,not_removed,technically its the opinion of multiple people experts including sean koerner who was the most accurate analyst in and and most accurate in the other guys were all in the top for accuracy last year as well not saying theyre right by any means but it probably is a bit better than if one of us just rolled out some thoughts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so i guess the undervalued was a different author i just assumed they were both written by the same analyst
fantasyfootball,not_removed,uh no just because i disagree with the purpose of an article doesnt mean i cant have an opinion on it and my opinion is that this is early and meaningless its not like i sub to rfantasyfootball just to comment on the uselessness of every offseason thread since were extrapolating this to ridiculous comparisons like the triviality of life i believe discouraging people from having comments on things they disagree with and everyone retreating to their respective internet echo chamber has contributed to the current toxicity in our country
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you dont think that as long as he has julio jones he will be putting up great numbers again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yep meant fourth haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dj elliot bell and who knows howardajayi or julio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably not but that is what the author of the ab overvalue was talking about ab will be golden with ben but not nearly as good without
fantasyfootball,not_removed,look man you asked a question to which the answer was literally in the article and its not hidden or in a smaller font
fantasyfootball,not_removed,or perhaps the writer is on the fence with dixon im not sure so dont take my word for it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no its people who choose to shit on things they dont like that they could easily ignore that create the toxicity in our country dont hate nothing at all except hatred dont shit on anything at all except for folks unnecessarily shitting on things im here because im interested in the topic and find it just as worthwhile as whatever else i was gonna be looking at whilst takin a poo youre here to be a shitter to shout stop liking what i dont like and be real cool about it we real cool we shit stools we uptight we not right while shitting im gonna shit on shitters so maybe shitters will stop shitting on things and therell be less shit around its one thing to disagree with an argument within a topic its another to just shit on an entire topic and say its worthless that adds nothing to anything comments that means this article has created a lot of discussion only a few bits of which our conversation here were absolutely worthless
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes had julio other years and been bad for fantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not really sure what i think its not like was his first season with julio going into last season he wasnt drafted in most leagues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont forget odell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well considering i read the other one last week i think its fair to not remember who wrote it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,was terrible for him but most of his other seasons were pretty consistent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill be approaching the qb position the same way in this years draft pick up a solid starter after the or round this past season guys like stafford and matty ice were there this year we have to wait and see how the adp shakes out but there will certainly be valuable qbs available late once again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am a giants fan but odell isnt too i think julio jones ab and evans make a good case to be ahead of him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do you remember if you read it or not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it just depends when he goes if i can get cam or wilson a round or two later id probably go for that or a car after that but even without the season being considered is mediocre the qbs in the range are interchangeable to me so if this years the outlier i dont want to pay big for a guy id rather par for the sure thing of brees brady rodgers if im gonna go in the first six rounds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,none of them were as good or really close to how he was last season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as someone that picked him up real late for his first few years he always had some amazing runs weeks of top qb performances then average the rest of the time this year was just the first year he put it all together
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is why i want to pick top three this year so bad the wide outs probably come after that and its almost a crap shoot who will have the best season honestly obj is taking a hit in my ranks this year cause the silly mental stuff that effects him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah but no other quarterback had those numbers ryan ranked and in qbr in the six years between his rookie season and
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah he certainly has the team and potential to do top three again hes certainly someone ill be looking at i agree with you for the most part
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he wont be worth the draft capital required after this last season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the most well thought out league u will ever play in sunday august edt auction bid league with reduced clock time everyone gets a fair shot at anyone this wayno luck of the draw for a pick or etcalso everyday waivers on all free agents with bid money to get those free agents so your bid money actually matters for a change points style so ppl dont get free luck wins just cuz theyre playing a team hurt or non active like head to head doespoints baby ha i make leagues so yards per play matter and qbs dont benefit as much just cuz theyre getting killed and the other team givesssss away yardage and underneath junk the benefits for yards per play i designate a small negative point per pass runreceptionthe point behind this example is if brady throws times for yards but tyrod taylor throws times for tyrod will score more it makes it so junk dump off qbs losing biggggg late in games where teams just give away yards dont benefit thst qb as muchsame with rbs per carryu dont do good averaging pet carry as oppose to per carry join anyone ive got a money league one and free league entry fee prize pool place place place qb wr wr rb te wt wt wr wrt wrt qwrt k k def def ir ir ir ir ir team leaguetheres over starters in football most all will be taken in this style so if youre tired of losing to teams who draft bad and sit at home all day picking up players u dont have time to pickup this league is for u plus as previously mentioned all players are on everyday waivers anyways to use your bid money on and to place a bid to win for the next day this gives all ppl fair chances busy and non busyas i saidits the most well thought out league u will ever play inall stat categories are set in stone so no worries accepts paypal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pretty sure field yates was the most inaccurate expert this past season well ranked out of httpswwwfantasyproscomnflaccuracy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aaron rodgers at holy shit sign me up any time love fat rob but seems a bit high id probably pick forte or coleman before him jamaal charles at is interesting if he falls that low hes probably worth the risk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,would anyone even consider taking lacy at wherever he ends up i highly doubt anyone just hands him the keys at that point you have a risky handcuff td dependent bye week flex play i would take derrick henry before i took lacy at least with henry you know that hes one demarco murray injury away from getting touches a week and he hasnt let himself go like lacy has
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont understand the position gap between robinsongurley and hopkins i always lump these guys together why would hopkins be ranked points below them i can understand ranking all in either the or the but hopkins seems as stable as the other two if not moreso
fantasyfootball,not_removed,russell wilson at and stafford not even in the top im in a team league and i might make qb my to last pick i see no reason to invest a single digit round pick in a qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yates is a worse version of mathew berry and mathew berry is already just bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is garbage
fantasyfootball,not_removed,forte seems low to me id be more than happy to have him as my second rb if that trend continues id love to draft rbrbwrwrfortegore
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jarvis landy and amari cooper are tasty at that adp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i hate field yates
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol dang hes even the worst one among the espn guys on that list
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks for this i never knew this type of ranking existed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah no way id take him that early peterson going in the second round seem unnecessarily risky as well both have had great years but theyre trending downwards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,weve seen gurley and arob succeed with pretty much the same supporting cast that they flopped with last year hopkins on the other saw a pretty huge set back almost directly due to osweiler and i highly doubt the texans cut ties with him this soon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,weve seen robinson and bortles have great fantasy football seasons weve never seen that from brock and hopkins unless youre betting on an early benching or an improvement of brocks play id take below average play hes probably the worst qb in the league youre gonna have a bad time drafting hopkins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i usually do that like my last picks to be qb te def k
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think there will be better younger backs availible in the forte is and on an awful offense that doesnt utiliz him in the passing game gore is going on and hasnt cracked in a couple years now i dont see much upside there for a relatively early pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh yeah i didnt even notice that but youre right hes way too high that team couldnt run at all last year and he was actually the least effective of the rbs they used it seems like he still tries to run like he did when he was the most athletic guy on the field but he doesnt have the acceleration to do it any more if he would make the decision to just hit the first hole and take whats given to him then maybe he could be alright but considering his age oline and injury history second round is way too rich honestly i would put him in the same draft value range as jamaal charles and theyre or rounds apart in these rankings
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mehhhhhhh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,remind me year fuck you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,while there will definitely be younger backs available there probably wont be many better rbs than forte in standard scoring i remember he had several point games and a good number of point games as well i wasnt a forte owner so i didnt keep super close track of him but id imagine he was a top rb at mid season before his injury if i can get a guy like him who has realistic potential to be an at the price of a low end ill take on the risk of his age betting on rookie running backs seems to be a crap shoot at in the draft having him not play well wont destroy your season he can certainly be a difference maker though fwiw i remember their age being use against them last year as well looking back on the season i would have been fine drafting either in the middle of the round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,one year well know in the next months
fantasyfootball,not_removed,season starts in months lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hi
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chris cooley for clinton portis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hello
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i actually made that trade once lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well met
fantasyfootball,not_removed,zeke elliot due to injury heres why im gonna draft him in my first round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jordan reed love the kid but he is going to burn some people who draft him high pretty much locked in to at least miss a few weeks and i can see the redskins offense regressing i could also see rawls shitting the bed im not a huge believer in the seattle oline and i still dont know if id want to grab him as my
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rawls going in the round seems like a big problem waiting to happen also my brother said demarco murray should go in the round i really hope hes the one to take him there because there is no way that works out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,best candidates for busting are zeke elliot and david johnson both have little sample size both have two other adequately talented backs in the backfield with them and both have a very high adp the flip side of that is that theyre also two of the best bets to be the top running back in fantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im going on gut feeling saying it is gronk between bradys suspension bringing in bennet and his injury history i think something gets him and people drafting him late in the will be furious
fantasyfootball,not_removed,todd gurley totally possible that the rams are just a huge dumpster fire
fantasyfootball,not_removed,latavius murray
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whoever you think is the safest most surefire player in the draft thats who wont pan out can set your watch to it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lauren hanley
fantasyfootball,not_removed,devonta freeman that guy did little his entire rookie year even after camp tevin coleman the new rookie beat him for the starting job he looked electric last year but hes small and itd be tough to repeat what he did i might be a little bitter because i held him his whole rookie year in my dynasty league cause i thought he looked special then i couldnt hold him when coaches seemed to like coleman better shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,carlos hyde if his adp were lower id say not a bust because hell be serviceable most weeks due to lack of competition but how are the going to be ahead in a game at all this year game flow should be terrible all year for rb production i believe his opening week yrd game is all people remember when norv turner decided not to give ap the ball and pretended that teddy bridgwater was peyton manning version
fantasyfootball,not_removed,zeke is guaranteed to bust for his adp heres a bold one adrian peterson i feel like the vikings have flirted with the though of him leaving i think they want the team to belong to teddy but ap is just too respected ap running times a game didnt lead to successful seasons unfortunately how old is ap again hopkins insane adp in my opinion but his numbers do support it jordy nelson i fucking love him but injuries like his are hard to come back strong from i think his presence will boost cobbs value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,moncrief and fleener
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keenan allen im fine with him in the round of a team ppr league but hes been creeping up to early territory
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jordan reed he very well could end up as te but im not taking the chance way too much of a risk w his long concussion history not to mention the depth at the te position david johnson the popular pick here so not much to add arians could stick him in a rbbc w i also think in the same way cja struggled due to denvers struggles in the passing game dj could struggle if palmer regresses at all or gets hurt it could kill johnsons value dez bryant coming off that bad ankle injury and dependent on tony romos health could still have a big season but the late round price tag turns me off doug martin im as big a martin fan as any and still plan on targeting him in the late but hes been extremely inconsistent year to year this could be the year sims iii eats into his snaps and drains his fantasy value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lacy is the bust i predict starks not only has a better year but hits top in ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would draft him early but i wouldnt be surprised if it was zeke elliot he was crazy in college but had so many holes opened wide open for him that i dont think will happen in the pros and i think hell have to work way harder for it which may not work out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pick any of the top rbs in the draft and you have a potential bust i cant think of the last time there were this many question marks at runningback even as great as adrian peterson is the wheels have to fall off one day and it usually happens out of no where
fantasyfootball,not_removed,david johnson after drafting hill and cj anderson last year im skeptical of any rb without a proven track record
fantasyfootball,not_removed,david johnsonwhy is a rbbc guy being talked about as a top rbi will believe it when i see it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ok people anyone who tears an acl and is a top round pick is a bust that is obvious i think it is funny when people say player x ifwhen he tears his aclno shit a bust to worry about is someone that stays healthy all year and doesnt play up to high expectation to me dj is a concern for me in az he has a small sample size yes he did very well but so do a lot of people then suck the following year also personally i am going to stay away from obj yes i know i will get flack for this comment but here is my deal i dont trust manning shepherd has been reportedly doing very well and i think could steal some targets and last year was more proof that ds can get in objs head i dont think he will be awful he is to good for that but i think he might produce a lot less than some people are projecting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,carlos hyde because he is overrated and does nothing to backup the hype
fantasyfootball,not_removed,matt forte
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eddie lacy andrew luck and jeremy hill wait wrong year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,itt every offensive nfl player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jamaal charles hard to get back to where he was pre injury also has decent rbs behind him i can see that turning into a rbbc situation
fantasyfootball,not_removed,from most to least likely melvin gordon davonte freeman all broncos offensive players fleener doug martin jamaal charles doug baldwin frank gore cam newton jordan matthews leveon bell david johnson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the entire packers offense people assuming that jordys return means the packers will be a top offense again good chance weve seen career years from all of the skill position players
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gronk acl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cordarrelle patterson everyone is expecting an improvment not me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,finally someone with some decent reasoning
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that will make next year fun as well if he has a game but only plays games it will make next year a madhouse
fantasyfootball,not_removed,injury isnt a bust bust is like drafting cj anderson or eddie lacy last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ugh i unfortunately agree i have obj and lamar as my keepers already and stockpiled the back half of the season i got reed off the waiver wire before he came back and he ran me through the playoffs but damn i dont know if i should keep him with him already rolling his ankle in practice i have lockett and ajayi sitting there staring at me to keep one of them instead it really sucks because he could be as good as gronk hes faster and looks much more fluid after catch than gronk just sucks that his injuries are all lower leg which seems to cause lingering problems for a ton of players agree with rawls though hes on my avoid list dont trust that ankle injury it was nasty and he had a small sample size even before that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,skins fan here i agree hes a stud but his injuries are to common im passing on him for someone like olsen or eiffert in later rounds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,his ankle issues concern me sounds like it was pretty serious and that his rehab is going slow they said jimmy graham was ahead of him in recovery that cant be good he had a torn rotator cuff
fantasyfootball,not_removed,where is rawls going in round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i really dont know how you put dj and zeke in the same sentence when it comes to small sample size dj was showing flashes from the second he started getting touches and outside of the seattle game where az shit the bed he hasnt disappointed once as a starter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did you all just see that the beat writer for the cowboys just predicted zeke would get carries next season who knows what to believe ive seen some that think he will be eased in and others that clearly think he will get a huge workload dont you love summer speculation lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they werent last year outside of gurley
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how the raiders upgraded the offensive line quite a bit and nobody in the backfield is a serious threat to steal early down work
fantasyfootball,not_removed,idk i could definitely see him busting but it would be more like how alfred morris was a bust last year not bust of the year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sounds like antonio brown for most people the only way he busts is if hes injured
fantasyfootball,not_removed,coleman cant hang onto the ball though doesnt matter how good he is if he fumbles as much as he did last season freeman will never lose that job
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he also had almost less than ypc in the last games of the season his value is entirely volume imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the defense has a chance to be pretty good and if they are close they will probably run it a lot still lots of ifs with that situation
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chip kelly moves to the west and people forget his predictable offense that proved it doesnt transcend talent as well yes kaepernick can run and his playbook will open but other than hyde the offensive talent including kaepernicks arm and turnover tendencies isnt there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont see either of them going high enough to be considered busts though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dude finished top ppg for a wr on a shit team ol ranked dead last pass blocking and to last for run blocking rookie rb couldnt get the run game going im not saying he will be top this year but i dont see how last year was anything but his floor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what are you reasons for feeling that way i ask because hes probably one of the players im highest on and im willing to take him a round earlier than his adp to make sure i get him he broke out under whisenhunt in and their offense went from to that year hes a target monster getting targets in his games last year and he didnt even finish the one on a ppg basis he was right there with julio and brown when he was playing a lacerated kidney is such a freak injury that i dont think you can at all say hes injury prone from that a healthier chargers offense under whisenhunt seems like a fantastic recipe for allens success this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think hes a steal in the personally and hes got a great chance to finish as a top wr he was a target monster last year and i dont think that will change in travis benjamin wont take too many targets away and he doesnt even really fit in san diegos system to begin with allens a strong candidate for catches and tds id be ecstatic to even get him in the late round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,allen had more fantasy points than antonio brown last year after games i wouldve loved to see how he couldve finished out the season without the kidney laceration it is true that if they are a better team he might get less targets but there will still be plenty to go around i like the addition of travis benjamin for the deep threat if the running game improves which i think it will defenses will have to stay honest rivers threw the ball times last season i think allen will be just fine
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just dint see it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he should have a larger role than last year he is in a top offense last year he had yards and touchdowns
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the thing is last year was the prove it year for odell and he definitely proved it with a top finish even with all the drama in the later part of the season as a young player still finding his way i would hope the behavior from last year is not repeated and he can grow from it but the production on the field speaks for itself regardless at what point do you accept that he is the real deal and belongs in the round i also think that obj will benefit from a competent receiver to draw some coverage and put more pressure on defenses
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how name a bad season he had with jordy at his disposal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,melvin gordon with his adp being around the round right now hard to say he could really qualify as a bust
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank god for this post i was targeting him in the second guess i wont be anymore
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can he really be a bust if he hasnt done shit recently anything is an improvement from last year im all about thinking he can do something and contribute but my expectation are very low
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont know a single person who would even draft him at all id rather grab an extra defense or kicker are you in a league with return points or something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is there a reason that half of your posts here are just josh gordon it literally contributes nothing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there are literally no expectations for him to start the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i could be wrong but id imagine hes going undrafted in virtually every redraft league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah im not at all wishing any bad luck on him but ive had him in fantasy for a few years now when he is healthy the dude is a beast and i love starting him but when you start wasting two spots on your roster for the te position it gets frustrating with that said i dont think olsen is making to later rounds this year eiffert isnt a bad choice but keep an eye on his injury status last i read he was still rehabing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he had a patellar tendon injury in his foot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,totally agree thats why it was so frustrating owning him last year every time johnson touched the ball he was electric he just didnt get the touches
fantasyfootball,not_removed,because they each have a small sample size zekes is obviously smaller but dj had his first start in week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this year might be more tough on gurley teams will be selling out to stop the run and they are in one of if not the toughest divisions for rbs i think he wont be a bust like alf last year but could easily underperform to the expectations he has going into the draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he faded down the stretch and had ypc in the last games sure with a better offensive line that will hopefully improve i just dont like the way the coaching staff talked about him right after season and seems like they may try rbbc and give d washington a shot to show what he has
fantasyfootball,not_removed,latavius did start to fade at the end of last year and the raiders were openly looking to upgrade at rb this offseason i doubt he is bust of the year but im tentative about him improving fantasy wise from last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,only way a lot of busts in the past bust is if they get injured then they just bust for no reason or a reason no one saw coming see lacy i agree ab is pretty safe but when you play ff you learn that no one is truly safe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fleener is continuing to rise a lot of people are big on his skills the big contract and drew brees i just think they have too many receivers there people are pointing to ben watson being great value last year but nobody took him in the or i think allen in indy will be better due to limited receiver options lucks penchant for throwing to tes especially in the red zone and what i expect will be a subpar run game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive seen moncrief go in the and fleener in the way too high
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im a big fan of keenan this year but as a devils advocate about half of your reasons could be used as an argument against him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for me its questions about rivers age and arm strength obviously allen relies on short to medium throws but those work best when you can throw deep i just have questions im not declaring rivers or allen a bust
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks to injuries in his rbbc though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,very good points i think having a good option in this situation will take away from him i would agree with you in a lot of other situations i just dont trust obj attitude i could see him pull a dez bryant and complain if he doesnt get x number targets every game so on and so forth obj is very talented i just feel like a lot of pieces have to add up just right for him to be effective and it is a little to risky a scenario for me let alone a new hc and system that is yet to be seen how it will workout i think this will be the prove it year for me personally on obj he has some competition new system he needs to react to
fantasyfootball,not_removed,even without jordy yrds and tds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if he repeats hell be a bust even at that adp bust of the year is probably out of reach though lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as he should be theyve already said hes sitting this year captain siemian is much more likely to get playing time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in the same boat with reed as a potential keeper off waivers but if the lower leg injuries arent concerning enough hes already had concussions within months and within weeks for some perspective wes welker has had concussions not good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ones patellar tendon connects their kneecap patella to their tibiahas nothing to do with the foot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i miss spoke pateallar tendon knee
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dj had his first start in week is that really a knock on him though when he finished the year as the rb at least in my league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,zeke has none he has nfl sample size dj has a whole year even early on when he got touches he was producing im not saying djs sample size is huge but it exists and is pretty consistent zeke is a complete enigma till he actually touches a ball in the nfl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,teams will be selling out to stop the run ill have to check the tapestats but i believe teams were already doing that by the end of last season including teams in that tough division he may not be the topscoring rb but i would be absolutely shocked if he doesnt return value over the course of the full season based on volume and tdproduction alone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,while i agree with this logic the rams play division teams very well its the rest of the league they shit the bed against
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they never gave backups real work during that time and the schedule was absolutely brutal washington is more of a passing downcomplimentary back they did want another rb to pair with latavius but that doesnt matter if theres nobody on the roster who will challenge him for early down work
fantasyfootball,not_removed,latavius did start to fade at the end of last year and the raiders were openly looking to upgrade at rb this offseason i think this would be more damaging if they started giving the back ups more work or if they acquired a guy who could seriously challenge him for early down work and they did neither
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the whole team faded really though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brees does love his tes though that being said im not that big on fleener either though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree there i hadnt realize they were both going so high my guess is both have been raised because they are receiving a lot of sleeper talk and we are encroaching on that time when sleepers become nonsleepers because everyone knows about them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eh fleener in the is maybe just a bit too high but even if he does bust thats not nearly high enough of a pick for him to be the biggest bust of the year round picks bust every single year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fair but my point is that the chargers are way more likely to be better and healthier this year than last
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rivers had tds and over yards in the games that allen was healthy screw age and arm strength
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and he proved hes way better than the other two guys tons of nfl players get their start cuz of injury but the good ones keep the jobs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,right at the beginning of the year he was still doing so well with absolutely no one to throw to cobb cant play as a for the life of him he thrives as a
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i see him all the time on this sub name is pretty easy to recognize and i swear everything he posts is just shitposts ive seen him make maybe a few serious posts but even those are rarely backed up with any analysis or statistics usually just him saying a player is good or bad not sure why hes still around
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes because this comment is a huge contribution as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah it just sucks because same as welker the talent is absolutely there the games i could start reed i was never worried minus him getting injured hate to say it but id rather gamble on late round fliers on guys like gates or fleener they are unlikely to be anywhere as good when healthy but at least the risk is far less
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jeremy hill blew every other rb out of the water at the end if and was mediocre at best last year small sample size man ya just never know till they do it for a few years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in a sense yes they did but i still dont trust it completely plus when was the last time a rams rb was good for more than year in a row
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that is the tendency but he still worries me a bit cant say i wouldnt take him in the right spot though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it is a huge mistake to think that someone wont lose carries because everyone else on the roster seems to suck if someone behind them is good enough to win the job then that is an issue but coaching staffs will look anywhere to give away carries when the top dog is struggling
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i mean i like them but i would take moncrief in the round area and fleener in the round area too much hype around them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,which could mean theyd have to passforce the ball to allen less no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when was the last year chargers had a better or healthier year honestly seems like every year the start okay then crash and burn before week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i thought i remembered chris johnson showing everyone that he was the guy there before he got hurtwhich was when johnson stepped in right after he lost the starting job to an old
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there is no in a sense teams were putting in the box on every single play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well gurley is quite a bit better than zac stacytre mason so i would hope he can break the curse lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,steven jackson was a solid fantasy rb for nearly a decade even when the rams were barely winning a few games a season before him marshall faulk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it is a huge mistake to think that someone wont lose carries because everyone else on the roster seems to suck im just saying that when murray struggled last year helu didnt steal work but coaching staffs will look anywhere to give away carries when the top dog is struggling not if they dont believe the backup is more capable
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the guy screams trich with his painfully mediocre efficiency vs current valuation murray was way more efficient that richardson ever was did the raiders want to pair him with somebody sure but if it was as dire as youre making it sound they wouldnt have waited till the fifth round say goodbye to his reception totals at the very least which accounted for of his total ppr output so youre predicting that murray doesnt catch a pass next year if you dont think washington has the skillset to challenge for three down duties then i suggest you reevaluate and take a closer look i dont even dislike washington but he went in the fifth round for a reason hes undersized hasnt played in a pro style offense and has shoddy vision
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they were the second least healthy team in the league things even out in the long run so im inclined to believe it will be at least marginally better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah chris won the job over the rookie in training camp and chris did good then david did better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cja was a huge disappointment but peyton did have noodle arms
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and it worked for a lot of teams he only eclipsed yards in one game out of the last the tds saved him fantasy wise but thats not necessarily a guarantee going into this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would hope so too but im not really sold this kid can do what ap does and stays relevantproductive even if the rest of the offense is a mess
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not saying its impossible but they had a few new guys step up one year and totally disappear the next none of them were as good as gurley but still worrisome recent trend
fantasyfootball,not_removed,coaches will give it to a lot of guys and this staff has already said that they werent satisfied with his work last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think andre ellington actually won the job in campthen chris won the job by playing better than everyone in season and david johnson only started because of that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he is an elite aplike talent could be the heir to ap as the best runner in the league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not only did the raiders significantly upgrade their offensive line this offseason but the depth chart behind murray is all players whove yet to carry a significant load in an nfl offense another key thing to keep in mind is that the raiders added pieces to their defense with guys like reggie nelson sean smith and bruce irvin they will be playing from ahead more which favors murray as a running back if you want to argue draft pedigree you should not be arguing for murray whatsoever yes murray was a sixth round pick but hes obviously proven to be worth more than that washington hasnt there were running backs taken in the fifth round in the drafts two of them have stolen work from startersajayikarlos williams and the only reason they fell that far were injury and character concerns according to just running backs per year drafted in the fifth round or later have amassed even touches in their rookie season over the last years especially company that excels on passing downs washington fits the profile of a pass catcher but drops were a huge problem for him in college murray isnt a great receiver by any means but he isnt bad and his drop rate was among the lowest for running backs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why not draft gore rounds later if youre looking for a volume guy gore has the toughest schedule of all running backs murray has one of the easiest the gap between gore and fergusonturbin is smaller than the gap between murray and washingtonheluimo oakland had the best run blocking line last year according to pff but they could have the best this season osemele graded as the second bets run blocking guard gabe jackson has improved every year as a run blocker hes not priced right for how low his floor is clearly youre much higher on washington than me i guess thats where we disagree im not even that high on murray as a player if the raiders drafted elliottprosisebookerdixon id probably be targeting those guys but i think youre propping up a guy who isnt even good based on your dislike for murray rather than washingtons merit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he really didnt look like it the last games he had one big game fantasy wise the tds saved those weeks but i could see his td figures regress depending how the rams offense goes this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,something something carrie underwood legs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck fantasy football
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez

fantasyfootball,not_removed,dak can feel romos breath on his neck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beasley please
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beasley and williams owners are probably more upset at that failed connection than beasley and williams that was a huge td they just missed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,squirting through the tiniest of holes jesus christ this commentary
fantasyfootball,not_removed,literally need fucking catch between beasely or williams then i win fucking catch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck yeah i needed that td to go to anyone that wasnt zeke movin on up to playoffs not out of sight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need zeke to get about yards but no tds cause i also have philly d but most importantly fuck dallas
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eagles offense is getting predictable too many screens and short passes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this has absolutely nothing to do with this game but geronimo allison packers wr who caught a td today has this amazing tweet check out tweet

fantasyfootball,not_removed,holy shit i started playing skyrim after the first quarter beasley still has nothing hes going to be useless once romo comes back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my oppponent has philly def and my league counts return yards for dst scoring its total bullshit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is it too late for romo to suit up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the week i start beasley is when dak decides to ignore him fucking fantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wish the cowboys could finish a drive cause fuck dan bailey right now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why did they just punt didnt sturgis drill a yarder earlier
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they need to lighten these holding call rules
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i needed that dez td so fucking bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hope this goes to ot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you dez
fantasyfootball,not_removed,welp dez just got me the win sweet time for some vodka gents
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes dez so happy i traded for him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cris large hands from a large man collinsworth
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in loooooove im a beasliever
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez fade daddys feeling greedy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is ryan mathews dead
fantasyfootball,not_removed,zeke elliott looks like a cartoon chipmunk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,playing both zeke and dez down got my liquor ready if some dumb shit happens and i end up losing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,steelers on bye fantasy already wrapped up the win can sit back and watch with no anxiety
fantasyfootball,not_removed,doug pederson looks like my landlord
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lets go zeke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lets go birds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need punts to win can i do it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just traded for bryant baby what a debut
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez is back to stud status
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man how does sproles block lookit the little guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i feel bad for everyone who passed on this man cause he was a rookie
fantasyfootball,not_removed,zeke is fucking for real
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please sit alfred morris back down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,give me those dan bailey points please
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so probably another drive incoming that features sprolessmallwood more than mathews even though pederson has reiterated that mathews is their guy because mathews doesnt look like their guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mathews action
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fly eagles fly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just need yards out of mathews and im good i am so worried not sarcasm
fantasyfootball,not_removed,got my wooo now i hope he doesnt fumble the rest of the game eek
fantasyfootball,not_removed,another catchable ball dropped by matthews alshon where are you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my opponent has sproles and i have ryan matthews so of course hes having the better game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck i needed that mathews td
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you mathews
fantasyfootball,not_removed,best overall pick ever i never doubted you zeke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,need more yards from dez to win bring it home
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why not give it to zeke in that situation
fantasyfootball,not_removed,looked like he blew his knee out on that landing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i can not believe the call run you idiots
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that was a terrible decision why on earth would you throw that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats up with beasley anyone whos watching the game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not sure why i started lambo over sturgeus
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cole for fucks sake i need one point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,come the fuck on defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its all slants and wr screens yall havent figured that out yet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the eagles might have the most boring offense in the nfl nothing but off tackles runs with sproles screens and slants
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please cowboys just dump one off to beasley for yards just one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that was a sick call
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chris jones owners rejoice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why is beas hardly in the game i thought he was the slot reciever
fantasyfootball,not_removed,romo incoming week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i bet romo would have gotten those fade passes right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe its cause i lost both leagues but this baseball game is more entertaining than snf
fantasyfootball,not_removed,up with zeke and ryan mathews vs eagles d and witten my butthole is clenched
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wtf happened to ryan mathews how do you lose inside carries to sproles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lmao my opponent is down points with jordan matthews and im just looking at every catch like pls stop
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gonna rip my ears off if hear awwwwww cheveeeeeeeee again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,td to beasley coming up optimistic
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cant wait for romos return this is garbage
fantasyfootball,not_removed,squirting line works for me lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cole beasley has nothing i can still win if he can just give me something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is it just me or are hcs way too conservative with fgs these days it seems like anything over yards is just too much to ask these kickers lately unless its a game winning situation of course
fantasyfootball,not_removed,of course offensive holding with a run like that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,football would be hilarious if holding was legal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when you read this tomorrow on tmz you heard it here first ryan mathews slept with pedersons favorite aunt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez sealed my week glad to have you back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bryant is back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,motherfucking dez is back baby

fantasyfootball,not_removed,another missed dez td
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so many tos why not use zeke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,abandon the run when there was still time on the clock with all timeouts left

fantasyfootball,not_removed,httpiimgurcomgpflzddjpg
fantasyfootball,not_removed,come on bailey give me about today
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cant believe so many of you guys started beasley with dez back healthy against the eagles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lets fucking go dez and cowboys dst
fantasyfootball,not_removed,laughable to not run it in the endzone with zeke considering how well he has done tonight its like what the chargers did with melvin gordon earlier
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol dak franchise qb put romo back in next week please i need dez to be a
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i thought wins were only true in fairy tails 🎵 meant for other teams but not for mine 🎵 then i saw his catch now im a beasliever 🎵 not a trace of doubt in my mind 🎵 im in love im a beasliever 🎵 i couldnt waive him if i tried 🎵

fantasyfootball,not_removed,damnnnnn dezniel
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck yeah jordan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,prescott is certainly making the case for romo to be the starter next week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,give the ball to zeke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please dont let this one go to ot too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there he passed to beasley are you happy now dickheads
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im a beasley owner in a close match and i just screamed in frustration the middle of a bar ama
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dallas coaches are morons stop trying to make dak more than what he is you are a run first offense how do you not run the ball on and goal pathetic
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if the qb fumbles the snap and then falls on it losing yardage isnt that a sack for the defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did beasley die
fantasyfootball,not_removed,romodak
fantasyfootball,not_removed,zeke needs a celebration move other than the feed me soup motion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,let us hold hands those of us playing a defense tonight i personally need from dallas to scrap out wins it would be their highest score of the year though so not very likely
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my eagles d vs his zeke and wentz and im up by chances
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just need points from eagles defence to win

fantasyfootball,not_removed,tried to buy dez before he came back this week i shouldve tried harder
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol so glad i benched mathews if another good ww rb comes up im dropping him someone else can deal with this headache
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this offense could end up being real sick i want as many shares in zeke and dez as i can get
fantasyfootball,not_removed,could we get a play without a flag
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need a miracle defensive or st eagles touchdown but dallas looks so good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,going into this game with a point lead he still has e elliot diggs and vikings def god help me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man if ware wouldnt have gone down cmon dez be better than jordan matthews for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wtf dak
fantasyfootball,not_removed,qb is tom brady back up is russell wilson gonna drop wilson and try to pick up prescott this week bc fuck wilson man he is shitting the bed not even trade worthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need from eagles dst this is stressful
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it would be nice if the eagles let wentz throw the ball further than fucking yards down field this isnt alex smith dougie p
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is the first week all season where i dont need to worry about fantasy for snfmnf feels good i guess but i also dont care that much about the game and will probably go to bed early
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im points up but against zeke and prescott in a full defense league plz randy mcleod get all the tackles and an interception or three
fantasyfootball,not_removed,matthews lives but thats it sry guys edit jk congrats to matthews owners

fantasyfootball,not_removed,beasley hello
fantasyfootball,not_removed,great now i have to debate on dropping jordan matthews
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mmm that feel when youre up by and you got a man playing monday the correct move is to take out jordan but should i go for the insult to injury
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck that was sick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chris jones turned on the jets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cris collinsworth practically touching himself after that fake he loves dallas so much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,still cant get over dallas at the goal line and choosing not to feed elliot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the patience
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it feels like almost every time zeke touches the ball its a yard gain craziness
fantasyfootball,not_removed,give him a better ball dak
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jesus christ gotta put a little more on that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,omg what the fuck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez getting plenty of looks but dak just isnt making the play fuckkkk

fantasyfootball,not_removed,anyone else with yahoo noticed that bailey got points for that yd field goal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,anything or anything but j matthews for anything not one catch remember the titans style

fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am loving all these bryant targets though

fantasyfootball,not_removed,feed the beas
fantasyfootball,not_removed,plz dak plz another td
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i want these dez and jordan matthews points to last forever
fantasyfootball,not_removed,elliot needs more yards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,really dont understand the play calling by dallas there try to run the field and use the clock to get in range of a field goal why are they just bombing it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so is ryan mathews droppable i just want him to be someone else headache and not mine ever again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pour it on jordan pour it on all these sad owners who are facing you

fantasyfootball,not_removed,if zeke and prescott dont score a lot that would be great im winning by
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt mind more points from dez tonight then i wouldnt have to worry about my howard tomorrow night
fantasyfootball,not_removed,zeke take us to the promised land
fantasyfootball,not_removed,get fucked bailey owners
fantasyfootball,not_removed,welp id love to tell you i made the right choice after feeling skeptical about philly d this week but there they are in my starting line up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh fuck you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,god i wish that the cowboys would have drafted gurley instead of the rams
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how is he that open
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beat beasley owner by half a point thank you fantasy jesus
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes i can feel good about my decision not to start a defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sorry guys i started philly this week my bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so tomorrow itll be c meredith vs vikings d straight up go vikings
fantasyfootball,not_removed,odds that alshon gets a td or at least yards against the vikings tomorrow
fantasyfootball,not_removed,here is why dak doesnt hold a candle to romo all year hes had an hour before every pass attempt to find his receivers get even a liiiittle pressure on him and he freaks out and rushes everything
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can i just say how much i hate these little scat backs in fantasy football theyll never be startable but theyll ensure your starter doesnt get touches they exist for no other reason than to throw a wrench into your lineup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need dak to throw like tds to dez that would be excellent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,started made some trades now and couldnt be any happier with my teams outlook ros dez is backkk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,morris again is zeke hurt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,could have punched it in and ran the clock down by giving it to zeke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please jmatthews i need you more than ever
fantasyfootball,not_removed,elliot needs to go more yards and just get into field goal range the outcome of the game means nothing to me but those two things do need to happen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre all welcome i fucking dropped matthews last week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,smh why is dez vulturing tds from cole randy moss beasley
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please just let dan the goat bailey kick it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont watch a lot of cowboys but i dont see how dak could possibly keep the job over romo based on these throws
fantasyfootball,not_removed,uphoecesbrown saved my week with the dan bailey post
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id rather watch some carrie than this game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jesus they dont trust mathews to get one yard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they are one of country musics greatest treasures
fantasyfootball,not_removed,even though i won this week i concur
fantasyfootball,not_removed,close enough for me burn the witch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,plz
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre screwed dude
fantasyfootball,not_removed,congrats
fantasyfootball,not_removed,me too man me too smh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yep same here down by all i fucking need and im pretty sure i might lose
fantasyfootball,not_removed,had to pick up sanu after the montgomery news could have ended worse i guess
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats a great emergency pickup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,present
fantasyfootball,not_removed,great oline mixed with hes an animal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,best offensive line in the nfl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please dont how about yards and
fantasyfootball,not_removed,romo still has a drive in him when it is all on the line when the rookie qb goes down in the superbowl he shatters his collarbone on the and goal and they go for it on with him as much as i dont like the cowboys romo deserves his moment
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im with you lets go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,take me to the playoffs dez
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow ask and you shall receive
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he heard you fam
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there ya go lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a onehundred
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beekaying suspended for fantasy football season by goodell for domestic violence
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im biased but not involving beasley is why theyre losing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i see dez i like
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same destruction of evanslambo but im up by with my asiata against his diggs in ppr whatcha think you can pull yours off but it might be a longshot ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats just such a harbaugh move i love it haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,his facial expression is great
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love whoever is beside him wife
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not a single target
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you underestimate jerry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rex ryan doesnt coach the cowboys right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you obviously dont know bad coaches haha most of us here were smart enough to see that playing mccoy last week was an awful decision didnt stop rex from thinking otherwise
fantasyfootball,not_removed,was it a designed run if so no sack
fantasyfootball,not_removed,never penderson will try barner and smallwood then tell us mathews wasnt post game when they cant get anything on the ground
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im losing by so would be wonderful
fantasyfootball,not_removed,had to play him cause of montgomery need him and vikings d to outscore chicago d by points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sitting and waiting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,softly crying
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need about from himdown by with asiata going tomorrow
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that sounds very sexy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gratz fam
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it says theyre protected what does it say
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well alright then
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the short list of things i wouldnt do to you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drafted him overall in a team league im a cowboys fan we have the best oline and decent schedule no regrets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you own mathews
fantasyfootball,not_removed,give him hopkins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mathews is the rb matthews is the wr just a heads up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nope were gonna let dak keep making a bunch of shitty throws instead
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dunno why people hate him hes fun to listen to and i enjoy the banter between cc and al plus the dude does his homework
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same i enjoy listening to his dulcet tones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how is the remastered as good as a enb thinking about giving it another run on pc
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there you go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes he does
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre not wrong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go ahead and start drinking now edit i read that as you were playing against them youre golden ponyboy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you only need from zeke and dez youll be fine my friend
fantasyfootball,not_removed,caw caw
fantasyfootball,not_removed,havent you seen that tide commercial
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im likely going to drop mathews for hightower more upside there at least
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there is yards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there ya go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dak has only given looks to zeke and dez
fantasyfootball,not_removed,to be fair theyre a bit lacking in receivers but they make it work so i respect that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,during halftime apparently
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if he keeps winning he keeps his job
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its gonna be a really touch decision for the coaches as a cowboys fan ill be happy with either one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he really stepped up when it mattered im just happy my team has them both
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nah theyre going to let romo keep his job until he either loses it or breaks again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its nice tony romo is visiting local elementary schools
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he still put up decent ppr numbers while playing with dez
fantasyfootball,not_removed,getting too cute
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good play racking up over yards in penalties so carr had more field the sling it down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,an app that can suck your dick nbc is going to be so rich wow
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wish
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hell yeah the nbc app is my bottom bitch shes working the corner for me every night bringing me the benjamins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,where is matthews
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if its ppr you have a decent chance id say
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im playing dallas d and didnt get anything
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nope typically just idps
fantasyfootball,not_removed,usually only points for scores individual players can get return yards depending on scoringnot on by default
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont put that evil on me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats basically how it was at the beginning of the season and it was infuriating
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i can feel the beasley owners glaring at you right now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,da dada da da dada da da dada da da dada da
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ouch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez should have about three tonight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please clap
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think so i read that sacks can only occur on passing plays and a play is considered a run play until the quarterback actively looks for someone to pass it to
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think its just a negative rush
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yep i feel like a zorostyle sword z would be cool
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you better start drinking and praying
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sorry for your loss
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id rather be you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,traded howard for dez and i feel fantastic
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same but needed feels bad man haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,need philly d to go into maximum overdrive right now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kiss my sister
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fumbles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he gets them all at the red zone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,because he fumbled a lot in the past few weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes in a rbbc
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hahahahaha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hellohellohello is there anybody in there just nod if you can hear me beasley are you home
fantasyfootball,not_removed,at least try to trade him first unless youre playing in a pretty shallow league hes better than waiver wire fodder
fantasyfootball,not_removed,unless you play in a shallow league no way should he be dropped in any ppr format at this point in the year there really shouldnt be a lot of reliably productive wrs out on the wire
fantasyfootball,not_removed,leave him in if total points tiebreakers mean anything in your league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if youre up keep him in you never know when the total points for stat will come into play for playoff seeding the only time to pull him would be if its a close matchup and youre concerned about a player usually dst finishing with a negative score losing you the week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez that was all daks fault
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hell i hope he gets you more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,only on even weeks not sure how bye factors in though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nope needs or so more maybe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id say pretty good odds cutler wont look anywhere else
fantasyfootball,not_removed,darren sproles should be doing years right now for the straight cold blooded murder of shady mccoy in chip kelly was an accomplice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i mean yeah definitely sucks from a fantasy perspective but they exist because in real life they can be effective
fantasyfootball,not_removed,make that please
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is this the first cowboys game you have watched this year its actually surprising morris took this long to get a drive normally he gets every drive or so
fantasyfootball,not_removed,his gf is
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there ya go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,upvotes for the sarcasm
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theyre winning with him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how was bailey available hes one of the elite tier kickers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mike fisher you lucky prick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pick up marshawn lynch trust me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theyre keeping him for fresh legs half right right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah he was easily the best option standard though so not quite as valuable especially with dez back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,deal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no dice best i can do is yds tds and a fumble
fantasyfootball,not_removed,giants fan here romo definitely deserves his moment
fantasyfootball,not_removed,asiata does probably have the td advantage no ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes if he can be average that would be fantastic
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah thats his wife
fantasyfootball,not_removed,only reason i can think of is dak cant see his short ass
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nah he got one target it was a woefully low pass ugh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,balls he put his account on private cant really blame him lmao heres his tweet httpimgurcomucuvdbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pretty much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a texans fan dont give wentz hopkins give hopkins wentz
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill take michaels and collinsworth over fucking phil simms any day of the week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol im definitely making that my new nickname
fantasyfootball,not_removed,outsiders reference ftw
fantasyfootball,not_removed,on the one hand hes a starting rb on the other he gets used more like hes a damn backup ill probably bail on him this week i just dont get what the fuck happened to him in philly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,since he isnt playing he has a lot of free time to give back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im and winning by do me the favor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre a fucking thief well done
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its a man cut to top it might be relevant actually
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have dez on both my teams and dezdak on my money league team i need a big game from them both the more tds the better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats irrelevant because they arent winning because of him thats like saying the pats wouldve stuck with jimmy g had he stayed healthy because they were winning with him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,was just saving him for that td run nice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like this fella
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats fucking gold right there i am fucking shitting thats the god damn sex number and he just tweeted it out for everyone to see
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think if any dallas starter is a candidate to sit for most of the snaps itll be dez to avoid re aggravating that back injury just my opinion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bench
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the funniest thing is the first two comments saying bench and start
fantasyfootball,not_removed,start
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this isnt even a question bench
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and this gentlemen is why we finish our fantasy seasons in week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,will cole beasley playbe worth a start
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id steer clear owned him all year and hes been always questionable all these small injuries i wouldnt be surprised if they rest this guy so hell be for the playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,complete unknown until gameday my gut feel is dez plays a half if dak and zeke play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a cowboys fan i think dez will run a few routes in the first half before sitting the second half i think theyll want to rest his back and not risk injury however that being said it would not surprise me at all if he caught a td pass or got some good yardage on those snaps before going out they look for him in the rz whether dak or tony and he catches it often so yes he wants to play and yes hell probably get restedsat at some point but whether he pulls in yards and a td first is just tbd
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pick up butler he should see a lot of work and runs a lot of deep routes sanchez and romo can sling it down field
fantasyfootball,not_removed,start him at qb in place of dak
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bench
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i totally agree given the lock the cowboys have and absolutely no need to win the game i expect to see the b team throughout most of it there really is no sense in risking these guys missing a playoff game by getting an injury in a meaningless game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drop so your opponent starts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and by bench you mean drop
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this jj made a note to say he wasnt going to start dak because he didnt want him playing behind a backup oline so odds are more starts are going to be benched than just dak and zeke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and i upvoted both to help the indecisive redditors on who they should start
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i only up voted start because my opponent is starting both dak and dez against me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats even funnier is bench is top comment with and bench is bottom comment with reddit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats not funny
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah there are undoubtedly waiver wire wide receivers i would play over dez personally im starting inman over him for instance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but then fantasy would be over already i dont like it when fantasy is over more than i dont like a fucky week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i see both sides of arguments about whether or not to play in week yes it does suck to have one of your best players rest im in a game where i have zeke but he has brown and id almost rather be in his position cause idk how much work zeke is gunna get but playing in week shows skill as a player as well in my league of years this is the first time weve run into an instance like this and we had a discussion on whether or not to change the format we decided to keep it the way it is mostly due to the season long variabilities that occurs are way more drastic than the chance of not playing someone due to them resting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,while we hear this very often what about this particular type of uncertainty makes it less tenable than other types of uncertainty six or seven weeks ago we didnt know whether to start dez because of health reasons so instead of starting a limiteddez we started a healthy cam meredith why does that logic not work in week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,personally i really enjoy having twoweek playoff matchups to each his own
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think dak will play the most of the no way any of them play more than a half
fantasyfootball,not_removed,come on people its a joke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,relax lucifer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i only upvoted so that they would be tied
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you should start romo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i feel your pain there time to buy squares i guess
fantasyfootball,not_removed,week is almost exclusively the only week they rest healthy players particularly the ones the nfl teams and fantasy teams have depended on all season injuries are a normal part of the game taking games off for rest is less so
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ours start week and end week like most leagues i played one this year that had a week playoff which was overkill for a team league but it still ended week week far too often sees starters rest and thats no way to have a championship game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its just not good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i upvoted the lesser one so it could be more evil i mean even
fantasyfootball,not_removed,those are both actual pieces of advice though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you are certainly entitled to your opinion that this is notnormal but that doesnt mean that it is not valid or that the results are skewed exactly the same skillset is in operation no matter what the uncertainty is caused by sometimes dez has a chance of playing the entire game because of injury sometimes he has a chance of playing well because he is facing a difficult matchup sometimes he has a chance because theyve clinched in each situation my job is the same evaluate the possibilities and the alternatives and decide where i think the most points lie ill be sitting dez this week but im not sore about it i just think that hes too risky and id rather start cam meredith in his place
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats fine with me it wasnt my joke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,one is better than the other
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think youre missing the point that the week situation is avoidable while the midseason injuries are not as far as predicting whether or not a guy will play a lot it is similar to injuries however with injuries we also have to take into account how well they will play and if they will reaggravate it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,right but you were defending it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,week championships are awesome youre missing out this is coming from a guy with bell dez on the line
fantasyfootball,not_removed,injuries are avoidable too people just dont like playing that way you could draft team rbs team wrs team qbs etc and essentially remove injury risk completely people dont do it though because its not like the real nfl and isnt fun you could eliminate the risk of a bad team beating a better team or the risk of you losing a week despite having the highest score by doing rotisserie but most people dont do it because it doesnt feel like the nfl and isnt as fun week is part of the nfl some people enjoy playing a full weeks of fantasy and some dont neither is more right than the other its just about what your owners enjoy saying another league is wrong for doing week championships is just silly especially when this situation is very rare in the previous years luck and brady were the only players to miss time in week thats players in years in our league in particular it hasnt happened in the past years this year is an anomaly with so many teams having their seeds already locked but even so youd need the championships to feature zeke bell brown or dez which isnt going to happen in every league in the first place the people clamoring about how bad week championships just arent seeing the whole picture its rare to even matter and some people just like the extra week of fantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol ok i guess youre right it was kinda funny to me dez threw a td last week and mark sanchez sucksso obviously nobody would play dez at qb even if it were possible but it was somewhat funny you know the amount of funny that caused me to accelerate air through my nasal passage i guess im in the minority all good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theyre not though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was taking that one sarcastically but admit it could go either way
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no im serious its strategy man anyone could get injured any week if baltimore beat the steelers they wouldnt be sitting imo week separates the guys who are smart and understand football from the guys who got lucky drafting a guy like dj or bell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am a huge rick and morty fanso rick and mortd
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sanduskys shower buddies hung like harambe not mine but a couple good ones ive seen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jstew is going to be the midround draft steal just like the last several years when i drafted him with that hope
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the meat train will rise again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the bane of my stewart owning existence is finally gone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good night meat prince
fantasyfootball,not_removed,runs like a block of cheese
fantasyfootball,not_removed,goodnight sweet touchdown tolbert
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and on to the next rb that will fall prey to the vulture
fantasyfootball,not_removed,noooo as a panthers fan this hurts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,your assuming carolina doesnt go rb in the draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,guy had limited picks from trades this year drafted him as his rb still did alright
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pretty sure they kept cam
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bane
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think they will stewart is a good football player but hes always nicked up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fournette is going to take the nfl by storm
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he broke stewarts back on the way out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love fournette in the right situation carolinas oline would need to stay healthy for him to work there they were pretty crap for a good chunk of last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i only need points from vikings dst no big feat or anything
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rudolph to get
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez made my monday miracle obsolete 🙌🙌🙌🙌
fantasyfootball,not_removed,missed field goals by blair walsh totally possible right

fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need sam bradford to get more than pts thats all if he does ill get my first win of the season in this league if not i go to the watery grave that is
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if asiata could just get negative that would be great
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for all of us that need the vikings d tonight let us bow our heads in prayer hail cutler full of shit blessed art thou amongst turnovers thy gun be slung they picks be thrown on first as it is on third and give us this day our daily sacks and throw not to your receivers but to those who receive against you and lead the bears not into points but deliver points against them amen

fantasyfootball,not_removed,have two leagues ppr down points with kyle rudolph left to play and my opponent with zero players left to play barring injury i think rudolph should be just fine and be able to score at least points definitely in the playoff hunt here and need the win standard scoring down points my opponent has no one left to play and i have jordan howard and kyle rudolph since its standard scoring im not very confident here if howard and rudolph can get tds between them i think ill be in good shape but i cant count on them combining for yards im doing horribly in this league so there are no playoff implications here lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well i guess im completely fucked because it doesnt look like anyone else is relying on adam thielen points in a ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,had ty montgomery in at rb and my only substitution when i found out the news about the illness was jordan howard also have kyle rudolph and vikings d hopefully howard rudolph vikings d can score points

fantasyfootball,not_removed,need at least from them and rudolph together tomorrow heres hoping
fantasyfootball,not_removed,from the min dstand i own the tie breaker its in the bag fam
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive seen the bears give up sacks before throw in a pick six or two and were good to go my team is fucking stacked with brees jjones evans demarco bell and crabtree and im still only at points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need to winor less
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you got this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need rudolph to score more than asiata plausible yet heartbreaking
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he did that for me then witten brought it right back now i need out of min d
fantasyfootball,not_removed,delete delete delete
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he gave me my first win in weeks thank god hes back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if it was anyone else id say no but blair just maybe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oooooooh thatd be nice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats doable
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need rudolp to not get points and for diggs to leech all the targets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,or yards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i could get on board with this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lets make it and call it good yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need nearly the same ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need from rudolph which is fine because hes going to score
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i only need from him but would have no problem if he got you what you needed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how do you go in weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i tell you what buddy i think youre going to get your first win and if you dont ill get you a month of gold sound good remind me tomorrow night good luck btw keep your fingers crossed that asiata gets points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,less than is my magic number
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need asiata to get about tree fiddy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,simply need him to get less than points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im up against jeffrey in ppr so you can have exactly points no more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am hoping that jeffery and cutler connect but vikings def is gonna be tough
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need in standard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks to that last dak throw i now need from asiata 😭
fantasyfootball,not_removed,were mortal enemies tomorrow cutler needs more points then asiata for me to win my matchup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need almost the same thing i have asiata and i need points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,need pts from him bc philly d shit the bed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill need that and barth held to gl to us
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i only need from asiata thats reasonable right goddammit for not starting eifert over walker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need asiata to stay under tell me it can happen lie to me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need diggs to score less than points my opponent had an ia and a bye player in i have four of the top rbs what is happening
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i mean if there was any combination of fantasy relevant players that id want to have to go against in that situation its diggs and asiata diggs last games in standard scoring have yielded and point asiata has had and so i mean assuming diggs drops another score and asiata drops something in the rangethis is the biggest stretch of them all but yards no tds doesnt sound that outlandish meredith isnt gonna need a monster game to make it work you also gotta figure that even though cutty has traditionally loved to throw exclusively to ajeffrey he definitely had to have taken notice when hoyer had a ton of success throwing to meredith i cant imagine hes gonna give meredith anything less than like targets unless alshon is just balling the fuck out and alshons gonna probably have his rhode closed or whatever so yeah i dont know why i even did all the mental gymnastics to try to comfort a random stranger ff player but i really do think you have a better shot than you think i think im actually gonna have this stupid situation in mind tommorow when i watch the game i needa know if the homie funkydrummer came through or not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,very doable good luck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need points from jeffery ppr no yardage bonuses pls cutler throw to alshon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hopefully youll win because cutler is going to throw everything to meredith
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont know bradford loves throwing to rudolph even against teams that have top te defense im a diggs owner too i hope bradford would look at diggs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,considering rudolph is bradfords favorite red zone target that could be more difficult than expected
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in exactly the same boat lets go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that one will be close but youre the likely dog
fantasyfootball,not_removed,watched that movie yesterday and it scared the crap out of me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im up with his rudolph left so hopefully not good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in ppr hes had game with less than with that said im up with his kyle rudolph left bears defense take my energy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i believe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need from him too same reasons screw injury news j brown and enunwa on the bench flip flopped over getting sanu and went patterson rip
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just need them to get less than so ill be pulling for you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,truthfully i do too about from ass and from minn good luck though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill take your luck for from the two of them but hopefully they go for
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill hop on this wonder train
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in the exact same position as you good luck to you friend
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes either getting less than or
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need yards and a td im gonna give my boy cutler a call
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think he could get i need i think yards and a touchdown isnt crazy to think possible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need asiata vikings d to combine for pts with my opponent starting zach miller hoping for a shutout with asiata tds and at least two dst scores my team needs this so bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need the same bears pass d take my energy as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gill was decent for sure put up good points but i think asiata will feast ever moreso
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck it keep tuck and take this week as an l
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you got this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ouch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you have a non money league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my friend league is currently being dominated by auto drafted teams not drafted by a computer or anything since we do a paper draft but by everyone present apparently everyone at the draft picking teams by committee made some great teams
fantasyfootball,not_removed,likely bc i need asiata to go off which means he will run alllllll over da bears
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so you mean youll be down when their ds points kick in better hope barkley and the bears tear up the vikings duh oh haha i lost too man oh well theres next week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre done
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why would you drop crowder for josh gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need from him lets fucking do this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mhm i last minute benched him for adams i had so much faith in bradford after week i watched that game and he just looked so confident and legit dont know what happened
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i mean chances arent great but if any defense were gonna do it id take the vikes hope for a shutout two pick tds and sacks or something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id say pretty damn good especially in standard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i say patterson if he plays i was considering him but i played witten my second thought after patterson would be royal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was in this exact same scenario i was down pretty heavily around pm when the out notification came was in poor reception and pulled montgomery just in time i had to choose between c patt and benjamin and because i was tracking badly ty i went the patt for the possibility of an explosive game cause that aint coming out of benjamin i rallied nicely and now im ahead by and its cpatt vs alshon cpatt is probably the only person on that list who has the potential to get you if you just want to say hey i only lost by take thielen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just dropped him i doubt he gets carey the new ruler in town
fantasyfootball,not_removed,need here lol fml
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youll be fine in order for a defense to even get negative points they have to give up points the bears havent scored points all year even against a colts d that was starting its and best cbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yards and catches confirmed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if he doesnt play youll have a chance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,vikings d is on another level thye will pick cutler off times before alshon gets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not really he should be a bonafide lead back this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,alshon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that is entirely possible considering how diggs has been playing recently jordy put up against that same secondary last week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,easy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jordan howard rushing tds confirmed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youve had worse odds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can you only pick one i would probably go diggs bears have been generous to opposing wideouts this year rudy would be a close second
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in the same boat except i am up by creepy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eagles are still at in my standard espn league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im up by and my opponent has miller let us pray
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you and me both i need asiata and diggs to not outscore him by
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well fuck you too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i need vikings d to beat alshon by in ppr maybe our juju hopes can combine to make it happen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you should bench vikings d for the fun of it bwahahaha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,to be fair if alshon goes off for the vikings d will probably already be at points because thats a beast mode game plus some tds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im feeling it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,had my shit wrapped up until witten caught the game winner now i need we can do it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats probable
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well it is cutler
fantasyfootball,not_removed,replace minnesota d with kyle rudolph and youre me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats plausible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,need we got this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats the buy in for your league if its free id never cheer for fantasy over real life if its a steep buy in then id take the money
fantasyfootball,not_removed,me too but i need the dst to outscore asiata by its not impossible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you can bench your player but keep in mind your tiebreaker for the playoffs at the end of the season i think total points for is the default tiebreaker in most leagues would suck to miss the playoffs because of the points you should have gotten but decided to bench
fantasyfootball,not_removed,asssiataaa
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youll be ok
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they havent scored less than all season and the bears arent good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank god hes black
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sammy sleeves got him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my only poor excuse is that ive lost so many times ive forgotten what my record is p
fantasyfootball,not_removed,less than yards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,more points then asiata than mortal enemies indeed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youve given me hope bless you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it cant happen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you get carrd
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lets make it an even whaddya say boys im fucked
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh dude every throw to meredith or vikings d
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sigh i benched riddick because he was just coming off injury and my texans were supposed to be stout against passing backs lol ran james white insteadfml
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah mine was drafted by an unbiased third party taco i currently only have two of the original drafted players rostered in crabtree and isaiah crowell the good part is we only have player benches so bye weeks and injuries lead to some decent waiver pickups
fantasyfootball,not_removed,deserved it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and if anyone could throw two pick itd be cutler right haha at least the game will be interesting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,itll be close i think
fantasyfootball,not_removed,or that the last game was diggs first back from injury and now he is a full go again heres to him playing lights out for the next weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for combined yards and fumbles please
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we got this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as they should be yds allowed pts allowed pts int sacks total
fantasyfootball,not_removed,does your league count forced fumbles as
fantasyfootball,not_removed,heres to asiata being an every down back and miller blocking that min dst every snap
fantasyfootball,not_removed,works for me lets do this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,should i bench them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wont be picky
fantasyfootball,not_removed,here i have faith
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it is but defenses always make me nervous because you just never know what to expect
fantasyfootball,not_removed,picks sacks and garbage time touchdowns
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they can win and still have their d get less than im betting hes cheering for that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its only and i def agree like i wont be sad if we destroy cutler by
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats your team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you for the response really appreciate it with this win ill move to actually
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nice i need this win in a team league but most points scored its bullshit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fewer than yards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if he fails now ill know its because of that typo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oppnonent had brady forte and kelce points right there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do we though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no your math in the other comment is exactly how my league has the eagles at
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt bench them unless you just want to mess with your opponent and itll let you razz them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the lions cries
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fewer than feet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have faith
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ah me too by the end of the season im usually cheering for fantasy over them i at least have a chance to win a championship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its miller time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im really surprised to not see pittsburgh on this list given how often their offense is discussed thanks op
fantasyfootball,not_removed,would you mind telling me where you got this data from just in case i want to use it as a reference at a later time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all those cleveland rush attempts were tough to watch but that does boost crowells stock to me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,key word attempts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lot of typos in this list why did you leave out most pass heavy teams
fantasyfootball,not_removed,houston under obrien has ranked and in rushing attempts small sample size but theyre on the right side of the bell curve
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes hes someone ill definitely be keeping an eye on will be posting rb projections in the coming weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes i was surprised as well but lets not confuse volume with efficiency either pittsburgh was one of the most efficient offenses in the league roethlisburger completed of his passes last season for about yards per attempt thats one of the highest in the league he trailed only carson palmer who had yards per attempt some of the teams above are high volume offenses as a matter of need they threw often because they were trailing and needed to catch up arizona and pittsburgh werent in the top but they were definitely in the tops for efficiency will be posting more as im breaking down the s
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its a new regime you should look at how much jacksons offenses run not now much cleveland ran last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if youd like to help me correct typos thatd be appreciated please send me a revised draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes stated multiple times to be a run first team im pretty content with those two rbs getting the opportunities
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i bet he gets held out of preseason altogether
fantasyfootball,not_removed,leveon bell expects to be ready to sit on the bench for the preseason game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh man i just got the pick for my league either way brown or bell is mine
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im a bengals homer so i hope the both go early if i get a later pick if he drops to fifth or later im basically forced to get him or be a total idiot so hope that adp stays high
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please rest him i really want to see what this offense can do clicking on all cylinders for a whole season so pissed bryant went and fucked things up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ leveon take my energy ༼ つ ◕◕ ༽つ
fantasyfootball,not_removed,leveon bell can expect to be drafted by ukwicks in the first god damn round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,after an injury like that i dont see why preseason would be a goal at all he can do without it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,where does he go this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i cant be the only one whos starting to get really scared of bell right i mean even if hes healthy in week are they really gonna force feed him the ball when they have deangelo who has shown to be a more than capable replacement
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mrankings list is going to change with the great leveon sidelined rest up good fellow you shall be rejuvenated by week gaining the most rushing yards in all the land
fantasyfootball,not_removed,waitisnt he suspended for at least two games though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,never was a fan of bell he has talent but thats exactly why i dont like him hes fearless thats why he takes huge hits hed have to drop to late first or early second for me he wont though plus coming off a knee injury
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes yesvery good the league will be mine this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,throw in a one day at a time in there somewhere
fantasyfootball,not_removed,carry yards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed not much to gain by putting him in the last preseason game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cant wait to find out my draft position
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you should go with brown in that scenario
fantasyfootball,not_removed,david johnson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if he drops to fifth there are five idiots in front of you i think your safe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mguess is that king ladarius shall fill the void of sir bryant who has fallen on his own sword
fantasyfootball,not_removed,your account reminds me of this guys hilarious review of this board game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,serious question i thought he was in trouble for a drug test he diddidnt take or was that last season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i read he wants to protect himself more this year i think he learned that his fearlessness was a liability in certain situations
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well last year when he got injured in the bengals game he was tackled awkwardly by two players at once not really his fault it was just an awkward hit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ypc for the season you say
fantasyfootball,not_removed,except getting back to full speed not only physically but mentally no amount of practice prepares you for full speed nfl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well if bell goes first i will the guy with the first pick is the biggest steelers fan i know so its one or the other
fantasyfootball,not_removed,second overall nope
fantasyfootball,not_removed,four idiots
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if he drops to there would only be idiots in front of him if he passes then hed be the idiot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i dont think he will but its literally my nightmare so i hope he gets better i hate not liking watching my players do well haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i actually forgot ladarius joined the steelers and im a steelers fan he could be a nice sleeper te this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,or markus wheaton he was really starting to hit a nice stride at the end of last season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this my favorite account right now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,last season no suspension this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for a conversion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think the risk is worth the reward deangelo has proven to be able to shoulder the workload if he plays in the game i would be surprised
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr or non ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,first overall blud
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes looking in a mirror hes the fifth
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id rather take a wr in the top half of round than a rb brown juilio and odell are just too valuable
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i always thought he was gonna replace gates but that dude just wont quit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks for the heads up i will keep this in mind when drafting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,half im in a perfect spot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,with only of total team carries expected nah
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theres a trade war waging on in my league right now several people want the number one spot brown has made every single championship game weve had and hes guaranteed ticket to the big show the first pick is a steelers fan but hes willing to deal second pick gets either bell or brown third pick probably gets odb so many offers are flying the second pick wont budge he likes the cards he has in front of him lucky bastards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,adrian peterson only had of his teams carries in when he ran for yards demarco murray was still only at in when he had almost carries tmyk edit and for good measure rushing leader lesean mccoy had over carries but just under of his teams total
fantasyfootball,not_removed,by expected you mean blurbed about by beat writers not the team you cant tell the future
fantasyfootball,not_removed,haha that sounds intense i think might be the perfect spot this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ap was coming off a severe acl tear they arent gonna give him a full table of carries murrays of carries is a lot more than that can be up to difference which is massive and shadys carries were on a significantly faster offense than arians cardinals david johnson will be very very good worth a first round pick but id take bell gurley and elliott before him not ap though regression city
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre right could be better than could also be worse than
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im low key working on a deal to get third pick after the first two are set some monkey in my league wants first overall to draft odb if he doesnt get it im moving up to third to take him there if he does move up no way in hell i can get third pick cause then its bellbrown price skyrockets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the point is that hearing a ballpark of and using it as a knock is ridiculous hardly anyone in the nfl is ever above that range theres a perception that you need carries to be a fantasy stud and thats just not true the murray example is proof that even if you get carries you still probably wont hit that mark
fantasyfootball,not_removed,doug martin it was a contract year so thats part of it of course but the difference between last year and the year before was absurd he ran so hard watch the highlight tapes and youll see he bumped off guys on every run and shed tackles like ap he looked quicker and stronger than ever before
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah after leveon bells rookie season they said he lost like pounds or something before the preseason so i held onto him in my keeper league despite the injuries hes been money when he plays
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in my opinion it is way more significant when its a rb especially if they are on the heavier side
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if this is in regards to eddie lacydraft him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it depends on where they are starting at if they are lean to begin with and shed some pure muscle they will probably gain some acceleration and shiftiness but lose power and the net gain wont be that big if they like lacy are simply overweight and lose fat they can gain a lot in the second case it also indicates a shift in mentality being overweight while training multiple hours a day is very hard it generally means a player has an atrocious diet and poor work ethic if a guy decides to shed the fat its a sign that he is taking the game more seriously which can translate to big improvements
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lamar miller but on of muscle last year and crushed it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,marshawn dropped like when he came to seattle
fantasyfootball,not_removed,leveon bell lost like lbs before his year and it was actually pretty helpful
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it did for year leveon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not always better shape just means you can stay on the field longer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont focus on a players weight loss focus on their production ly the offseason changes in their teams offense any changes in the coaching staff and their schedule their weight loss should be a minimal factor in your draft decision keep in mind i didnt say that weight loss shouldnt be factored at all just not your main focal point when drafting a player you can use it to your advantage pick the player up in a later round thinking he may be more productive this year though it shouldnt be the determining factor in drafting a player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,contract year wasnt a part of it since thats been proven to not be a factor in performance but still gets brought up here way too often
fantasyfootball,not_removed,deangelo williams leveon bell doug martin to name a few on the other side of the equation of guys who gained weight and struggled ray rice trent richardson eddie lacy so yes it does translate to performance on a side note lacy lost weight this offseason
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there were tons of reports coming out of bucs training camp that he looking in better shape than ever it panned out for people who paid attention
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol nobody looks like ap when ap is playing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he wasnt bad his rookie season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you dont think some receiver should lose
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my main worry is that lacy seems like the guys that doesnt give a fuck and is gonna go home and eat his moms home cooking anyways or just get drunk and go to taco bell at in the morning i just dont see him keeping the weight off all season even if it does help him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i cant tell if youre serious or not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lamar miller gained and ran a at at even if hes running a hes still pretty damn fast
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it definitely was that and his health after his rookie year he was plagued with bullshit up until last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed but dougie sure did do his best imitation he didnt do as well once he got into open space because he just doesnt have the top end speed he could have easily had another touchdowns last year if it werent for getting chased down by safeties after a yd run every part of aps game is beastly but watching him work the field once he breaks out is like watching michelangelo paint its beautiful
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes never bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agree he wasnt bad op said underperformed and for a rb who had the lions share of carries id say he underperformed his rookie season he didnt break out until after the weight loss but honestly his success could be due to a year of nfl experience under his belt and the steelers oline just as much as losing some weight unfortunately eddie lacy and his weight loss pals dont have the rookie excuse but well see
fantasyfootball,not_removed,his yardsattempt his rookie season were actually lower than trent richardsons his rookie season the popular hype on leveon after his rookie year was that he wasnt very good on a per attempt basis and just like richardson he owed his productivity to the volume of work he received the next season he supposedly slimmed down and the hype when he dominated that second season was that the yard per attempt increase was due to increased mobility and quickness i dont know that were qualified to definitively settle the validity of those two lines of thought but they were popular and they did exist
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nah im cool with httpsenwikipediaorgwikiantoniobrown staying
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lamar miller killed it last season when he got the opportunity criminally underused but after his slow start he rarely produced less than his point day saved me the week i accidentally started maclin on a concussion and a kicker on a bye he finished just out of the top but considering how bad his first or so games were thats tremendous pace lotta miller hate on this sub last season bc he was drafted high and appeared to bust but if you were paying attention last season lamar miller was a stud
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it definitely was not as again contract year has been proven to be a myth just like far too many things spouted on here as fact
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed but wasnt the question about a guy who wasnt good becoming good after losing weight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he was drafted middle of the second between bernard and lacy i think he performed right about where he was expected to perform him having the jump the next year was a nice bonus i dont think it could be considered a bounce back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lmao you played a kicker on a bye and a guy who was ruled out before the game started then lamar miller of all people scored fucking points to get you a win thats why i fucking hate fantasy football i bet the guy playing you was pissed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had him all season trust me i was paying attention the part that i worry about is that people act as if carries is some magic number there were a few games where he got like carries and did nothing i like the guy i think hes talented and i think hell be an rb this year no more no less but i do think hes a streaky player and when hes on hes on but when hes off hes off
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i didnt reply to the main thread lol i dont think this is a very common thing if anything it just shows you hit the gym more and get more prepared thats always good as an athlete
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre right and maybe it wasnt the best to drop bells name as a bounce back perhaps the best way to phrase it would be a player who showed significant improvement after being reported to lose weight which isnt exactly what op was looking for but i think its relevant jumping from a ypc to is a big freaking jump from one year to the next as others have said though losing weight should be one of those interesting little accolades that you remember going into the draft but hopefully has no sway on draft strategy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the kicker was a calculated move i have very limited bench in one league and had a short term injury and was not going to drop a player had a solid kicker too i think i had just snagged mcmanus so didnt want to lose him maclin was my fault he was a game time decision but a likely start i went to work and was going to check his status before the games then adjust we got slammed at work and i totally forgot about checked scores around and it was a close game now that im remembering it miller helped he really did but i dont think he had he maybe had just a regular great day jarvis landry saved me that week juice went off i renamed my team jarvis landry just to piss off the guy i beat he was furious obviously edit nope it was miller httpiimgurcomhsfeemnjpg
fantasyfootball,not_removed,philbins offense really did so little for him hopefully houston can utilize him better hes got the talent imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah hes pretty good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,top is a stretch cant put him above dj zeke or bell hes just behind murray imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gordon is a top rb the rest of season in my opinion thats actually not as crazy as people may think if everyone is healthy david johnson demarco murray leveon bell ezekiel elliott and melvin gordon are all in the conversation for the top again if healthy i think david johnson will likely be the top rb rest of the season i think you could argue that murray may lose some fantasy points to derrick henry elliott being a rookie could potentially run out of steam and the absence of big ben could hurt bells fantasy value a little bit gordon is in the perfect situation there really wont be anyone challenging him for playing time he is involved in the passing game in spite of any concerns about his yardspercarry he will get the volume to make up for that and has a pretty decent schedule going forward hes not a lock for a top finish the rest of the way but it shouldnt be surprising if he does
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would say gordon proved he is a highend fantasy today there have been a lot of critics saying his ypc is low and he is dependent on tds but today he got me in ppr with no tds i do have him so im biased but him still putting up those numbers in denver puts him in top ros contention also today the chargers ran passing plays on a and goal needtoscore quarter drive a lot of people are giving coach mccoy flack for bad playcalling not letting gordon run it not sure what this means for the future but gordon is already getting volume and the fan want more him being the feature back when so many other teams are in committee makes his situation alone pretty valuable i think ros he is probably below dj zeke and bell fantasy wise but those are the only rbs i would trade him for pure speculation i think coach mccoy is going to get fired sometime soon somewhat in relation to todays goal line play calling
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he is an but top would mean he is ahead of either dj zeke or bell i cant justify that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,top for sure
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont understand why people doubted him even if he only averages ydscarry hes the only one getting work in this day and age thats all you need to be a top rb toss in a touchdown here and there some games hes more efficient you have yourself a top rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,butbutypc
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he became a top back as soon as danny woodhead went down week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,glad to feel a bit vindicated after catching some heat suggesting people target him in drafts he doesnt need to be the best running back to be a good fantasy running back though i actually think hes improving and if you watch games his line does not give him a lot to work with most plays hit in the back field a lot opportunity isnt necessarily greater than talent for fantasy production but its a damn big factor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats a whole lot of words to simply give his basic stat lines for the past two seasons
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes leading the league in touchdowns who the fuck was doubting him in the first place
fantasyfootball,not_removed,melvin gordon is not a great football player is not the same as melvin gordon is not a quality fantasy football starter also not top ros
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive said this before if you have him this season he seems to be touchdown dependent the broncos run d is not the best so his performance doesnt surprise me but against better teams he will need a td to be relevant when danny woodhead is back next year those tds will more than likely disappear hes going to be great this year but next year he will definitely regress in a big way
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes only benefiting because of woodhead being out for the season that opened up a lot of opportunity for him with opportunity no matter how bad you are you will get points by default as far as football talent is concerned hes no where in the elite category if i did a redraft id take zeke murray bell freeman and a few others before him having said that were all lucky to have him on our team it took woodheads injury to give him workhorse duties without that hes the same rb from last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so sell high on melvin gordon right gotcha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely time to sell highshould probably sell high on dj and bell too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he gets the touchdowns because he plays in a very good pass oriented offense hes not a great football player but he is a good fantasy player and was very fortunate to have woodhead out so early in the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a gordon owner he is definitely not a top rb not even close first off dj bell zeke and murray are all clearly better than him then you got guys like mccoy miller and others who are probably better and comparable at the least
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont see why this post was necessary at all who was doubting him hes a pass catching back in a good offense without anyone threatening his job opportunity work load is all there again who was doubting him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just traded freeman for him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank god for this insightful post otherwise no one could have possibly known
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but is leveon going to over take him in scoring after missing the first games he very well may end up being top as crazy as that sounds but youre right dont see him overtaking dj or zeke murray is a toss up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,postbye shady i think is also in that conversation
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just imagine if gordon had that extra points on his stat line this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we are forgetting about demarco murray who is just raging this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you missed this part gordon is a top rb the rest of season in my opinion this is not the point of the thread he is basically saying gordon is a lock for being a top back and people thinking he was fringe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kinda depends on what kind of league your in doesnt it idk about standard scoring but in ppr he is ahead of zeke if you look at actual points scored the list would be dj murray gordon zeke bell now obviously thats not fair to zeke and especially bell because the games played for seke is compared to and the games played for bell is compared to but if you look at average pointsweek in ppr the list goes dj bell murray gordon zeke i am not saying mg ends up top for sure but with his situation this year it isnt a far reach to say he could either way like you said he is a and thats all that really mattesr when you get down to what this sub cares about haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes my after bell and dj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the arguments i heard were if you take away his last tds or if you take away those last big runs hes just a mediocre rb or hes only that good because of woodhead seems like too many people reading stats listening to ffb podcasts rather than watching the actual game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,people doubted him because they didnt think he would take over woodheads passcatchingif woodhead was available or someone else stepped up to the past catching roll we wouldnt be having this conversation about himthe amount of carries hes receiving each week is fantastic and his goal line work is beyond anyone else in the leaguehes still not a good back overall but the position hes in this season makes him better than almost anyone else in the league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,butbut if you ignore his past rushing tds and ignore all those big runs he had hes just a mediocre player on a mediocre team should we sell now high fam s
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ypc td dependent unsustainable all things i see on here every week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes still the ony rb in games to put up yards against the broncos points in ppr without a td and he had a td catch called back on an iffy pick penalty against gates thays points if gates just puts his hands up and acts like hes expecting the pass
fantasyfootball,not_removed,exactly thats why people still doubt him and a lot of people dont understand whyhes not going to be at the goal line as much next year and he certainly wont be catching passesand hell potentially lose up to touchessure hes amazing in fantasy this year who wouldnt be in his positionbut calling him a top running back absolutely insane fantasy he will be but overall absolutely not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but dont sell him because woodhead is out and hes putting up elite numbers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes like you said hes the same scoring rb as last year damn some people are so salty we need the mods to tag this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so guys are clearly better and maybe two more that sounds like he is actually pretty close to top
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a gordon owner he is definitely not a top rb not even close well he is currently the rb in soo yeah id say hes pretty close
fantasyfootball,not_removed,of this sub was doubting him since the start of the season where were you theres around threads a week asking when to sell high or who to trade him for even in threads about ranking or chargers players gordon would consistently be bashed on and compared to a pee wee league rb last year he had fumbling issues but sucked mainly due to a decimated oline horrible coaching and numerous injuries all over the team leading to inconsistent and predictable play but noooone wanted to hear that the chargers are an easy team to pick on cause of bonehead decisions by their greedy owner smith see weddle bosa for recent examples but just about this entire sub except for a select few that actually watched the games doubted him week after week hell even now i dont believe that everyone is still convinced hes a top rb ros
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also thank mr skeltal for good bones and calcium
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ah yes lets ignore the weeks before those in this rest of season thread
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ros yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,at this point going forward it doesnt matter if bell outscores him for the season it matters if he outscores for the rest of the season which i think he will
fantasyfootball,not_removed,murray is having a killer year but for me i think i still like gordon better since his offense is better at moving the ball and they tend to have more red zone opportunities
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how neat is that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree hes getting touchdowns because hes getting the majority of the work as the short yardage rb like if youre ever gonna chase tds then thats what you want to see
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i scout the boxscore ive seen him suck on paper with my own two eyes watching the game is for casuals
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love the ypc argument people forget that fantasy doesnt score how many attempts it takes to get there i think last night he proved he can put enough points without tds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a blind squirrel finds a nut every once in a while matt jones rushed for over yards against the eagles and we can collectively agree he is not good the eagles even have a better run defense than the broncos and the yard stat for the broncos is skewed for just a single player which is fine but its a dumb stat imo week the bengals rbs had over yards on the ground against them hill with of those yards week falcons get over yards with freeman and coleman there are couple others as well the broncos do not have a good run defense this year period secondly ppr format heavily favors rbs points in full ppr is horrible for a rb if you meant ppr thats a good score but thats one game and i dont really know why you were talking about that as it was pretty irrelevant im not saying hes not a good play this year but if he goes in the first round next year to someone im going to be thrilled because they just wasted their pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think hell still catch passes next year but itll be back to what he was doing in or worse if keenan allen is back full throttle if allen was still around he doesnt catches as many passes this year woodhead is a certified td vulture as long as hes around the main rb on that team will not be as good because those goal line touches are his he hasnt gotten better hes gotten more opportunities tds this year tds last year thats because woodhead is out carries per game this year last year again no woodhead is the reason why but heres the telltale sign hes doing almost exactly what he did last year ypc wise ypc higher this year thats negligible its clear as day that he is only this good because of this opportunity and it will only last season if everyone remains healthy next season hang onto him this season and dont let him go but dont draft him next year unless he is in the mid rounds if you do redrafts if its a keeper league and youre out of the playoff picture trade him get someone that will have way more value next season like a top wr or a different top rb id say target mike evans or amari cooper if you need a wr i prefer evans because hes a clear number on the team its hard to trade for rbs this season because of all the injuries and uncertainty surrounding returning for next year but if you can package him with another gooddecent rb or wr and pick up zeke elliot or lesean mccoy i prefer mccoy because the owner might be freaking out about him being an injury problem ros then do it both will be good next season i believe i dont see you getting dj or bell but hey it doesnt hurt to try
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think that dj bell elliot murray mccoy then similar group with hyde miller gordon that puts him mid
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beginning of season vs right now is a completely different thing doubters at beginning of season dont matter now if theres a doubter now theyre not paying attention top now no top yes absolutely but keep talking about who was doubting a player at beginning of season vs now because that makes sense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is the key my friend confirmation bias kicks ass
fantasyfootball,not_removed,last four weeks are usually must win fantasy playoff matchups and are more important in a lot of cases
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not often do you get all this neatness in one location
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nah some of us actually enjoy watching football i played it and grew up on it and while ffb is fun and great id hate just looking at numbers week to week it would take out all the fun and enjoyment
fantasyfootball,not_removed,people also forget hes putting up receiving yards too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well i brought up the ppr issue simply because i am in a ppr league and pg is not a bad score for a rb in ppr leages if you average out the rbs this thread is saying are the top zeke dj bell and murray average scores in a full ppr league the numbers are pretty damn comparable so i would exactly say that its irrelevant its all relative honestly it just depends what kind of league you are in but i digress lets break down the numbers for the top rbs in full ppr this year in order dj games played points points per game bell games played points points per game murray games played points points per game gordon games played points points per game zeke games played points points per game i mean i just dont know how anyone in this sub can argue that he is a sell high candidate at this point in the season hes right up there with the rest of these guys and has a pretty favorable schedule ros granted he has ten mia and a bye week in the next weeks the production is there the snap count is there the touches are there those are all the things a player needs to put up good numbers not to mention the draft value most of those other rbs went in the top rounds in fantasy drafts this year gordon averaged around the round and as for your comment about how he is a good play the rest of this year i agree but in terms of talking about his next year value that is where i find irrelevance this whole post was about his value ros so thats all i was talking about i see what you are saying about the broncos run d stat being skewed for a single player no argument here that point is valid
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is a fantasy football sub just to confirm you realize he is saying fantasy top rb not real life top right mccoy is currently injured and who knows when hell come back or if hell be the same sometimes injuries linger a little murray had an injury scare and it could come back as well he has had multiple injuries throughout his career miller is on a much worse offense and wont have nearly as many goal line opportunities if you are going to disagree make some arguments as to why you dont think he could be top fantasy rb ros because it isnt unlikely at all especially to the point of saying not even close
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i actually totally agree with your list i was only giving you a hard time because you said he was not even close to top and i think is pretty close not even close would be imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes it started at the beginning of the season and it has continued until now the doubt has never stopped go ahead and search melvin gordon in this sub and youll see the same sell hightrade mg posts week after week or even go through my post history ive been defending mg all year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how is he not a top fantasy back in ppr right now with the most tds in the league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but you have to make the playoffs first
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i admitted hes a great play this year the only person who should sell high this year on gordon are keeper leagues if you can get return value for him in a top tier wr or top tier rb he wont be this good next year because of the points ive stated below in my other comment
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you everyone bitching about him not being a top rb in the nfl and the rest of us on this fantasy football sub are just looking at fantasy stats for our fantasy teams lol good lord
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i do i guess it is fair to say he could be one i guess im just salty bc i traded melvin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think im win away from clinching playoffs in a league ive been preparing for playoffs for a while which means paying attention to those last few matchups over almost anything
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no argument there i am in a keeper league but im in and dont want to sell him off because i want to win this year and hes my only solid rb the rest are gore matt jones terrence west cant really get rid of him lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cja played well in the playoffs but people tend to forget that he wasnt even the starter for the last month of the regular season personally i think it starts as a rbbc and that booker finishes the season as the lead back lacys struggles can mainly be narrowed down to things being a fatass and poor offensive line play its clear lacy has put a lot of work into getting in shape and its likely that he keeps the weight off the offensive line was dealt a devastating amount of injuries and now that theyre healthy the ol shouldnt be a problem im not sure how much spriggs will play as a rookie but he played a key role in indianas dominant run game the past few seasons im kind of conflicted on murray on one hand oakland has invested heavily in their run game and they have one of the best young offenses in football on the other hand its clear oakland wants to at least find somebody to pair with murray if not take his job deandre washington is a solid bet to steal third downgarbage time work ill start lacy flex murray and cut cja
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this would be better as marry fuck kill marry l murray hes going to be a steady producer who is going to get a lot of carries unfortunately the raiders are really into their passing game not that they shouldnt be which puts a cap on his fantasy production fuck e lacy hes shed some weight and you know at some point hes going to have one of those td games he had two years ago its just a question of when kill cj anderson im not digging the denver offense im sure he will be ok this year i just think he will be in the least productive offense of the three
fantasyfootball,not_removed,start lacy flex latavius cut cj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill address it from a money standpoint only obviously money doesnt determine playing timesee demarco murray but sometimes it can help determine who the team values lacy no new contract but they did give starks a million deal this offseason murray no new money here either just a round rb in the draft cja signed a million dollar deal in the offseason after orginally getting offered a similar contract from miami what i get from this is that green bay will most likely not have a long leash for lacy if he falters early murray seems to be the safest of the with little competition and finished in the nfl in carries last year it worries me a little that the broncos didnt sign cj before free agency but maybe they just wanted to see how other teams valued him either way they brought him back which makes me think they werent comfortable with hillman being the lead back or they just liked having the punch of cj and hillman murray lacy cja
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for the season overall start latavius flex lacy cut cj latavius is clearly going to be pretty reliable lacy is a possible monster with huge downside and im convinced cj will be overtaken by booker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think cj and lacy will do fine but the raiders need to trust lat as down back and stop giving him only hb dives when he runs im not in the area so i only watch when im going through sunday ticket but when i do watch him he only run dives while he is taken out for the fb forgot his name during pass plays and the or string rb comes in and takes hb tosses or counter basically all outside the tackle running also voltured in red zone by the passing offense or the fb on a swing pass to me when i see him play i see alot of matt forte and he still has to hit his prime but they need to trust him and let him be the workhorse even though thats a no no in the new nfl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had lacy and latavius last year ended up starting latavius each week and benching lacy after his slow start until after the thanksgiving games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,starting murray as his job is the most secure taking lacy as flex as he has the most upside but im worried about how the coachest feel about him after last year stark playing a bigger role cj anderson is out do we really know for sure that he is really the man in denver if hillman has a couple good games will he really not eat into cjs workload plus the box will be constantly loaded with sanchez in town
fantasyfootball,not_removed,murray because the others may lose third down work
fantasyfootball,not_removed,start murray he has the highest floor of the three with little competition in the backfield an improved line and what looks to be a good to very good offence as a whole flex lacy he can be a little streaky but i like him to finish as a top rb at worst cut cja ive never been on the anderson hype train and there are just too many question marks in denvers offence for me to be comfortable taking anyone in denver at their current adp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,would you keep eddie or ingram as a keeper in a strd league your thoughts gentlemen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i really think lacy is going to blow up this season hes in better shape than hes ever been in the nfl and the longer youre in any system the better acclimated you get to it so i think you take his best season and improve on that which makes him a top guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ask me again after preseason youre asking me to predict things that we will know for sure in the future if lacy is still in shape hes going to be if booker is a looking like a threat to andersons carries hes going to be
fantasyfootball,not_removed,something tells me not to pass on lacy this year although something also told me that last year lacy cja murray
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gimmie alla dat lacy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this sub hates cja for being a first round bust but loves lacy despite him being a first round bust two years in a row whatever guys let cj fall to me in the im cool with it as for ranking id say start latavius since he is pretty much the raiders only starting rb and is gonna get his touches flex cj you dont pay a guy mil over years to bench him and cut lacy because that offense is gonna be airing it out a ton and starks will vulture goal line touches
fantasyfootball,not_removed,start latavius murray hes consistent hes a bell cow he has one of the best olines in football flex eddie lacy hes not longer fat is that enough we hope so hes got potential but they just resigned starks cut cj anderson he doesnt pass the eyeball test hes done one year wonder on his way out the door
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good call i think im in the same boat except i think latavious is a solid if you take wideouts early
fantasyfootball,not_removed,spriggs will be the swing tackle he has to be an improvement over barclay at least
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i feel like i see such contrasting opinions on green bays line nfl named it top lines in the league this week and all the comments were in regard to it being terrible was it just the injuries
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats a good weekly position thread startflexcut havent been here in a while so hopefully we can have good breakdowns like yours in the future
fantasyfootball,not_removed,add a third cause to lacys struggles bad offensive coordinator once mccarthy took playcalling back from the oc lacy did get going just a little bit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,personally i think it starts as a rbbc and that booker finishes the season as the lead back should i jump on the booker bandwagon if so where should i draft him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think instead of cut op should have just used bench since youre obviously not dropping any of these guys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,only on reddit does oh id fuck eddie lacy garner several shrug nods around the world
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this should be a thing on this sub
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ok now fuck marry or kill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the packers are good at keeping their own starks was a fa lacy is on his rookie deal still the way rbs dont stay in league for long they most likely want to see if they can get the old lacy back before making an offer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mil a year is elite backup money not starter money theyre counting on lacy to start
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a keeper probably lacy ingram is getting pretty old and while id take him over lacy for this year i dont think hes got too many good years left in the tank
fantasyfootball,not_removed,something tells me not to pass on lacy this year although something also told me that last year lol i love fantasy football so much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bust years in a row in lacy had total yards and tds i dont call that a bust
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cj anderson on his way out the door did i miss something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,easy there with calling murray a bell cow deandrewashington might steal his share of snaps
fantasyfootball,not_removed,httpwwwspotraccomnfldenverbroncoscjanderson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i know this is a really old post but do you think that latavius and jamaal charles would be a good combo at rb i got latavius in the round and jamaal in the team standard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,debating in between or compromise kinda defeats the purpose of the exercise often traditional marry fuck kill involves three people you dont really want to kill or marry or even fuck the choice is supposed to be hard but if you had to make it the point of the cut option is that if were in some strange scenario where you simply had only those options then you must cut them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kill cj for being a waste of a first round kill lacy for being a waste of a second round marryfuck latavius for being the only decent rb i had last year team ppr league last pick in a snake draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im having kenny britt flashbacks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont like him hes not the main back and booker will be the guy by week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,personally i dont trust charles to stay healthy hes an absolute monster but hasnt really been able to stay healthy consistently if he does stay healthy though that is definitely a solid combo depending on what you have a wr charles would have to fall to late second for me to spring on him i think but i havent been keeping up on adps lately my draft isnt til after week of the preseason so ive been pretty oblivious lately gonna start lacking again soon though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont doubt booker could make a serious contribution but i dont see why theyd be showing cja the door at the moment
fantasyfootball,not_removed,didnt they just pay him a lot if they were just going to cut him yards a carry two years ago and yards a carry this year all while peyton was at less then his a game and they were switching to kubiaks new run blocking right i see a lot of bounce back potential
fantasyfootball,not_removed,booker is an everydown workhorse type of rb other rbs will definitely still nab a carry here and there but booker is going to make the other guys nearirrelevant as far as fantasy value imo hes the kind of reliable guy you want paired with a great defense we saw that in utah for years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and he had injuries for most of the regular season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is it safe to drop bell i figured i might as well pick up any viable free agents before my opponent may need them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes drop bell pick up dwill or maybe a brandon lafell if you need wr help i think dwill might get anywhere from touches so hoping for yards average on that with td potential vs the browns it is risky but so is every other option burkhead perkins collins mcfadden illness etc
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive got my lineup pretty much set i just didnt want to drop him if theres any possibility of him playing im more looking to block my opponent from getting anyone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh yea bell isnt playing and now it is saturday so he wont be able to pick him up anyway if he does start chance

fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr who do i start at flex jerick mckinnon vs nyg theo riddick or dwayne washington vs chi cole beasly dez is hurt vs sf willie snead questionable vs sd jamison crowder vs cle
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man paid league standard scoring with an extra flex wr choose mark ingram lagarbear blount mike evans allen robinson odell beckham only doubt is vikings d is real
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sanders tb diggs nyg or crowell was team standard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man standard scoring league crowell vs was pryor vs was ware vs pit thinking about going with pryor but if jc is out ware might be the more logical option given his guaranteed workload and the fact that pryor will have to go up against norman this week advice please
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am not sure who to start this week at flex in my person standard scoring league tyrell williams i like his matchup with the saints dwayne washington i keep hearing how he is going to get more reps and he is going up against the bears jerick mckinnon starting for vikings but their line and their matchup is terrible i also have fuller wallace and crowder on my bench who should i go with
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what are some realistic expectations from travis benjamin should i start him over crabtree team standard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr pick two michael thomas sd tyrrell williams vs no stefon diggs vs nyg
fantasyfootball,not_removed,flex out of these three bonus c mike nyj hyde vs dal or howard vs det
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team standard it sounds silly but i need to pick between bmarsh and dwayne washington obviously marshall is talented as hell but hes against the sea secondary washington is unproven but is expected to see work against a cupcake bears defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team standard ware or howard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id probably go gurleycmikehiltonkelvinsanders coleman is gonna be a tough start against a good panthers d and a split backfield im getting the inklings of a shootout in london jax and indy have very good offenses and not great defenses luck might end up throwing the ball a hell of a lot more and if wilson is really limited or unable to go on sunday cmike will have a massive workload even against a good jets front line i dont know how you sit him with the massive workload hes bound to get
fantasyfootball,not_removed,really tough choices i like ware the best london rivalry lots of uncertainty enunwa if decker is out might be interesting but not against the seahawks which are great at covering large wrs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i kinda like ivory here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id keep it with diggs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,diggs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,between the two id go with williams
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cooks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go williams the weak no d is too good of a matchup to play anyone else i would maybe consider murray but baltimore has the best run d
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id play riddick is snead plays i like the thomas play if he sits though i think while the dwayne hype train is legit and going to finally come to fruition this week its going to open back up the dump downs and change of pace necessary for theo to succeed this will turn into a bernardjeremy hill type team with dwayne being hill and theo being bernard goodluck guessing each week which will hit but they both probably get you point floors i cant say the same for lockett or sharpe anymore
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i bit on the dorsett trap last week and then dropped him immediately after his poor performancelet down which means hell probably drop stat line this week i mean again dorsett has a solid matchup but he let me down so hard last week i think id have to say ebron if it was me picking again humphries is a real deal floortype receiver but vs denver yikes sharpe has been a let down since not living up to the hype as clear wr on his team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not brown not decker if jc is out you fire up ware
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this one is rough if it was ppr id say crowder standard im leaning towards crabtree the most but the big balls bastard in me says all aboaaaaarrrrrd dwayne dwayne the hype train
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like ware vs pitt its likely we dont see any of charles and pitt has a big problem with checkdown backs which ware is in spades pryor is gonna have norman on him all game with probably even one more spying since who else do they really have to fear and i dont care if he says his frame isnt afraid of norman i am cmike is too boom or bust for me and this entire reddit probably
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ware for sure if jc is out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats tough i think id roll with diggs hes the clear wr on the team the only person who is a real threat to eat targets is rudolph alshon is playing with hoyer in what seems to be a decent matchup against det but alshon was hoyers target last sunday with kevin white saw targets and zach miller saw
fantasyfootball,not_removed,washington should be a higher scoring game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go washington as well plus im still concerned about whittaker tolbert and cam himself poaching runs especially at the goal line
fantasyfootball,not_removed,washington not because of the hype train but he will have a bigger role than cap currently
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who did you trade to get dj geez sit kb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go crabtree then pryor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crab
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like cmikehell get the volume regardless
fantasyfootball,not_removed,want to roll the dice high points but high risk fuller decent floor but lesser points cmike only because of the nyj d if it wasnt nyj i would make cmike over fuller currently
fantasyfootball,not_removed,marshall and walker i dont think decker plays coleman is up against a tough d and floyd hasnt been great to start marshall is gonna get a bunch of targets and walker is always a solid play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,marshall walker agreed decker wont play walker should benefit from ten having a great run defense lacking pass d
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats tough both are playing against hard defenses but i just dont see a performance from coleman last last week happening again so soon maclin will eventually get some amazing points in one of his games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like damariyus this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crowder i dont trust ivory at all after his last performance and he is banged up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crowder ivory is still suspect
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crowder will do well vs cle
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tyrell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crowell i just cant trust anyone in the bal o currently except for pitta and possibly dixon in later weeks so steve can be boom or bust
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crowder in a heart beat even if not in a ppr league he has been getting sooo many more looks from the was o and there is a trust in his production
fantasyfootball,not_removed,josh gordon obviously p but no seriously i would look at pryor only because of his size mismatches he can do against the was secondary sanders is great too and both games are feastable just depends which you trust more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,snead if healthy riddick for ppr against a bad chi d you got a conundrum though as wares floor isnt that bad watch charles throughout the week but since it is ppr riddick is a catching rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,depends if snead is out again thomas hands down if snead isnt you might get more points with sims
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im going sims although he is playing denver he can catch passes out of the backfield all day so game flow wont kill him if they are losing im always scared of saints wr since brees spreads it so well especially since brees and fleener seemed to have the chemistry going so well last week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,london games usually mean high scoring games you got ty has the lead wr against a jax defense vs michael against a stout nyj run d i say ty
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im starting michael this is a toss up though because ty has shown for the past few years that he can put up on any given day who are your other rbwrflex currently starting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im starting kevin white with confidence this week he has improved every week and is going against an awful lions defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cole hes already peppered with targets from dak and now dez is out hes small shifty so hes always open and hes catching damn never everything that comes his way and with zeke running strong daks dual threat sf wont be able to sell out on covering wrs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if ppr totally crowder he has been getting increased targets per game and catching more and more each
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go crowder too although both are solid in ppr id give the edge to crowder vs the browns
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crowdah i just missed him on waivers last week think hes a good ppr guy targets are high like the others are saying
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed on pryor tyrell pryor is just involved in every play and the saints def cant cover anyone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would say pryor and tyrell ppr gives them them edge over michael imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is a tough one id almost be forced to flip a coin but id lean diggs i think bradford has shown some consistency some chemistry with diggs so far
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ten rush defense has been solid i think that hou will bounce back which means the pass game should be the high point of the offense crowder would be a lock if ppr id prob wait to see if snead is fully recovered even if he plays if snead is out fleener will move up he looked better this week finally ware may lose touches if jc comes back pit does suffer against passcatching backs dwashington i picked up in leagues but im waiting for some production id go fuller and then fleener depending on snead or crowder
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would love to flex pryor the amount of times hell be involved in a play is crazy cant really trust latavius bc they just arent giving him the bulk carries and like you said atl rbs will be a risky play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id probably go tyrell the saints are bad just so bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pitta has the better matchup but denver has been strangely bad against the run id still feel more comfortable with pitta if you start sims id flex kelce
fantasyfootball,not_removed,diggs but its close
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go tyrell he and benjamin as well as hunter henry are all likely to have some pretty nice games against the saints defense look at all those who guys matty ice was connecting with last week diggs is going to be up against a pretty nice db if i remember right too i dont pay much attention to nfc east but i saw him on a sit em article
fantasyfootball,not_removed,snead if he plays crowder otherwise riddick or dwayne wouldnt do bad either i think both are gonna have a good game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crowder browns give up a lot of yards through the air see landry last week source sad browns fan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,robinson blount evans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if jc is out then ware pit has decent run d but cannot handle pass catching rbs well then for me its a toss up for your browns
fantasyfootball,not_removed,absolutely mind boggling there is no one better in only an man must have some really really bad injuries woes jc still out bears suck definitely ware
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its so tough i feel like theyll all have pretty good weeks and nobody is head and shoulders above anyone ill ride the train for now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do we think this is the new normal in chicago i am finding i am arguing with myself and telling myself that this was hoyers first week with jeffery and maybe this time around it will be different i would normally roll jeffery no questions asked but his hobbling has got me a bit worried
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but if it turns into a shootout wont that turn to riddick getting more snaps as the receiving back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,traded ryan and abdullah for ingram then traded ingram jarvis and dorsitt for johnson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i dont think that you can really go wrong w either choice here both have huge potential this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,landry travis benjamin elliot and gordon landry didnt do great tonight but the bengals d made up for that a tad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks i was a little nervous about fuller because of his drops last week and the week before if that is the case im probably starting ware as my rb and going fullersneadfleener crowder just has been getting more targets each week which was the only reason he seemed to be in an interesting position for rz targetsbut i keep on forgetting reed is a cog in that offense still
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i get what youre saying i usually always believe in starting studs i just sort of believe williams has a little more upside in ppr this week going against a terrible saints defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the more and more i read into it ware seems like the obvious choice if jc is out followed by pryor gonna wait for injury updates before i make a final decision though thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tell me about it i got hit harder than the entire combined rest of my league keenan ad moncrief woodhead abdullah and now dez my team is a fantasy version of the cleveland browns
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all abooooard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,both of your options will be touchdown dependent this week in a shootout youll have more redzone opportunities for all players youre rolling the dice no matter what way you look at it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would play ty and cmike both over travis benjamin for sure you can play both if you want
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id for sure keep an eye out for news on jamaal though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,very good point washington it is thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,benjamin against that saints d looks so juicy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if by fridaysat afternoon reid is still mum on jamaals status i may still go with ware i just dont see them giving charles so many carries on his first game backa la gronk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,foster
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do you mean eligible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no one important thatll be on ir come week one hes not on ir but i scooped up knowshon in about of my dynasty leagues with the hopes that he plays this year another interesting pick is rookie wr duke williams on la he was projected to be a rounder this time last year but a bar fight ended up getting him kicked off the team and out of school i believe and he was signed as an udfa also come join us at rdyanstyff for all your dynasty questions and some insight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oops yeah my b
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what else did you think he meant
fantasyfootball,not_removed,edible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe some rookies last name or something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,legible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,are you in those weeks because that is one awful lineup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how do your weekly scores compare to the rest of your league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what is your average points scored per week because with studs like gb dst and ty montgomery your league must be a pretty mixed bag
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tannehills touchdown pass was worth points everything else tannehill did was worth points that is all
fantasyfootball,not_removed,love landry hate the team hes on
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj giving me that thursday night hope until i get destroyed on sunday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its a sad day when you get points from your rb and feel like you dodged a bullet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green made my pants fit weird
fantasyfootball,not_removed,every year i draft aj green i wish fantasy matchups are two weeks long so that his monster games like this will get balanced out by his catches for yards game next week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,started hill and went against green just fuck me up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,few things are more satisfying in fantasy football than when you have a great thursday night thank you aj green and cincy defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i swear aj stands for almost jesus cause he straight descended from the heavens on to my fantasy squad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,landry has a crazy floor green has a crazy ceiling
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i still love you jarvis your team and qb played like utter garbage and you still got me catches and yards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,knew devante parker was a mistake when he had target mid quarter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,apology for poor wr depth where were you when landry was kill i was sat at home readying the rotoworlds when esbn was notify jarvis is kill no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that miami offensive line is bad like really bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck you tannehill for fucking over landry and fuck you landry for dropping that last pass oh and also fuck you aj green im salty af
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why did everyone in my draft sleep on aj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks for the headstart nuge
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pairing green and landry that consistency boombust
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that mightve been the worst game of football ive watched this season also fuck you tannehil eat a bag of dicks you cock goblin ass hat
fantasyfootball,not_removed,me landry him nugent and bengals
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj laid that dad dick on em
fantasyfootball,not_removed,happy i was able to pick up cin defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mike fucking nugent appreciation thread
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jeremy hill is such a sex tease
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bruh theres boutta be a scrap on the postgame show
fantasyfootball,not_removed,owning landry in a standard league sucks i need to convince my league mates to switch to ppr haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,considered streaming cincinnati and chose washington instead my opponent went with cinci feelsbadman at least until sunday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,with the points parker put up my starting receivers for this season have put up a combined points bout to drop all these guys for defenses
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just trade aj green for deandre hopkins and shady yesterday so this was my last game with him thank you aj ill miss you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love that receptions snd yards is basically landrys floor in ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,holy shit that miami offense was brutally terrible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who got dad dicked by aj green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive lost my faith in parker but only because tannehill blows he really sucks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,devante i didnt expect much but plz aj green has a dad dick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green can have my children
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that second half was atrocious to watch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i made a snap decision to start parker the only redeeming factor is my opponent has ad starting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,off topic but did anyone watch the post game show prior to green coming on what happened between faulk and michael irvin i couldnt tell if it was joking or if things were getting heated and the laughter was of the awkward variety
fantasyfootball,not_removed,god i cant wait for tyler eifert to come back dalton would being having a much better year than he already is
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as an owner of landry bortles and miller i feel like my team is the king of garbage points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,playing against green here goes another wasted week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my opponent started parker tonight ill be sleeping like a baby tonight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the dolphins team needs to be blown up again what an embarrassment
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all hail mike nugent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you cincy d no regrets now about dropping texans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im glad i benched dalton
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj mothafuckin green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dalton played well but could have easily had another td or
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what a shit show guaranteed we all bench parker next week and he goes off for
fantasyfootball,not_removed,should we feel worse over gordon or the dolphins performance tonight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green now has yards through games not bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,to be honest ill gladly take the from landry considering how shitty the game was im just going to speculate that the outcome was due to a short week and see them bounce back next week once they get their injured players back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did you have aj green great did you have anyone else fuck off
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my opponent has dalton so im really thankful they stalled out in the redzone times
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the bengals have regressed so far from last season when they had other good receivers and a very good offensive coordinator they should have put up tonight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hell yeah carlos dunlap getting double digit points from de makes me feel good going into sunday idp represent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fins always blow my mind they somehow manage to accrue great talent but waste it in spectacular ways landry needs to be on another team asap his talent is wasted much like arob tannehill is a pos qb that should have been kicked to the curb seasons ago but instead is a starter based on flukey games against weak opponents that brings me to my next point holy shit miami coaching is bad terrible terrible playcalling unimaginative terrible calls you name it combine it with tannehill just fucking up ugh also miamis defense should have done better during cincys scoring drives they looked lazy lots of missedhalfassed tackles missed assignments and general lethargy looked quite shitty at times but they also pull the tannehil and have flashes where they look good someone needs to light a fucking fire under everyones ass
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well that was pretty boring
fantasyfootball,not_removed,went all in on the dolphins and started landry and parker played against green not much to do now but pray
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ugh i hate fantasy i hate my team see you in minors next season again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eifert youre our only hope please save daltons season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn forgot to switch defenses this week so i left miami in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wish mcdonalds would sell burgers in the morning like bk great hangover food
fantasyfootball,not_removed,even though the bengals d put up good points dalton and the d couldnt put up more points then green heres to hoping i dont shit the bed sunday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my opponent accidentally started miami d when streaming defense goes wrong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,justdolphinthings
fantasyfootball,not_removed,honestly at this point im alright with my rb posting only around points if that means they come out of the game without an injury
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that game was painful to watch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is there any use in keeping gio in a standard league he had another bad game he had that one good game with receiving yards but hardly anything else it seems like jeremy hill has a solid lock on that main rb role thank god i didnt start gio this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so switching theo for devante was a really bad idea it seems
fantasyfootball,not_removed,started both landry and hill fuck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i miss having landry as my flex such a reliable floor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who else had green and nugent like me wooooooo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that feel when youre down pts and its only thursdayhe has dalton and aj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in a sixteen team league where its possible to play one quarterback and another as a flex how much should i think about the possibility of ryan tannehill being benched this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i picked up the dolphins d for next weeks match up against the titans but maybe i should pick up the titans d instead
fantasyfootball,not_removed,god watch crowell score like cause i chose hill ver him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,quick question can i drop the bengals now like that wonnt lose me my points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pros of my night cincy defense cons played against aj green and jarvis landry and i started davante parker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bengals d got me points way better than that texans d last werk with point lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,today was a great day aj green laid down the hammer and the first place owner in my league had to plug in tannehill in our qb league thanks to rodgers bye week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also the miami d committing much penalties killed them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,first thursday night game so far this year i didnt get terribly let down neither me nor my opponent had someone playing but still good to be trending up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wellaj green was a good surprise for me even though i had a gut feeling he was gonna have one of the bigger feasts of the season this gameopponent used parker as a flex and the week is only getting better now that my bellcow is back and ty is playing against jax d
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i started him but benched tannehill because of his last weeks performance vs the browns in the back of my mind i was like hmm well tannehill certainly sucks ass but he cant start as slow as he did last week can he oh yes he can and he did
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the dolphins suck like really suck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green and stills just ended my hopes for a win this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,was going back and forth between starting parker tonight or using mccoy against new england feeling good about my decision to keep with mccoy and as a steelers fan it pains me to say it but i love green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,never count on miami to help you out in fantasy whenever i start anyone on their team they lay an egg or whenever im going up against someone that has a player playing against miami they have career games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj evans and diggs i feel great
fantasyfootball,not_removed,taking aj green over gurley was the best decision of my season easily
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for my idp friends can anyone tell me what happened to xavien howard he absolutely disappeared after the first quarter did he get benched or just not thrown to anymore because lippett was that much worse
fantasyfootball,not_removed,off to a great start tannehill gave me a whopping smh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did anyone else start green but play against mike nugent green got me almost but nugent got almost such a hollow victory
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gio youre lucky i also started aj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,picking up nugent worked out well for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how is there not more love for kenny stills in here dude had one job and he did it catch a long bomb for a td can you rely on him week to week of course not but this week he did exactly what i needed him to do god bless kenny stills
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was so pleased to wake up to aj greens performance this morning he is probably in the league behind brown
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont understand the bitching about j hill i think in todays fantasy football you gotta hope for touches from your rbs ideally and roll the dice he got carries and looked okay while just missing having a much better fantasy day had he punched in one of those goal line carries if he is any higher than your then yes you should be worried but imo getting good usage out of your runningbacks is about all you can hope for with how few bellcows there are now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cancel tnf end this travesty of pathetic football i hope the union fights to end the shit at least make it after byes and dont start it till week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jeremy hill betrayed me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,god i cant wait until brady comes back from suspension so i dont have to play this garbage ass qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,his shitty performances get masked by wins against crappier teams and all the garbage time scoring pads his stat line and makes it less obvious just how terrible he actually is that is until you actually watch him play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,imagine him on the pats
fantasyfootball,not_removed,decent floor in ppr at least still got me points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had him last year in ppr he made a fan of me because of his consistency and the fact that he could do so much with the little he was given id love to see him have some success with a better team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wish hed play for the bucs at least we try to win
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just traded him wish i hit it before the game gotta deal with aj green this week need those big numbers from my other boys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well he has a high floor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he had two goalline carries too almost had points too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeai put him him theo riddicks spot at the last minute and regret it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,still hard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no jones no sanu a hobbled eifert an improved daltonand a mediocre running game ive been saying it all season this is the year of green rejoice brother as we fly unto a higher plane
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so true it is nice to pair him with high floor low ceiling wrs and for that reason
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i feel like he will be more consistent this year the only reason he did so poorly against pittsburgh is because of the weather he also put up against the best secondary in the league he is going to have a great year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is why i always pair him with a highfloor guy like landry my feelings about tonights game are deeply conflicted
fantasyfootball,not_removed,besides last year he wasnt ever really like that the year before he had turf toe but the years before that he was just a flat out stud
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe just maybe we dont get any more of that this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same but gio 😂
fantasyfootball,not_removed,started dalton and parker played green in ppr fuck my life right up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had both
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we are truly the winners of the night
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yessir been on both ends the worst side more times than not cincy defense looked amazing tonight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,should have started nugent for the triple
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i feel ya on that bengals d the d was fa so i picked them up for texans d
fantasyfootball,not_removed,love to know theres more of us and i wasnt the only one got a good nights sleep
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same here and i was playing against ryan terriblehill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and thank nugent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,knew to sit him tonight did not expect it to be that bad thought he carved out a more respectable role than that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a dolphins fan this made me ridiculously angry along with a lot of other things
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck the dolphins is all i have to say about that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so glad i passed on keeping him in the round i hate all the dolphins go bills
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dropped parker before week games started
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is such a dank haiku
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it is bad for sure but they were also starting a third string center and their left tackle was out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that last play drop was brutal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you okay bro
fantasyfootball,not_removed,summed up my thoughts almost perfectly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not everyone can handle
fantasyfootball,not_removed,especially pissed after that last drop that could have led to some more garbage time points instead of kneeling to end he game edit tannehill is fucking terrible i thank the fantasy gods the miami defense was on point was up against dalton and hill and that could have went a lot worse
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what happened on the last pass
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck you terrence fede for the brainless penalty
fantasyfootball,not_removed,because his floor is scary for a first round pick his awesome games are the majority of his points i own him and am glad to have him paired with decent floor people like landry and crabtree
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wish everybody in my draft slept on him he went like or in full ppr and i was the next pick planning on picking him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i slept on him because i dont like boombust performance from my rounder points in week points in week his great games are great but man does he lay some duds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got him at in one league i was cracking up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,proven talent isnt sexy in fantasy drafts for some reason dude has consistently finished in the top for wrs yet no one talked about him going next to julio i got him at in a teamed and have been very happy hes going to have a career year i think
fantasyfootball,not_removed,got him in the spot in a man couldnt believe it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same here just picked him up yesterday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you need that greenlandrymjones combo im loving this season so far haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yessir this has been my strategy two years running this year i added arob and benjamin to the mix as well and i can start all four im currently winless but optimistic
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that game made dallas vs bears look like last years super bowl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that was like streamdefensesagainstmia bad or at least stream kickers not sure how their defense grew a spine in the red zone and didnt have one elsewhere
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i take it you didnt watch the rams vs niners in week or the steelers vs bengals in week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would like to refer you to last weeks jets kc game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well glad i missed it then
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree that was turrible as charles barkley would say i hate when the really bad games are on the night games like who decided that miami was going to be a potential contender this year apparently
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yup i quit watching and switched to tna
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got the same for landry he got for green i feel your pain
fantasyfootball,not_removed,had nugent and green im pumped right now im also playing the best team in our non ppr league so far so im happy to get off to a good start
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a defense finally worked out for me this week shame my opponent has green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same here picked cinci d last night and they where fa dropped texans d
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so close to pts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he was number in scoring for standard going into today i think ive been very happy with him this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wtf you got both just for aj green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that worked out amazingly well for you ridiculous trade value and a great chance to win this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shhh dont jinx it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am the one doing the dicking this week and its about damn time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he just wasnt targeted but was open quite a bit but lets just throw a dump off to williams for another yard gain for the time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,back off hes having mine
fantasyfootball,not_removed,taco
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do you have a link to it by chance i want to see it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i saw that in the background but i missed what was actually happening
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it was super awkward i dont usually watch the post game show so i couldnt tell you if it was normal bickering but it genuinely seemed like they were arguing to me im watching now and hes still acting salty dude just really didnt wanna talk about the dolphins haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,michael irvin wanted to give props to bengals while marshall faulk wanted to talk about how much the phins suck faulk really sucks at his job and irvin just gets mad at everything
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea feeling very meh about my points in should have been
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i signed him a few hours ago to be on my bench cutting his ass before sunday i dont understand the lack of targets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yd avg per game even though that is totally not true i can deal with thatnext question is if he knocks on wood is able to get another yd season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed boyd and lafell just arent cutting it maybe eifert can make a difference
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shouldve bet that guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good prediction anyone who watched the miamicleveland game last week wouldve been worried about the dolphins they looked poor on both sides of the ball against a much worse team than cincinnati
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not hard enough to get in the endzone from inside the on back to back carries though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,carries when the team gets up they leave the fb in and just grind hill he had some encouraging runs against a tough front looking forward to watching him more down the road
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got sick of hills inconsistency so i traded him for mike evans and im not looking back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,carries not his fault the ol fell asleep against a terrible run defense im still happy with him as one of my starting rbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,need a coaching change and possibly new qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id like you to meet my friend alcohol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my condolences last week miami owner
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what time does bk start sellin burgers man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats what i love about whataburger burgers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think gios whole use in standard is as a trade chip early in the year wait for him to have one of his gio games then flip him in a combo to an rbneedy owner with bad record chasing the upside given that nobody can ever predict when it actually will be a gio game he should basically never be in a lineup unless utterly desperate xd
fantasyfootball,not_removed,could be worse they gave hill so many redzone chances and he got stuffed for negative yardage each time half those attempts go to dalton and he most likely scored a passing td also someone dropped a dalton pass in the endzone so you could definitely be losing by more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,could be worsedalton only threw one td
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont play the dolphins d made that mistake last week and wouldnt recommend bad defenses are bad even against bad offenses
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably not until all the games are finished and processed just my guess though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,werk it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,vs thats a no brainer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,landry is pretty consistent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the decision i did not make green went right after my gurley pick too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in the same spot was just looking at my roster saying this already set my week lineup and put brady in the qb slot instantly made me feel better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he was through first weeks tho
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i picked up joe flacco the other day i now have flacco rodgers and brady on my roster because some assholes hogging all the wrs except for gordon i have gordon because i thought he would be good once his suspensions over fuck me right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not scrappy enough too late to the gym im not sure hes a student of the game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im pretty sure the pats could have had him if they didnt pick up garappolo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i know he deserves better but please dont take him from us its literally all we have to get excited about
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that one run landry had my jaw was open crazy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he would be top in standard and top in ppr on a good offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he could put up prime welker numbers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same they just seem to use him in quarter trash time only horrible underuse of a great player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,literally the same move here bah
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i doubt riddick will see that much action i expect lions to pound it down the middle with washington and tear that lousy d apart with with middle range passes with a few deep bombs every now and then
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seriously the guy opposite him is brandon lafell its gonna be green all the way all year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,his matchups are pretty solid for the rest of the year week no one played well because of the weather week broncos but you can tell they changed their gameplan this week to get aj the ball
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agree i have him paired with landry feel pretty good about that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have him with hilton and cooks its a rollercoaster every week but it usually balances out well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i somehow have him paired with jordy nelson and doug baldwin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i have him paired with nuk and alshon helps keep my average up on off games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj set with mike evans and cooper good to go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont even know what to do with gio anymore
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah the passing game was weird they focused way too much on the run game and passing to williams which is the worst part of their offense i know tannehill isnt the best but youve gotta use the best weapons you have its not like parker or landry run particularly difficult routes the most difficult throw he had all night was a touchdown youd think theyd realize after stills td was the only thing that got them going to start looking downfield a bit more but i guess not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,go bills as a watkins owner as well this hurts too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so chargers at week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tunsil at lt was the only bright spot the rest of the line was straight garbage juwan james looks like a different player hes been that bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sigh if landry had caught that i would have been okay not a terrible showing from landry but still
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how deep was the pass
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im salty af
fantasyfootball,not_removed,on point totally
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jl dropped a pass he should have caught
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also paired him with landry but switch crab for decker its an amazing combo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,exact same for me he went just ahead of me in my league no worries i just took ap then gun
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that league sucks then
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got him in the second round julio in the first
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that was like his adp mate
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats actually exactly who i have
fantasyfootball,not_removed,greenjonesmatthewsbryantrudolphgronkowski im but feeling strangely optimistic
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive got landry marvin jones julio jones and a backup jordy nelson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and here i was happy with my jordyjefferyjulio trio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,add in diggs and thats my starting wrs in my team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ayyyy thats whats up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dallas vs bears was worse for me since i lost langford and dez
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i really want to know who put this game in snf it doesnt make sense but well the game ended very late in my maybe the game started and i had a test in college and had to wake up im glad i was like fuck this game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they mastered the tannehill halfassed until the last possible moment then mehd their way through seriously though those fuckers were lazy as shit sometimes missed tackles lazy tackles missed assignments fuck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that niners game is what cancer is made up of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,or houston vs pats in week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seconded on rams niners maybe the most incompetent football ive ever seen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont get me wrong hes been great but games like today is why hes much more valuable in ppr than he is in standard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah holy shit thats a great trade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably because he has games like this four times a year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sorry the total trade was aj carlos hyde and tajae sharpe for hopkins shady and desean
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think hes a little busy having his own guys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he had a td pass to the te cant remember his name but he dropped it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,overreaction
fantasyfootball,not_removed,considering that he has never had a season with less than id say chances look great
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yyeah
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i have a feeling theyll finish worst and second worst in pretty much every category this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gotten them as early as where i live nebraska
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i almost started him this week but made a last second switch because i got a bad feeling shudders
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah they got me points but i think even the raiders d performed decently against the titans so im conflicted
fantasyfootball,not_removed,got lucky no one picked them up especially as free agent lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,got me points in standard i was frustrated but then i thought about it and realized thats not really terrible for how little action he saw
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they tried to make me go to rehab i said sure why not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,never carried a lunch pail
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so youre saying hes not cerebral enough and leans a little too much on his physical gifts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,doesnt like mayonnaise
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah but how often do the pats spend high picks on receivers or rbs anyways they took vereen and ridley in the late second and late third the pats and picks of the draft dobson in the late second in and gronk in the middle of the second in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did you really just say jarvis is not scrappy enough are you kidding me jarvis is a man ive been saying it since college odell will be the hero of the league for the first years but jarvis will be a year pro i think he could be one of the scrappiest wrs in the league he is not the fastest kinda big and has the heart of a lion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol no just cuz the dolphins throw to him every other play doesnt meant thatll happen on a good offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he could always leave miami and come play with his best bud odell in ny we will need a replaced for cruz
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hed get receptions on new england wes welker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i mean hes already still top even in an offense where hes the only legitimate threat put him with a good qb on a team with an oc that knows how to use him and hed be a total monster hes got great hands that last drop notwithstanding and hes so damn good with the ball in his hands
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not necessarily true tannenhill got rekt both from his incompetence and the oline tannenhill being shit and o line being awful
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eiferts return will significantly drop his red zone targets tho c
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i also have him paired with landry in a ppr league good combo for sure
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same trying to trade cooks for jordy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hopefully they dont collectively have one of those weeks come playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,those are boom and bust wrs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got lucky green evans and jones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no one cares
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i will take your cooper and raise you an arob
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my plan is to never start him again but still get pissed when he goes off on my bench
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its odd he hasnt had more work seems like zampese is still figuring out how to run the offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was up against hill so projection wise it evened out that catch wouldve been a nice couple points though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yards maybe but it was on down so the bengals just kneeled it out wasted minutes of garbage time passing downs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,was the pass how deep was the pass i really need to know cause were living in a world of football sorry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how many yards was it a td pass
fantasyfootball,not_removed,luckily i took zeke over ap which is looking like a pretty decent pick but still wish i had aj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i know im just surprised he fell to me considering the league is pretty competitive i would have take him overall also in the mocks i was doing he was always being taken before
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you mean lamar miller vs pats in week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you won that in a landslide holy shit shady upgrade hopkins probably upgrade but fuck bo djax major improvement over tajae dammmn
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there were key drops its a good sign for dalton though he played well and just got unlucky he was on the verge of yards tds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn there goes the titans chance of getting the and draft pick next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats amazing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,feelsgoodman d your instincts did you solid
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea tannahill is really holding him back but decent floor in ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,only walks up hill one way
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aka hes not white
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pretty sure hes referring to a joke from the league basically saying that landry isnt white
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theyve taken several receivers in the first couple rounds and deion branch was the only one that turned out not be a miserable failure
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i said the pats could have had him i think you responded to the wrong person
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre overlooking the importance of a good coachcoordinator and qb a good offense doesnt necessarily mean other good weapons thatll steal targets can you imagine how much worse ab would be on the dolphins edit man this sub is dumb as hell sometimes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,king shep is here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wes welker you mean julian edelman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh man watching tannehill sacked at the end by his own tackle because geno atkins pushed him into tannehill convinced me how bad the dolphins oline is
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is very true
fantasyfootball,not_removed,true but even if he doesnt catch that td he still had an elite game the return of another threat to the passing offense will just stretch defenses further and may be an overall benefit to green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah considering theyve only scored one passing touchdown out of attempts in the red zone it wont affect him that much i dont know what the bengals are doing in the red zone this year but it isnt right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,got him paired with evans stoked so far
fantasyfootball,not_removed,are we twins aj evans arob here life is good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drafted him last year and never once put him in my lineup like halfway through the season after most of the injuries i noticed he was theres something to be said for getting points every single game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i pulled washington last minute for gioi know washington going to go off now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr for me that was worth quite a bit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,looked like about to keep the drive alive
fantasyfootball,not_removed,about a yard gain but it would have gotten miami a first down and continued the drive instead they turned it on downs ending the game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the only worry i have is that fuller will take targets away from hopkins whereas aj is the man week in and week out as seen today
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eh i wouldnt sweat it as fuller rises and gets better it will free up coverage on hopkins more theres no question about who has the better hands of the two all the important stuff goes to hopkins anyways i think bo is the bigger problem he looked like total ass last week i think hes slightlybetterthantannehill caliber and will limit both receivers upside
fantasyfootball,not_removed,true but we all saw how hopkins performed last year with what little qb play he had so thats what ultimately made me take the trade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,arian foster
fantasyfootball,not_removed,josh gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,alshon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keenan allen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cobb in the past years has been difficult to bench because hes always been poised to break out but game after game rodgers either struggles or ignores cobb completely dez is similar but worse over the past years because hes missed time with various injuries and you never know how long hell be out cant drop him cant really trade him because his value is uncertain he just clogs a bench spot those are my plight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think you guys forgot about jeremy hill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gio bernard he will usually look like the better back on most days but as soon as the ball is down by the goal line hill comes in to take the glorious fantasy td points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,arian foster latavius murray thomas rawls dez bryant keenan allen antonio gates oh wait im just listing my team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ryan mathews
fantasyfootball,not_removed,landry because miamis play calling is not great so he hasnt piled up yards until the last minutes of every game this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in the past few years to name a few sammy watkins doug martin jordan reed dez bryant any ne rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dez 💯
fantasyfootball,not_removed,antonio gates sammy watkins chris ivory tj yeldon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio jones no hes hurt ok hes going to play this week hamstring injury nooo oh ok hes going to play goes out as a decoy gets catches questionable next week puts up yds tds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gio blows up every week you dont start him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,alshon jeffery
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maclin t austin romo ne rbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ty hilton will either get you points or
fantasyfootball,not_removed,last year every time i started woodhead he laid an egg and every time he was on my bench he had every fucking time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,honestly aj green is up there for me he will have huge games and then put up or duds throughout the year at the worst times
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cant believe djax hasnt been mentioned
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ryan mathews
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gosh jordan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cordarelle patterson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,charles this year dealing with andy one more week reid julio is pretty stressful you just have to ignore all the news and leave him in your lineup pretty much no matter what
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jeremy maclin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,vincent jackson and pretty much any rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chris ivory
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jeremy hill fumbleeeeeeee
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think bernard is more frustrating to own than hill bernard is so underused imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tj yeldon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rashad jennings
fantasyfootball,not_removed,randall cobb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,joshua j gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,josh gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,josh gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gosh jordan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,god dammit i have a lot of players in this thread
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jash garden
fantasyfootball,not_removed,currently have him i now see the frustration
fantasyfootball,not_removed,was so hopeful for him in my auction keeper league with having him for could have been the corner stone of my team for years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ugh drafted him last year and this year dude has so much talent shame he cant stop having flukey injuries
fantasyfootball,not_removed,first person to mention cobb and i agree
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and as you say that he has a yard run
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont know why hes still regarded so highly this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive had hill and bernard on my team these last few years and definitely can relate to this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gio is good player to own in ppr but hes not an every week starter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gg
fantasyfootball,not_removed,better late than never
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dion lewis was quite unfrustrating to own last yearuntil he went down for the season of course
fantasyfootball,not_removed,uh douggie and reed were great last yr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,these last two years have been brutal for dez owners
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why chris ivory
fantasyfootball,not_removed,except you start him every week and times he gives you a big week its not very frustrating
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed hes the arian foster of wrs soft tissue injuries galore
fantasyfootball,not_removed,romo never again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ultimate boom or bust
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is ff in a nutshell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,had him a few years back agreed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,finally someone other than josh gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you for switching it up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,to own
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i cant remember someone who was a bigger let down these last few years other than him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the only time ive ever had jamaal was that year after the acl tear and he went off especially that one game against the raiders with like tds and total yards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why maclin hes been pretty consistent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you own v jax
fantasyfootball,not_removed,based off this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,go away
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just watching hill run makes me upset tho
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeldon was good to me last year tj slander will not be tolerated
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wish he was good at his job
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i want to hold him but really need the roster spot with my team being full of injured rbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,some scrub receiver not surprised you havent heard of him tbh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,say it again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but lafell was clearly holding
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed the dude has amazing talent but brees never has had a probowl receiver because he spreads the ball around so much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,until it starts being never because tannehill cant keep taking the punishment hes been taking
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good totals doesnt mean they werentarent frustrating to own martin rustled a lot of jimmies in and well into reed just cant stay healthy so instead of finding a te to fill one week youre left wasting a bench spot half of the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,past few years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,martin was also less than yards away from the yard bonus with a quarter to go like times last year but tb was always playing from behind so it started that way it was super frustrating
fantasyfootball,not_removed,being great for one year doesnt at all not make them frustrating
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yup and ive had him for the past like years and its been tough at some points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is my first year not having him he took me to second my first year and was literally one of the only two worthwhile player or my roster my second year jennings kapernick ingram jbell fitz vjax i had olsen and dez and basically no one else i guess ingram was ok that year since he carried me so hard my first two years i held him way too long last year and trusted him when he came back so ive had all the flavours of dez
fantasyfootball,not_removed,points heading into week is why
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea but consistently putting those numbers up with about min to go in the game makin me sweat and shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i did for half a season a year or two ago and that was enough for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sucks bro may the fantasy gods watch over us
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive got an ir spot but my rbs are brutal and i need him back so he can disappoint me more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in a redraft league or keeper
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well hes been hurt so i mean theres that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sitting with jstew in my ir right now its a rb graveyard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ok fine jeremy hillllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keeper this is my last year thoughsaid if he went down again it was time to move on
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fosters been hurt too and you mentioned him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you right but that frustrates the hell out of me lol even though i got him off waiver after someone dropped him week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes always hurt though but never badly enough to know for a fact that he wont play hes a fucking perpetual game time decision who even had a game last year where he was active but didnt get one fucking carry look at his game logs from last year one week and fifteen carries for sixteen yards the next i ended up with him as my this year but also have mckinnon and coleman if ivory strings together a couple good games im trying to trade him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just dont jinx anything here man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,here take my other sock
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is it official
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not official yet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whoops ill resubmit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think itll get removed until it is official
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its like an abusive spouse i know hes gonna burn me but i cant help but come back to him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jd jd jd jd
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why not just resign him to another year prove it deal pay him the minimum and promise more if he plays well and stays clean
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sigh unzips
fantasyfootball,not_removed,stay offfffffff the weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this could easily be a move to drive up his potential trade price
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im drafting him in the next year no question
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont believe anything i read about gordon march the cleveland plain dealer reports its doubtful the browns give suspended wr josh gordon another chance it falls in line with coach hue jacksons stance on gordon the browns are expected to shop gordon if he gets reinstated but could ultimately release him gordons status should be known before otas
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when hes nice to you hes really nice to you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,have you seen his latest picture dude is looking large and in charge
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you know who his new qb would be right id be more concerned about brock at the helm edit i forgot rule of this sub never give an opposing opinion on hype players fragile egos get shattered in doing so
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes still on his rookie deal so whats the point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,duh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we dont take kindly to rational analysis round these parts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think his adp would be there even if he was playing maybe like round everyone on this might be a different story though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why release him hes on a rookie contract that would be dumb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah this came from mary kay cabot who is a fucking hack and shouldnt be taken seriously
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats an opinion piece from mkctake what she says with truckloads of salt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i havent stopped looking
fantasyfootball,not_removed,really doubt we start brock fully expecting them to either pull someone out of free agency or draft a qb even then its the josh gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but you editing your comment kinda shows that your ego is quite fragile lmao
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ideally ifwhen he comes back he wont be in a browns jersey i felt bad for the guy at the bottom of the thread that got downvoted to oblivion for suggesting that just because sashi said something doesnt mean its going to happen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,depends on how many people in your league like him and leagues in general i personally would take him after having wr rb te and a best skill player but i know some people in my league that would probably reach for him in the like they did last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theyre just completely over him and want to move on it will be hard to find a good trade because they know hell be released edit bet me ill go one month reddit gold that gordon will be released or traded by week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i cant believe someone is actually getting upvoted using her word over the fucking gm of the team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how chafed are you do we need to send lotion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fair enough but as of right now brock is the guy i feel like people who didnt have to deal with brock last year dont get it i dont really care its your team but look back on what he did for hopkins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that was also years ago we have no idea if he is still any good or not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats one way to look at it or maybe i didnt want to reply to anyones comments anymore because clearly to them my opinion is wrong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah its hard to swim against the over the top hype trains but at least its just fake internet points i think it would make the most sense for the browns to see what they have at his price instead of just giving away someone with his talent or potentially they could try to trade him for a pick if they thought that some team might overvalue him i hope he makes it back the drug policy is pretty difficult to get out of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the amount it costs to keep him vs the potential upside would suggest strongly that cutting him doesnt make much sense if he comes back and has a productive year its all gravy otherwise its wasted money on a cheap rookie contract or if he gets suspended again effectively no cost he has the potential to be a legit wr and its not like the browns need to free up cap space
fantasyfootball,not_removed,then dont release him they can trade him next season if he stays off drugs lol if not hes still on the rookie contract which costs peanuts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,uhhhh do you know who sashi brown is if the gm of a team is saying theyll keep a player theyre a little bit better than the cleveland plain dealer as a source
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think you might be right but ill take that bet cant wait to see josh on the ravens
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this isnt the first time weve heard that the browns want to move on from gordon though hue jackson has said the same thing i think his opinion also carries weight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,err as of right now kessler is the guy brock is in no way the guy if hes on the roster in tc hell get a chance to compete but as of this very moment the job is easily kesslers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,looked pretty good in that pre season last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cool use remind me bot to tag this comment for week if hes still on the browns ill pay up on reddit gold
fantasyfootball,not_removed,final roster decision gm coach whether or not they play him is another question
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i believe that was in the context of last season as in they were moving on from him that season and wanted to focus on the team they had now i dont entirely believe he meant he was completely done with josh gordon in the future
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah kessler is who i believe they are planning on starting unless they pick up someone in fa or the draft that they think will be better ill be interested to see how he performs behind a much better oline this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lmao preseason because starters definitely play the whole game and with the same intensity as the regular season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not a bright man how do i use remind me bot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i get that but hearing the browns might shoprelease gordon shouldnt be a surprise if thats what happens based on whats been said in the past whatever happens nothing will shock me i expect nothing and will still be let down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he looked pretty amazing but whatever avoid him at all costs hes terrible draft sammy watkins in the top of the third of course though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,remindme months is josh gordon still a brown
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my personal opinion on it is that the browns have held him this long theyre not just going to release him we wouldve done that years ago
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what does sammy watkins have to do with anything gordon is a late round flier imo i dont care who you are years without meaningful game action is a long time to be away until he actually plays some real games against starting caliber players its pure speculation as to how he will perform his return in was a disappointment ignored on this sub of course ive seen people talk about taking him in the rounds which is just nuts to me id much rather have pryor moncrief abdullah perkins and even crowder but since you love the hype train go ahead and draft christine michael again who is so bad that the packers decided they would rather start a wr at hb than him and who has been cut several times though that wont stop the sub from circlejerking oh and cmikes preseason stats were stellar too the arizona cardinals should just trade for him and cut dj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,exxxxxxactly especially after getting burned again last season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sammy has nothing to do with anything these gordon fanboys are salty because you have a different opinion about him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you need more to do with your life if you care this much christine michael sucks sammy watkins has as much credibility as a starter as josh gordon except gordon lead the league and you can get him much cheaper have a good one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,apparently posting while being bored at work is caring too much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,are you even reading what you type youre calling him out for caring too much but yet youve replied to every one of his comments it takes two to have a conversation
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that sounded a lot more important than it actually was
fantasyfootball,not_removed,second place team flipped a coin to decide if he wanted brady or big ben he also picked cobb when antonio brown was still available
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i won last week our weeks are usually one sided or close but below
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes i just lost to
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sounds about right im in my league in points and first in points against i have to win this week to make playoffs fucks that shit god is great god is great
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i won this week to
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my league usually averages but never do two teams put up plus
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think my league has had about scores of all season of the overall top were against me this week i won with a from ebron my opponent this week is projected in ppr he has bell mccoy and melvin gordon sigh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it kinda sucks with so many players being out but this is where boys turn into men you gotta know who to pickup and have the guts to play someone like toussiant or burkhead but to answer your questions yes the winner is determined by cumulative points you are allowed to change players and utilize the ww just like any other week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like the two week championships because it limits the element of luck someone in my league had brees zeke freeman gordon game he was injured evans and olsen with some others im forgetting week one of the playoff he scored exactly points in ppr that dude deserved a second chance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i once won a week championship starting josh mccown over my opponents mike mcmahon we changed the rules the next year to end week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pretty much the worst fucking part of the year a literal dice roll on a shit ton of money i cant wait to leave this league money or less money
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my league has week because we have matchups per playoff game and you play the same team over two weeks and highest total wins teams make playoffs of it reduces any oneweek flukey events and usually ensures that the better team really wins which i really like its fun being down by and coming back next week to win the ship or getting a nice point lead going into the second week knowing one of your players can not show up and you still might win i know there are problems with this week and players resting but its usually only and frankly its vital in ff to have bench depth especially by this point in the season i got homies to start if i have to sit a usual starter and thats just part of the game it sucks to go in regular season and go out the first playoffs matchup due to one random players gettin points or a goose egg or something if that happens in our league at least you get a second week to try and come back as a good draft and team management over the season can be enough to counter some crazy anomaly game let the truly best team win
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just make sure you end your regular season after week so the first round is week and the championship weeks are none of this week stuff i prefer it vs a one and done format except if im winning after the first week then lose the matchup after the second week then fuck it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in a week championship team standard scoring running back league ive somehow dealt with the aids and made it to the finals with a autodrafted squad acquisitions i could sit here bitching about the randomness and all the rest of it but i actually have enjoyed it even if everything flops at the end i feel like the better team is winning week in week out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have always played week playoffs and have loved them every year my only complaint is week playoffs can suck week playoffs and be more balanced instead of getting blown out by a point leveon bell week yes i was down and won by next week for me the ideal way would be week playoffs starting with then
fantasyfootball,not_removed,never woulda thought id be playing jacquizz rodgers tyreek hill and cameron meredith in my championship finale earlier in the year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive been in leagues for yrs nowone is teams divisions week playoffchampionship and the other is teams division no playoffs straight through weeks i much prefer the division straight through format as it makes every win all season matter and keeps a weak division winner from stealing championships just because they lucked into the playoffs and had a good or week run too many times ive seen well managed teams lose championships to barely participating owners just because their big dogs that got them to the dance sat out weeks i get the whole make great pick ups to make up for that but imho it taints the entirety of a smart well played season to have it come down to who you can dig up off the waiver wire
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed imo its part of the fun having to grab backups when starters are being rested and having two weeks per round eliminates any huge flukes that could happen with one down week from your team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im also stating meredith and jacquizz rodgers had to bench melvin gordon and elliot i started meredith last week and he did great for me debating on starting darren mcfadden or deangelo williams too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,flacco jacquizz mcfadden d will ab bell big ben miller mariota dak all out or limited im already down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in a team standard league where we do something similar we play games take week off top teams top in each division wildcard determined by most points scored advance to playoffs playoffs occur during the nfl playoffs each team drafts qb rb wr te dst in a snake draft scoring changes to tds and field goals only most cumulative points wins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the straight through sounds great but i have one question how do you keep owners interested who got a slow start and are essentially out after weeks my league has that problem even with most teams making playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,amen about weak divisions in my league made it while tie one of them lost out due to divisions
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and keeps a weak division winner from stealing championships just because they lucked into the playoffs and had a good or week run imo this is usually limited in a playoff you might get lucky and pull off a win by a few points but the dj owner is coming back next week and slaughtering the team for the second half
fantasyfootball,not_removed,woah two seasons in one dj brings you to the party then brady brings you home
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i can see that being an issueluckily the straight through league im in has dedicated owners all friends and of the time take the spoiler role on with pride when mathematically eliminated we have had some epic last week showdowns between even teams all in contention ties come down to total points scored all season which is another plus that this format brings and makes every point your starters put up all season matter we had one championship where three teams came down to pts place was points back and second was points behind the champ but yeah if guys give up that taints any league playoffs or not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its pretty unfair to tell everyone not to use fantrax based on your experience with your crazy rules ive used fantrax for many years for my college football league and its been great and their support line usually responds very quickly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ok so httphomemyfantasyleaguecomwhat are its advatanges over espnyahoo do you still need to create a league on espnyahoo sorry im a bit of a noob when it comes to running leagues and for the past years weve been doing everything in espnyahoo and im just looking for something a bit better for our competitive league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why not do your draft offline and import results into fantrax i ran a league on fleaflicker once and my members hated its mobile interface lack of app and intrusiveredirecting ads
fantasyfootball,not_removed,have never heard of fantrax but what did their customer service say about the issues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why on earth would the bills get rid of literally the only piece of their offense last year cut tyrod cut shady and sammy is never at full health either come on
fantasyfootball,not_removed,while i agree completely the bills arent exactly high on my list of teams that do smart things and that tweet is really odd otherwise
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gio bernard he will get at least touches a game some games more and he will bust big plays i really like that kind of value in those middle rounds and he is good handcuff to have if hill goes down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i really like the value on the following jeremy hill current adp is ryan mathews melvin gordon frank gore i think hill bounces back this year and finds some consistency mathews is intriguing for me because if he is healthy i think that new eagles offense will feature him and keep feeding him the rock no idea on how long that lasts but a round pick for possibly weeks of production is worth the pick to me i think melvin gordon shows why he was drafted in the round this year im not worried about the knee unless it was a dynasty league and no way he doesnt score a td this year just had a rough rookie year with team that lost all its receiving options to injuries and had no oline now frank gore is the ultimate stealcurrently round he was a top option last year at rb and as long as they dont bring in arian foster or k moreno he will again be a top option in that colts offense will only get better with new offensive line members and luck back to prevent defenses from stacking the boxfrank gore reminds me of fred jackson from the bills not a sexy pick but was always there late and helped you win multiple weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wont speak on what round to take these guys but here are some great values frank gore ameer abdullah theo riddick isiah crowell melvin gordon darren mcfadden tj yeldon chris ivory karlos williams bilal powell charles sims darren sproles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all adps per httpsfantasyfootballcalculatorcomadpphp all these guys are undervalued i believe most undervalued i will list first dion lewis was last year on a points per game basis but got hurt if you took him in the second round i wouldnt think youre crazy me personally i plan to take him in the third in every draft i can hope his adp doesnt creep up hes undervalued by at least rounds if you assume hell be healthy and the patriots will keep doing patriot things jonathon stewart i have no idea why his adp is this low makes zero sense should be a little less productive than lewis health has always been a scare for him but he was healthy most of last year undervalued by rounds danny woodhead all this dude does is produce hes a risky start week to week because he could end up with only points but he could also end up with value pick that keeps on giving undervalued by rounds latavius murray they bolstered their offensive line and ran the ball a lot last year the offense will probably be the best in the afc west and latavius is the clear bell cow undervalued by a round jeremy hill im hearing that he had a bad offseason of partying last year but his head is screwed on straight this year hue jackson is gone and though he is known for running the ball they spread things out a lot more last year the new oc is a qb coach so he may be pass happy but at the same time they lost jones and sanu so they should be lining up in more powerrun formations this year which should help a lot i would take him end of if hes there undervalued by a round frank gore was last year this is largely because he was healthy and had the outright starting job all year while other backs were getting hurt but still kept grinding it out without a qb or offensive line luck is back bradshaws gone offensive line and coordinator are better im not expecting him to win me any weeks single handedly and the last rb or older to rush for yards was i dont even know how long ago and the colts dont ever rush for yards in a game but just due to usage opportunity and durability is a steal at this adp undervalued by at least one round ryan mathews i know health is an issue but hes the starting rb on a doug pederson offense former chiefs oc who turned charles into a volume hog eagles offensive line is still very good mathews should be a high end when healthy undervalued by half a round at least ameer abdullah i know he didnt live up to the hype last year but joique is gone he has a full year under his belt and the offense couldnt possibly be any worse than it was im not expecting huge numbers but dullah should be a servicable for a very cheap price undervalued by half a round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,matt jones dude is gonna have carries next year thats enough for me to take him in the round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dion lewishes going in the early round right now but if he stays healthy he has top potential in ppr leagues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,based on current adp via fbg going into the round about rbs will be off the board in ppr leagues the clear targets would be danny woodhead and theo riddick both have been heavily used in the passing game and even with gordon back that shouldnt change much id consider taking either as early as the theres also the need for clear handcuffs if you grabbed leveon bell early dont be afraid to overpay a little for deangelo williams was extreme with injuries but they still happen and its best to be prepared karlos williams charles sims tevin coleman and derrick henry are others in this range that seem to be the clear benefactor of a starters injury if youre drafting early i also like to take a shot at some unsettled backfields every raven dolphin and colt should be available and with a later round pick you can go with your gut and maybe youll get lucky if not theyre an easy waiver wire drop early in the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i gotta think jstew will have another good year and outperform a round adp panther backfield hasnt really changed so its definitely still him carrying the bulk of the load
fantasyfootball,not_removed,matt jones anyone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id take a look at jerick mckinnon in the round or so
fantasyfootball,not_removed,forsett and dixon will at least be sharing snaps by mid season wouldnt be surprised if dixon takes over especially with any kind of injury to forsett rashad jennings also showed a lot of potential in the latter part of last year imo he might see an increased workload gio bernard will continue to get decent production and i could see melvin gordon turning it on this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i really like jonathan stewart this year again he is nothing spectacular but he isnt bad fantasy wise expect an average of points a week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,buy the sd backfield melvin gordon in the and then woodhead in the especially if in any ppr format another obvious buy is frank gore in the yes he is old but he was the number rb last year behind a horrible oline and stacked boxes i also like karlos williams gio and duke johnson you can also buy the jac backfield in this range though i would probably just take yeldon in the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably matt jones ajayi and maybe landford so far theyre hovering around the late rounds and they all have pretty good upside
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what do yall think about carlos hyde bouncing back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,was reading cj anderson lost some lbs this offseason
fantasyfootball,not_removed,chris ivory
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks id love more posts like this great talk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont know exactly what qualifies as mid round but i made this list when i first looked at matthew berrys initial rb rankings eddie lacy i buy the hype not mid i know dion lewis must start when healthy great offense slight damper with brady suspension but i still like him jay ajayi maybe my favorite to target right now jeremy langford am i missing something didnt he show tremendously well in fortes absence last year ryan mathews murray gone obviously health a concern but could produce elite s karlos williams this one is a no brainer mccoy aint getting any younger and he is an absolutely fierce runner as we all know
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kenneth dixon bal could be the starter at the end of the year wouldnt take before round though jeremy langford chi i know hes supposed to be the starter but i can see him slipping into rounds any arizona cardinals rb that makes it that far should be a top target
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont give all the secrets away haha i draft gio every year and hes exactly what you said always a perfect pick with multiple hidden values about him so many ways he can help you vs not i really like yeldon as well for a combo in the later rounds if you can make it happen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he will get at least touches a game thats not a lot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hue was the oc for each year that gio and hill were together no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hill and gordon will move up in adp httpsfantasyfootballcalculatorcomadpphp already has hill at mathews melvin gordon gore i expect hill and gordon to climb even more i would probably take a shot at duke or crowell in a mid round i know its the browns but i have a strange feeling hue might get that offense going
fantasyfootball,not_removed,where are you getting those adps im looking at httpsfantasyfootballcalculatorcomadpphp and the numbers are different
fantasyfootball,not_removed,big if for mathews
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love the riddick in late rounds especially in ppr leagues of theyre in short yardage situations it seems like times out of its a short pass to riddick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think duke johnson is going to be the guy out of the browns backfield great for dump offs for a mobile qb to me he looked more talented and explosive if he can learn to downhill run crowell job is done for
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love crowell tooi think im getting him every mock in like the roundgreat value for a guy that could get the lions share of touches
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh the abdullah hype train what fond memories we had
fantasyfootball,not_removed,add in jay ajayi gase is expected to bell cow that man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i owned of those guys last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,melvin gordon micro fracture surgery😷😷
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the knock on jstew is that he doesnt get enough tds its true but hes still a very solid back who can have big games i got great value on him last year and i wont hesitate to snag him again if people are sleeping
fantasyfootball,not_removed,unless they sign arian foster
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id expect his adp to creep up toward the round before the season but hes a guy ill be hoping to land in every league as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not a good bet to stay healthy imo but an absolute must start whenever he is and a guy ill be targeting heavily in drafts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dion lewis scares me his injury is very bad news for players that rely on quick jumps and cuts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also you can never really take a gamble on a patriots rb that high belicheck likes to vary his strategy game to game based on the strengths of the opposing defense remember when he just abandoned the run versus the jets in week id take him maybe sixth round but odds are id pass on him the workload is far too inconsistent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mckinnon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i disagree the offensive coordinator gives something like of goal line carries to tolbert or cam ends up running it in on a drawbroken play too often jstew gets vultured way too often thats not to say he wont have a good year yardage wise but hes not a home run pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes top handcuff maybe even top three behind like deangelo and karlos williamstevin coleman imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i forgot about jennings and gordon those two can be picked up towards rounds right is your rationale for gordon just a hunch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,trent richardson the hype we can believe in edit s
fantasyfootball,not_removed,forsett and dixon will at least be sharing snaps by mid season wouldnt be surprised if dixon takes over especially with any kind of injury to forsett do you not think buck allen plays a role at all personally i have no idea what to do with that backfield right now i just think the best strategy is to take the one available the latest
fantasyfootball,not_removed,right there with you i think hes got solid value for a guy you can grab in the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,buy the sd backfield nooo its a passing offense gates doesnt block terrible system for running backs woodhead produces as the checkdown machine but his weektoweek variation makes it very hard to ever start him in standard leagues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe chop kelly gets creative with him but i expect about what he did last year didnt his backup replace him for a few games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,langford showed flashes but fox is renowned for using a rbbc and kadeem carey showed some promise last year the bears also drafted jordan howard who a lot of pundits are predicting will get ample amount of playing time theres a chance langford takes the reins but even then i could see howard or carey both more physical backs poaching some goal line carries and all three of them splitting time as fox likes to ride the hot hand
fantasyfootball,not_removed,haha i know ive had gio for years now and he is normally good for points a week a great guy to have in case one of your early rounders dont work out i think yeldon is intriguing and someone i wouldnt mind snagging as well i could see him in a similar roll as gio actually and plus ivory runs hard and normally misses games so yeldon could come in handy god i cant wait i love ff
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes been in the league years i wouldnt say hes a proven perfect pick last year yes also great rookie year complete non factor year though the one year he was being drafted in round if you drafted him year it did not pay off
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its not a lot for a or most but for a mid round rb carries is all i can ask for if you can accurately predict a mid round running back to get more than carries a game then you should be winning millions in ff
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think you are using team and im using team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would take duke johnson first
fantasyfootball,not_removed,httpsfantasyfootballcalculatorcomadpphp i did standard team league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes got a greater chance than gordon i feel like from that list
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in ppr riddick would be a fantastic pick up hes gunna shine this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dunbar in dallas too he was startable in my ppr no flex league last year before injury
fantasyfootball,not_removed,me too man been saying it for months
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and abdullah might be gone for the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,especially if is respectable a running qb does wonders for rbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in cleveland with all cleveland leaguemates so unfortunately crow will be gone wayyy too high for my liking
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am not a ff fanaticare the oc and hc gone in cle if not its the same horrible coaching crowell suffers from alfred morris syndrome
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not sure if id consider him a mid or late round pick though many have him in the first four rounds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hold the phone to see where foster signs edit downvotes for paying attention to his most likely landing spot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what i find funny about that is jstew actually had the most rushing attempts inside the and about the or so most inside in the theres a notion hes only a back but he actually had plenty of opportunities last year just didnt cash in also to be fair his of team attempts for both of those are quite a bit lower than the other leaders but i dont think anybody is expecting a major regression from carolinas offense so the attempts should still be there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,doesnt help cam vultures touchdowns for himself a lot of those would be his
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah im pretty scared about that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe he burned some people last year who got hyped about him and hes just not good haha but with all those carries his absolute floor is frank gore last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dion lewis was an incredible option in ppr while healthy last year out of games i can only see one week where he would have been disappointing in ppr and he was phenomenal in most bb may switch his gameplan weektoweek more than most coaches but if lewis is healthy hes going to get the ball in some fashion every week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jms likely going to be getting a little more work this year especially as he improves as a receiver and teddy improves as a passer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh i forgot about jennings that is solid lottery ticket for a round pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,healthy keenan signing of benjamin and rivers will make for an improved passing game woodhead not being a good every down back option so id be willing to bet they will give gordon plenty of snaps this year regardless of his performance last year and just a year of experience under his belt now i dont think he will be a top rb or anything but id be pretty happy if i could snag him in the round or so
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he was hurt for almost the entire season with a stress fracture im wondering how hell be at full strength after all he was majorly hyped last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this probably doesnt mean much to yall but as a bears fan i would bet on langford holding on to the main back spot yes carey howard and hell even rodgers will get touches but i think langford will be the one people want this year in fantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,makes sense but langford passed the eye test for me last year turning in some absolutely studly performances
fantasyfootball,not_removed,average ppg in ppr in standard certainly a decent or bye week plug as for yeldon i hate drafting guys that rely on someone else getting injured to be worth starting thats why i dont bother with handcuffs if i draft them i usually drop them after a few weeks for some breakout guy on waivers i figure i may as well draft someone who i think will break out to begin with edit deangelo is one exception id make that offense is just insanely good for fantasy points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,naw look at his pretty consistent these last years if anything his lack of touchdowns in didnt help
fantasyfootball,not_removed,protip always assume
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hue has been pretty vocal that he likes crow a lot so far crow has also flashed top tier ability before and with a proper coaching staff and game plan he could be a solid way to early to tell whats going to happen in that backfield though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he absolutely killed it ppr before the injury last year his reception to target percentage was insane
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would be slightly weary about how he will come back from that injury but luckily that should lead to him being a very late round pick where he could be very good value and very low riskhigh reward cowboys almost used him like a receiver very useful in ppr if he recovers well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i miss something he get injured
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah cle has a new coach hue jackson from the bengals think hill gio type backfield but hes been talking crow and johnson up big time its way too early to see how that backfield will shake out but it will most likely be similar to how the bengals operated unless one of them really stands out lots of coach speak right now about how both can be down backs blah blah but i expect a time share
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes new coaching staff in cle this year hue jackson is the new head coach
fantasyfootball,not_removed,people are probably downvoting because new team and old age are red flags not saying i agree though the whole point is to name mid tier running backs i think on the right team he could have upside
fantasyfootball,not_removed,miami has shown strong interest
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wasnt frank gore last years if you can grab that value in the id do it every single time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not saying he isnt that doesnt make him any less valuable as a handcuff though and if the argument is that he shouldnt be classified as a handcuff id disagree
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he was okay last year but it was a pretty small sample size he beasted in week and everybody hyped him through the roof from there on he basically went down the tubes with the rest of the niners offense by midseason that shaun draughn dude was in there putting up better numbers that hyde admittedly with a ton more catches than hypd ever got until late in the year when he too went down the tubes bottom line its probably not safe to trust a niners rb this year we have no idea what the chip offense is going to look like and the niners draft was not great he shouldnt have lots of rivals for touches but if the team is just chaining threeandouts like last year the undisputed sf rb will not be a very valuable commodity anyway and i say this as a niners fan feelsbadman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im curious what the absolutely studly performances were that have you convinced he can be a formidable fantasy rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah he was pretty solid and showed some promise i think he needs to work on passcatching out of the backfield as he struggled with that last season i do think there are a few red flags when it comes to him and the least fox will give him firstly the aforementioned penchant that fox has for using the rbbc secondly the bears were actively looking to upgrade their rb corps and signed cj anderson to an offer sheet theyve also been reportedly keeping an eye on arian foster lastly they were one of the teams that were reportedly enamored with ezekiel elliot and would have drafted him had he fallen again this one is pure speculation langford is certainly the starter for now but all of these indications make me think that theyre not wholly convinced hes the guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,those are great numbers for a mid round running back and great point on yeldon but i believe he still holds some value even without an ivory injury but he is going in the round range i think and that may be a bit steep for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt touch yeldon ivory will vulture all goal line touches
fantasyfootball,not_removed,are teams more popular than teams im just curious i always assumed team leagues dominated the fantasy landscape is there empirical data to show this somewhere
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think that if crowell falters at all hes in the dog house
fantasyfootball,not_removed,labrum surgery i think
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sorry to clarify i meant hold the phone on jay if foster doesnt sign in miami which is the rumor he could be a great value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah exactly frank gore sucked if you watched any games last year but if you stay healthy and get enough carries you can default into the top nowadays
fantasyfootball,not_removed,comment was meant as an addon to yours
fantasyfootball,not_removed,weeks and sd and stl i think theyre sticking out more in my head because they were right when forte went down and i know he didnt have any big games after that but iirc forte was back for the majority of the rest of them looking at his number though youre right nothing spectacular dont forget to look at his receiving numbers in those games btw sd and a td stl edit went back and looked he only had one more game without forte in the lineup and it was a poor effort against denver i think he can be forgiven in that matchup but he did score a td after that forte was back and handling double digit tds alongside him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not sure about the empirical data but almost every adp or article i read splits the rounds out into
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team is by far the most common saw some stats on this once but i cant find them now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,apparently not as bad as everyone speculated should only miss a month
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ahh ok
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yep i have jay matt jones and langford battling for my last keeper spot i have a feeling foster lands on one of these teams making my choice easier
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh my bad lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont forget to look at his receiving numbers in those games btw thing is his receiving numbers and fantasy day in general in the rams game in particular were heavily weighted by the touchdown on a screen pass where he simply had great downfield blocking now im not knocking him for taking advantage of that — he still had to be fast enough to not get caught — but im just cautious about buying into players whose fantasy production was weighted by just a couple big plays which i guess makes my desire to own matt jones a bit contradictory lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i would rather have langford than jones coming from a redskins fan langford looks better to me but admittedly jones probably has less realistic competition for work
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ravens even if big ben is back its in baltimore
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well with the league name ordinary gentleman why not follow that up with the jag just another guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we were really boring and just called our super bowl the ship but this year i became the first repeat in league history so im buying a trophy to commemorate that so i decided upon a model of the millennium falcon that im going to spray paint gold and mount and its going to officially be the ship everyone voted and approved the idea im not just hijacking the league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jay cutlers vagina
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was thinking the log but i hate thay
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our league is called bush league so our trophy is called the merkin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,someone just texted me the brophy thought that was worth sharing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the log will take on an identity of its own i started referring to my league the oklahomiraqis league as the oil and hated how it sounded at first now it doesnt sound like anything but our league i like naming trophies after people though was there someone who was entirely ordinary in your collective lives we used to have ours named httpokiraqiorgharrington it was named after the guy who was homeless but managed to win the entire espncom fantasy championship in weve since renamed it httpokiraqiorglawson to honor a soldier we served with who was kia ditto for the httpokiraqiorgtenequer httpokiraqiorglandrum and httpokiraqiorgkillman memorial trophies except only landrum was kia the other two died in the states is there anyone youd like to honor it could be people whove passed away or an inside joke or your favorite collective team or coach hell name it the belichick trophy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the piss bucket
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shiva kamini somakandarkram
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the extraordinary trophy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our league is called aroused by football and we named our trophy the harriet tubman freedom award so it doesnt always have to be relevant with that being said id name it broseidon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my league actually has the same name based on recommendations from here we named ours the og
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shit my league is named the league of attractive men and i cant come up with a name for are team also
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the log ical conclusion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like the log clever yet simple
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the soaked biscuit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a new league name
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the sacko
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the mab man amongst boys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the trophy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats pretty freaking good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jay cutlers torn labia
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i hate it every time you talk about your league because i realize its a level of greatness mine will likely never achieve bravo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the only true name is simply the shiva
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like that one the jag rolls off the tongue although i prefer just a guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks lol i obviously put a lot of time into our league it really just takes a commish that loves doing it i dont have any children and this is something i can do on my laptop while watching tv with my wife some people garden for fun i obsessively update my fantasy football league website im working right now on a sortable spreadsheet of all fantasyrelevant retired players since their stats and fantasy points when im finished ill post it that way other leagues can take it tweak the scoring if need be and have their own version
fantasyfootball,not_removed,league players ppr pt passing td few other cusstome scoring for long td couple bonus pts for yd passing rushing etc do i keep derek carr jordan howard demarco murray gronk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr league keep two i bombed my keepers last year in ap and gurley im leaning towards doug baldwin and terelle pryor but would consider dixon if the ravens let twest walk as of right now we have to pick our keepers before we determine draft order im optimistic we change that if not i dont think i can afford to not keep evans player position cost mike evans wr doug baldwin wr terelle pryor wr kenneth dixon rb carlos hyde rb greg olsen te taylor gabriel wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hyde pryor dixon depending what the ravens do dixon could be over pryor i think hyde has a ton of talent and the shouldnt be as bad as they were this year if you pick late first round then definitely evans but that depends on what your draft order is and i think that should come first before keepers are selected you want all the information possible before you make a decision
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who should i keep keepers rounds my top options are hyde ajayi hopkins i also have bryant benjamindecker gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how many do you get to keep is there any penalty for keeping players in order howard murray gronk carr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,howard most upside and probably the safest
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its between howard and demarco of the two i currently would lean howard but this is one id definitely want to revisit later on assuming you dont have to decide now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im sorry but what are you talking about the season is over for those players am i missing something im relatively new to ff so apologies in advance d
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what is the cost for your keepers and how many can you keep
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so what round one talent will be left after keepers that really decides if you have to keep evans without knowing your draft spot in a pure redraft right now evans is likely late first round pick so i would likely gamble and not keep him but if half of the round one talent is kept ab dj zeke bell julio etc then he becomes a must keep after evans its tough as most of those seem close to where id expect them although there isnt much of an adp established for anyone yet for example baldwin is likely an early third maybe so getting him for a is meh pryor in the seems safe enough so id likely pick him gabriel in the seems close but maybe a little too early so maybe pass hyde for a is where he should go but maybe a must keep if enough round talent is being kept actually picking today it would likely be dixon and pryor for me but if enough elite talent is kept it quickly becomes evans and hyde
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we get to keep one no penalty
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there are two distinct types of seasonlong fantasy leagues the first is redraft leagues with these you start fresh every year draft a full roster play it out then your season is over the second is keeper leagues dynasty leagues are a deeper form of keeper league in keeper leagues a portion of your roster can vary from player to your full team stays under your control across seasons rules for keeper leagues can vary sometimes players cost you the pick they were drafted in the previous year sometimes that draft cost changes or sometimes theyre simply assigned to your team so theres strategy in who to keep particularly if you have multiple strong options thats what this thread is about selecting keeper options for the next season most people arent actually deciding yet that typically happens right before the draft but the strategy point comes into play particularly if you can trade keeper assets or draft picks through the offseason also its just fun to discuss and think about
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its for keeper leagues for next season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah thats the thing almost all first round talent is going to be kept the only ones that might be there are obj or bell one guy has to decide between them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in that case its likely hyde and evans that is going to be a rough start though if other teams have similar caliber players for cheaper costs ie a team might keep dj and freeman for cheap then get to use their first and second round to get good players while you are spending those picks on keepers good luck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol one team gets dj for a and freeman for his i whiffed hard last year on gurley and ap as my keepers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the biggest impact i can imagine is that the zerorb strategy would gain more traction and rbs might be less valued in drafts because of increased probability of injuries i can imagine most wrs surviving a few more games rbs may have more trouble staying healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just a longer regular season if you make the regular season the same and just extend the playoffs youre excluding your owners that didnt make the playoffs from playing best to keep everyone involved and having fun as long as you can
fantasyfootball,not_removed,regular season would be weeks playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think a lot of it depends on how the bye weeks are scheduled you dont want the playoffs happening during the bye weeks so if bye weeks go through week then most people will probably do a longer regular season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised if you saw a lot more of players being rested in games where teams have a leadadvantage other than that not much different
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it shouldnt impact much because if they were smart they would extend the regular season by one week and give every team gets two bye weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,players would get more points over the course of the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,week would matter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i know as commissioner i would increase bench size at least two spots if they did this to allow managers a chance to fill the holes the injuries will create without having to go to the wire
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it would delay my being mathematically eliminated from the playoffs by weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not just injuries but committees becoming even more prevalent then they already are to keep the rotation fresh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,big one here it would be a lot like fantasy basketball
fantasyfootball,not_removed,of their season total for more game scratches head
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely particularly late in games when teams are ahead
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah but then really deep leagues get more fun
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im wondering if a second bye week in the season would counter this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not so total games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,does this help httpwwwprofootballreferencecomfantasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if its not pf i dont know thats how my leagues are
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its probably or division record if you have divisions just check your settings itll be in there if you want post screenshots to the commishleague issues thread and people will help you figure it out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks it was thats many clicks to analyze the playoff seeding
fantasyfootball,not_removed,look back every sunday night this is always posted
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it depends on how much of a bitch you are
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hopefully if you have a dst left its the vikings and they are playing chicago then yes play them lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,take the w and sit or take the likelihood of getting the w and adding to your points so come playoff time and possibly being in a tie breaker those points could either save you or kill you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sooo youre considering benching the best defense in the league you dont deserve them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,most of the time you dont see dst with large negative scores unless you are purposely playing the shitiest defenses so unless the game is won by a very small margin i dont see why you wouldnt gives your team more points for at worst it takes away a couple
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it honestly depends on the score and the dst assuming you have the vikings d and arent a jabroni with the chicago d start em no fuckin way vikings dont sack cutler and cause turnovers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if youre up by or more you sit em
fantasyfootball,not_removed,more likely to annoy you if i post it so i just went for it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah but i already won and trash talked only up by im afraid to be greedy what if cutler throws tds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre an awful person like sityourdefense awful
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ehh id sit dude
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the reason why he has decided to do this is because after this weeks games there are exactly weeks until the first game of next season nah the reason hes doing this is probably because he blew through the league dues when he collected and cant afford payouts right now lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,next season you should pay dues in weekly increments as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im sure thats awful and annoying for you but over here as someone who will never have to deal with a week ff payout this is hilarious
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cmon though hes fucking with you who cant come up with like yes im a poor student but i work your commish is either a bum or yrs old
fantasyfootball,not_removed,get a new commissioner or have a master of coin that deals with the money as he obviously should not have control of it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not cool would not be returning to that league next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,put his ass on blast
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pro tip join leagues with leaguesafe only oh and your commish is either messing with you or a douche
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as far as im concerned thats theft and should be dealt with as such
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wouldnt doubt it its a damn good excuse if thats the case but fuckkk me right lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i did this in my league one year and it really fucking sucked missing the playoffs lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes its settled
fantasyfootball,not_removed,people who are poor college students who have to pay for phone bills car insurance food etc its really not that hard to understand if someone cant dish out for fantasy football however him blowing through the money is fucked up and hes irresponsiblean awful commish in that manner
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got third place once and he gave me my entrance back it was a team entrance fee too shit was serious wut
fantasyfootball,not_removed,make it daily weeks is separate payments you can lend literally just give him like a quarter a day
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sometimes when you make up stories you misplace facts and shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i paid still whats the difference
fantasyfootball,not_removed,truthfully i wouldnt mind a huge sack of quarters if i won id think of my badass season at the vending machine everyday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,truthfully i wouldnt mind a huge sack of quarters if i won id think of my badass season at the vending machine everyday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,truthfully i wouldnt mind a huge sack of quarters if i won id think of my badass season at the vending machine everyday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,got em lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,truthfully i wouldnt mind a huge sack of quarters if i won id think of my badass season at the vending machine everyday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,truthfully i wouldnt mind a huge sack of quarters if i won id think of my badass season at the vending machine everyday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,these guys are all lying
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wait a minute sack quarters you guys are still talking about football arent you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,te dilemma graham nyj witten sf or tamme vs car this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,standard league would you guys go with pitta ebron tamme henry or allen this week i currently have pitta but am worried that hes more helpful in ppr than standard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,got a couple shit options to choose from brate v den or barn was
fantasyfootball,not_removed,catanzaro or hauschka standard man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team standard player opponent delanie walker hou kyle rudolph nyg
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ros bengals or panthers standard team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr dst options detroit pittsburgh or jacksonville leaning towards detroit at the moment
fantasyfootball,not_removed,espn standard scoring ravens vs raiders or jets vs seahawls bottom barrel but dont have any other options
fantasyfootball,not_removed,standard scoring choose kelce pit pitta vs oak
fantasyfootball,not_removed,should i drop texans d and start streaming im tossing up between ravens and redskins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eric ebron or delanie walker didnt play last weekpick one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so is jimmy graham going to be real deal is martellus bennett going to become more consistent my ol man gates is down for the intermediate future and may be replaced by my bolts superstar new te im trying to figure out who to play this week between graham and bennett any thoughts what about ros
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ppr fleener sd zach miller det
fantasyfootball,not_removed,espn standard defense rules im streaming defenses this week do i roll the dice with redskins jets or bills im not particularly enamored with any of them but i just need something passable to get me through the week after being burned by the steelers defst
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go witten
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i go graham here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pitta seems to be the safest with a decent amount of upside as well especially against a lousy raiders pass d i also like ebron because hes done well so far but i wouldnt be surprised if he isnt utilized terribly much in what should be an easy win vs the bears probably a lower floor and lower upside this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i generally wouldnt recommend hardly any receivers vs the broncos d i like brate in his new unquestioned starting te role in tb with asj gone but i dont think this is the week he solidifies himself as a fantasy and stands out barnidge looked pretty good last week and he should be safe for at least points vs washington with possible td upside
fantasyfootball,not_removed,henry unless julius gets a full practice in imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,catanzaro hard to trust seattles offense this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kyle dudes getting tons of targets and is bradfords number behind diggs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im rolling with rudolph until walker is confirmed near rudolph just has so much upside due to the amount of volume hes gotten so far this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in the same situation walker vs rudolph going with rudolph
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think your best bet would be to check out this post as many of the users find these weekly rankings to be helpful my analysis hauschka has started poorly but is generally considered a top tier kicker for a seahawks team that tends to settle for low scoring defensiveminded games this is more true for last year though as the hawks offense has been abysmal for the most part this year for a short tldr hauschka probably has a better ceiling this week but i think everyone would agree that lambo has one of the highest floors out of all kickers in the matchup against the saints if you want to play it safe lambo if you can afford to take a chance haushka lastly i personally dont find any kicker other than gost to be worth holding through his bye but this all depends on your league and the ww good luck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,never washington lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,panthers for sure
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i would lean towards that as well chicagos offense is dismal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,raiders have a good o so id probably choose the jets especially if rw is injured there arent any other options though these are pretty rough
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kelce such a vital part of that offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not unless you have a really good ww pickup you need to play texans are going to be just fine without watt and are usually ranked a top dst from what ive seen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think walker is going to play this week either i have him in my secondary league and went ww shopping hell not be in any case definitely ebron
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go pitta i think fleener still is overrated and had a fluke game until he proves he can be consistent pitta is the safer bet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,any insightreasoning you wanna add to that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,awesome thank you thats what i thought as well i dropped ebron earlier this week for pitta under the same thought process but was second guessing myself i feel like tier tes are such a crapshoot sometimes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what do you think about doug baldwin in the flex then my other option is telvin coleman john brown chris ivory and theo riddick im hesitant to put coleman in because they face the panthers and the rest are meh baldwin seems like a good option im sure not sure
fantasyfootball,not_removed,great thank you pitt vs kc and jacksonville vs ind are at least at home where they should be better pitt just hasnt done anything fantasywise seems like detroit should be able to get to hoyer but im kind of worried about howard having himself a game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lions colts jags and giants are available
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you should reply to some too its expected that you dont just come in here ask for detailed analysis and then bail grahams only had one good game and russell is banged up dont trust that yet i expect carolina d to own atlanta san francisco d is awful so is their offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tes in general can be a crapshoot lol and if pitta keeps producing for another week or two he aint tier rest of season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would agree that baldwin is the better flex play but still doesnt get my hopes high for the entire seattle offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its cause they play the browns but miami showed us that anything is possible browns may be able to get some points with their qb situation
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id go with either the jets or the colts jets are the better defense but face a better opponentalso depends on rws injury while the colts are more porous but are facing an offense that makes a lot of mistakes in the jags of those two id still probably lean toward the jets as a better floor but the colts probably have a higher ceilingkeep in mind that this still may be a ceiling in the single digits as the jags have a good offense when theyre not throwing it to the wrong guys lastly the giants have the best defense out of that group behind the jets but i just dont see them doing well when their secondary is banged up and their o is going against minnys d
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats fair but when i posted my original comment there werent any other comments yet ill go check some out now thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,very true only thing that concerns me is the lack of red zone targets in a standard league that can kill you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is awesome
fantasyfootball,not_removed,very cool
fantasyfootball,not_removed,love your league been trying to work on a league website for mine as well and youve been a huge reference for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why was the link removed ive been looking to start one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how did you decide draft order
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont show that the link was removed but here it is again httpokiraqiorg
fantasyfootball,not_removed,champion gets first choice of draft position secondplace gets second choice etc until the lastplace team receives whatever position is left
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cool thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably why the rehab announcement occurred
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so the kid is jg didnt get paid by cle last year he stood to make a million this year if he played financial decision
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love blount this year hes a cheap pick that can be had late and has potential plus he knows the system and i could see them leaning on the run a bit more the first games everyone is discarding him but hes a great depth guy to have that could churn out a few big games if not more hes looked great this preseason too and not to mention the patriots oline will be improved over last season plus develin is back this season after missing pretty much all of last year and hes a beast of a fullback he definitely helps open up some lanes for blount
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he definitely has potential value but guessing the pats rb situation is near impossible id say blount or white have the best shot at having a fantasy impact but which one if either is the guy to play is hard to tell i would like to have blount in my bench but i dont think id be happy with any realistic situation in which i have to start him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he will be the run running out the clock when the pats are up he has value in certain games he has bellicheks trust
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its hard to see him being worse than last year when he was a serviceable back averaging ppg
fantasyfootball,not_removed,take a look at the first teams we are play all pretty good at the run d just be careful
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a pats fan i think white is the only person even worth rostering in that backfield he is a decent lowcost ppr option and should get a handful of targets per game he also has big play potential i have no idea why his projections are so weak but hes a poor mans dion which isnt that bad starting blount is incredibly risky because there will be games where bill might just decide to not play him for an entire half high ceiling low floor i dont waste bench spots on veteran players i will never consider starting edit if you have an ir spot free stash dion he will probably be back after the bye week and will be an asset come playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drafted him in the round but ended up trading him for jared cook hes got potential but its too much of a wildcard for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he might be cut
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey they play arizona week dont count on a blow out specially with no brady
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what about gaffney
fantasyfootball,not_removed,edit if you have an ir spot free stash dion he will probably be back after the bye week and will be an asset come playoffs have him and doing exactly this dear god lewisplease just make it to the playoffs without getting reinjured
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and jared wildcard cook isnt you got hosed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,source
fantasyfootball,not_removed,because we can run the two te sets for a majority play blount on weak run d teams like the colts and play white on sold run d teams like the jets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,right certain games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,white is definitely the better play for this matchup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gaffney is barely making the team this next week will decide if gaffney or foster get bumped to the ps hes all hype right now and is basically there to spell blount
fantasyfootball,not_removed,are you in a team league if not then no you shouldnt be reaching this far down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just coming back to say you were right i ended up having to drop cook to pick up ware so that made up for it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,truthful statement
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nope i drafted him with my last pick just bc the patriots rb position always seems to be a crap shoot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey its still week but good on you to snatch up ware on such short notice surprised he was available for you because he sure as shit wasnt available for me to pick up charles owner
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same in a team i grabbed him with my last pick just to see how week plays out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team i have brady on my bench but i also have matt ryan currently spotting him in my lineup i was offered ty hilton for brady should i make a move should i ask for cooks instead please help ya boy out edit ive now been offered larry fitzgerald by another buyer thoughts

fantasyfootball,not_removed,i offered someone t coleman and k benjamin for stafford then he tried to counter offer his palmer for my k benjamin and l bell he said my offer was horrible then came back with that was my offer really that bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr guy in my league is completely decimated with injuries has jordan howard and orleans darkwa as his starting rbs hes offing up marvin jones for a reliable rb technically i believe latavius murray is a reliable rb and i could probably get the trade done after the trade ill be left without a solid but will have jones marshall and jones jr who should i offer to try and get an im possibly targeting demarco murray shady hyde gordon gore crowell thoughts qb stafford eli rb eddy lacy latavius murray spencer ware dwayne washington cameron artispayne wr julio jones brandon marshall randall cobb michael crabtree jameson crowder quincy enunwa

fantasyfootball,not_removed,team standard my tom brady dwayne washington will fuller for his mike evans my other rb are bell forte mckinnon and dixon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr what do you think of this offer im gonna make my randall cobb for his tyrell williams or my demarco murray randall cobb for his cj anderson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,standard i trade brandon marshall and ryan mathews i get legarrette blount and willie snead have dj and jc at rb and jarvis landry dt jordan matthews pryor trav benjamin and maclin at wr so im looking to shore up my rb depth im big on ryan but blount seems more dependable and bmarsh hurts to lose but feels more expendable given the upside of my other guys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,full ppr my julio and moncrief for his sanders matthews and crowder i have been ravaged by injuries so i needed to do something bold did i screw myself over
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team standard my team qb rivers dalton wr hilton cobb maclin tyrell williams crowder parker rb miller lacy cap morris te gronk pitta k tucker dst cards his team qb rodgers stafford wr fitz evans tate crabtree rb d murray mckinnon langford howard white te witten k santos boswell dst eagles what would be a fair offer for stafford dalton pitta dalton alone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team standard my leveon bell for his brady and d williams i have david johnson and melvin gordon as my two starters im streaming qbs at the moment and i figured d will is just a stash in case bell gets hurt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,team ppr my matt ryan and matt jones for his cam newton
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea i should have kept evans but i was already down of my top picks had keenan allen not got hurt i would have kept evans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in a super competitive league waiver wire is bone dry i wish i was in a league where even crowder was available
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was offered david johnson for mike evans and dwayne washington i have good receivers team ppr is this a good deal for me thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my dez for his tate ppr starts after the completed catch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,take ty and run
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dion and standard isnt better than wilson on your bench for a possible late year run like last year ppr is a different story take russell and drop rivers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you have ware need rbs badly and have wrs for days all of those things otherwise i would take a good hard look
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id be ok with that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its a pretty even trade imo rodgers loves jordy but millers workload is through the roof maclin could be good he gets a lot of targetstime will tell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,huge upgrade at rb you will be fine with maclin kelvin diggs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think you did really well at first i thought you could do much better but then i saw your rbs you upgraded your team with this trade and im sure the other guy did too nelson is a tough loss he has some huge upside but getting lamar miller nullifies that loss for you good job
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if youre really worried about the toe then i would take it i think you slightly overpay but not a horrrible deal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no mathews cant stay healthy and coaching isnt fully committed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if crow is your or then take it if you regularly start him dont
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id do that the eagles offense should be a lot smoother than the browns
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i honestly have no idea why you would do this i dont see you getting any more elite than dj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seems odd in a keeper league to give up a young rb doing well right now i understand youre trying to get pieces to trade for other pieces but thats very risky and if it doesnt pan out your team doesnt come out stronger from this trade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would stand pat david johnson is the most valuable piece this season and almost certainly next he should probably be you keeper so that should be a huge factor couple this with the fact that you dont need a wr at all forte will probably finish outside of the top rbs ros this is a nobrainer decline for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in a keeper league i would hold very right onto dj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you mustve went zero rb haha but ab is not equivalent to bell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id trade brown for bell if you can finagle something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,see if you can use the second offer to make the owner from the first offer sweeten the pot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats your record and your outlook its a buylow on decker for sure but you may not be able to afford holding out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nah dont do it thomas could prove to be a stud going forward
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this helps your team as it is currently constructed normally i would lean toward decline but you need rbs badly and jennings is widely undervalued derrick henry is one hell of a lotto ticket but i think you can stomach it go for it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you need gurley as well you have no top rbs besides him and maybe blount
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a waiver pickup for a top wr easy do it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id take this in a heart beat
fantasyfootball,not_removed,really depends on your depth i think its fair i would lean towards the landry side you know what youre getting there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes howard could turn out to be a boom heard really good reports from him out of camp and the draft landry always has a high floor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its a gamble as a bears fan im high on howard and snead looks great but landry is by far the best player in the deal do you feel lucky
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nah dont trade obj not sure if id even counter you dont have much else to give up for cjs current going rate
fantasyfootball,not_removed,with murray and charlesware u need obj more than cj i wouldnt make a move here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id say you need obj more than cj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont do that i think youre taking a loss at rb and wr here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont like this at all
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like this for you people still seem to have a bad taste in their mouths from demarco but he is solid as hell right now and has a sweet schedule you are also buying low in maclin who i think will be huge later in the season mccoy is coming up on a tough schedule and jeffery is overrated imo qb troubles not much help
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pls dont do this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes sea is built to run the ball
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who are you getting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would say no to this i think that bell will be competing with david johnson for on the year forte should finish as a top back you also have two pass catchers leaving in the trade while not getting any back i say no no no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would not do this kelvin had one bad game and lacy is only trending up charles and watkins are both injured and are complete risks this is bad for you do not do this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would prefer to stay not injury prone here benjamin will be good lacy should be borderline top
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt want watkins on my team i think kelvin is going to bounce back big time id hold on to your guys the injury risk is too much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think this trade favors you considerably in smaller leagues especially favors the person making the upgrade and you dont even have to give up a starting rb to get your upgrade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think the trade favors him maclin is not doing so hot right now partially due to smith the targets are there but not the production he faces pit this week and has a bye the following week i would use the two to get something better i find a more solid considering your rb depth
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think you gotta take that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tough one but you gotta go with the proven commodity in jeffrey here i think who are your other wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shew this is tough with alshon you get to see if hes gonna play every week which isnt fun he has shown to be productive while being banged up though pryor is just crazy right now he has potential to litterally throw for yards or catch out of your wr slot its nuts with him i honestly dont know which doesnt really help but its another set of thoughts for you to consider hope i helped sorry dude
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would definitely take this trade just for the name value alone alshon is worth it wait for him to have a big week and flip him for someone else
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you should be asking for more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would do it upgrade your depth into talent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nope dont do that maybe ask for a better wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre not hurting for a rb or wr so take it just for the dez upside especially when romo gets back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would do this you have the depth
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is an upside trade for you you can totally afford it and he gives you another trade chip later in the season whether you want to move him or another stud wr you should win your team with that roster its absolutely stacked
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its fair those two are pretty close ros season for me also you didnt really bypass a bye week as hopkins still has his
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you can get obj and coleman then yeah but dont get greedy and scare him off imo its already a great deal for you plus i think evans may be more valuable than obj in ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mike evans is good especially in ppr if you can get him to bite on obj i think i would pull the trigger
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol no this is just bad you lose with both players
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you definitely make some offer i rank them fitz dt hilton tyrell crabtree in terms of who id be want to keep but i am a cards fan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn i am a mark ingram owner and thats tough arob has been seriously underperforming and i fear that continues for at least one more week his career stats vs colts over games is surprisingly bad for his standards including a performance if he was playing better itd be an immediate trade but i fear trading for arob right now if anything ingram should gain some value after his good matchup with the chargers this weekend
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hello again friend id try to target a diggs or landry if you think either might bite on latavius i fear his production is going to go down and go down fast hes very touchdown dependent and theyre also a serious rbbc right now for some reason which also scares me i think personally if i owned diggs or landry i wouldnt trade either for lmurray but theres no hurt in offering especially after landrys poor performance tonight if it continues e i also wouldnt rule out trying to trade him for edelman if that guy isnt paying attention to brady coming back pissed off in week and you get to immediately reap the benefits as they take on a porous browns defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey its the same person who just helped you if you can get forte do it forte is being given one of the largest workloads in the league and is performing with it powell is a clear handcuff for him but is not a necessary handcuff but would be nice to have as insurance powell probably wouldnt be too difficult to get in a trade and is on the wire forte is being given touches a week and if performing with it hes a legit ros take forte and run if you can get him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just to contribute a data point i landed landry for crow and michael floyd barf literally during the game in espn standard now would be a great time to broach the trade as anecdotally the owner in my league was reluctant until about the quarter of the game when they quickly accepted i love the crow but latavius has a bigger name and cache than crow does if the owner of landry is rbneedy tonight is probably your best bet to catch them when theyre semitilted hope it works out d
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea do it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,take that without even blinking e and how in the world do you land forte cja murray and gurley on top of arob and landry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes good trade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ok what is he offering
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that other guy would be stupid to accept that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i kind of like taking thomas cause alshon is always injured and who knows whos gonna be starting at qb for the bears
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no edit god no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nope healthy watkins with the ball being thrown to him is a top receiver
fantasyfootball,not_removed,would hold onto foster your rb depth behind bell is on a downward trend due to brady coming back and murray being in a committee now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you have enough wr depth i wouldnt do this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why not aim for an wr you already have rbs better than mckinnon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ivory is a flex or emergency backup ros dixon is a wildcard and could have upside i would go for dixon because harbaugh has already stated that he is unhappy with his teams rb production
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think its a great deal for you although youre gonna be hurting at rb until martin comes back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im a lamar miller owner and thats a great deal so much versatility youre likely getting a and for an
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt you kind of need gurley and charles sims will become less useful when muscle hamster returns and i dont trust mckinnon thats just my two sense though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would do this smith and lockett have little to no value in mans right now i dropped allen a week ago colts run a two te set with allen doing the dirty work of lead blocking and staying at the line for pass protection
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you get really good value here but you give up rb depth in a rb injury ravaged season ultimately i say yes but you need a backup rb badly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats tough ty hilton appears to be the guy going forward at least weeks for moncrief and if that juicy stat line from last weekend is any indication of his ceiling youre in for a treat todd gurley is in a really shitty situation fantasywise seeing as teams will constantly stack the box and commit to stopping him at all costs really limiting what hes capable of i think id take the ty hilton but a lot of people will disagree with that i just think with gurleys schedule factored in as well hes too boomorbust for me with a buzz that the name gurley gives him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love ty but id do it just because todd will have so many looks all year and worst comes to worst this year feels pretty good for ww wrs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,of youre getting reed this is a steal i assume you have at least wrs that are better or equal to sharpe meanwhile the only te with more potential then reed is gronk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whoever is getting reed is stealing tajae sharpe has proved to be nothing but a disappointment and while reed hasnt done much better in that department he absolutely will ros him and cousins play much better at home cousins shoots all the way up to completion at home and i expect they have a much better weekend this go around so buy now if you can on that deal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,reed is much better than sharpe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,absolutely not marvin jones is going to cool off and i think if you want to sell out of the risk of gronk you can get a better wr to do it for a mike evans hell maybe even obj if he has another poor performance this weekend vs minnesota depending how crazy the obj owner is the one in my league has offered him for mike evans hopkins and green now e and then you add cmike into it and youre getting robbed at that point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no gronk and c michael on their own are possibly better than marvin jones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats you losing big time way too much hype on the zeke piece kelce ebron and dorsett should find a place while moncrief is gone another weeks forte is nothing to laugh at youd need to be trading like freemankelcedorsett for zekeebron forte too high caliber imo for this deal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seems decent curious why youre including an extra wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah they have no use to you on your bench
fantasyfootball,not_removed,trading with your opponent this week if he takes that offer youre a straight bandit d theres no way that i ever would jstew is out another month and cobb at the moment looks like a total bust you are basically getting lamar for free of course jstew will come back at some point but with his constant vultures his ceiling is always capped low and cobb could return to form but at this rate that seems unlikely if i were your opponent id probably want jmatt and alshon for lamar likely the lamar owner is frustrated by the lack of tds so he is willing to sell him very low i would want rb value though and that is worth a highend and lowend edit just remembered its full ppr in that case id want jmatt and probably riddick since you likely wouldnt want to give up both jmatt and alshon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do that immediately
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id do it you need a halfback and youre still getting a quality starting qb in return
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea i definitely do it for hyde maybe you can get more rb depth than palmer if possible but if not the trade is beneficial for you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no way man cmike is borderline and williams is an upside rest of season youd be way overpaying
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no cmike is good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,blountdt for julio blounts value is at a high point and while his usage will remain high throughout the season it will be a bit more sporadic when brady returns giving white a few more snaps and dion whenif he returns dt is coming off a a high point where he narrowly scored a last minute td and julio should be a major upgrade over dt ros hilton looks to be a stud moving forward for the next several weeks and beyond so id want to hold on him and possibly sell high in a few weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes although whether its blount or hilton depends on who else is on your team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crowder or stills matt ryan for matt jones straight up isnt that bad of a trade so i wouldnt overpay to get it done definitely dont move on maclinsanders if the guy is pushy then cobb might be worthwhile if he has a better rb for you to bargain for cobb still holds a little name value and could return to form if the packers can continue their week trend after their bye
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ryan and cobb are too much for matt jones you have some good wr depth to get a better rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre welcome
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what matthews and what m jones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sorry dude i feel like id be overpaying cobb for matt jones and matt jones is better than washington i dont know i dont think you did well there and thats why youre having second thoughts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rather have kelvin but i do like crowell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kelvin side
fantasyfootball,not_removed,unless i was thin at rb id want kelvin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i traded rashad jennings and jeremy maclin for martin so i think this is giving up to much try a lesser wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,anyone solid you can pick up from the waiver or what would he drop if he does that trade cuz im assuming he getting rid of two guys from his bench as well since martin should be in his ir
fantasyfootball,not_removed,which rbs do you have in mind murray should be solid rest of season i like cooper more hes in for some positive td regression than landry assuming this is a standard league ppr theyre more equal id be looking to package murray landry for a non toptier think cja mccoy ingram i dont think i sell cooper given that your current wr situation lacks bonafide studs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i do this especially in ppr edelman will become a ppr monster upon bradys return the potential multiweek absence of dez makes this even easier to pull the trigger on
fantasyfootball,not_removed,take edelman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre giving up too much to upgrade m jones to julio i wouldnt want too much investment in that eagles backfield especially given pedersons liking to sproles running the ball and the multiback rotation freeman looks like a solid at worst moving forward and gio may be getting some more snaps in the near future depending on how jhills shoulder looks after the game tonight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes that would be a great trade for you and would vastly improve your team overall
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i keep aj and try to get rid of robnsion or hopkins first
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ware for henry a pretty lateral move but would be mutually beneficial so you each have the respective handcuffs why bother for cj though i would want to keep dixon and washington over cj and its not even close
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you take this trade the moment its proposed the guy is probably worried about m jones hamstring but weve already seen what he can do and has the potential to easily finish as a top wr sheppard is solid but that wr core is so loaded that it will be hard to predict the games where he goes off hes more like a weekly with upside
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well hyde for julio sounds good for you on paper but hes getting so few targets despite playing teamss with worst secondaries oak no bucs but hes still a stud i wouldnt give up hope on him but it sounds like you are lacking rb depth so definite close call
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is pretty equal i like lacy moving forward especially over gore so if you need rb help this is the trade to make obviously youre taking a downgrade at wr but not quite that much arob will still get his this season and i feel bortles play should improve as the season moves forward and the team figures out their running game situation overall its an solid upgrade at rb and a downgrade at wr this could be mutually beneficial depending on each of your needs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it depends on rb depth i like green a lot more than robinson especially with how shitty the jags are playing and how he struggles against better defensecorners lacy is better than gore but not by that much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is a horrible trade for you aj green stock is at an all time high you can do way better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like this trade given the gordon news and deckers shoulder injury rawls isnt someone id be actively trading for but crabtree would be a great addition to cover your current wr situation wheaton holds no value as far as im concerned so its basically mckinnon for rawlscrabtree which feels like a good trade for you to make
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man your rb situation looks a little rough latavius has been relying on tds for point so your top two are whoever the chiefs start and mckinnon it feels like you are downgrading at rb and would be super touchdown reliant for any rb points which feels unreliable to me that being said crabtree seems like he would either be your or fit into your flex beside hopkins and decker who are both super solid you have two solid wrs but and two kind of solid rbs back up vikings player whos starting position is like and whoever the chiefs start which hopefully wont be rbbc and murray who relies on tds for points it seems like you are either going to start mckinnon or crabtree after this so decide which one you want to start if i were you i would do it because crabtree feels safer than mckinnon but then your rb situation is a little dicey but still pretty good in a man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you can get either id pull the trigger i like gordon a little more moving forward better qboffense situation but mccoy would be awesome too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like gordon since the top pass catching options are out for the season or out week to week but shady is proven whos your other wrsrbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes mccoy is a proven stud and weve been witnessing blounts ceiling blount becomes a bit more of a wildcard once brady returns so i take mccoy all day
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes ahem yes you can trust shady all season last season with brady in blount would either have huge games or for and no tds i like shady much more than the pats rbs blounts still a solid play this week though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pretty equal if youre liking benji here more then i dont blame you to pull the trigger each will continue to have week winning leagues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id give landry for pryor and sims or try and trade them doug martin for something since they have the handcuff it may just be me but i wouldnt sell hopkins that low
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think you are better off with blount and shepard murray has been getting the goal line touches but his production otherwise isnt impressive jeffrey is on a bad offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i disagree w boomboom hes right that murray has been getting fewer touches but as a blount owner last year i can tell you it is absolutely maddening to own a patriots rb bellichick is completely unpredictable and outside of gronk and edelman maybe you cant trust anyone once brady comes back i expect more or less touches games for blount id also rather have jeffrey than shepard jeffrey is all the bears have as a weapon whereas shepard has to compete with one of the best wrs in the league and a resurgent cruz for targets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you can get b marsh for crowder do it j matt for b marsh is a bit harder but you dont win championships playing safe go for the higher ceiling player the guy who was the number receiver last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes you make this trade the upside for bmarsh once hes fully healthy is too great and is worth the risk if you think you can offer crowder first without scaring him off try that otherwise i definitely do jmatt for bmarsh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all day i take this especially if you are solid at rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yep you do this and dont look back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,was this proposed to you before or after dez injury news either way yes coleman is a flex with tremendous upside but a low floor with the timeshare and dez is injury prone with an injury prone qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,those two backs are pretty solid i would straight up drop bortles right now you could definitely trade wilson or stafford for more rb depth i think you update your since your backs are the main offense for their respective teams
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i take this because with gordon taking a leave you have too many question marks at wr landry despite tonights game is still a ppr monster and you are solid at rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i really hope you didnt take this trade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree trading bell right now seems like a panic move i agree with trying to shuffle watkins what you pick up isnt bad however ware isnt dead in the water yet try trading him to the jc owner for a rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you need to do this i know its tough but your rb situation is awful shady and cmike give you weekly starters cmike is borderline moving forward and hes basically giving you edelman for free given watkins value right now edelman will only get better with bradys return think borderline so this trade works out great for you moving forward
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont like losing the best player in the trade but you are getting quality for stud coming off injury yes suspension but last year injured and the other will make you nervous each week give me shady cmike and edelman for watkins and bell all day
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes this is basically trading julio and a for luck and a and theres no way luck is worth anywhere near that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i probably want dt in this situation because denver could be legit and everyone worries me about alshons frailty
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do it blount falls off at least a bit when brady comes back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,blount is so shaky when brady is back id do it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yessss do it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this one is really situational need to know who your back up rbs are since you are trading one for a wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like it for both sides if you need an upgrade at rb i would rather have the millerjordy side though accept the trade on sunday possibly to ensure you will get players next week when miller blows up sunday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id do that bummer giving up evans but nelson and miller are studs in their own right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there are both studs and i like evans a bit more because of his playoff schedule and he gets the most production on the field compared to obj to shepard and cruz
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i definite take gronk for minnesota def you can easily stream defense in a team league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mccoy and jones alshon is just not realiable and its week and i think its a miracle he hasnt missed a game jones is on a much better offense with a much better qb i also think mccoy is more valuable moving foward
fantasyfootball,not_removed,side a jones is gonna come back down to earth matt forte is a much more viable option than mccoy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like side b with watkins being injured mccoy seems to be involved a lot more and can produce very well same thing goes with bears not confident with jeffery with his injury or hoyer instead of cutler i think jones is on fire right now and could stay in top wr with stafford playing like a beast forte is still an amazing rb but i just see more upside with the other side
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would want marvin and mccoy hands down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you think ingram can hold your flex all year not a bad trade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like matt jones okayish i think tate is not so good and cobb will turn around your rb situation is kind of alarming to me though i think crowell falls to earth soon gurley remains to be seen id consider taking it but id try to get maybe christine michael depending on how much he loves him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think with your wr depth you should do it rawls is going to be out for a while and based on last week cmike has a lot potential to keep that production up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hold maclin he will pick it up and even what he is doing now is better than injured dez
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like maclin ros feel like hes going to be a pretty consistent and alex smith leans on him more than weve seen dak suggest he wants to lean on dez
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shouldve kept evans in a few weeks you might think shouldve kept dj but gordon edelman isnt bad if you are trading him you definitely need or guys you can start over washington maclin tate if they dont pick it up you are hurting at rb outside of dj try to strengthen that by getting demarco lamar mccoy and another solid starter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,run and take thatif you are decent at rb position
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i really like the trade but how your rb depth i dont think charles is playing till week and probably not going to take all the carries himself in the first game back i dislike cobb a lot right now and olsen seems to be the top te right now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,take it and run if you can spare a rb and need a better te
fantasyfootball,not_removed,your rbs are fine great really but i would want bell over an maybe hobbled julio but that leaves you pretty thin at wr right after marvin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,your rbs are good and you could shore up your wr depth a little so maybe try offering someone like sneadsanu for matthews or maclin julio and bell feel pretty even cmike feels better than marsh maybe he has a wr you like more than he does to get a third wheel on this tricycle of roster movement
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nope not trading away a top player in fantasy for depth play the waiver wire and you will eventually find the depth youre looking for
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id take it matthews sucks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id take it throw out the somewhat lateral move of cooks dt and i say cobb mckinnon all day cooks celing roasts dt but he can be inconsistent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i disagree with smashncash on this one cobb hasnt done a damn thing and terrance williams will have a bigger role with dez out the falcons are running like crazy and cooks has more boom potential than dt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id rather have first
fantasyfootball,not_removed,like the demarco side better rbs are hard to come by in a team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you accept
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would take this one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good deal as long as julio is healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you won
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well you did quite well a wr lock for a and a good deal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its good to lockup bucs backfield but by giving those there goes all rb depth what will you do on bye weeks start derrick henry and dixon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with smashncash that it hurts your rb depth a lot so it is hard to tell without seeing the rest of your roster but i think in your position i would do it tb has no twice in playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,take jones if youre strong at rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like the deal for you not sure he goes for it tho
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rbs are at a premium right now and youre going to trade away starting ones leaving you with morris as the only rb on your bench i couldnt hit cancel faster on that trade offer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who the hell is doug peterson for the record i would take that trade wilson will bounce back and michael has upside i expect gurley to underperform all year looks like you need that help
fantasyfootball,not_removed,his fumbling issues are being a little over rated and with rawls down for at least a few weeks michael is one of very few remaining work horses if he and wilson both hit stride you gonna have as fantastic mid season run stafford while great will not end top but he def is a top qb the question though is wether you would actually run michael over hill ever as your wr depth is plenty to warrant not needing the trade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i also like the trade christine michael is more valuable than sanders
fantasyfootball,not_removed,option b and its not a question
fantasyfootball,not_removed,option b partly due to jthom injury no guarentee he can stay healthy as its a reacuring injury
fantasyfootball,not_removed,great trade for now ryan is expected to come back down to earth drop gordon because hes useless and dont stream qbs if you dont have to see if winston or stafford are available i doubt it but just in case
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not sure i think amari and kelvin are pretty close in my mind both underperforming with the exception of kelvins good game talented young receivers in decentgood offenses it remains to be seen whether matty ice will fall to earth
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crowder if he accepts or cooper if you really want him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think if you can get lacy for crowder youve got a steal and i think your other receivers are all overpays you could maybe find more fair ground by doing a for where you downgrade at one position and upgrade the other and he does the opposite
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think youre taking a much bigger downgrade at rb than you are getting as an upgrade at wri wouldnt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with i think its a downgrade you already have solid wrs with nelson evans and crowder in ppr floyd has been fairly bad but has potential to be better i dont think youd be starting sterling shepard over anyone but crowder and floyd as a or flex plus sproles is definitely a downgrade on rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is a seriously impressive draft i like the trade for you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id try and move ty instead but if it came down to iy yeah id do it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think you did well try and pair of your wrs for a rb now maybe fuller and diggs or dt and fuller for a rb no need for starting wrs for spots
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont think you needed landry with those wrs and i think sims will do well these few games without doug
fantasyfootball,not_removed,uhh yes yes lamar miller is a first round pick latavius is a rounder trending down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes in all cases miller is top rb ros
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would do that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would not do that if i were you cmike may have limited value and people have been talking about selling hyde high for some time now lacy is probably the best of those backs and reed should turn around his slow start
fantasyfootball,not_removed,would rather have bmarsh in my opinion he gets targets all day granted he suffers with injuries from time to time but so has dt recently
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tough but im probably going dt for consistency with decker enunwa and forte snagging looks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no hes an idiot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,your offer was terrible for you in my view i would be glad he refused it depending on your qb situation i think stafford will fall to earth and probably be a top but nothing like he is doing now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,your offer was already bad for you to begin with dont trade with people like this qbs arent worth that much in leagues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats a large range of values in rb demarco shady and probably gordon will finish top this year the others less so latavius for marvin jones is a steal obviously so do that regardless are any of your targets owned by the charles owner the charles owner might move a gorehydecrowell type player for warecrowder or warecrabtree
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think you may be surprised about ware he may endure as and possibly the chief with the most touches even after charles gets back that said you might try to dangle eli and crabtree to someone with weaknesses at qb and wr for an rb although you might only be able to get someone at the back end of your list like gore or crowell with the dearth of good rbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sims schedule is shit for the next few weeks and jennings has been bruising a little so id rather stay safe with shady who looked great last week and take my chances on trav and diggs panning out or finding their replacement on the ww
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if he will take it then go for it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agree with smash you get a high targets wr for a good qb but not great im guessing this year who should be replaceable more or less an unknown new rb and a streaky thus far but talented rookie receiver
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id rather do your second trade for you and im a chargers fan i like tyrell but hes still all potential and cobb should turn it around soon demarco may be at the top of his value and i think cj would be a very nice upgrade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keep murray he is currently the titans offense i think randall cobb will find his game give him some time on the bench
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i think blount will be more dependable although hes not who id want if i wanted a guy to feel solid about all year i had him last year and im still recovering form bellichickinduced ptsd i will be wary of any rwt players not named gronk now and in the future expect some or point games for blount once brady gets back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is that emmanuel and jordan for the first two if so then not really moncrief will be out most of the fantasy season im a julio owner myself and have been unimpressed by his performance against some weak d teams thus far well see how he shakes out matthews will be consistent and sanders may be boomorbust but they both add some depth now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no stafford owner would think for a second about a straight up swap for stafford and dalton lol stafford is the overall qb and shows no signs of slowing down dalton someone like williams or crowder might make him bite though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who else does he have at teams i think you can still stream a decent qb and this trade is basically leveon for brady and a lottery ticket i wouldnt take it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why even ask dj is a fantasy beast
fantasyfootball,not_removed,incredible deal do it now best fantasy rb in the league for a wr who could well finish top but is about to go through a very rough stretch of games his value is likely to drop over the next few weeks right up until playoffs where he has a cake schedule get johnson avoid the rough stretch you can always trade johnson if need be for another top wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oops its actually demarco and forte for julio and golden tate without counting those guys my wr are williams from chargers and crowder from redskins cruz on my bench my rbs are l murray darkwa r shenningsi had langford but he went down i also got tj yeldon on the bench but he sucks smh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree lat was my pretty much tho and that had to change
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that was my plan i was just hoping it was the right move thanks for the feedback
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you yeah i was really lacking in rbs i totally am gonna miss jordy but the kid is also from wisconsin so i knew it would improve my chances thanks for the answer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,health is an issue but coaches said hes the guy when healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he is my depending on jennings and washington i feel comfortable risking it just need a sanity check thanks for the reply
fantasyfootball,not_removed,trying to get top rbs instead of having the trying to trade off arob howard for a zekemurraymccoycj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nah it was never my intention wrs just fell to me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks yea he already has david johnson too id cause myself a lot of headaches i think if i released gurley
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks i knew i was feeling squeamish about it for a reason
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks thats hows i was feeling
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can you explain why murray has looked good and has a cake schedule whereas mccoys schedule looks more brutal hed be able to cuff the titans backfield as well if he gets henry alshon could be a headache
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would be getting michael
fantasyfootball,not_removed,basically what i am leaning towards only reason im considering this is the top potential of charles and to a lesser extent watkins then again lacy was a top pick not too long ago
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what do you think would be a more fair offer should i throw in gore in place of coleman the reason i was sending coleman was because he has devonta freeman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you im about to drop josh gordon cries ill probably pick up washington dst and then shop coleman and gore for a receiver
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i disagree at the moment i dont trust cutler nor do i trust hoyer i like pryor moving forward with the uncertainties around clevelands offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio edelman and a bunch of junk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so you like the green for evanscoleman no question if i cant get obj and if obj performs poorly vs minnesota i think thats who hed prefer to trade of the two evans from the way he was talking pregame
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and if i can only get evanscoleman i should sit on it or is that a pull the trigger moment too i would assume its definitely worth as the handcuff i get in coleman is extreme value for me with owning freeman already and evans did have a point game already in ppr so this outlier from green isnt too out of reach of evans i feel like im talking myself into a decision that should have been easier from the offer i almost want evans more than obj how crazy is that too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hah thanks for the sanity same guy keeps trying to fleece me theyre staying put
fantasyfootball,not_removed,spoken like a prophet yeah ill try to get rid of him but i wont make any desperation moves im not ruling out a situation where del rio goes back to using murray as his workhorse by midseason
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he offered hopkins for gurley
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it went through lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes been healthy except last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but will he be healthy this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i honestly didnt even think to go check on martins prognosis sims would be temporary and i also dont trust mckinnon at all thanks for the sanity check
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i still have mckinnon and giovani bernard so its not too bad but i see your point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ugh im a big ty hilton and colts fan but hilton is always a ff shitter of course he should take gurley luck spreads the ball out like nobodies business and the stat line from last week is definitely a red herring im not saying hilton is a bad ff receiver in fact i think hes a solid with a relatively high ceiling with a good qb but i dont think hes ever going to be a consistent that seems like a steal imo and he should take gurley before he begins to heat up even more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,have to drop someone and with my roster it will probably be dorsett he is the moncrief owner im trying to move forte i could try to move kelce out of the deal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i never expected him to take the first it was meant as a psychological ploy to get my foot in the door and to offer my slightly better trade of j matt hes preferring hyde to lamar this week for some reason which is why im trying to capitalize maybe j matt riddick i wouldnt need to use riddick if if add lamar
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks for the help i will try to package dt and blount yeah i like blount but i would really like to upgrade my wrs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks for the reply i think i will try dt and blount my other rbs are gurley gordon dwayne washington riddick ingram and mccoy my wrs are dt hilton fitz and crabtree
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks a lot this is the info i needed the guy i am dealing with is my best friend from elementary school and hes a hard mother fucker to crack so i have my work cut out for me thanks a lot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks a lot thats what i expected i needed another opinion i appreciate the info
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ryan mathews marvin jones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the thing is my receiving core is very good but my two best running backs are hill and mckinnon ap and vereen injuries i may have overpayed but cobb doing well doesnt change my outlook whereas washington going off could significantly change the outlook for my team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i offered the original and he said hed consider it so i dont think hed do less im okay with giving up dt considering hes my right now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt have to drop eli manning for a d this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mjones the rb is what i meant
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yup and i have decent wr depth this one is tough
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i definitely needed an upgrade at rb for rb i have d johnson jereck mckinnon dwayne washington and orleans darkwa for my wr i have mike evans tyrell williams mike wallace will fuller jamison crowder think it was a solid trade to upgrade to a
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah lataviuss situation has been a pain in my ass to read about definitely not looking good definitely gonna try to flip one of my receivers for a rb though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so i got hit with the injury train lost keenan allen ap abdullah langford vereen wr demaryius crabtree fuller crowder michael thomas lockett rb jeremy hill darkwa ap smallwood
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agree i had blount last year and it gave me such a headache hed go from point games to point games depending on how evil genius felt about the game bellichick hates your fantasy players
fantasyfootball,not_removed,let me kick the offer upstairs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont have much depth but i have forte david johnson sproles and duke johnson
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i proposed it to him he is in desperate need for a rb so i just threw it out there to see if he would bite and he accepted it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,should i actually drop bortles he was such a stud last year and i keep hearing that russ is going to keep getting hurt with his oline being bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sorry but this is the worst advice ive seen on a wdis ever this is an absolutely awful trade for this dude and you know it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the jc owner has no interest in ware so i feel like he is about to become another handcuff
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think i have to as well i also have dwayne washington but he is still hype cheers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my rb situation is a disaster i have giovani bernard and murray along with morris wr i have ab and evans mike wallace and enunwa injuries have destroyed my team and nobody really seems to have opportunities except my opponent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what do you think of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i had the same thought just hard to let go of fuller this earlybut hes been sitting on my bench and i need another solid rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,currently i have ingram and am trading for gurley in a but its funny how after week i was down to only ingram as healthy rb with woodhead and abdullah going down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with this guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i couldnt disagree more hes going to trade away starting rbs in an already rb poor season leaving him with only morris on the bench for a wr that he doesnt desperately need
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ahh i meant doug martin lol werd gurley is a concern and rb can help me out doug will come out of injury soon hopefully
fantasyfootball,not_removed,actually i mis typed doug martin i would play gurley and martin as rb and evans with larry or landy ad wr so for flexits gotta be j hill or larry fitzerald but christian michael seems better flex my qb will fall to lower value since ryan has tough matches but thank you for replying i think i am going to take it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my qb value is concern do you really think i can survive with matt ryan for next three weeks and wilson underperforming with bye week coming in week ww is all junk lol heres ww new player note r tannehill mia qb final l cin player note m mariota ten qb sun am hou player note r fitzpatrick nyj qb sun am vs sea player note a smith kc qb sun pm pit player note t taylor buf qb sun am ne player note b osweiler hou qb sun am vs ten new player note j garoppolo ne qb q sun am vs buf player note s bradford min qb mon pm vs nyg new player note j cutler chi qb q sun am vs det player note t romo dal qb o sun pm sf
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont know i think cooper is a fair trade especially considering the huge upside lacy showed in his last game yards rushing without even hitting the endzone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah dont do this avoid eagles backfield
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks man my year doing fantasy last year i kinda winged it than traded the farm for hyde after week won games the entire season i didnt want to be a i guess you guys call it taco in year so i did hours and hours of research build draft board and prepared strategy switches depending on how the rest of my league was drafting kinda stoked for this team so greatto get positive feedback think ill do the trade then dont have a stad wr on my team like that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like ty over cooper good trade fire it up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah that was a stupid ass question
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my current qbs in our qb league are flacco tyrod and siemian he tried telling me that his trade was fair because palmer willget more points than bell i finally just told him nevermind
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its a qb league would the trade be fine if i just offered kb i realize this guy is never gonna do legit trades this is the second time trying to trade with him and each time he just offers complete idiotic trades
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its a large range because those we all of the backs from different owners who were somewhat lacking in wr that i could hypothetically get with a good the charles owner has ingram crowell jennings and obviously charles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cool thanks for your thoughts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes it is thanks for talking me off the edge julios performances coupled with the oc saying he wanted to spread the ball more made me doubt his ability to carry my team although hell probably score this weekend to prove me wrong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i didnt think so lol he seems kinda shallow on wr so i figured it would have to be a package what if i offered daltonpittaparker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was leaning towards not taking it i was going to ask for brady and blount but blounts value takes a hit with brady in there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah you need julio try to get of those rbs and a good wr back for him if you do trade him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am having a really hard time figuring out how you drafted i see a first round pick in julio and then i dont see a rounder or even many i would consider what did you do anyways i think even in your shitty wr position i would take this trade that is top rbs in a year where rbs are hard to come by you can flip one for another wr later
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mccoy is close to demarco arguably better no one behind him henry is a real threat to take more carries jeffery is a better receiver than maclin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think colemans value is at a high point here you need him but i think you could go either way counter with obj and see if he bites you can even leave the other trade open without rejecting it i like evans ros and his playoff schedule is gravy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,haha thanks again man and as always unnecessary i think thats the right play if someone offers a nice piece like landry diggs edelman you take it if youre content with the hype machine dwayne washington carrying your bye week or a waiver if it comes to a nice flyer and who on reddit isnt content with dwayne dwayne the hype train
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for sure that wasnt in the original post with that information this trade is even more in your favor i would do the trade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he offered gurley and matt jones for ty hilton and rawls i countered with my ty and rawls for his gurley and frank gore im still on the fence if i should just keep ty because his upcoming schedule is beautiful
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if both parties agree i dont see why it wouldnt be allowed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would say no not really but if its obvious that collusion is not happening they are not friends the tajae sharp player did not give up already the reed player isnt trying to intentionally make the sharpe guy better etc then i would not stop it i am a firm believer that a trade is between he two people and if they agree then thats that as long as it isnt obviously shady i mean this is obviously dumb for the reed player but as long as it isnt as obviously shady it is what it is we have a guy in my league that likes to try to veto everything we had reed for freeman he wanted to veto we had apcharles for edelmanlamar millerabdullah he tried to veto pre injuries of course we even had fleener and bernard for travis benjamin that he tried to veto nothing is more annoying than someone trying to veto your trades when you worked to get the other guy to agree
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea i think you wait and see what he does vs the browns with brady and if hes healthy that should be a very nice game helping to boost his value to first roundearly round picks hopefully
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why do you have to drop someone ir
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think fortedorsett is absolutely worth zeke to the moncrief owner only probably i dont know how high value they have ebron in my man league i feel like he would go untouched if dropped as people seem to be more interested in the pittas tamme jesse jame types that are getting a game without the name
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow you have a ton of rbs id try to trade one of them for a qb or te if you need it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ya you have an insane amount of wrs any teams with good rb depth and weak wrs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sorry i misread your original post not the worst trade given your league makeup typically i would give more value to matt jones but youre currently dealing with injuries to deckermoncrief so padding your wr core with added depth and a potential starter might not be a bad idea i do think jones starts to pickup since i dont think weve seen the ceiling of that washington offense yet tough trade man i think its about equal though so go with your gut if youre wanting to improve your wr core
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think you keep hyde despite how the offer looks on paper hyde seems to be all of sf offense and gets a lot of red zone targets plus the lack of rb depth doesnt make julio worth it especially with his match ups the next weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah overall i think this trade will work out for you i think lacy returns to form as that offense trends upwards coming out of their bye arob looks like hes starting to return to midseason form which is great news for you too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id make the trade whichever you are more confident it ask for them first your second option wrs are much better than your backup rbs but you knew that by saying desperate hill wasnt spectacular today but maybe offer hill and dt for melvin and shady possilbly of yours for those just an idea
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seriously this past week proves that he can even make you scared of gronk lol if not for just a week only safe patriot is gostkowski and brady when not in time out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like it gets them a rb and a late season and you some consistent production from obj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i do it cuz you can confidently start miller with such a high floor murray is getting shaky as the season goes getting back for nelson for evans isnt too bad considering your wr depth
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is tough but i would consider this trade pretty hard miller might be the stud rb you need week to week only issue is if you did that this week you get jordy on bye therefore i say you should do it but only after this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,martin and rawls arent healthy im holding gurley not making any trade because you need the hb help more than you need wr help
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for sure that makes it better but i still think you need michael and sanders will be too inconsistent to rely on love him in real life fantasy can be a bit of a headache
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think matt ryan will be fine
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i definitely would do that i agree w mac though ty is more boomorbust than cooper but cooper has been underperforming too anyway julio is going to turn it around once fully healthy and will be killin it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,haha thats a pretty basic understanding of trade evaluation he must be new im a palmer and ryan owner and im worried about both of my qbs right now his offer to you was hopefully sarcastic or an intended insult as it was offthecharts crazy i dont think most people in my league would trade kelvin benjamin for palmer i know i wouldnt nevermind with bell added on can you take a look at my question on the top and tell me what you think please
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you should really always mention when asking for advice especially when the trade involves a qb is probably the single biggest value swing as far as settings go in fantasy that being said would i trade benjamin for stafford maybe depends on my wr and my qb situation but it sounds like this guy would never go for it since he already turned down a juicier offer so why bother thinking about it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ill keep julio lol my rb situation is bad tho smh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mccoy not having anyone behind him kinda scares me with his injury history which is one of the reasons i want murray and the henry cuff
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so the obvious consensus is that objcoleman much better than evanscoleman despite obj having vastly subexpectation stats over the first games first really one was saved by late heroics i know preseason its an absolute no brainer but i think now it actually is a valid question of evans obj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt hes not going to do better than he did last week seriously dont let cognitive bias fool you yes he has a great qb throwing to him yes hes the on his team with the injured yes its a past first offense but this always seems to be the case with ty and he always seems to disappoint very inconsistent maybe im wrong but this is just my two cents
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dropped my kicker to pick up dixon at the start of the week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he doesnt currently have a flex if watkins is ruled out which is likely haha if this doesnt go through ive thought of offering dorsett for moncrief straight up and trying to atleast get some value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i traded crowell and tyrell williams for olsen a week ago and have ben at qb i am happy with my rbteqbs but i am unfortunately still
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there are two teams with good rbs and bad wrs but im not the biggest fan of their rbs one has hyde demarco devonta tevin coleman and jstew the other team has jeremy hill blount melvin gordon and eddie lacy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,appreciate it homie love your posts over in rnfl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you i am going to accept it what you suggest for my qb play then wilson is playable this week i know matt ryan have tough three weeksww aint looking all that ww r tannehill mia m mariota ten r fitzpatrick a smith kc t taylor buf b osweiler j garoppolo ne s bradford min j cutler chi t romo dal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,okay im just gonna wait to see what he does then gore matt jones
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh seems like a fair trade though was this your idea or the other team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,haha never mind just saw that was dustin hopkins thought it was deandre hopkins at first would he be willing to throw in another player for you i know you have sims but i feel you can get more for demaryius thomas and rashad jennings
fantasyfootball,not_removed,honestly i realize this is contrarian to what everyone else is saying but i think matt ryan keeps up his great performance shanahan has really come out of his shell and changed the way this offense works to benefit ryan and the results are there obviously i could be totally off but i just have a gut feeling about it id feel fine starting matty ice this week and then possibly streaming next week based on performance id avoid tannehill mariota and garoppolo the others can be streamed with the right match ups but its definitely a sorry bunch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think so
fantasyfootball,not_removed,his idea for kelce in the mix im gunna try to counter with these and see what happens
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes cam newton went in the second in my league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think a super bowl winloss affects his adp how he plays in the game might change it a little bit but i think most of the change comes from his performance in the regular season this year i think everyone will underrate him again as the bigger names go ahead of himand hell end up with a little higher adp than usual higher being better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think shanahan leaving will put a damper in that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think instead of the usual aaron rodgers brady duo of qbs people reach for ryan will join the mix and make it a trio of qbs that i want but cant possibly justify taking as early as my leaguemates will
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hell probably get a bump up honestly though i dont think it will really matter outside of and super deep leagues you can get a qb with the same relative stats criminally late romo stafford brees rivers wilson etc etc almost always fall way later than they should and often will put up pretty similar numbers as guys taken waaayyyy before them that being said if matty ice is your guy and you think someone else will take him before you make sure to use your first overall pick on him better to be safe than sorry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,at this point just winning the nfc chanpionship game has given his adp a bump whenif he wins the nfl mvp award that will be another slight bump before today i expected that the only qbs with an adp in the first three rounds would be aaron rodgers pick and drew brees pick i figured matt ryan to be a fifth rounder so lets say pick selected in the same range as andrew luck after today i expect matt ryans adp to be somewhere immediately after brees if he wins the mvp and wins the super bowl with a stat line of something like yards and tds i think he takes over rodgers adp in the mid second round
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had newton in but didnt feel the need to reach for a qb in the draft i got brady in the due to his suspension and me being happy to wait for games but didnt pick up my starter until the with so much qb talent out there to round for a qb seems good to me anything before that is madness
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i still think people will devalue him but it will be a way higher prospect then this year he went undrafted in my league which was a huge pick for me i can see him off the board after rodgers brees luck brady camdebatable he will be either the or off the board imo that should leave him around the mid stage of the draft depending on your leagues settings
fantasyfootball,not_removed,winning or losing the sb isnt going to make a difference imo if the offense stays in tack and more importantly if ks sticks around seems unlikely at this point will determine a great deal in where he ends up being drafted quick reaction i would still take rodgers brees over him i could see him lumping into a tier with the andrew luck and brady
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fantasy footballs sb is week so it seems pretty stupid for people to draft matt ryan higher for playing well in this one game his tds to ints in the regular season this year should be why he is drafted higher
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i sure hope so so other qbs fall
fantasyfootball,not_removed,newton had running production though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,first overall in my league lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,td int rating in his last games hes off the board in the first rounds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rumor is theyll go for chip kelly which could work out well for ryan a bit more running will give him a better floor not that it wasnt outstanding this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed i dont ever reach for rodgers brady luck and newton this year someone always takes them way too early im sticking with drafting qbs in rounds depending on draft flow
fantasyfootball,not_removed,romos draft position will depend on where he lands even then youve got to make sure that team has a great offensive line or hes guaranteed injured in two months imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if hes still there in the hes mine would even go if i like my first few picks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,with the way the last few years have gone you could probably take a qb before your kicker and defense in a team qb league and be good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he played at his ceiling this year and if anyone takes him over brees or rodgers next year then that is high risk low reward
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i can make exception for running qbs like cam got the konomi code
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you account for bradys suspension ryan was the third highest scoring qb on average this year last year the qb was taken at the beginning of the round so it depends on your league given his entire career i think there is still a chance he is taken after brees as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe in public leagues with randoms in most leagues i play in people arent stupid enough to bite on recency bias and will look at the full body of work and deem him as a which is or later in general because they know qb is deep
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think kelly and ryan are not a very good fit we have seen this year that ryans strength is the high degree of complexity he can handle kellys system is based on simple and clearly defined reads it kind of negates the thing ryan does best a lot of nfl coaches will tailor their system to their personnel but kelly has shown that he will put his system ahead of his talent imo kelly would be a much better fit with a team that has a qb that struggles with the mental part of the game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a bit more running for ryan that might give him more points a game but the chances hell get hurt will go up astronomically cant see why atl would put their franchise player in peril like that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you need to erase that td run from sundays game from your mind he has functional mobility but he is far from a runner in his career he has never had more than yards rushing in any game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh god no hope youre wrong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cant tell if being serious but no way this happens promoting from within as were not changing schemes after how successful the offense has been this season reports in atlanta read our qbs coach matt lefleur is the leading candidate for playcalling duties
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well like i said that was before today now i think hes a third rounder in two weeks he may move into the low firstearly second
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i completely agree my starter this year at draft was dalton in the round i used the wire to change him for stafford for week then for matt ryan for the weeks after qb k and d are not positions i lose any sleep over in a man league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and this is why any league with less than people is a joke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,could im honestly more familiar with kelly the coach after watching almost every niner game this year kap had a great year under him but he fits that mold of struggling with the mental part of the game ryan wont have that problem or will he this point in the offseason were all just speculating wildly anyway
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if your league drafts qbs high in a starter league it isnt very competitive
fantasyfootball,not_removed,speculating is half the fun the thing is it took more than a full season to install this current offense last season after a full offseason and half a regular season there was a game where ryan was miced up where he said something along the lines of i cant wait till i really know this offense because were going to kill people with it essentially they threw away one year because of the complexity of the offense it paid off massively but why would they go away from it after year of massive succes when they can promote someone from within and try to keep a good thing going i mean its possible and i have seen weirder shit in the nfl but it seems very counterproductive
fantasyfootball,not_removed,love it when people randomly feel the need to tell other people that their league is not competitive like its some kind of competition to be the most competitive evarrrrrrr i bet your dad could beat up my dad too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the point is that if you care enough to post in a fantasy football forum you would want a league that challenges and excites you if you want to win easy money in a league that nobody prepares as hard as you in good for you but dont brag to strangers about it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no the point is that ive not bragged or mentioned anything about the competitiveness of my league but youve decided to be all years old telling me all about how shit me and my league are while alluding to your way being the only way to ever have fun ever sucks being doesnt it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,really hard to say at this point but i could see a scenario where reports come out that he has a strong offseason some hype builds and he goes in round he is the kind of guy i would love to have as a
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think it really depends where he gets ranked and if he gets offseason hype rankings because he wont be the guy on everyones mind but him being under ranked could lead to getting a great steal draft position wise where as a higher hype ranking will bring him into contention with people who basically go auto draft style
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for me hes a mid range with upper lower upside we dont really know much about him as hes only played part of a season also coming from a steelers fan who knows if he can stay off the weed hes a big riskreward pick for me id be comfortable taking him probably round or later
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whether its injuries offthefield issues dropped passes it has been forever since you could rely on a wr for pittsburgh martavis sammy coates markus wheaton emmanuel sanders have all struggled as browns before that brown struggled his year as mike wallaces cuz he was injured before that they had an aging but consistent but not great ff wr hines ward and an emerging but mostly puntreturning brown prolly have to go back to mike wallaces early years when him and stillinhisprime hines were playing together to find a solid steelers ill stay away and stick with other options until i see better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive been going on the notion that his adp in will be in the round territory i never make my own draft board until after seeing the adps for all players for the season so ill make my draft board sometime in august after the adp sites have a few hundred mock drafts in their databases but for my own super early mock drafts ive been thinking round this isnt scientific but im basing it off the drafting behavior i observed this season with josh gordon gordon is easily a first round fantasy talent with suspensions of games full seasons and games as his baggage his talent and baggage had the general drafting public valuing him as a sixth round pick this offseason to me this says that people are afraid that hell get suspended again since he has a history of it so for bryant i see him as a second round fantasy talent with the baggage of a fourgame suspension and a full season suspension going off my purely nonscientific formula of devaluing a player by full rounds for every full season of suspension served and another full round for any partial suspension served i believe bryants perceived adp lies in the late fifthearly sixth round of a ppr league draft frankly as i think of it thats about where id take him as well his talent is solidly in the second round territory but he has multiple suspensions on his resume and will be subject to multiple random drug tests if he fails or even misses a scheduled test there goes his season that huge riskreward swing meets in the late fifthearly sixth round for me pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bryant averages over fantasy points per game in nonppr leagues for his career if you look at this years scoring leaders only wrs finished with over fantasy points the problem is he cant stay out of trouble and in his three seasons in the nfl hes played and games for an average of games per season i think the steelers will bring bryant along slowly and theyll make him reearn his spot in the starting lineup hes simply too talented though for him not to see the field eventually though and once hes in the lineup he should begin to produce you do have to be careful with bryant though a lot of his numbers are a result of one or two deep balls a game it makes him a bit of a boomorbust wr with really great games and some complete stinkers im guessing his adp will be around the or round but hes a player that could end up finishing the season as a lowend if he can stay on the field
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i checked his instagram and it looks like hes been working really hard and realizes he fucked up he posted stuff about intense workouts and training im going to probably end up drafting him earlier than i should and i think it will pay off
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably in the same kind of spots flash went this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt touch him until the or the im t will also depend on how coates fits in the offense too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just wanted to say that dwill is a legit option
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bruh if hes in the im taking him remember coates blow up game marty can do that weekly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,parts of two seasons regular season games starts tds apypg plus playoff games with tds apypg and unless you count addiction as a health concern zero injuries since october
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the year before he got suspended you could absolutely rely on martavis he was a top wr in standard iirc
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lie hey buddy that term might hurt please use the patriotically correct pc term alternative fact with a little effort we can make the world a safer space for patriotic discourse see this for more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,deep balls yes but also runs when he was on they schemed him the ball around the los too he was more versatile than that narrative
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the thing with bryant deep balls is that it is pretty sustainable he is an exceptional deep threat normally defenses see that and put safety help over the top which makes it a lot harder to regularly get big plays the steelers however have guys named brown and bell that defenses need to worry about no defense is going to give ab on without safety help to that side of the field on a regular basis that means the deep safety wont be on bryants side of the field all he has to do is beat a single corner deep a few times per game to consistently get big plays he is easily good enough to do that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes been working really hard and realizes he fucked up i want this to be true however this is the narrative after just about every athlete returns from a suspension working hard best shape of life realizes mistake wont happen again bryants talent and opportunity make him a really intriguing fantasy player but the risk is there and anyone who reaches could really feel the hurt cough cough josh gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but a team only starts one rb they start normally three receivers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,williams is a good running back and did terrific the past two seasons when hes had to play when bell was suspended or injured williams came in the game and did really well but as good as he is leveon bell is the best in the league imo and williams isnt as good of a receiver that bell is right now much of the steelers offense is based around bell and brown but martavis bryant is a playmaker too and he could be huge in the passing game like he showed last season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats a bad idea my friend
fantasyfootball,not_removed,addiction may not be a health concern but it is a concern for him possibly missing time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,weed addiction lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nope not even top he missed first games of the year had catch for yards in week two other point games had big games but not very reliable at all
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lie
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the news on gordon was notinfootballshape then mysteriously injured with patience and a nonpremature draft well know what to do i think
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not saying dwill isnt a bit of a downgrade from bell but you wrote the steelers didnt have a legit option but i think dwill is as legit as a option gets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when it interferes with your employment youve got a real problem no matter what the substance is
fantasyfootball,not_removed,have you ever sucked dick for weed bob saget
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he had ppg in actually he on had games that year points he was really good that year and the year before after looking at his stats for both seasons i think he was pretty damn reliable by comparison to other
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think you quite understand what a option is diangelo is not a option he is a back up runningback a option is a reciever who goes out and runs routes the majority of plays one can argue bell is a option because he is often lined up as a wideout and has a ridiculous number of catches per game for a rb but diangelo is not bell and simply does not do that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,true but addiction to weed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,only twice but its really none of your god damned business
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes he averaged doubledigit points but he only played and games in those seasons when you have that few of games he can have a couple big games inflate that average a lot to make it seem like he was consistent people in this sub are talking about a round adp to me thats crazy high for an unproven injuryprone suspensionpossible guy in an offense that has historically been unable to consistently provide production out of the spot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just a misunderstanding thought you were saying option and rb not option at wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,would you bite he wants to send mike evans and david johnson to me in exchange for ezekiel elliot on condition that zeke doesnt recieve a suspension before week in which case the trade is reversed accept he keeps my second round pick which is the gamble its ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not sure why he would get a second round pick and evans and johnson back thats just stupid with even a small change of zeke getting suspended you lose out if he does and get nothing does he have some sort of insider info
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would absolutely make that deal what a haul
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green with points why wont they throw it to green green with points why wont they throw it to green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is why landry is bulletproof dolphins can either throw it to landry early move the ball landry gets his points dont throw it to landry early suck start losing by defense starts playing yards off at the line landry gets in the second half your move tannehill you fucking donkey
fantasyfootball,not_removed,now that weve established green as unguardable lets rack up some and outs by targeting everyone else dalton

fantasyfootball,not_removed,hahahah why the fuck do they keep running whhhyyyyyy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why did i pick up tannehil smh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tannehill isnt a very good qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this might be a disaster for landry and parker owners getting a little nervous that tannehill literally cant even get the ball near them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they have to stop running this is the opposite problem from last year the dolphins are just so bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wilsons face in that ad is my face watching this game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,devante parker is kiiiillllling me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,holy fucking aj green

fantasyfootball,not_removed,landry time pls
fantasyfootball,not_removed,regretting this parker start
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol that right tackle literally a turnstile
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they cant even not hit correctly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fucking trainwreck of a team are these dolphins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats not aj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the score does not reflect the beating the dolphins are getting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my vegas bet of less than wins for the dolphins this year is making me feel real smart right about now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dammit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dammit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seriously why the fuck do teams keep trying to return the kickoff it is so rare to get back to the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yay landry earned points in my ppr league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gotta love when your teammates give you a concussion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when i say parker you say reception parker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,each week the bengals pathetic red zone percentage makes nugent an enticing pickup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when i say tannehill you say fuck you useless piece of shit tannehill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dalton not being able to hold the ball is screwing my hill garbage time points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cincinnati is doing everything to keep miami in the game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sweep to the short side of the field with the box stacked who decides these plays for cinci
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green owners could really use another td to put away their opponents this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fins still running where was this last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is it too late for miami to send tannehill to rehab for the rest of the year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we will get more landry garbage points do not lose hope
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i repeat fuck the bengals ol they fucked up what would have been a stellar game by dalton and hill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ryan tannehill is jay cutler without a frown
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bad drop by jarvis but i repeat tannehill is just not a good qb shame
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good news i started aj bad news i started tannehill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,blitzed of the time and still got sacks the retooled oline for miami might need some more work
fantasyfootball,not_removed,u can never trust the dolphins years of nothing but pain
fantasyfootball,not_removed,post 🐐 to pay your respects to josh gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,got damnit give landry some targets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cant even criticize tannehill for most of this the oline is garbage
fantasyfootball,not_removed,miami is a disgusting excuse for a football team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lacy on the chunky commercials now they know their audience
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just want to thank quickonthedrawl for these points streaming defenses is fun
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love andy dalton and i dont care who knows about it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just put in hill over j howard lets go boys

fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck streaming cincinnati tonite please dont let this be a sign of things to come
fantasyfootball,not_removed,of course it had to be stills siiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiigh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i didnt know the university of tennessee made the jump to the nfl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,quick someone make a reactionary thread my diagnosis is decapitation but we wont know until we get an injury update
fantasyfootball,not_removed,didnt remember to change out dolphins d yet and its thursday night so fuck it go dolphins defense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the creamsicle uniforms are making me queasy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its cardinals its niners its thursday anything can happen lol no my niners are gonna get smushed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that punt was magnificent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green is a grown ass man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when they said a rookie was going to be on green i knew i was about to get destroyed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,take it all the way aj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green is ridiculous what a beast
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj take the wheel
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i knew that wasnt aj green even when the tv view was blocked because aj always gets his feet in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,greeeen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green has points in my league not how i wanted my opponent to start this matchup out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as an aj and tannehill owner this is a good first quarter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who the hell thinks landry looks like a running back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i hope burfict hit sticks the piss out of some jabroni
fantasyfootball,not_removed,playing against both aj green kenny stills looks like its gonna be an uphill battle this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cincinnati bingals phil sims
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drinking one for everyone who is playing vs aj green like myself
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yo this ayy jayy greene guy is pretty decent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn aj is having fish for dinner tonight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green laughing his ass off at this secondary
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hot damn being an aj owner is fun cant believe ive missed this experience the last years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj❤❤❤❤❤❤
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes gonna dad dick the entire miami secondary
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please break every record aj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green is fine confirmed he just went over yards
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green on absolute fire
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck green is going to put up points for my opponent if this week up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dad strength
fantasyfootball,not_removed,having marvin jones last week and aj green this week has been like fantasy football peyote
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what the fuck this is like the biggest first min for a wr ive ever seen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,josh gordon sacrificed himself for the aj green owners
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this beatdown from aj green helps take my mind off of losing gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is aj better than antonio brown right now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,have green also have hill happy yet frustrated
fantasyfootball,not_removed,where was all this running when miller was on the team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,landry always does nothing in the first half then gets his points in the second half when the dolphins are down by points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,does miami move on from tannehill after this season his growth has stagnated big time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive always been surprised tannehill is a starting nfl qb and i feel like people are finally starting to realize how distinctly below average he is
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have a waiver on tj yeldon dropping kenyan drake not realizing i had him in my lineup still and he is playing tonight does this mean the transaction wont process because drake will already have played the claim is supposed to go through tomorrow morning
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck you davante parker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and come on dalton get a td
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jarvis baby you dont need this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green has yards and the run game still going nowhere
fantasyfootball,not_removed,deion telling miami to run more am i the only one that thinks thats really dumb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fellow landry owners dont overreact until the half in the pats game he had like points at half then he finished the game with thats with a fumble
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i knew starting tannehill was a mistake
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green has about as much catches than tannehill has pass attempts what a joke of a team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hopefully ab can even out those fucking points that aj green is putting against me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you called a timeout for that jesus
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dolphins jerseys make me want an orange cremesicle
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj and landry take me to the promise land
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dolphins ol would get ryan tannehill sacked by the kids in the commercial
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green going for lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green being a fucking monster out there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im masturbating to aj tonight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green for president
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hill is back and does nothing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj laying that dad dick on the fins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gimmie aj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj had a baby and decided to start dsd dicking people
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dammit hill if you cant score at the goal line then what are you good for
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ugh dalton i need you to get some tds yards are not going to do it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all im gonna say is that the dolphins are straight up dumb for putting lipett on aj green considering lipett played wr in college not cb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i still dont understand why they would motion a man away from aj in perfect range for a fade then throw the shitty underneath pass close to traffic
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how stupid do you have to be to push the kicker like that lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jeremy hill da god
fantasyfootball,not_removed,one of the dumber penalties ive ever seen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,toomuchsauce
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey thats not aj green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when did lafell grow hands
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck nugent is gonna outscore aj tonight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that fumble is going to translate to nugent points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and this is the defense i played what the fuck is wrong with me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,danget
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lets see that creamy nugent filling
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not touching nugent after this game point chasing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hopefully time for some landry garbage time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man the bengals desperately need eifert back to convert these redzone opportunities
fantasyfootball,not_removed,landry owners be careful what you wish for
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there you go negative garbage time yards for landrylol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont understand why you torpedo yourself in there when two of your teammates have him wrapped up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,come on aj how the fuck do you not catch that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well i was going to make an offer to the aj green owner in my league but after tonight i fear the only thing hed accept is half of my roster gg
fantasyfootball,not_removed,landry garbage time lets go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,l a n d r y p l s
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh landry i your yards after catch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,go on parker and landry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck you tannehill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,miami is the worst team in the nfl this year they should have lost to the browns last week they deserve to be
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for such a cupcake game dalton only has im glad i benched him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,landry hype come on
fantasyfootball,not_removed,was that a butt sack
fantasyfootball,not_removed,announcers giving miami the business good for them miami is a shit stain of an nfl team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dolphins are not a good team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for landry could be much worse considering the qb play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ah yes kneeling to lose points always love that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was scared about cin dst after that stills td shit worked out though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not a dolphins fan but those color rush jerseys look amazing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nfl has jumped the shark turdsday night foolsball is a garbage product one team is completely unprepared and gets blown out or the better team is unprepared and it becomes akin to watching two buffalo fuck in a muddy river and the one on top doing the thrusting is simultaneously defecating in the water with respect to jim nantz he is the mitt romney of broadcasters if you slipped a little meth into his coffee before the game and phil simms is merely adequate someone must have informed nantz that even the most mundane play needs to sound like the fate of free world depended on the negative yard play drawn up by the incompetent oc of the bungles to which we were just subjected this is still better than the post game buffooneryaka watch rich eisen do his best to wrangle up to six other cohosts at a time ever try to watch an eddie murphy movie at the old pennsauken movie theater now you know how steve marriucci feels grabbing each others forearms laughing obnoxiously loud shuckin and jivin and interrupting each other as to sound even less intelligibleif that is even possible enough of the money grab keep football to sunday and monday judging by the ratings people are getting tired of the morons on the field and substandard play on the tv
fantasyfootball,not_removed,everyone saying relax they will be throwing it a ton to landry in the second halfyou are probably right except they already should be and are handing it off over and over and over and over ahhhhhhhhhhhhhjjjwnwichejwixjcj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i never dont laugh at the icet commercial
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gameplan for miami run ball on first down take sack down screen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this bengals team is also sort of terrible for as bad as the dolphins are td in quarters is bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not sure how anyone can blame landry for lack of production his qb is the shithead here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why the hell would they wait until the end to target landry does their oc have a disability
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can i just say that tannehill is completely predictable he only looks in one direction and thats where he throws even i could pick him off
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hill gio landry pts hahahahahahaha i hate thursday night football
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck tannehill ruining landrys night
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pass to landry you deserve to lose
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rip josh gordon this week is for you im too emotional for this someone hold me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,god damnit jeremy hill no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jeremy hill with his helmet on on the sideline they say he is okay to go back in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why dont dst get any points for turnover on downs its a turnover
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so when did this sub turn gordon right after the news broke or were we just gonna gordonjerk until he came back next week if it happened when the news broke i really like the thought of the mods just having a big red button that reads gordon that they push to just turn the sub into gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh jesus why they look like creamsicles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,these unisthe whites look okay orangenot so much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive said it since he was in seattle and cant believe miami paid the guy so much but byron maxwell is hot garbage lippet already better than he was
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gio i need you to get at least more receptions please
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a patriots fan who owns aj green all i can think is dont throw it to lafell on and long hell drop it everytime
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i do not like my opponents players
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn it bengals d and devante parker worst case scenario is stills getting tds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,enter primetime dalton
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maaaaaan thought that was parker for a sec
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sunvabitch i agonized over adding stills for like minutes until i finally let the rotoworld blurb convince me that i was being too ballsy i need to just got with my gut jesus christ
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why oh why did i start cin d its gonna be a long night
fantasyfootball,not_removed,williams is the starter actually fuck rbs adam gase probably
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hill looks broken
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hill favoring the shoulder not good
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hills shoulder pop out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dalton makes like one read and throws the ball lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,god dammit hill you cant be hurt now after the second series
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hopefully hill is just a stinger but looks like that dlineman landed his full weight on that shoulder see a lot of broken collarbones that way fingers cross
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just realized my opponent is playing tannehil god damnit god fucking damnit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ryan missed my boy devante on that down play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,couldnt the dolphin color rush jerseys been a color that wouldnt have me forgetting which team they are
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well hill looked like he still has his helmet onthats good right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,woooooo ajjjj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well even if hill doesnt come back in on the bright side hes gotten me more points this week than cooks did last week

fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green is my dad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tackling might want to read that book dolphins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj is having an ok first quarter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i faced marvin jones last week aj green this week i survived marvin now the question will be if i can survive what green is about to do
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj greeeeen

fantasyfootball,not_removed,omg i hate this tea so much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,come on tannehill you fuck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol tannehill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jeremy hill back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did i see jonas gray out there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,miami play calling
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did the texans oc call that play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,miami going no huddle is perfectlets get to garbage time quicker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have yet to win a game and at this rate im already pretty sure aj green is going to keep it that way
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,feed the green machine
fantasyfootball,not_removed,see tannehill thats how you throw to your best player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green you magnificent bitch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,playing against aj this week and i guess this is just karma for my opponent last week having julio and having him put up like points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes a fucking monster
fantasyfootball,not_removed,holy shit that catch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,unreal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lets keep this going aj i want to have a larger lead going into sunday

fantasyfootball,not_removed,holy shit aj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man how i love aj green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our lord and savior one aj green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love you aj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i know i said jeremy earlier but damn aj is the one feasting on these creamsicles
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj and bengals d didnt think id have this much total let alone right now woop
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what the fuck double him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sweet gordon aj is eatttttinnnn
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ajs gonna set some records tonight miami cant stop anyone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this miami team is a joke take a note idiots
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green scoring all his points for week and tonight
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you cover him no you cover him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they need to triple team him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can they block for hill please
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj green on fire
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green is killing it right now more yards than the entire dolphins offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did the dolphins kill aj greens family or something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green single handedly destroying my life this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all i can do is watch the box score and what ive seen is hill go from rushes for yards to rushes for yards update for blargh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,josh gordon lent his fantasy football hype spirit to aj before checking in to rehab
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why are they running against this dline
fantasyfootball,not_removed,holy shit what the fuck is this o line doing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cmon bengals dshut tannehill down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,holy shit is the quarter already over bengals really running the clock
fantasyfootball,not_removed,come on jarvissssss
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that commercial cracks me uplol not my sunday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol they say ajayi differently every single time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bengals can dolphins can
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dear miami you have some star receivers notably landry ajayis not going to win this for you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn miami sucks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ajayi has actually looked alright
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol i dont blame you for this jarvis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why are the dolphins running it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ajayi looks pretty nice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the dolphins would choose to be good against the run just for this game against hill havent started him all year this is why just praying for a touchdown
fantasyfootball,not_removed,alright back to aj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hill is great at getting me fantasy points at a time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,okay lets get a green or hill td here to cap off the half
fantasyfootball,not_removed,goddamn tannehill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,blast off aj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj bomb coming
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tannehill should go to fumble rehab
fantasyfootball,not_removed,still fucking running with a minute left
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tannehill is garbage
fantasyfootball,not_removed,at this point its as if landry isnt even playing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i hate this fucking team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,at least the dolphins should be throwing it a lot second half looking for good news
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for parkers sake im hoping this is the bengals finally looking as good as they were supposed to with burfict back and not miami being utterly unable to play offense football outside of one deep pass
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ok jarvis and gio produce as for aj good god its hurts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lady gaga for the super bowl really
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so maybe abandon the run play until you score a td eh miami
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol these guys just butcher the dudes name every time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey we threw some passes better run ajayi some more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,burfict pls dont kill landry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ice tea
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in practice someone needs to stand behind tannehill if he doesnt release the ball in seconds that guy needs to kick him in the nuts or shock him or something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i played devante parker tonight fuck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i feel like this is gonna be one of those games where aj is super quiet in the second half while the bengals run clock and people gon bitch like he hasnt already had a great game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the score is just but ive felt like i could just turn this shit off because ive known the outcome since the quarter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,miami sucks so hard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gio finally about to put up points again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,greeeeeeen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,green is a menace
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj motherfucking green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cmon green get me that bonus
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aj motherfucking green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this lippett dude needs help but i hope he doesnt get it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jesus christ aj green is a man among infants
fantasyfootball,not_removed,put hill in for the td
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cant watch the game is hill hurt bad i just got him this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol sometimes i wonder why they just dont throw it to aj every single down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gio deserves that td chance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mikey nuge he is gonna spooge
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dalton looking to the sideline after these shit run attempts like come on coach just let me throw every down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i picked up hopkins should have grabbed nugent instead
fantasyfootball,not_removed,stop running with it just throw the damn ball
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the big positive of the bengals not scoring tds is that it keeps the game close so that they keep having to air it out but tds would be nice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bengals line is playing like fucking trash
fantasyfootball,not_removed,getting killed by aj but of course when i have players on tnf they dont do a jack shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow boyd wow dalton owners
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tannehill is gonna fuck this up we dont even need to watch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think tannenhill would be a good qb if he had even a half way decent line
fantasyfootball,not_removed,parker made a catch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is embarrassing to watch im not even a miami fan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that tissue paper oline
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is kind of how i felt when julio made that one catch monday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the punter has a damn cannon miamis best player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,honestly at this point id be happy with just yards for hill solid points yards to go can he do it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats so miamijesus christ man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just throw it to green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats genius i should have targeted him in the draft i had him last in nonppr he was okay but this is my first year in half ppr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lets repeatedly run gio bernard up the middle in the red zone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seriously the dude has been shredding the dolphins all night on coverage in the red zone nah lets throw it to our string tight end
fantasyfootball,not_removed,marvin lewis logic
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he really ismossed the one guy carried him for yards the next play then breaks a tackle from the other db and walks into the endzone dude is a beast
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we can only hope
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just checked my points for him oh gawd im hyped lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is a time of mourning upgordon prayerpryor
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do you really have to even ask that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gordons
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gordons but maybe do away with the josh gordon usernames
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gordons all season long
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a couple players kneeled in reverence for him during the national anthem
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mainly he plays for a shit team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and he still almost dropped it the ball rattled around before he had control
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why stop there i say three
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tannehill here you should have played stills you motherfucker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dude outruns daltons range in parking lot sec from snap
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mixed in with the sad landry owners
fantasyfootball,not_removed,josh gordon time traveler
fantasyfootball,not_removed,guy in my league benched aj green lol no idea why his starting receivers are hilton and austin
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dennis pitta
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol second play of the first miami drive be patient landry will get points he always does sincerely a fellow landry owner
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe its finally miller time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,have juice in all my leagues since the start of last season hes been far and away my most consistent player along with justin tucker heres to hoping to another fantabulous performance
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol why is the sound off
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who is that in the background lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wooooooooooooo ok
fantasyfootball,not_removed,michele tafoya is speculating that it seems like a stinger which isnt too big a deal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but i have aj green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as is tradition
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aaaaaaannnddd they were right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,secondary is a strength they said
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thought i was in the dolphins game thread my bad also fuck the dolphins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hearing shimmy shimmy ya on the netflix ad for it only solidified my interest in watching it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i smoke a shit ton of weed on a daily basis so its not that bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im holding out hope for a goalline td and thats about it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pretty big hole in the middle eh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,smh aj green is kb from last week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,because it takes a long time to move up the ranks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nfl refs are so old because they are expected to have thousands and thousands of previous experience as a ref
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jarvis members
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ya we didnt fuck up the gulf as much as we couldve so go humans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,garbage time is your friend
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as someone up against hill same

fantasyfootball,not_removed,seconded thanks uquickonthedrawl these points will make up for some of the points julio jones doesnt get me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont tell me what to do ive already burned my house down
fantasyfootball,not_removed,downvote me to hell but i think they look like radioactive vomit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i thought cincinnati was playing tennessee at first
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yaaay destroy landrys night
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you werent here a few years ago when he was a god tier wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,congratulations on your son being in the nfl though you must be a proud father
fantasyfootball,not_removed,black or green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,earl gray
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same thing man high five lovin the total yards over carries wtf hill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats with these people its lemonade man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so happy the entire league has been doing this all season for mr gordon bless you kapernick for respecting joshua in this tough time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no hands all forearms and chest lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol i hope he gets fuckin crushed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they enjoy television with the sound off for whatever fucked up reason
fantasyfootball,not_removed,copy that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,flip out cause he doesnt have tds he was your first round pick and you should expect that out of him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that is so dumb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,considering that the texans punter has a higher base salary than hopkins im sure this will be taken care of promptly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i really doubt that this will last long enough to be fantasy relevant even with the pickup of miller on offense they really need hopkins to move the chains someone will definitely budge well before the season begins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they just paid brocklobster huge money but they do have mill in cap space for whatever contract they agree to it doesnt need to be super cap friendly for this year i see this being resolved quickly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,almost positive i saw that hopkins said he wasnt worried about his contract not saying this is neither is false information but i dont know why hopkins contradicted himself
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think these nfl players should learn how to play basketball
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not sure why he would report then just leave lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hopefully thisll end up like the brief jamal charles contract holdout
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pay that man as a fantasy owner i demand it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when did reddit get so fuckin twitter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this will be worked out within the next days texans have a bunch to spend in so theyll at least work something out in the immediate hopkins is way too important to this team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,houston set a precedent when they signed jj watt and whitney mercilus to new deals prior to the and seasons both years into their careers watt made sense due to the historically great seasons he compiled prior to the extension but mercilus had career sacks over seasons not terrible but also not demanding of a new contract if i was nuk id hold out as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes a beast pay that man his money
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if this drags on do you think he will fall out of the first round in fantasy drafts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gulp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is it a good time to trade for hopkins now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,needs more cash money for that wardrobe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont get all this a contract is a contract he signed and he has to honor it nonsense nfl contracts are not guaranteed owners regularly cut underperforming players thereby not honoring contracts that they personally offered to players players should have the exact same right to cut their own contracts in an fair equal system instead because the owners set the rules players hold out instead i fully support that houston should pay him fair market value they already got one year of incredible value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hundredaires always siding with billionaires over millionaires cheering for laundry fake football teams over a dude maxing his earnings in a career thats guaranteed to be short ooookaayyyy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hell be back in under a week wont holdout
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please no nuk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gives more reps to my jaelen strong so i dont mind the holdout
fantasyfootball,not_removed,be afraid all kidding aside this finally gives me an excuse to move dez bryant up to my ranked wr ive been trying to justify nudging him ahead of nuk and this is enough for me to do so missed camp time is kind of a big deal even for veterans it seems like guys who hold out during camp struggle during the early part of the regular season and the fact that nuk will be working with a new qb this year only amplifies that issue plus camp holdouts seem more prone to injuries im not saying nuk will be a bust im just saying that if this holdout goes on for weeks dez will be a safer choice than him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont understand this he has two years left on his contract i guess this is just the nfl now contracts mean nothing these guys want it both ways they want a contract that guarantees money in case bad things happenand also want out of those contracts the moment they outplay it and the fact that its a rookie contract means he doesnt have any leverage all he can do is take hits to his own wallet so dumb edit if any of you think hes going to hold out and do anything except hit his own pocket book you havent been paying attention
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is it likely he resigns with the texans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gotta love the newage diva receivers these days have a good year better hold out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,unhappy with the contract he signed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol what a douche
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably manziels ex is telling hopkins she needs gold for her pussy the type of girl she is she dont give it away for free
fantasyfootball,not_removed,according to scheff texans arent interested in negotiating
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seriously i dont know what theyre thinking not paying him unless it was just a negotiating tactic guy is clearly their only serious receiving threat lamar miller needs something out there to give him room to run
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes only due a million this year hell be broke before a meaningful preseason game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes due a half million roster bonus wednesday if he shows so lets hope so
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its still nuk too any training camp issue should only adjust his adp by or if at all
fantasyfootball,not_removed,doug baldwin is making million a year nuke will want more than that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,people change their mind
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i thought i heard him say i want to be paid what im worth
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe he wasnt worried at the time because he thought he would easily get an extension
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe he said that because hes confident itll get taken care of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes getting paid less than will fuller this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he wasnt worried cause he thought he was about to get paid they went and got some other guys he didnt get his now hes holding out until he does he wanted to trust the team to do right by him but by no means should he wait around im with hopkins if he blows out his knee this year it had better be for more than million bucks or whatever his rookie salary is paying out the latest year he could literally be broke the rest of his life if he doesnt get a contract now someone is going to pay him whether its the texans or someone else even if he sits out a year that hell get probably million guaranteed next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why basketball baseball if anything guaranteed contracts no salary cap much easier on the body
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he actually played basketball for one season in college
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he never showed up espn gets a little excited when they rush the headlines
fantasyfootball,not_removed,apparently he did some errands at the office maybe picking stuff up but didnt officially report
fantasyfootball,not_removed,been that way for years i hate it should be text posts with a link to source in body imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nah
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if things are bleak at the end if august maybe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ah owell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same here but dont you think aj green has a lot of potential to put up similar numbers this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes been a great value since day tbh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,where are you seeing these people at of what i just read till i got here was saying houston absolutely needs to pay the man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bryants foot and ankle want to have a word with your prediction
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you meant aj green
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow long as hopkins is playing week nuk over dez every single time lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all of the texans first round picks got deals done in this year of their rookie contracts not unreasonable that he should expect the same even if it does seem greedy he deserves it and its the texans front office that set the precedent for this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rookie contracts are not negotiable how much you get paid depends on where youre drafted hes one of the top wr in the nfl he deserves to get paid like one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,exactly contracts in nfl mean nothing mostly if a player underperforms team will cut him or ask him to take a pay cut i fully support players holding out so they can get more money
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes done nothing but improve and was basically their whole offense last year im not a fan of paying wr top dollar but he definitely doesnt deserve rookie contract money either
fantasyfootball,not_removed,completely agree it really seems like these guys dont know what a contract is i agree that some of these players get way underpaid but they signed a contract then outplayed it if they can hold out and get paid more then teams should be able to hold out and pay less when the player sucks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah because its only the receivers holding out like fitzpatrick and von miller
fantasyfootball,not_removed,new age divas did you miss the and wrs today are barely divas comparatively
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes getting paid a million ask antonio brown how much hes getting paid as a top tier wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what only wrs holdout wrs are bigger divas today than or years ago huh what are you talking about are you high
fantasyfootball,not_removed,deleted to protect anonymity and prevent doxxing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well yea that was his rookie contract hes definitely outperformed that and deserves to be paid as such
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they will be pretty sure any of us could walk on at wr for the texans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes on his rookie contract it is not abnormal for even the best of rookies to finish out the contract before hitting their payday
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes a future goldmine for his agent if he has financial problems during his holdout his agent would front cash no problem
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he has a base salary something like a signing bonus and roster bonus hes making around itll be his highest paid year from his rookie contract though hes still ridiculously underpaid i think hes making more than a million dollars
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im betting the texans dont talk til after that deadline
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id hope he actually gets paid dude has lived up to his end of the bargain time to pay up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just so you know his nickname is nuk not nuke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if its multi year it can easily be for more than that annually and still have a low enough cap hit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes been watching ballers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,unless youre a pitcher
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just referencing the new nba cap and contracts theyre getting ridiculous
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol at someone trying to just pick up baseball it doesnt work like that most sports do but not baseball golf also
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fo real you just stand around all day for baseball
fantasyfootball,not_removed,too bad the announcers dont remind us every two seconds like with fucking gates and jimmy graham
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wow looked that up and he did but he only played games and minutes total didnt even score but he got a block
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ah that makes more sense lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its like the day you go into work knowing youre about to quit you show up not do a damn worth of work move things to your car in small batches throughout the day hoping no one notices make some positive comments to the coworkers you like leave a little earlier than usual and then wham leave a voicemail on your boss phone after hes left work saying you quit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he had to use the copier and fax machine why waste ink and paper at home
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so does romos collarbone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got dez aj and nuk all in the same bucket whoever costs me less auction dollars
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this here is an important piece of information if the texans have indeed extended their other first rounders this early hopkins deserves similar treatment from the organization he will influence their future too much to not treat as a franchise player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it would set a precedent and the team doesnt want to open pandoras box with rookie contracts nothing will come of this he doesnt have any real leverage if hes only going to make a million this season hes going to lose massive amounts of money every time he takes a fine
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its amazing how many people do not know this and are actively criticizing nuk for holding out with the average length of nfl careers what it is players should get every last dime they are worth as soon as they can one injury can end a career instantly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but he wont and the nfl has no reason to do anything any differently this situation is much better for them than paying out the nose for a rookie that busts thats why they made it this way
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes on his rookie contract thoughand not even on the last year many other players have had to deal with this situation and arent holding out i understand he wants to get paid huge but the huge contracts come in the second and third go around for these players why is he special
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont think hes saying anything about how much better he got more he is talking about how its pretty stupid that players can just choose to not honor their contracts yeah you had great first seasons but a contract is a contract you werent at the level when you signed it and if you didnt like it dont sign it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it is called a contract it is binding if a player signs a big deal then shits the bed next season you dont see teams holding out to pay less this is because they agreed to a contract
fantasyfootball,not_removed,teams do pay less when a player sucks they renegotiate players into lower dollar contracts all the time if the player wont budge then they get cut usually at a fraction of the cost to the team sometimes for no penalty at all nfl contracts arent fully guaranteed thats why when a guy gets a new deal it sounds like for years with guaranteed probably of the guarantee gets paid in the signing bonus and the other half gets paid in the first years of the contract then if dude sucks in year they can cut him for free in year so the actual deal ends up being over years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am all about contracts with more security to protect from injuries and have a nonnegotiable guaranteed money set in place but if these guys want to hold out every season where they outplay a contract then its just going to make teams less inclined to get in to large multiyear contracts since the player is going to bank on his performance one season at a time anyways
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah josh norman and mo wilkerson are great receivers too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bad example ab is way underpaid and looking for a new deal
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well he still is on it and signed it not others fault he didnt want less years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i literally just did that and got signed on at year million all guaranteed my brother who drove me there got signed on as the backup qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if youve got leverage might as well use it when im football who knows when you could be done for
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its also not unusual for teams to lock up their star players even if they are in their rookie contract its a sign of goodwill and not doing it for a wr like hopkins would be a terrible mistake because he will likely get a butt load more if they let him anywhere near the fa market
fantasyfootball,not_removed,people always forget the javon walker getting fucked by greenbay story
fantasyfootball,not_removed,risky remember what happened to spencer strassmore when vernon littlefields negotiations stalled
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the signing bonus was paid at signing the you refer to is the prorated cap hit from that bonus also he forfeits the roster bonus if hes not back in camp by wednesday plus he owes per day held out after that which would come out of his new contract even the million salary hasnt been paid yet because he hasnt played a game this season basically he has made no money from the texans in so far and is hurting everyone with this hold out i hope he takes a or around there and works it out after the season otherwise this could drag on for a while
fantasyfootball,not_removed,actually that isnt how contracts work he wouldnt have to give the money back if he was trash now would he the whole reason why rookies that havent played in the nfl get millions of dollars guaranteed is because there is a chance they significantly outplay their contract paying someone before their rookie contract is up is like buying a lottery ticket and then paying extra if its a winning ticket people dont seem to understand that player salaries are a zero sum game when nuk gets more money other players on the roster get cutless money he should get paid when its his turn to get paid not before
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can i call him duke nukem
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is nuk pronounced nuke or nuck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nukacola quantum
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its still pronounced nuke tho
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the nfl has rules about back loading contracts though theres a limit on how much you can do they need to get an interim year deal done and work it out after the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crap is that back on i dont think ive watched any tv since game of thrones ended and for some reason i thought ballers came back at the same time the football season started
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont know why but im having a hard time not believing that ricky is really jarvis landry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,meh who cares about ucls
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its like if your or over or you made a three pointer some point in your life your going to get at least million from an nba team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you earn the real money for your bat though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you see hes boxing out like hes getting a rebound and bahm touchdown
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree hopkins over green all day
fantasyfootball,not_removed,romos collarbone who is just the rep for the rest of romos crumbling skeleton
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its ok we got kellen moore
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the precedent has already been set the texans have all of their first round picks since on their roster and the last several picks got their extension at the same point in their rookie contracts that would coincide with where hop is barring watt he is more deserving than any of them and the texans front office already set the precedent for when they extend first round rookies
fantasyfootball,not_removed,name another player who is in the same situation where the punter is getting paid more than the same guy who was your whole offense aka receptions over yards mind you a rookie contract he cant control its so funny the amount of people who are getting on him for this seem like the same people who are dispensable at their own jobs where as nuk if he isnt suiting up on the field week that whole offense will be in the bottom or in the league the man is a difference maker and while i stated earlier that i dont like giving wr top money nuk should not be playing on a mil salary come week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the nfl should start giving their players guaranteed contracts then you cant just give the owners all the power breh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it is called a contract it is binding if a player signs a big deal then shits the bed next season you dont see teams holding out to pay less you are wrong teams will force guys to take less money or be cut very regularly they often do this at times that makes it most difficult for a player to catch on with another team giving them no leverage to refuse i mean you just dont know what youre talking about plain and simple you dont know how this works
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats how the league is now these owners dont care about their players they just see a number and dollar signs why not get as much as you can as fast as possible right now his base salary is million he could really get hurt this season and then hes screwed over since he has no guaranteed money i understand why hes doing this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,length is non negotiable for rookie contracts buddy and the amounts are set to a scale so the total amount isnt either
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no doubt they will pay him at the end of the season if not now before he becomes an ufa
fantasyfootball,not_removed,javon walker isnt as good as hopkins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont what happened
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good ass show
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i only meant to point out hes due to earn more than a million this year youre not at all wrong i understand where the guys coming from with this hold out im usually on the athletes side on many issues by default but this especially is understandable and im sure everyone from deandre to the front office to fantasy players want this to be resolved quickly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not really lottery tickets are a bad value whereas all rookie contracts are a screaming bargain players as good as hopkins are rare trying to squeeze out an extra year of value from his rookie contract is bad business negotiating extensions while a player is under contract is how you lock in fair value for your studs if you want to put the players longterm earning potential in jeopardy by forcing him to play out the end of a nonguaranteed deal you help your cap in the short term but then he walks and gets free agent money and you try to rebuild with lots of cap space and no talent paying osweiler and then not extending hopkins is basically telling him youre the most important player on our offense but we arent going to pay you in fact you are going to pay the quarterbacks salary
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he wouldnt have to give the money back if he was trash now would he what is this your first year watching the nfl guys get cut all the time the nfl is a violent game with short career spans and very little guaranteed money i dont blame him one bit for holding out for a market level contract in a sport where any given snap could ruin your career
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what is all this gibberish people get new contracts early all the time people also restructure sometimes downward to help the team out with cap hit you just said a lot of condescending shit that means nothing this is the real world the guy wants his money maybe the team will budge maybe they wont if they dont maybe hell crack or maybe hell continue to hold out its not really too complicated kid
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like the sound of that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it is pronounced nook like nook and cranny
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nuck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nuke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,knock k silent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its pronounced nook
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the point is simply that the can give him more than million per year despite the fact that they currently only have million in cap space im sure there are limits but they arent prohibitive at all here for example see brees cap hit this year for the saints thats some serious backloading
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah episode is tomorrow night
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah but jarvis gonna get a big contract
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why would you extend a guy with two years left on his deal that just sounds like mismanagement he literally has nothing he can hold over the team i can understand extending him in the last year of his deal but this is a year early part of the dance with cap construction is finding value one of the reasons the seahawks were so good over the last four years is because they had a bunch of players on their rookie contracts and they didnt have to let anyone go because of money issues
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and once hes out of his rookie contract hell get paid many more times over a punter got to pay your dues the reason the contracts are like this is because rookie contracts were getting completely out of hand and half the guys getting paid hadnt done a thing to earn it it was getting paid off performance projections nonsense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont know much about contract system in the nfl im a hockey person players barely getting paid a million and they are some great young players these guys play out the full shitty contract and finally earn that pay day
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ok maybe im missing something can you give me one example
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they picked up his year option for million this offseason so hes effectively on a deal currently with guaranteed a lot can happen in years and hes a top tier talent with a new qb so i can see why he would want a bunch of money up front
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in they didnt pass as much as they do now and he was a hoss injured last year of rookie contract everyone was like oh he should play etc etc dont hold out so he did the right he got hurt and green bay didnt give him the contract he deserved
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just in case you didnt know they are talking about the fictional show ballers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he fronted cash and that clown listened to his leach friend and turned his back on the peoples champ
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you should try entourage too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well put if they renegotiate with him this year they can get a fair price if they wait id imagine theres a large chance he walks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dukkle nukkle
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is the correct answer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i watched that whole commercial for some reason and i dont even have kids
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wrong its pronounced nook
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i get what youre saying but its part of the balance of power if players dont have the leverage granted by holding out the owners could perpetually lowball their contracts which are basically completely voided as soon as the player is cut i also think the owners should just pay the guy its just as much their fault that hes not playing dude is a top receiver in the nfl and theyre just being cheap give him a raise he earned it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont know much about contract system in the nfl honestly it shows you shouldnt have a strong opinion when you understand the system so poorly its ok to not share your uninformed opinion you dont have to comment
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i could point to literally hundreds of examples
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i just started this show a few days ago
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if it drives flies floats or fucks lease it spencer strassmore
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the peoples champlol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,should have given him the rock bottom
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love entourage is ballers comparable to it i havent found another show that scratches that itch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,like nookie without the ee
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if they lowball contracts then they wont get the player somebody is always willing to pay for a talented free agent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,very much so definitely a bro show equivalent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i think ballers was really trying to go for an entourage feeling but went with a sports theme
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no lol youre missing the point all owners would have the power so players would be at a huge disadvantage in negotiations
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rookie contracts are based on their draft position as is length the only negotiable aspects are guaranteed money and bonuses which still cant exceed the total amount based on their draft position the players are literally no longer allowed to negotiate contacts based off what they think they are worth when they are drafted due to the rookie wage scale negotiated several years ago in the cba players can only sign with the team that drafts them unless the team agrees to trade them eli manningphilip rivers as an example please stop making players sound bad for things entirely out of their control when they enter the league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if this is the case its the exact same way as it is in the nhl there has never been a case of a player asking for more money austin matthews wont and hes going to be a top player in the nhl yet he makes less than a million a year right now because he knows this is what every rookie has to go through its completely in their control to play or not i dont think its right to not agree a contract just because you think you are worth more then get your money when the contract is up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he ded
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is a strange post
fantasyfootball,not_removed,strange way to come out of the closet but whatever works for you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hey what do you mean you people
fantasyfootball,not_removed,psycho
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes a pats fan what did you expect
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am pretty sure free agent auction is exactly the same is normal waivers but instead of submitting claims you submit bids
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you have it correct it sounds as exactly as its written continuous means just that players are never free agents and you can set waivers to process on whatever days youd like free agent auction has players become free agents on whatever day you designate typically wednesday in fact im not entirely sure you can change this both systems use the auction process dropped players will be on waivers for however long you set as the waiver period so theyll be on waivers regardless of the format you choose you should definitely use one of these systems but its up to you whether you want players to always be on waivers or to allow free agent pickups my ideal system is continuous waivers processing thursday and sunday but on sunday morning they all become free agents to allow for last minute replacements the purpose behind continuous waivers is to not give anyone an advantage for being closer to a computer when news breaks that is unlikely to be an issue on sundays so having players as free agents allows owners the freedom of not being forced to account for a questionable sunday night player until game inactives are actually revealed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is there a way to have your recommended faab system on espn i only have the option of continuous or just faa i want to have waivers run everyday but sunday and monday so the owners in my league arent penalized for last minute game time decisions any advice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,unfortunately i do not believe you can have it automated what you would have to do and it does require a bit of commissionering yes i made that word up is set it to continuous waivers processing thursday and sunday and then every sunday morning at a designated time switch it to noncontinuous waivers then once the monday night game has started and everyone is on waivers switch it back to continuous i think not sure that espn allows you to change the waiver system throughout the season if not then unfortunately this is one of the many customizable features that espn and yahoo do not provide for in their antiquated systems
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ah all good appreciate the reply buddy ill probably just stick to continuous until an option like this comes around
fantasyfootball,not_removed,again this is just an index thread please do not use this thread to ask for help go directly to each thread to discuss and ask for help all comments on this thread will be deleted thank you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for every player i dont want i raise the bid secretly to while everyone is rapidly bidding this causes someone to overbid on one player and they dont have the budget to get anyone else therefore you can buy anyone you want without having to spend a lot this strategy is effective
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i play in auction leagues and have been doing it for a lot of years the best advice i can give you is to find value rather than gameplan this kind of strategy now its nice to have a plan but if several of the studs you are targeting get run up beyond their value overpaying for them does you no good im not a fan of studs and scrubs as a strategy but if youre going to do it i would suggest targeting studs that are at the bottom of their respective tiers not as sexy but the values are typically much better i would also suggest that you grab several mid round values instead of all scrubs youll have a better chance of success if any of your studs falter which brings me to why i dont like the strategy youre basically betting your whole season on your studs being successful catch an unlucky injury and your season is done
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in a auction most of the stud players go in the range ill usually throw out or bid up big names that i know people are going to overbid for but if i win im not disappointed to have them have a cheat sheet with auction values on hand so you know if a guy is going above or below his average value think adp let everyone else blow their wad on the sexy names and draft for value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in a auction ppr league studs in my league can go in the range if you were to survey my league people who go studs and duds usually finish out of the playoffs because of injury depth matters you are usually better off spending big on players big meaning and and then grabbing a bunch of guys in range in that range last year i got tom brady brandon marshall jeremy maclin chris ivory desean jackson arian foster and martellus bennett while they all werent great i thought the strategy better mitigated injury risk with higher upside then lottery tickets half of them panned out into starterstud caliber players
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my league is a league with a auction budget most studs go for between which is expensive but since its a keeper league its really a multiyear investment my strategy is to have studs as keepers going into the draft and come out with more that way my entire starting lineup is studs i dont want to have to play weekly guessing games with a horde of sleepers and boomorbust plays im totally ok with my k and d all being if they dont pan out i can pick up someone in the middle of the season that is just as good or better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the other doesnt make it worth it though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shady i like it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,forgive me but ive never done auction wouldnt doing this mean you pay for a player you dont want also how is a bid secret
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont see it as very fair in the end ive never done an auction draft but im willing to switch to it in my league soon and was reading a few about it something i read was to place the bid right and not just if i was in an auction draft id be waiting for the bid war to come to an end before i click something at least
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lmao i dont think im willing to screw someone over like that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in a auction most of the stud players go in the range wow its funny how much different leagues will vary and why those auction value lists are pointless in my ppr league with a cap julio went for last season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do you keep the players at the same price they were originally drafted for or do they not even count against your budget the latter sounds pretty interesting but also like it could lead to some unbalanced teams if someone ends up with mega studs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what about a league with players and budget ppr if you were in a league like that how would you approach it no keepers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jerm i like it too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think hes trying to say while everyone is clicking the bid button he inputs a bid of hoping someone will click bid quickly without looking he says its effective but i cant imagine that working in any league not populated with idiots
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive seen someone try it and no one bite last year someone dropped of their budget on aaron rodgers and wound up starting sproles and bilal powell it was hilarious
fantasyfootball,not_removed,holy fuck i think ive seen some stud rbs go for in the a couple times but thats it curious as to what other players were going for or if that was just one owner the got suckered howd the rest of his team turn out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theres no penalty for keepers also no limit on how long you can keep them which yes can create a bit of imbalance though my experience is that the people who have the best teamskeepers tend to be the smartest drafters so its not unfair in my eyes but the general effect is almost like a quasidynasty league feel as the guys on your team feel like theyre yours because you can have them their whole career if it works out that way i enjoy it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my league avoids the issue by having salary inflation for keepers players can be kept for and a player goes for we round up you can keep a player for years and franchise tag them in the fourth year for the average value of the top players at his position the salary cap management is by far the most fun part of the league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive never played in a league with those rules so im not speaking from experience but i think i would approach it largely the same way i probably wouldnt spend of my budget on guy as with no keepers theres no sense in killing the rest of your draft in order to get guy but i do think a premium should still be paid for studs especially in a league where rosters will be spread a bit thinner i would also value guys who you anticipate being consistent players eric decker jonathan stewart types over longshot potential season winners the second type of player can win your league but theyre much more likely to waste you and several weeks putting up points in your starting lineup the longshot guys who will be the season winners will probably emerge midseason on the waiver wire so i wouldnt try to find them by spraying and praying with your auction money
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ayyy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also gotta remember if its a keeper league or not if it is then players are being kept for less than market value therefore there is more money to be spent to the remaining players budget keeper league the top guy usually goes for close to because someone has obj for from two years ago and doesnt have to spend the he normally would
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think he finished middle of the pack prices for the top guys usually run between two guys just walked in to the auction going after julio we also had keeper going into last season so the discount youre getting on keeper value drives prices up a little bit and more than a few of the other were being kept that said i play in two other reauction leagues one is right in line with yours the other is about higher ime its really league dependent based on how a group of owners like to build their teams
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah mine are keepers too i guess its all about the dynamic if everyone is paying for their top player then the values of everyone else adjust accordingly interesting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,exactly your dollar values for players are only accurate until people start using money if someone overpays for a player the total amount of dollars remaining in the draft decreases ive always used the footballguys draft dominator because it adjusts dollar values on the fly for each player picked
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there seems to be an absurd number of mustown receivers available this week this doesnt feel like my league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have held the since week missed ajay tyrell ware guess who is going to get the nod colin fucking kaepernick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,marshawn
fantasyfootball,not_removed,list of reasons to use waiver spot stud rb goes down for season pick up undisputed handcuff
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if youve held on to it so far i really dont think this is the week to use it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,absurd amount of must own i cant think of one must own off the top of my head unless its like a team or maybeee a team league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,last year that bad boy netted me rawls and hightower hang onto it youll know when the time is right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,peyton hillis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,brandon marshall
fantasyfootball,not_removed,knile davis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i held it for a while to start the year so glad i finally spent it even though i basically wasted it i am not free to make as many claims as i want next year i wont place as big an emphasis on the first waiver claim
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if there are mustown receivers then you should probably burn a waiver spot on one of them if you need one considering this is the last week before the playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,grabbing tyreek hill someone dropped him right before the early games for a kicker lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive had mine almost all season in my league i considered burning it for inman mitchell or sims this week still undecided if anyone would like to give me a hand
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tyreek hill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im out of the playoffs stealing kaep from last years champ and beating him out of the playoffs with him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our waiver doesnt work off your usage but how bad you are doing ie if you are you get last spot waiver every week if you are you have waiver to fix your shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive had waiver since week still have it still not going to use it im and clinched seed already i picked up tyreek hill kaepernick r kelley and kc defense off free agency as i would wait for waivers to clear i grabbed these players about a week or two before their hypes peaked shout out to this subreddit for making all that possible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hightower could be worse
fantasyfootball,not_removed,who is worth a going forward im pretty sure all the viable handcuffs are taken do you really think burkhead or the sd backup or alex collins or damien williams or artimispayne or langford or benny cunningham are going to save your season i think everybody is forgetting that dj was a known speculative add last year if you played in a decently competitive league if not you didnt play in a competitive league sorry he was explosive in the beginning of the year scored tds and was on peoples radars if you are in a competitive league and have been holding the until week you should use it on tyreek if available but he shouldnt be you wasted it because there is going to be no season saving player from what i can see all the talent should be rostered at this point the potential are all hasbeens i dont know of any young players that are just waiting for the guy in front of them to go down to shine the potential perkins kdix howard gillisee henry richards or experience like morris should be rostered you should have used your
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this has been a terrible year for the waiver spot but if ezekiel elliot gets hurt youre gonna feel like an ass
fantasyfootball,not_removed,held all year someone dropped aj green do you use it do you idk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is why i dont hold mine i put in claims times per year im rarely below youll find that if you are around and make a move you end up back at after people behind you make moves and people in front of you make multiple moves this i never do the following week youre back at and can get another quality player wake up at when not making a claim for first cracks at unclaimed players
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but what if sammys been there the whole time though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,going off of this you never would have gotten obj in though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,profit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for tyreek even he seems dependable not just a one week wonder
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gabriel i know he doesnt get a huge amount of targets but his schedule is looking tasty as fuck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tyreek hill is still available in my league so im burning my on him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ted ginn jr stone hands ted never drops a ball
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kenny britt if hes available
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i never saw the big deal either no player is ever a sure thing it seems crazy to hold on to it week after week my best pickups came as free agents this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had him and started him last week and then dropped him for tyler boyd this week thinking he wouldnt get anything done vs denver oh well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i picked him up and started him the last two weeks then benched him against denver
fantasyfootball,not_removed,inman easily mitchel is the option at best on the pats and only did well because gronk was out sims is coming off injury and is at best a pass catching change of pace substitute for doug
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is the worst system it penalizes teams for doing well and can pendulum shift the balance of power come playoff time since ww pickups are an integral part of fantasy football success
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it depends if people are holding handcuffs or not i still have my priority but im also not rostering ellington as a dj owner no room alfred morris is also currently on the wire as well as gillislee
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would possible week return could be a league winner
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no its a fools game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably not because the bengals are done for the year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats exactly what i do too i realized i was holding onto the number for way too long and missing out on players that could help me im always hovering around and can usually get who i want the guy that has had the number in my league since day still hasnt used it you miss out on way too much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i completely agree with you i had plenty of missed opportunities because i was determined to hold on to that waiver i did get a few good players staying up late and letting the waiver clear but im not going to place so much value on the waiver where i miss other great players
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that was week though were at the dark horse studs are out there arent any more surprises except for injury there are no more bye weeks for the rest of the year this is where you get david johnson you dont get david johnson by blowing your wad on a point chase you are only using a for speculative purposes in this situation if you are fighting for your playoff life and you dont have enough healthy players to field a team otherwise youre either already good and waiting for a knockout punch or youre out of contention and well fuck it do whatever
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tyreek went a while ago in my league my team league the ww choices are guys like inman gabriel and whoever the bears player was
fantasyfootball,not_removed,considering the same thing chiefs are quietly on a roll and it would feel good to pick up someone on an upswing ive been holding this whole season though and am basically locked into playoffs tough decision but my gut says go for it whats your reasoning for burning on him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes been owned for a good weeks or so
fantasyfootball,not_removed,though this is usually the case i saved it for weeks last year and dwill won me the ship high riskhigh reward to hold it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you im still really torn between that and not using it all this is my second year playing ff betting on an injury seems risky lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i too am in a league so i imagine our ww is similar may i ask what your rank is im trying to decide if i want to burn my waiver at all this week and i could use the input
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he has been consistently a huge part of that offense doubledigit targets in a few recent games and then that outburst against denver it seems really good i just hope i dont miss out on an rb pickup laterm
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its a gamble either way i cant deny hill has been good im just a perennial skeptic of kcs passing game ware could light it up next week and hill will out up pts in standard maybe ppr the main reason to use the waiver priority is when a team is decimated by injuries and has no choice but to over utilize a given player keep an eye on maclin and prepare for someone else to keep more touches next week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not necessarily high risk though if your league isnt too active on the ww you can usually get pretty good results after waiting for waivers to clear
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my rank
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i get that and thats what ive been saving it for some big rb to go down and im sitting there with waiver but i did that with booker and it has been underwhelming ware hasnt really been the new j charles my feeling now is those starters that are great are like that because of their talent and not entirely their teams plus theres not a lot of time for a backup to gain steam now it wouldnt feel good starting a guy right out of the gate in the playoffs t hill has been ramping up and has heavy usage i feel like if i save it any longer ill end up just blowing it in week just because its there i mean how many more players are really going to step up like hill has this late in the season plus it seems to me that when teams become decimated by injures the whole team suffers replacements included i feel like maclin coming back would only help hill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also a very good point weve since moved to faab in the league in question however i play in another no so active league with weekly gross ww been all year and have done fine on the wire with the position
fantasyfootball,not_removed,current position winloss
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not sure why that matters though theres either value in your ww or theres not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im with waiver im not using it this week because i can afford to not take a chance on the available guys if i had to win this week to make the playoffs id probably use it without hesitation i think thats why it matters
fantasyfootball,not_removed,adddrop thread should be posted within the hour post there instead youll get responses edit missed that this is for keeper but still best to do there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wrong thread
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theres certainly a noway list for certain players at their adp but at the right pick if a player i dont particular like falls far enough ill certainly take him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shepard over hill is a joke he had more yards from scrimmage and more rushreceiving tds he outscored him in leagues where you get zero credit for return years and return tds hill finished between and in scoring systems that dont include return yards shepard was in the mid shepard scored under points different times in games once he was effectively a starter hill did that just once in games and was money in the playoffs with many people playing in leagues where they do get credit for the return tds hills tds puts him waaaay ahead of shepard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i guess aguayo didnt make the list
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its just some random dudes list man dont worry too much about it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did aguayo stop being a kicker
fantasyfootball,not_removed,again this is just an index thread please do not use this thread to ask for help go directly to each thread to discuss and ask for help all comments on this thread will be deleted thank you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if powell is active im starting him buf has been getting torched recently and that shouldnt change this week with the exodus of the ryan bros
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not exactly on topic but why did the jets get forte to begin with powell has looked like a better receiving back than forte is at his career and we saw that last year they run their team like i run my madden connected franchise
fantasyfootball,not_removed,struggling with this call powell vs ingram ill probably decide on sunday morning
fantasyfootball,not_removed,are there a lot of leagues playing this week i would mad if i realized i had a playoff championship sunday way too many meaningless games if your teams playoff destiny is sealed a two score lead will most likely lead to every starter being benched
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same boat i had to drop hyde and gordon and im iffy on ajayi and im hoping mccoy gets a full load i just picked up quizz and powell last week so far mccoy and quizz are in and idk if i should flex powell as i have new wr new te and new rb on my squad with all but powell starting also stuck on clay or fedora since i dropper brate and im watching reed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i got powell as well hopefully he plays i got deangelo williamsjacquizz rodgersdarren mcfadden lined up in case he doesnt im also benching gordon and elliot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but man forte was just killer those first what games it was impressive for the old guy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah im mad we didnt start the playoffs one week earlier this week is the worst
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in a points only league and we play through week and we like going the full but i wouldnt play in a match up league that played week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably not bucs still have something to play for and i would bet on him getting more touches than powell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yds for a career low this year not bad for the old man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jacquizz getting more touches than ingram you think saints dont have anything to play for i believe and tampa has a chance to make the playoffs or something i think ingrams a better player but jacquizz might be used more
fantasyfootball,not_removed,correct me if im wrong but isnt coleman a beast in situations like this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good for julio i need him to go nuts this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,looks like im starting julio freeman and coleman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,does that make julio startable
fantasyfootball,not_removed,upvote in hopes your correct because coleman is my this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wish i could say yes but the saints sold out to stop him last time they met obviously it backfired big time but you never know with these division games not like it matters though youre firing up julio regardless just pray you get directv julio and not cable julio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a falcons fan i honestly have no clue certainly it cant be bad for julio but last time the two teams played the saints were focused on stopping julio and the run game ruined them not to mention neither gabriel nor hooper were really involved in the falcons offense at that point in the season it hinges on the defensive gameplan and the saints run defense has improved since last time while their secondary has just been ravaged by injury so i expect a more passoriented attack from the falcons this time around
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe hell break points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes been startable friend its julio jones 💪🏻
fantasyfootball,not_removed,godspeed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,did they really sell out to stop him or was it just that with coleman and freeman rushing for ypc they didnt really need to go over the top to julio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,playing against freeman and i have julio along side golden tate reading this is making me feel much more comfortable im not nervous one bit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think its unfair to say martin sucked for two years when he was just injured and playing with a sub par offense i also think a regression is unlikely because his tds were so low last year tds in comparison to his carries and yards rush and rec i always like targeting players like martin this year or hopkins last year who just didnt have the tds the year prior to boost their total fps because theyre usually under valued the following year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jameis will make the leap and bring up the stats of everyone around him tampa is my dark horse playoff team this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,from what i can tell his two down years after his stellar rookie season can be blamed on nagging injuries and a sub par oline he has finished as a top rb twice in the last years he clearly has the talent to be great i think the entire bucs offense will take a big step forward this season i have the first overall pick this year and im really hoping doug falls to me at the turn
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if you get him be patient with him his early season has mostly brutal matchups before the bye if you dont get id keep an eye on him as a buy low for his bye week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bucs and years he dealt with some nagging injuries he looked pretty slow as well compared to his rookie year not sure if he just bulked up too much last year he came to camp down pounds and you could tell in the preseason he looked way faster and i was hopeful of a return to his rookie form he looked like a completely different rb from his previous two seasons charles sims will definitely be involved but isnt a threat to steal early down work draft doug with confidence i expect him to put up similar numbers to last year lovie pulled him multiple times after fumbles as well and just randomly so he could have put up even better numbers hopefully he worked on his fumbling issues and i can see dirk koetter being a little more lenient
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eye test watch him in preseason last preseason he advertised to everyone what he will be in the regular season look for the same this year personally i personally believe he will be just fine maybe a slight regression in stats but nothing to derail your team if you take him at adp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drafted him for pennies on the dollar as part of my strategy last year also helped that he was basically and projected cost this year he is lower part of and projected at so the expectations are significantly higher
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not sure he will repeat last year but hes being drafted as like a backend end i think he can finish the season as that given he has the talent and i think the bucs geniunely feed him the ball consistently
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he gets volume and is talented to make the best out of them i think hes healthy and is surrounded by other competent players he may not get the same yards but i expect a little uptick in tds from him this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,imo it seems like doug martin is fantastic but at times has been dragged down by a horrendous offense with winston improving things last year he dominated and the offense will probably be a little better again this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,interesting hadnt looked at it through those eyes i like it makes me excited to get doug in the thurd
fantasyfootball,not_removed,evans is a good target this year when looking at it that way theres some good articles on about td regression candidates that show how tds are the least correlated year to year stat and therefore dont represent a players skill level and a low td year is usually unlikely to be repeated
fantasyfootball,not_removed,his teammate mike evans fits that role as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree that the team will improve but that schedule is brutal the first month or so
fantasyfootball,not_removed,exactly where i drafted hopkins last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,doug in the third team league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,predicting a teams success based on their schedule before the year starts literally never holds true
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nah qb man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i predict the patriots will make the playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah but itd be like predicting theyd make the playoffs just because they have an easy schedule
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i mean its definitely possible that obj outscores ab but it is the less likely scenario ab has been producing at a ridiculous pace
fantasyfootball,not_removed,abjjobj in that order imo only bc of the qb position on each of those teams
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if the giants make an effort to improve their o line i could see obj finishing this upcoming year however like some others said its more likely that ab takes numero uno
fantasyfootball,not_removed,na obj is great and all but ab has the better quarterback and is much less of a hothead
fantasyfootball,not_removed,browns been more reliable on a pergame basis than obj and ends up with a higher end of season point total plus his style of play leaves him less susceptible to injury even though thats not a concern for either of these guys cant go wrong with either but odell would have to match his rookie year production which was a historic pace to surpass antonios yeartoyear consistency for even one year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no i am not a stupid person
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there is always the possibility and you can definitely make an argument to do so i wouldnt criticise you if you did obj is right there with julio and ab imo as the top wideouts in fantasy in ben mcadoos offense they are going to throw the ball that is as much of a guarantee as a sean payton offense the question you have to ask yourself which at the top of the draft is what i do who is the most likely to give you the value at the spot you are drafting it becomes difficult when you look at antonio browns production but here are some stats for you ab in games catches catch percentage touchdowns yards on targets obj games catches catch percentage touchdowns yards on targets at abs pace for a game season with objs targets he would have finished with catches yards and touchdowns both are going to be super productive but it would be very difficult for me to take obj over ab imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,obj has a habit of being garbage early on and is also completely infuriating to watch so theres no way i want him on my team for that high of a cost
fantasyfootball,not_removed,absolutely not
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the presence leveon bell and freemancoleman are what make ab and julio jones better choices than obj the qb play on the teams is similar enough in that all would be considered top qbs in this league with the caliber of receivers were talking about the qb play shouldt showcase too much of a discernible advantage or disadvantage to any of these guys having a strong running game to split the defenses concentration is key in this particular situation
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a packer fan this big ben retirement talk reminds me so much of brett favre im starting to get flashbacks hes not retiring hes got too much talent around him to retire
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think youre leaving out the top guy here i would take jj before both of those two if he can stay healthy for a year theres no doubt to me that he ends up as the wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no way i think ab is the better receiver and ben is the better qb only way you draft obj over ab is if youre a giants homer imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,obj ab julio obj has a higher td upside than brown or julio and more of the giants offense runs thru him than the steelers falcons offenses for his counterparts nyg dont have a reliable running game thus they still have to throw it more around the goal line eli is also more reliable in staying healthy than big ben and there is not as noticeable a homeroad split for eli cannot go wrong with any of them honestly but i still think obj is the best bet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,about seconds bitch
fantasyfootball,not_removed,heres my logic all things the same ab is better however which is more likely to happen ben plays all games or eli plays all games theyre close enough that i go with consistency at qb over individual talent
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck no and at this point i think obj is a little overrated he seems to crumble in high pressure games and really i dont have much faith in the giants offense i would much rather have ab or even julio jones over obj or a top tier running back you can always find some good to decent wr on the waiver wire so i plan on using top picks on a premium rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nope i would draft mike evans before either of them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id draft julio before both of them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lolable line of questioning of fucking course not better team and better player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they put up virtually the same numbers this year why is it so outrageous like a few here think
fantasyfootball,not_removed,does matt ryan spreading the ball around make you question jj he reguarly throws to receivers in a game makes jj very boomorbust
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its the reverse for me i think ab is regressing somewhat jj is looking unstoppable and obj is the giants main offensive weapon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but big bens inability to stay healthy seems to work counter to your reasoning ab has horrible numbers when ben isnt under center
fantasyfootball,not_removed,obj before julio every time man julio is far more boombust as well as injury prone then obj in fantasy in fact id take evans before julio as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yup
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had all three in plus mike evans man that was a fun season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i like the idea but i feel like the safety of having one of the best wrs im the game would make me lean towards ab obj is riskier
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt say injury isnt a concern for beckham
fantasyfootball,not_removed,obj the giants offense has a habit of being garbage early on and is also completely infuriating to watch ftfy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if he can stay healthy thats the difficult part
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes never healthy and even if he is jj may very well end with the highest total points but he has always been boom or bust ab is less likely to get you the monster game but is generally far more consistent depends what you want i guess id tend to go with consistency
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio has an pretty long history of injuries though he played most of last year w foot problems and it caused games where he would score almost points and lose you the game i would much rather have a consistent ab or a top tier running back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,obj loses you as many games as he wins you id rather have the high floor of abjj
fantasyfootball,not_removed,remind me months
fantasyfootball,not_removed,idk who downvoted you but mike evans is insane and if you really feel that way i would try to trade your draft pick so you can end up near the end of the first round or take a top tier rb and then try to wheel evans at the very beginning of round evans is prob worth more than julio or obj in terms of value in regards to where in the draft you can pick him up i think the cat is out of the bag this next year on him though and he could easily go in the first round which would be overpaying if hes there in the round though i would for sure try and grab him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why would you draft the less consistent higher injury prone player of the three first
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i might take julio over obj but certainly not ab ab is debatably the number one pick off the board like he was last year in many leagues the guy is just that good my problem with him is that big ben is always getting hurt which definitely causes some problems
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre being downvoted for your language here im guessing but youre absolutely right obviously its laughable and ab is better not close obj might be one of the most overrrated wr in the league sure he is very fast and talented but he still plays with eli manning at qb and the giants and he seems to disappear in high pressure big moments
fantasyfootball,not_removed,imagine fantasy football as rolling a dice if you pick ab you win by rolling a or if you pick odb you win by rolling a or there is a good chance that you roll a or but there is a better chance that you roll a or it makes very little sense to go for the lower probably play if you have a choice
fantasyfootball,not_removed,seriously julio would alternate between two points and thirty in standard literally the definition of boom or bust
fantasyfootball,not_removed,also his oc left
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yes but hes still julio lol hes going to have some point games that just make you auto win the week almost definitely worth the upside imo there are the occasional duds but most players have those that being said i would also rank it abjjobj hell i might even want a guy like jordy nelson over obj at this point esp considering you can pick him up considerably later in the draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats true but everyone knows hes their main weapon my only reservations with obj is that the rest if the giants offense lacks the depth of the steelers and falcons pittsburg and atlanta both have great running cores and passing options outside of their top receiver the giants have no running core and you could argue that shepard was making some noise but other than that obj is the giants offense and will be heavily guarded the entire season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio is more injury prone than ab historically and also abs numbers have been redic i think ab is the clear number receiver in the nfl and anyone who disputes that isnt paying enough attention to how those teams operate their offense schemes and the injury histories
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fitz puts your reasoning back in the pile
fantasyfootball,not_removed,julio literally scored single digits a few times this year that is not a high floor the end of year numbers will be there but consistency is not not his fault though the falcons offense can take what the defense give them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i play standard and last i checked evans did better than either of them last year add to it the certainty the bucs grab distraction from evans in fa or draft evans should have a strong year again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,evans is a first rounder without a doubt easy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my language eh has anyone here actually played fantasy football
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as someone that drafted hopkins in the first missed the playoffs but had the highest scoring team in the league i would absolutely take up and down play rather than just down play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that could be a good thing for julio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jordy will go within picks of odell
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my only reservations with obj is that the rest if the giants offense lacks the depth of the steelers and falcons pittsburg and atlanta both have great running cores and passing options outside of their top receiver the giants have no running core and you could argue that shepard was making some noise but other than that obj is the giants offense and will be heavily guarded the entire season this has been the case for objs entire career so far he still has tds in less than seasons worth of games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,main offensive weapon in an offense quarterbacked by eli manning so downgrade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you forgot his ankle too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and marshall brings it back out fantasy is about statistical probabilities just because an anomaly happens doesnt mean those probabilities should be thrown out the window
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fitz puts your reasoning back in the pile literally had to change positions because his physical abilities faded
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah but i have more faith and trust in matt ryan i guess this year it could depend on schedules if they play the vikings during playoff weeks i might avoid them my perception of jjs floor is higher than objgoing into last season but the freemancoleman duo really ate into his production i guess this year i would lean obj damn maybe skip them and go for good value picks in later rounds like eric decker kelvin benjamin and keenan allen of the los angeles chargers cringe
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh im not saying youre wrong evans was amazing and consistent i just want to see how this looks then
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with you fwiw but when you phrase it the way you did people get salty lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes still been money in ppr at least that said i would in no circumstance take him over odell obviously but changing position didnt hugely impact his fantasy numbers based on nothing but recency bias to be fair
fantasyfootball,not_removed,eh its just one of those things my dad used to say you ask a stupid question you get a stupid answer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,obj i great and i would have him above julio just not above antonio brown eli may throw beckham a lot of tds but will also throw a lot of balls to the other team averages an interception per game for his career
fantasyfootball,not_removed,talking about over his career eli games played career interceptions thats intg tds or tdsgame ben games played career interceptions thats intg tds or tdsgame so elis career tdint ratio is while bens is ok now you go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,career is meaningless at this point at their age its what have you done recently
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not really because eli continues to prove that hes an intg player and as you age you typically get worse
fantasyfootball,not_removed,last years ill happily exchange ints per season for more yards and more tds plus the confidence that eli will play the whole year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for like a second little early here damn vultures
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i knew he was hurt the moment that big son of a bitch defensive guy fell on him with his full body shit looked painful hopefully nothing serious
fantasyfootball,not_removed,always wondered how these guys take these hits one of those and id be fucking done
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it was definitely his left shoulder that was hurt i hope they can just pop it back in and send him out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hill is back in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,his leg looked like he couldnt move his left arm
fantasyfootball,not_removed,still on the bench tho
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mad because i started him not as mad because if its serious i have bernard on the bench hate to see players get hurt always though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,possible stinger
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shoulder looked fucked
fantasyfootball,not_removed,looked like he got the wind knocked out of him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it looked his his shoulder not leg or hip it was hanging limp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it was his arm not leg
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely a shouldarm best case scenario is a stinger his helmet is on he looks fine
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just got a carry good to go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,back in the game and got yards my man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hill is back in the game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes been running like shit since he came back
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely a kidney
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck everything
fantasyfootball,not_removed,straight weeks with injuries to a starter for me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,looked like hip to me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,looks like his day is done fuck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,reminds me of when johnny knoxville took a hit from an nfl linebacker he flew back like feet and couldnt get up for a long time might as well step in front of a car
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i thought it looked like he was reaching down but you could be right i am watching the microwave broadcast
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he wasnt moving one of b his arms
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hopefully thats all it was
fantasyfootball,not_removed,most likely the case no sign of a limp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no he hasnt he just hasnt had room to run that first down he fought for was pretty beast
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably a lacerated hip bone
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lmao my opponent has hill so while i wish no one an injury this might help me win
fantasyfootball,not_removed,didnt look too bad maybe a dead arm gio owner not hill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,r u ed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,haha nothing better than those original jackass skits
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it was jared allen wasnt it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely left arm
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why the fuck would he limp with a shoulder issue
fantasyfootball,not_removed,left armshoulder i think because he wasnt moving it and let it hang limo running back while other was loving
fantasyfootball,not_removed,aaand hes hurt again
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its hill were talking not keenan allen
fantasyfootball,not_removed,huge dick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,moving
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how about this go to a thrift shop and find an old trophy ours is a bowling trophy with a football player on it go to a trophy shop and have them make an engraved plate to affix to the trophy you now have a custom trophy for under
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just play around with old trophies you have lying around well assuming youre younger like myself and have tons of participation trophies lying around ive finally put them to good use i unscrewed two soccer trophies screwed a football from a different trophy onto it and printed a pic of todd bowles right in the middle of it the bowles bowl now just needs the writing inscribed on it which i go to a trophy shop for
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we are doing something similar for the playoff loser in our league but going way cheap i ordered a mcfarlane manziel statue and im going to put a inscription plate on it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i used to work estate sales for a summer for some extra cash and one of the things we had at a few of them were old trophies we couldnt even really give them away even at like cents to a dollar each i ended up getting a bunch of em and frankensteining together trophies for a few leagues cheaply this way just have to order engraved plates online
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this guy does good work we just got one from him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our sacko made out of hockey sticks a jock and tennis balls
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i found a big cardboard question mark in a craft shop to use as our sacko trophy i feel like the trophy should be as low effort as possible to reflect their achievement itll get glued to something to make it stand up and thats it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we all went to ucla so our sacko is a trojan trophy if yall have a college or high school connection that might work
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mcfarlane manziel statue cool idea i want this statue named after the guy who screwed us i really need someone who can do that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats really awesome
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is great info but it does not take into account where the rookies were being drafted in fantasy it looks like elliott is going towards the end of round or up to mid round thats an expensive gamble on what could be i believe he will do well but that well who knows
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tod gurley seems to be missing or did he not get the requisite number of carries
fantasyfootball,not_removed,great work thanks for doing your homework only thing ill point out is id wager the majority of those runningbacks if any didnt go into their rookie season behind the best ol in the nfl i would also wager many of them didnt go into it with a qb and wr as well as tes very good at run blocking elliot makes his nfl debuts with arguably the best situation out of any first round rb you mentioned which i think factors heavily into his fantasy draft stock also something ill throw out there is many rookie rbs lose playtime and touches because theyre either bad at pass protection have ball security issues or both neither of these were ever issues for zeke at osu so thats worth pointing out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,very good info i did something similar to this in but i only used five years of data i also had positive results when looking at rookie rbs who had carries i used top as my barometer and the only ones who didnt meet the mark were zac stacy andre williams and vick ballard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,good write up in this pass happy league now its hard to expect a rookie rb to come out and blow it up even if he is as talented as elliot is plus the fact that he has some good competition with almo and mcfadden i think its a good idea to be wary of what your getting with elliot
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats fair but i think thats a question for any rb not specific to rookies and how many rbs at any point in the draft lookfeel safe this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,carries
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh im in favor of elliott where hes going in drafts my full profile is quite positive
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its even more tellingfavorable for elliott however that dallas drafted him overall after no rbs went in round in or followed by gurley and gordon last year i would not classify morris as good competition and i dont believe that the cowboys drafted elliott where they did to split work with dmac carries for the season comes out to just per game so theres room for mcfadden to still get some work even with elliott in a feature role dallas has ranked among the leagues most runheavy over the past years
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i disagree with most first and second round rbs not rookies you pretty much know what youre getting minus injuries the only rbs in the first or second round are rbs with not enough games to base their performance off of cj anderson for example but youve already seen at the very least their ceiling
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yep gurleys a positive example though as he finished in ppr and in nonppr even on just carries and despite missing the first games and playing in a poor offense
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with you man they passed on jalen ramsey for elliott and that means something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,here are the rbs in the range of the first rounds in right now leveon bell torn knee ligaments todd gurley weak finish to plays in bad offense david johnson career regularseason starts so far adrian peterson safest id say also devonta freeman ypc over final games tevin coleman set to share job lamar miller has yet to average more than carries per game in a season jamaal charles coming off acl tear eddie lacy coming off terrible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and just to be clear im not saying i dislike all of these guys im just pointing out how difficult it is to find a safe rb early in drafts so im not knocking elliotts safety vs those hes up against
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol id take an extra and round pick any day for my first rounder
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im drafting and i actually chose that draft position i will be taking any of the players listed that are available at that spot obj julio brown zeke
fantasyfootball,not_removed,peterson i love obj but i think eli is going to spread the ball more this year cruz is back and their round pick is impressing everybody at camp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it has to be qb otherwise cam in the first round is one of the worst if not the worst pick ive seen in my years playing fantasy football i dont play qb leagues but my general understanding is you need to take at least one qb early if you dont wanna go qb id take beckham in any format standard or full ppr i have abbeckhamjulio ranked
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i understand the top three as they are all pretty safe bets but elliot is a bit of a gamble at
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and you think peterson definitely over gurley
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i get that not everyone agrees with zeke as the first rb off the board and it has taken me awhile to come around initially i had him ranked as the best rb but the more i think about the situation in dal and the skill set he possesses the more i think he will flourish
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i had gurley last year and he was a beast for me once he got rolling but to me your first or picks is not about gambling its about taking the safest bet and peterson is as safe a bet as there is
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in the history of his career no one has ever taken and ap and had it be a bad pick hes as safe as they come so i respect the argument in standard i dont play standard literally just wont participate in a league without or full ppr so i dont have the requisite knowledge to counter your position
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have in a team standardi really want to take ap but i also want abjjodj im taking ab if it falls to me doubt it but if he doesntits so conflicting workhorse adrian peterson or ankleissues julio i cant decide
fantasyfootball,not_removed,there is just no reason for dallas to give zeke the workload that the other top rbs will get alfred morris and mcfadden are both going to get time in regular rotation i would actually be afraid of morris taking some goal line work and if they are trying to salt away a game they are winning they arent just going to leave zeke in to get touches the way ap or charles or gurly might stay in also if anything happens to zeke like cramps or a rolled ankle they have no reason to rush him back into the game with other solid rbs as a cowboys and ohio state fan i cant see taking him any earlier than mid if he is getting less touched than the rbs ahead of him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wrong the only time i chose him was he played game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,people are just hell bent in this assumption that hell get touches and run wild like murray did two years ago im having a really hard time seeing any chance that both mcfadden and morris wont be rotated heavily especially early on in the season and as you said in situations where the game is in the bag if he only gets carries the first couple games you will see people here losing their shit and asking if they should trade him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah but he wasnt a bad pick at the time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what constitutes as a bad pick cuz he got me points on the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,at the time the pick was made you passed on players that are objectively better
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that doesnt cover if someone busts or not cj anderson was an objectively good pick in the round at this time last year and he busted
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thomas rawlsplease
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my rbs are duke johnson and danny woodhead ppr because i took julio jones deandre hopkins and sammy watkins with my first three picks they should make up for my poor rbs right right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have first overall pick and im taking antonio
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh no you didnt literally the last thing we need is more confirmation bias coughs alshon jeffery
fantasyfootball,not_removed,arian foster
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jamaal charles and devonta freeman
fantasyfootball,not_removed,remember when he was playing last year and it was consensus that he was the second coming of christ just look forward to more of that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i love thomas rawls he might not be to start the season but i expect him to be a solid before midseason
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cmike hasnt failed to disappoint fantasy footballers yet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you make excellent donuts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,duke will get a lot of receptions
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you didnt select a qb in your first picks good job
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre mommys big man yes you are
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe alshon will convince jay cutler to quit smoking
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if if he can stay healthy he could be top wrs with the garbage time bears
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you drafted them thats great
fantasyfootball,not_removed,devonta freeman and cj anderson will be fine as your rbs ppr fwiw
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he has the creamiest hamstrings or the hammiest cream strings i cant remember which
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he has looked great so far at his adp he is a stealif he stays healthy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youve got quite a lot of vowels in your rbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yissssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i thought it was the stringiest ham creams
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is he thoughits starting to look like a committee rather than the starter i thought he would be
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gah i knew it was something like that mmmm stringy ham cream
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think so the dolphins really dont seem to like ajayi and he hasnt looked very good i think they just didnt want to run foster too much in the preseason i would think he will get the better half of a split
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wtf this doesnt make me feel better at all
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i hope so i am sitting him for crowell the first game since foster will be taking on the seahawks week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bro if thoughts of stringy ham cream dont do it for you i dont know if we can be frat bros who occasionally give each other tug jobs as pranks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its a thinker youll get there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you say that nowbut you know when my invites go out for elephant walks you will be the first rsvp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you know me too well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,does anyone know if it is possible to do faab only in an nflcom league to clarify i found the faab option but i believe it makes players free agents after the faab process has concluded i dont want that i only want players to be picked up via faab at all times anyone play in an nflcom league like this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i ran an nflcom league last year with faab i dont think thats possible i just looked at last years transactions specifically adds and they are either from waivers or free agents
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was originally going to setup my league on nflcom till i realized this if you want continuous faab waivers run everyday or your choice of days youll have to go with espn not sure if yahoo or some of the other sites do it i originally wanted to have waivers everyday bit sunmon having fas those days so players arent punished for game time decisions but apparently thats not possible either
fantasyfootball,not_removed,heres the skinny when theres tons of sites to play on espn most stable and the rare fuck up never hurts league more than a bit of time loss tradeoff is site looks bad yahoo less stable but better looking better looking means its heavier slower to respond both in app browser its not bad or even noticeable on good hardware flea flicker great features home of narffl nfl poorlyprogrammed junk with a nice fascade yahoo arguably looks better everything performs better to the extent that youd notice how heavy it is on good hardware
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im taking last week as a one off he was number in targets per game going into last week this game should be a shootout
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im rolling with ebron
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im also sticking with ebron in a mustwin fantasy matchup this week stafford is too good to not target his massive te in what would seem to be a shootout against no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think the vikings game planned against him specifically should have a bounce back game against no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i trust him they were playing minnesota on a thursday game both are worthy of throwing out the window regardless if you dont trust him i dont think anyone even comes close to his consistency or upside in free agency lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its either him or gates for me and it doesnt help both are coming off point weeks lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have reed on injury watch this week if hes a no go im rolling with ebron
fantasyfootball,not_removed,walker on bye so im either starting ebron or picking up hunter henry coby fleener or doyle off waivers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gotta start him with walker on bye c
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if youre playing the whats most likely to happen game you probably have to start him and min is a much better defense than no
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if gronk isnt practicing this week im rolling him out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,walker on bye so hes my best option
fantasyfootball,not_removed,someone on the game thread or somewhere i forget said that lions were force feeding jones to get him going i watched a bit of the game and jones missed a few catches or stafford threw some shitty ones either way he was targeted times this week compared to the past few weeks which were so based on the game log the guy could be right as week they fed him and he hauled in for to get him going but obviously that didnt work so im giving ebron one more week to see what lion do this week as ebron has been one of their more consistent receivers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i do that goose egg isnt concerning me starting him in two leagues with confidence one being a must win
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think he will bounce back i agree it should be a shootout if gronk isnt good to go ebron will be in my lineup for sure
fantasyfootball,not_removed,starting him over reed this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he is dead to me i didnt even start him i need a replacement for walkers bye and i wouldnt touch him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont have much of a choice firing up ebron this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,walker is on bye so i have to start ebron
fantasyfootball,not_removed,torn between him and eifert i currently have eifert in but i dont like his matchup as much so im leaning ebron i think that game was a fluke and hell return to normal but who knows
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im starting him in place of reed this week or i could grab vernon davis any insight appreciated
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely worried hoping to pick up fiedorowicz as a back up plan its win with a little help or go home in that league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cant decide between him and fiedorowicz the fact that it will be high scoring makes me wanna say ebron but damn that pissed me off
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rudolph or ebron
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my team is pretty crappy however i am wondering in team full point ppr should i flex ebron or jarvis landry this week other possible candidate for flex is tevin coleman and wendell smallwood
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i endured the goose egg from him and had a goose egg from gronk on the bench im gonna dump ebron for mcdonald
fantasyfootball,not_removed,serious question i only have tate and ebron to put in my flex spot which one would you put in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im starting lebron and cooks with confidence this week hold me
fantasyfootball,not_removed,except there were times he was wideopen including the endzone for at least one of the tds he was just never looked at by stafford
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a chargers fan id roll with ebron hell bounce back from the egg and gates competes with hunter
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same boat and its a must win
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same here i need this win i win and im in cant believe it all comes down to this im playing our commissioner and he is asking me for bribes to get him to throw the game for me i think im just gonna play him straight up though dont need that karma in the playoffs its ridiculous no clue why he is in charge he bought brady a couple weeks back and hes supposed to be stopping collusion really hoping for this win the right way ebron better show up if reed ends up not playing nasty fall last week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont bother with henry
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same here
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same i want to see gronk at practice as a full participant before he makes it into my lineup obviously i want to start gronk hes a special talent but i have no problem starting ebron i look at last week as an anomaly hell get targets and hes an elite level talent so he should convert
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ditto
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was looking to start a discussion but my dilemma is starting him or brate and i need to win to get in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am in the same dilemma as well but own ebron
fantasyfootball,not_removed,is reed out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,own ebron and and debating cutting for davis myself i think im sticking with ebron he had been consistently heavily involved and seems like mn schemed him out last week im looking at it as a fluke and the chance to recover greatly in a shootout with brees this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same exact situation with me will probably roll with fedora but im tempted
fantasyfootball,not_removed,foh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,foh
fantasyfootball,not_removed,over one dudquestionable
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bold strategy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wouldnt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the butthole
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably tate id think his floor might be slightly higher this week but its a close call
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dang your commish seems desperate beating him fair and square would be sweeter than anything he has to offer imo reed is looking really questionable this week though and as someone mentioned ebrons production or lack there of last week could just be a a once in a blue moon kind of situation if reed cant go im just hoping for some points from ebron good luck this week and kick ass
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not officially but it seems unlikely that hell play reed said he has no idea if hell be able to play and that the injury is very painful particularly on any reaching motion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,when a player puts up a gooser i feel even more confident about their next week i just feel they cant do it twice in a row its why im confident in julio this week after julio dropped earlier this year i knew he was gonna blow it next week but not like i benched him ever
fantasyfootball,not_removed,way to be an asshole
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id send him a tweet about it no idea if hes planning to do them soon but hes usually pretty good about responding
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he does usually around julyaugust
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah hes usually pretty good but didnt get back to me when i asked him recently
fantasyfootball,not_removed,very interesting cool concept moncrief looks like hes gonna eat hope ty can snag of those tds lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just looked at the giantssteelers game tds but only extra points whats your logic behind five missed extra points in one game also you only have sammy watkins as getting fantasy points
fantasyfootball,not_removed,
fantasyfootball,not_removed,have you run this against previous weeks to see if it holds up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no tevin coleman in the atlanta game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the website isnt loading for me 😕
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i mean im trying to decide whether or not to pick up gabriel off the wire but i dont think hes scoring all three of atlantas touchdowns this week
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pretty nifty but yeah still has players like cmike and prosise as active for seahawks some of the predictions look scarily on point others look pretty silly and yep theres ware with his point floor sobs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how accurate is this program when did you start using it lastly what is the percent error per week or the average percent error for the season until now for this program
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whos the better flex start this week tcoleman or hightower im already starting freeman tho
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol windy there is no logic i definitely have to improve on the kicking game projections in the algorithm ive been sweeping that one under the rug
fantasyfootball,not_removed,maybe conversions
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lol yeah i put a note up that its not exactly mobile ready
fantasyfootball,not_removed,heres a desktop httpimgurcomajzxhp so you have an idea what it should look like ill have to work out some design for mobile
fantasyfootball,not_removed,definitely last week it was in terms of game outcome and if you adjust the sliders to match actual yardage the players come in pretty close the secret is its not really me making the prediction its the vegas pros i just use their assumptions to break down into individual player performances based on their general workloadsover the past three weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes there i totally stranded you guys without any real instructions but you can click on the httpimgurcomddvkpej to add players that have been removed players who are averaging less than percent of the workload over the last games are filtered out initially to keep the list from getting polluted this is all automated so thats why hes not displayed initially ill have to create an exception in the algorithm to look for returning players and calculate their predictions a little differently sammy watkins is only projected for points for example
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same here sounds like a cool idea
fantasyfootball,not_removed,shoot try now had the ip blocked
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if the algorithm says its so its so haha yeah sometimes the tds can be off in those cases i built this so you can edit who gets the touchdowns
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it usually scores very high on actual winsloses the yardage can vary pretty significantly sometimes it is scary how close it is sometimes i wish it would tell me to start m ingram week to week out of all the games it usually within about yards per game on average as i mentioned below the actual predictions are based on the vegas odds so if a game has an overunder of with a spread of i can deduce the final outcome should be from there i use median of workload over the last three games to determine each players predicted scoring so its an averaging algorithm not really setup to predict break out performances so much as give you an overview of what is possible given a particular game flow what the sliders are for i would love to just load it up and fire off based on the generated predictions but i highly recommend a little hemming and hawing on the sliders to fit the newsinjury reportstrends etc ive been building this thing for about two months my personal roi in daily is about to date i have another part of the algorithm that i havent included yet that generates x number of lineups given your selected players
fantasyfootball,not_removed,coleman is a wild card hightower is averaging touches a game over the last games so i might say hightower has a higher floor and would probably roll with him unless you feel like gambling
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its bookmarked ill definitely keep watching cool project
fantasyfootball,not_removed,very cool thanks looks great
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ooooh nice yea i got him there now nice work by the way
fantasyfootball,not_removed,please retry just had the ip blocked to public
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i tried and it worked but im on my phone checking out the site and all the letters and numbers are like overlapping each other it does seem like a nice little tool though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah its a tough choice even tougher when youre fighting to get a playoff spot lol
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cheers man ill be improving on it adding snap counts and redzone stats etc really appreciate the feedback thank you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cheers man thank you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah im definitely not mobile friendly yet i will post back when i get a phone friendly version going
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its all good ill definitely check it out on the computer 👍🏼
fantasyfootball,not_removed,awesome thanks man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tyreek played so incredibly well that the conservative in me tells me its impossible to keep this going but ill be damned if i dont reach for him in the like an idiot i think hes a solid pick in the he helped carry me so many weeks last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this guy is gonna be an absolute wasted draft pick i hope he gets hyped as shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am so on the fence about whether to make him a keeper or not i have to pick three between tyreek hill jamison crowder spencer ware jordan howard matt ryan all can be had for a round pick jordan howard is the only one that im dead set on thoughts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,breaking water wet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as long as hill can keep himself on the straight and narrow his upside is sky high the only issue i see is that he might be used inconsistently and on a slightly limited snap count
fantasyfootball,not_removed,anyone else looking at this thinking that as the coach the role that hill has next year is pretty much up to him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as a jamaal charles owner two years ago ive heard this before not biting this time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,where my return yard leagues at id like to keep him in the first but that will be reserved for leveon bell pt per yards ret
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but he hit a woman im going to need two dozen articles telling me whether or not its okay to cheer for him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i lost aj green and picked up tyfreak championship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he is so physically gifted i really cant think of a reasonable comp he is strong for a small receiver like randall cobb or chris hogan hes extremely fast like desean jackson hes also very quick and shifty like tavon austin and jerick mckinnon if he can improves his routes his hands and work on catching over the shoulder i think there is no limit to what he can do hes not in an offense thats going to make it easy but he could be the next antonio brown or odell beckham different style player and it will take a commitment like ab has but if he puts in the work it could happen the potential is there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would choose matt ryan howard and hill
fantasyfootball,not_removed,howard no question
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if kc doesnt add an rb then you have to go with ware in addition to hill and howard youll be able to pick up a qb later in the draft every rb with the floor of ware is going to be gone by the
fantasyfootball,not_removed,howard is a fringe round pick this year it would be criminally stupid not to keep him i wont comment one way or another on your other choices but for the love of god do not let howard slip out of your hands
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why is no one saying ware is a solid round keeper yeah he fizzled out towards the end of the season but do we think hes washed up now or what
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id have to say crowder and hill but i may be biased cause i had both last year i think crowder is in a better situation than last year and if what andy reid is saying is true crowder will have similar production if not more than last year i also had matt ryan but qbs are easily replaceable
fantasyfootball,not_removed,imo definitely hill crowder and howard with desean jackson and pierre garcon gone crowder will get plenty of opportunities plus he was already a pretty big rz threat last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,howard hill ware
fantasyfootball,not_removed,howard hill and crowder id say
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just hit a woman youll feel like kindred spirits its a joke i swear
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how was tyreek still on waiver in
fantasyfootball,not_removed,hes percy harvin without the migraines
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if he can improves his routes his hands and work on catching over the shoulder i think there is no limit to what he can do the same was said of cordarelle patterson be careful with hill i would absolutely not expect anything close to brown or odb out of hill in any case
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with you unorthodox composition picking tyreek too early is a huge gamble we dont know how the kc offense is going to look and exactly where tyreek fits in kc looks like they may do a full time rbbc and alex smith is not one to force the ball to his wrs everyone knows tavon austin is talented and fast but no one drafts him early because they know the situation hes in is shit the one thing going for tyreek is that hes on a better team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he could be the next antonio brown or odell beckham lol gtfo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i drafted maclin in the last year with that same mindset never forget
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i may be incline to switch ryan with crowder but that is really if your league hoards qbs or not and there is nothing on the waiver
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats why i said howard is the only one im certain on
fantasyfootball,not_removed,one saying ware is a solid round keeper yeah he fizzled out towards the end of the season but do we think hes washed up now or what i dont know but i have a hard time keeping him off of my list he is a workhorse back which is becoming more and more rare in the nfl and i have a hard time passing that up with a round pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,crowder will get looks but his redzone production will drop with pryor doctson and reed well be seeing the big guys score
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you stay away from my mom
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whatever week aj green went down i picked tyreek that week before the aj injury so i lucked out trust me we dont have any freebies on our ww its tight as shit blink and miss a tweet and youre already too late on pickups haha
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree that a patterson type career is a strong possibility i however disagree with you on his potential maybe im just enamored with the new guy but youll never hit a home run if you dont try
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what really productive qb are you getting for a round pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,woops didnt read as closely as i should have id go ryan hill who knows whos top dog in washington this season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,id for sure do howard and ware the possibility of ware retaking control of the backfield is real and i think he could be gold this season take those two and then grab a couple more solid rbs in the draft and youre sittin pretty with rb depth
fantasyfootball,not_removed,guess i dont have a lot of confidence in doctson quite yet crowder saw good rz usage even with reed pryor will definitely get his no doubt id even be ok with a decline in rz usage for crowder in exchange for more consistent targets make him less of a boombust player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,last year our league really fell asleep on carr and he ended up going undrafted not saying theres a guy like that available this year but stupid shit like the one in our league happens
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i still wont draft a qb until around rather fortify my bench w wr and rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with umychataccount looking at one year is a poor sample size but to keep the conversation going i looked at the numbers and after andrew luck it flattens off considerably there are really only top tier qbs that were worth it in last years draft aaron rodgers drew brees and andrew luck all the other guys listed were available including matt ryan qb who i believe was going in the round or later plus you see a guy like kirk cousins or dak prescott up there who couldve been had later as well overall i think this tends to happen every year fantasy football is very much a what have you done for me lately game where everyone wants to draft based on last years production im seeing everyone going back to saying they want a running back with the top picks this year where last year it was wide receivers you can always find solid quarterback production late in the draft while the running back and wide receiver talent dries up earlier
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what ive done here is establish a baseline starter only looked at points over the season based upon number of teams in your league and how many of a position you start in your league that determines the baseline required ive then looked a players points standard scoring over that baseline seems to suggest to me that the most important position is rb then qb before wr te which i didnt expect i was wondering if there was any reason as to what ive missed if anything otherwise the debate to leave qb drafted seems to have taken a bit of a turn
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the only positive about drafting a qb early is the relative safety of the pick typically qbs drafted highly end up finishing highly as well but safely drafting a qb doesnt win you your league the benefits of drafting a elliott or david johnson far outweighs the benefits of having an elite qb and make the risk in that pick completely worth it you may end up with a peterson or gurley but that shouldnt deter you there will be many weeks a streaming qb will land in the top at their position there will be almost no weeks a streamingwaiver rb ends up in the top of theirs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,just like you should never go into a draft content on a positional strategy you should also never rule out taking a qb early on if i got a mid round pick and rodgers was there at say you can bet im going to snag him up are you going to see me take him in the no but if hes there in the mid i wouldnt hesitate to take a top qb over the likes of arob adams allen rawls or ware the same exists with other qbs breesbrady in the luck or ryan in the you bet im grabbing em
fantasyfootball,not_removed,it works extremely well in hindsight predicting the top qb is the main problem that and the fact that rosters usually end up with rbs and wrs and typically only qbs means that the holding value of rbswrs is higher than qbs you are more likely to find a serviceable qb on waivers than you are wrs and definitely more than rbs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think in terms of determining value its more pertiant to look at the relative dropoff between positions espn standard qb is a difference is pts rb is wr is te is since you need more rbs and wrs just to fill out a spot it makes more sense to go rb heavy early then get wrs and qbs a bit later however rbs move around slots so erratically thats the boom or bust aspect of it all the difference between qbs isnt enough to reach for one however it all ultimately depends on who youre drafting with if you know people wont take a qb until the round no matter what then reach for one early isnt helping your squad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,do you account for streaming qbs if im taking a qb late im going to play matchups throughout the season same with kickers defense and a lot of times te
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not a statistician but given that qbs score way more than the other positions shouldnt that be taken into account as well ie scale down the qbs scores and see what the difference really is
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ask people who took the best qbs from cam or wilson how that plan worked out for them this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can you explain a bit more as i thought i had taken the replacement value by taking the benchmark as the lowest starter of each position
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i get that and that is what i have done in my leagues previously but i wanted to kind of prove that out based on the season that doesnt seem to hold true
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but what if its a qb league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as an aside brady projects to between brees and luck if he continued his pace for instead of games which i think people should feel confident in since it wasnt drugsdomestic abuseinjury
fantasyfootball,not_removed,preface not a stats guy so i cant really speak to the numbers and methodology but here are some issues i see from a fantasy strategy standpoint youre looking at a single year stats and making a strategy off it how does this compare if you look at the last years the issue with taking a qb early is that you have to predict which qb will be the qb you only get one shot cam newton was the first qb off the board last year and russell wilson was your numbers dont account for flex players there are more than starting rbwr each week which adds to their scarcity and importance that may be part of the vbdstatistical approach but it absolutely impacts the fantasy strategy side of things that said again from a fantasy strategy standpoint the entire industry is jumping on the wait on qb train espn is finally aboard that means adp of qbs will drop once drafts start and it means zagging may entail grabbing an elite qb earlier in the draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think it all depends on how you tier your qb rankings i tend to let other managers draft qbs super early but if one of the guys in my first tier for example is the last one in the tier available and i dont love my options elsewhere i wont hesitate to pull the trigger
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i will only even consider taking a qb after ive drafted at least rb and wr mostly based on bpa with a few caveats its just too easy to find a totally serviceable qb in the later rounds and lateround rbswrs are basically all lottery tickets some might pan out but no one can consistently pick which ones will work so its better to go for a bit more consistency early at those positions and just snag a couple of midrange qbs towards the end and hope for an above average year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i am not understanding cpv difference what is the math used to calculate that i cant think of way where rodgers comes out the third most valuable player this just doesnt seem right at all to me i did my own calculations determining what everyones rough value was last year and where they probably should have been draftedrodgers is going at pick granted thats a team league i did for those but still no where near third pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the only positive about drafting a qb early is the relative safety of the pick typically qbs drafted highly end up finishing highly as well i dont think thats the case i think its a coin flip some elite qbs finish high others dont last year newton wilson and roethlesberger were top qbs in adp and only wilson finished in the top in scoring
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i couldnt really check your spreadsheet since im on my phone im def curious ive just done well w the strategy so i kept it opportunity cost for waiting on qbs was always good for me since most owners go qb in the first four rounds anyways
fantasyfootball,not_removed,doesnt drafting a qb early make it harder to draft a top rb or wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,drafting any position earlier than your opponents are drafting that position is a bad idea because that means you can always wait another round and that player will still be on the board
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that changes their value entirely as the bottom qbs are guys you really dont want to end up with in any format which is why you see the top qbs typically going in the first rounds of a qb draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i realized after typing up the comment that brady should obviously be included in that top tier
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in all honesty im not saying that its a strategy what im saying is that the notion isnt as cut and dry as you may think ive made the sheet so it will auto calculate the amount above average for different league sizes although i didnt think about taking g flex into account i dont think it would actually alter too much the hypothesis that can be drawn from the analysis i was just trying to fill out the offseason with something that might be interesting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i get what you are saying but i was trying to prove that with numerical breakdown and it does seem to imply that the average points of the top qbs over the depending on league is higher than wrte so would say qb is more valuable to get a top tier player
fantasyfootball,not_removed,cpv difference is the difference between what a player scored and the base score of a player in that position ie in a team league the cpv for a qb would be the difference between their points and
fantasyfootball,not_removed,last year was an oddity but if you go back and look at the past years or so when its brady brees rodgers and luck going top they nearly always finished top if they played the entire season rodgers ryan brees luck cousins newton brady wilson bortles palmer brees rodgers luck played just games rodgers luck wilson manning brees manning brees newton rivers dalton luck rodgers played games brees rodgers brady newton luck rodgers brees brady newton stafford tldr brees will be top brady and rodgers should be as well
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so the absolute over the baseline
fantasyfootball,not_removed,doesnt drafting a top wr or rb early make it harder to draft a top qb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was just trying to fill out the offseason with something that might be interesting yeah absolutely and it is i think there are questions you raise that are great for discussion but there are also holes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the problem is that you can be guaranteed to get a solid qb later in the draft ryan cousins stafford before his injury etc were all great options available near the end of most drafts now compare the qbs available at that point to the rbs wrs and tes available you can get a sure thing at qb late in the draft whereas the other postilions are a complete crapshoot at that point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i wasnt trying to disprove your rational just stating that i think it comes secondary for qbs id be more interested to see the drop off in points between qb and qb for example vs the drop off from rb and rb
fantasyfootball,not_removed,should probably preface this by saying im not just trying to shit on op more making sure that the way i went about doing i think the same thing isnt completely wrong and useless just bouncing ideas maybe im not thinking of this correctly but that seems like a really bad way of calculating a players value doing it this way creates the assumption that point a quarterback gets is equal in value to every point a runningback or wide receiver gets which yes if you look at your fantasy points for your team point at any position is point but quarterbacks score more points than running backs the number of serviceable qbs on any given week is far higher than serviceable running backs qb point rb point rather qb point is rb point in value this is how i did my calculations when i was trying to compare last years adp used fantasypros team adp if i remember right to where they should have been drafted i took the top players that were on the list at all then i took the top players for the season points scored including week and put them in a table i then took the average points scored for each position removing anyone that didnt play atleast games this gives you a baseline of how many points on average that position scores its a lower number than the baseline that is used by op obviously but it makes it more relative this way you are factoring in the fact that theres a shit ton of qbs a descent number of wrs and not many runnings backs i then took the bselines for each position and divided each players points by their positions baseline so someone like aaron rodgers had a relative value of being the average vdb ff has david johnson spots under aaron rodgers but on my sheet david johnson has a value of for last year which makes way more sense david johnson won a lot more leagues than rodgers did im betting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,had the windows open already so im going to pull some data adp from fantasyfootballcalculator scoring from profootballreference player adp finish newton rodgers wilson luck brees roethlisberger player adp finish luck rodgers p manning brees roethlisberger wilson player adp finish p manning brees rodgers stafford luck brady player adp finish brees rodgers manning brady newton ryan through seasons thats players top adp each year finished outside the top in scoring at the position slightly less than a coinflip
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tell me if youd rather use a qb or a rb from waivers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,think about it lets say god came down and told you raiders def was going to put up points next season and that no one else knows this taking the raiders def is still a mistake because they will still be on the board for at least more rounds guaranteed the best draft strategy is to maximize the value of a player at a certain position over who you could draft at the same position in the next round so if no one in your league drafts qbs for the first rounds taking the number one qb in the first round is a waste of a pick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,let me see if i can can get the stats for previous seasons any help appreciated and re run it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the problem is that you can be guaranteed to get a solid qb later in the draft it is by no means a guarantee particularly as the industry shifts to wait on qb its going to become tougher lateround qb darlings last year included manning rivers palmer all guys who missed on expectations winston had a lot of hype and wasnt really consistent sure ryan was available in a lot of leagues but only one manager could add him its not guaranteed to be you or me particularly if we think we have a great lateround pick streaming is still a strong option since so many qb can have strong fantasy games based on matchup but thats different from grabbing a qb in the late rounds and having him perform at fantasy mvp levels
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think you guys are actually doing the same thing simply using different inputsapproaches this if im interpreting correctly says that both are ways to calculate baseline players thats where you guys differ in your baseline establishing i think op has a flaw that hes using as a baseline not and i think you have a flaw in that youre excluding injured players which are absolutely a factor however i also agree with harris that existing vbd is not a prediction tool in order to use vbd for predictions you have to have complete projections for statistics this is an underlying principle of httpsubscribersfootballguyscomappsarticlephparticlebryantvbd you can look back at through a vbd lens using stats and you can look forward to through a vbd lens using projections but you cant use stats to project output vbd wise
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this seems like the same approach i do something similar for my program that i wrote that calculates player value and conducts my own rankings i call it point separation by position which is similar to what youre talking about i didnt filter out players that played less than games though this is a good idea im stealing it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think this sort of points towards not taking a qb top that hasnt been a top mainstay youre not likely to get burnt on brees rodgers brady or luck in my opinion but guys like big ben and russell wilson have burned people i still think the safety is overrated because you need those elite guys at rb or wr to actually win your weeks and you can get a serviceablegreat qb off of waivers most weeks but i also think those elite qbs are fairly bust proof assuming health
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive reworked it and qb is now the least important position in relative value thats the nugget that i was missing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,depends on the player just like drafting which ever one does better at their position and improves my team more whether its jordan howard last year or bortles the year before
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but if you dont draft a player earlier than your opponent then by definition that player will not still be on the board
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no that still doesnt make sense someone has to pick a player at a certain position first and it is impossible to predict when other players at that position will be taken after you this is all determined randomly by the texture of the draft you also havent taken into account draft position if you pick at the ends of a snake draft you can have picks in between your own making it extremely difficult to assume a certain player will still be on the board
fantasyfootball,not_removed,has a vbd column i dont know if their underlying methodology is the same as yours also i am using fantasyfootballcalculator for adps newton adp among qbs brady wilson drafting a qb early didnt help here rodgers luck wilson drafting a qb wasnt a home run p manning brees drafting a qb worked great if you got brees or manning rodgers adp and brady had significantly lower vbd
fantasyfootball,not_removed,trying to help here so plz no flame here are some pre rankings and adp and the end of season qb rank the point differential and cpv may be a better measure but i think this chart helps to illustrate the variance in the position maybe this is the case with every position out of the top ranked at the beginning of the season only ended up in the top ten at the end edit just wanted to note that brady probably doesnt fit into this well qb rank name adp cbs end of season qb rank c newton a rodgers r wilson a luck d brees b roethlisberger c palmer t brady e manning d carr p rivers b bortles j winston k cousins t taylor m stafford a dalton m mariota matt ryan tony romo dak prescott qb rank adp end of season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ya after the fact i realized i dont think i need to take injured players out when creating the baseline ive been meaning to do it again with out doing that and comparing i dont think it will make any difference except accentuate the positional value as i called it cause it would still be an average of all the players total points at the position relatively it should be the same i thinkbut since id be dividing each players total points by a smaller number the average the values would just be more spread out rodgers may end up being a instead and johnson id imagine would end up being like a or something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think this sort of points towards not taking a qb top that hasnt been a top mainstay sure absolutely of course up until p manning was a top mainstay youre elite until youre elite and you cant predict injury
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and even in the list above you got burnt with rodgers finishing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if carr is out dude broke his fibula last week hes out i do like lats in this matchup though scored last time against the broncos if i recall correctly
fantasyfootball,not_removed,but the broncos will be expecting the run with carr out and just stack the box making the run game more tough on oakland
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree hes seasoned but i benched crabtree this game out of fear also denver pass defense is on point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,tds and went over yards rushing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this may be true but they cant completely forget about coop and crab mcgloin is a pretty competent qb imo
fantasyfootball,not_removed,penis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre a year late in internet time on this one
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thick ropes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,as long as sammy has balls in his hands his load will be huge
fantasyfootball,not_removed,youre gross
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nasty
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wifes feet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,username does not check out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuckin jake
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what was jake wearing at the draft khakis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i enjoyed this story
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jake from state farm
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fantasy football is mostly luck im not surprised by anything anymore
fantasyfootball,not_removed,two years ago pretty sure manning went in the first in all three of my leagues that year i remember grabbing manning at and demarco at
fantasyfootball,not_removed,guy in my league who won it last year has the worst team in the league as of now reading this makes me paranoid now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think jake might be a wizard
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what the fuck jake
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lost semis because of that steelers vs ravens game i feel you i started big ben that week and lost by points at the end
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats how i consistently make the playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,nick foles won me a championship i am just saying
fantasyfootball,not_removed,love it ill try to keep it in mind this year because my draft stunk
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i went into week against my dad ready to win a title he only had wrs starting because hes a fucking taco they were tronjordy the game was flynsanity
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ha same story i was the virgin in fantasy first year drafted peyton manning first and ben tate second loli had absolute worst draft of all but guess what waiver wire wins the championships i learned and ended up picking odb he took me to championship in people
fantasyfootball,not_removed,lulz the taco won your league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,never underestimate beginners luck a lack of knowledge can be a very powerful thing remember taco won it all
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i cant figure out which year youre referring with all these rankings of players
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so were you the guy in first or did your team lay an egg in the semis
fantasyfootball,not_removed,so you either got hustled big time or he is the luckiest sob in the world
fantasyfootball,not_removed,two years ago was my first year and my draft was pretty awful other than jimmy graham and demarco i drafted trich in the third and nick foles in the fourth defenses and kickers thanks to this sub i picked up hill and obj and a few others to beat the leveon ab and russell wilson owner for the championship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,something similar happened in my team league a couple years back one person in our league was a huge colts fan but ill get to that later anyways he drafted a bunch of players other than mccoy with the pick way before they were supposed to go he even took nate washington in the round halfway through the season he was the laughing stock of the league and did not have a single win and everyone was hoping they would be the one playing him in the playoffs since my league was only teams everyone made playoffs being the huge colts fan that he was he dropped all of his players and picked up all colts players so he could have an all colts team he didnt drop anyone good to waivers because his team was awful before he did this maneuver so everyone was ok with it fast forward to playoffs week allcolts team faces the seed he decided to make one last move before the playoffs started that move was to pickup odell beckham jr long story kinda short he ended up beating the seed in the first round by points then went on to win the championship with a record
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the only jake i happen to associate with told me to put on roulette when he heard i was going to vegas the next day not a bet for him just do it drunk at osheas the lightbulb comes on and i remember work my way over and the dealerball spinner guy allows me to squeeze into that round of betting you know it fucking hit brb changing my name mainly so i can also name my first son jake ll
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you think thats a bad draft the very first year my gf joined a league it was against a bunch of veterans were talking everyone in the league had years of ff under their belt we ended up winning the championship her first pick janakowski her pick rivers her and pick was a dst and gronkowski i dont remember which she took by the round she had no rbs and only one wr victor cruz one of the last picks she took josh gordon she brought me in after the draft to help comanage the team off waivers we managed to pick up julius thomas alshon jeffery shane vereen and james starks i think our team looked like this by the time we hit our stride in the or game we lost the first then went undefeated the rest of the season position rank in total fantasy points for their position in qb philip rivers wr josh gordon wr alshon jeffery rb fred jackson rb donald brown te rob gronkowski only played games flex julius thomas dst carolina panthers k janakowski bench bye weeks james starks mark ingram victor cruz shane vereen and a cycle of other players that were churned looking for someone worthy of keeping
fantasyfootball,not_removed,draft grade means absolutely nothing ive won with a league worst d last year in a league the most important thing to success if playing the waiver wire and getting lucky on guys you draft always draft guys you believe in even though you reach for them compared to adp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jake must be a lsu fan
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i liked your story up until the luck is better than good part luck may take a couple wins here and there and we all have stories of the friend who go lucky and won but good is where its at being good and youll always have winning on the table ill take good over lucky times out of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,jake followed his heart
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rthathappened
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sounds made up but sure you drafted the ultimate team but for pure luck reasons some newbie hack who picked based on the direction of his penis lucked into ultimate victory you know a ff newbie who picks players that are rookies or free agents or massive sleepers because thats exactly how newbies play right lol stick to rwritingprompts with the rest of the poorly written fiction
fantasyfootball,not_removed,walked into my first fantasy draft in not knowing anything i drafted by looking at the stickers that went on the draft board i ended up winning my first and only championship that year thats why fantasy football pundits and gurus and experts are full of shit best job in the world people actually get paid to make rather arbitrary guesses
fantasyfootball,not_removed,gronk went in the overall to me the year youre talking about i think in standard play though we had an rbwr slot too so jake was even more ridiculous than you said also not to be a dick but my team might trump yours for greatest all time team round jamaal charles round dez bryant round montee ball involved in a trade after week that netted me julio jones chris johnson and keenan allen round rob gronkowski round ray rice cut him after the suspension increased round reggie wayne picked over emmanuel sanders jeremy maclin and ty hiltonoops i dont remember the order for the rest as well but i drafted greg olsen philip rivers matt ryan mike wallace kelvin benjamin i picked him at and remember being excited as hell josh gordon mason crosby and streamed defenses all year trade week traded montee ball and reggie wayne for julio jones chris johnson and keenan allen after week i won this trade trade week picked up justin forsett after week and packaged him keenan allen and greg olsen for julius thomas i lost this trade but it was useful later trade week picked up players after that first trade dont remember who and saw lacy underperforming the first three weeks with point totals of and in standard play so i offered julius thomas and chris johnson to the owner and he accepted important pickup after this trade i again needed to fill up a bench spot so i picked up odell beckham jr up off waivers after reading he was a round pick and reading an article on bleacherreport about him i know wow bleacherreport helped trade around week arian foster has an injury and it was rumored he could be out for most of the fantasy season seeing this and being absolutely loaded at receiver i had dez julio kelvin benjamin mike wallace and odb at this point i offered josh gordon and some other player that i cannot for the life of me remember for arian foster and got him this was the season after josh gordon won a lot of people leagues and the hype train was real so by the end of the year i was starting qb matt ryanphilip rivers rb jamaal charles rb arian foster wr odell beckham jr wr dez bryant rbwr julio jones flex eddie lacy k mason crosby def packers defspecial teams with guys like mike wallace and kelvin benjamin on my bench who also had monster years this has been by far the best team i ever had and i won the championship against the best regular season team because of these guys playing well in the playoffs odell beckham jr was a god and because andrew luck completely shit the bed in the championship game for him putting up zero points i was incredibly lucky to get this team i offered a few trades involving good players for guys like reggie bush and doug martin who busted hard and i dont think ill ever get another team as good but hopefully i can at least win another championship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,too early in the season for this story
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuckin jake is always the reason i back down from daily fantasy yeah we have all these great tools like beer sheets quick on the drawl fantasy pros and rotoworld yet even the slightest team management from a supposed poorly drafted team can outshine you at any point in the season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that guy fucks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,she sounds hideous
fantasyfootball,not_removed,first thing i thought
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i might be in error there it was a ppr league so that depressed qb values but it may not have been as bad of a pick as i remember regardless the rest of his draft was atrocious or so it seemed at the time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea i advise going gambling with jake im guessing he drafted freeman and barnidge last year too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this was the same year luck went for negative in most peoples semis round as well i believe i had him i was sad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,man i lost a championship to a taco too ask me why i had to start rex fucking grossman as me and all my buddies now refer to him and i cant recall but only needed points from him at halftime and gets benched 😑 couldnt believe it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why was obj not on a team by that point
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well shes a guy so
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im a packers fan new years eve the sexy rex game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh wow that long ago damn im feeling old
fantasyfootball,not_removed,me too
fantasyfootball,not_removed,does anyone know if it is possible to do faab only in an nflcom league to clarify i found the faab option but i believe it makes players free agents after the faab process has concluded i dont want that i only want players to be picked up via faab at all times anyone play in an nflcom league like this
fantasyfootball,not_removed,expecting catches for yards and tds should see more snaps and more targets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not as full as your mother sorry but yeah i think they take the leash off watkins and let him go
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they said theyll never use him that much because hes too important to special teams i honestly thought that was a joke when i first heard it how could they not have someone capable of replicating what he offers to special teams but apparently hes the real deal in that facet of the game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i feel like you have to have a better option if youre in a team league or less
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im pretty sure he got injured midway through the game either way i wouldnt trust him if he only got targets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i watched red zone today he got the one touchdown a check down dump pass on a pa roll out and idk how stats work but he got a target on a yard pass i think where he made a double move and was alone walking into the end zone ready to catch the pass except the cb pulled him off the double move and stopped him from getting by was literally a td no doubt that being said i dont trust him moving forward if theres a defense to get catches and tds against its oakland and he didnt
fantasyfootball,not_removed,theres a lot of players that do so well at special teams theyre kept just for that facet of the game matthew slater is a meh wr but hes one of the best gunners in the league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,one of the easier ways to make a nfl team is through special teams
fantasyfootball,not_removed,same scenario with joe webb of the panthers hes listed as a string qb but hes a special teams boss
fantasyfootball,not_removed,absolutely my wonder was that if they had a need at an important offensive position that he is the best candidate to replace wouldnt that greatly trump any skill he offers to special teams obviously we know less than koetter which is why im not really knocking him for this decision
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kerley hes still like the top wr on that team
fantasyfootball,not_removed,doesnt he also play wr
fantasyfootball,not_removed,probably because the difference between him and humphries in terms of being a wr isnt as great as the difference between him and the next best special teamer opportunity cost man
fantasyfootball,not_removed,with a qb who cant find him see hopkins
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a very very occasional screen pass but no hes the string qb and special teams only
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yahoo is now not counting points scored by opposing teams dst so sd got a touchdown off an interception which was nothing to do with denvers defense and doesnt count against them as far as points allowed
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pick doesnt count against denver dst
fantasyfootball,not_removed,pick doesnt count against them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks for clearing it up guys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,they didnt count that last year either
fantasyfootball,not_removed,damn i wish espn would do that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i believe espn counts them though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,or ever for as long ad i have used it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,and that is why they suck
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i know however if theyre coming from espn i can understand why theyd be confused
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you know nothing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for redraft i use the cbs weekly trade chart more than anything
fantasyfootball,not_removed,httpwwwfantasyfootballnerdcomtrades
fantasyfootball,not_removed,rototrade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fantasypros
fantasyfootball,not_removed,none are great cause context is everything i just put in my trade on fantasy need floydpowell for maclincarr in that case it says team a scores pts more blah blah remove carr and it says team b scores some nonsense except floyd and powell are on my bench and the dude trading carr has qbs on his roster currently and carr is certainly going to get cut shortly not to mention im only looking at carr because im not sold on dak i would say it favors me getting maclin any way you shake it idk i like to use yahoos analyzer it sets theoretical lineups based on mediocre projections and atleast gives context and some sense of how the trade works out in the coming weeks but it only works if you used yahoo which is a huge drawback
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fantasypros is really good but its premium fanduel deposit when i dont have that cbss trade value charts with fantasyspcoms trade analyzer as a second set of eyes
fantasyfootball,not_removed,none i just use overall rankings or positional rankings and go from there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its always pretty spot on sometimes they over react a bit but so do people so maybe thats not bad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed it helps quantify the players to you can get a rough idea of what to offer
fantasyfootball,not_removed,keeper league guy is straight up offering me his aj green for my mike evans should i accept
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no evans is better for fantasy right now and younger he also has a potential superstar qb while green has dalton
fantasyfootball,not_removed,any restrictions on keepers how long can you keep them and what is the cost id rather have aj green for the next few years still very young offense runs through him incredible consistency if you can keep your keepers indefinitely at no cost evans is probably the lean since hes younger evans is sexier and coming off a huge season i almost wonder if you could get aj green and a tiny bit extra minor draft position upgrade
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if anyone wants to caption it and i can share it with the league im sure they would enjoy it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks for sharing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if there is interest ill upload one for ppr and point as well plus i can keep them updated if people are interested
fantasyfootball,not_removed,always interested in a new sheet thanks for putting in the work and for sharing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im happy to do it i hope you find it useful
fantasyfootball,not_removed,looks great id love to see i cant wait for draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,people are def going to be interested bring on the ff spreadsheets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i would love one to look at when im making my decisions ppr would be awesome
fantasyfootball,not_removed,remindme months
fantasyfootball,not_removed,happy to do it i was doing it for myself and decided it didnt cost me to post it and share with other people unless my league mates find this which is very possible shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sweet ill try to upload them as a i go i wont start on the predraft stuff until july at least unless theres a demand for it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thanks im glad you like it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,sweet ill try to upload them as a i go i wont start on the predraft stuff until july at least unless theres a demand for it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,request received and logged i will remind you about growing some balls in weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i know a few leagues like to do early drafts but i still think most people are looking much closer to the start of the season for their drafts
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dont tell matt berry there are two basic approaches value over opponent mpa whatever you want to call it is one the other is the idea that a team that averages fantasy points standard no ppr makes the playoffs almost every time so focus on reaching that total in points per week berry is a big advocate of the latter both have merits but it is better to know which one you prefer and make the decision deliberately to follow one strategy or the other lots of analysts make recommendations through the lens of one or the other and knowing that will help you interpret their recommendations what decisions you make throughout the draft will be impacted by which strategy you choose
fantasyfootball,not_removed,uh not to burst your bubble but this sounds alot like vbd value based drafting
fantasyfootball,not_removed,where do we get these numbers tho when drafting in real time and how do you guys do all this in seconds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,does this idea support drafting tes early since the difference between the top tier and second tier is so large
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i ended up with luck round so i wasnt disappointed either
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this kind of thinking is clearly the way to go but the problem comes when this analysis completely ignores consistency you cant waste a round pick on a guy that is amazing games per year but isnt top at his position for weeks out of the year ppg can mean different things for different people managers who played mariota or taylor through had a different experience than those to went with rivers despite a similar ppg of course consistency isnt always predictable but it needs to be at least considered to get a real draft value
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mpa maybe using it as a construct over a an roster drafting lineup matchups that would be winnings on a weekly bases instead of mpa for rosters over a season long draft looking at just starters
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i couldve used this months ago
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a team that averages fantasy points standard no ppr makes the playoffs almost every time so focus on reaching that total in points per week how does this have any value to anyone though you play your best players and hope they score as many points as possible
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its good to have lots of different tools in your toolbox so when youre behind on monday night you have tavon austin or when youer behind you have frank gore i will say this almost every single ranking you will see online besides beer sheets is using qb td if you are playing points qb td an elite qb is a must brady or rodgers in the third is the best pick you will ever make brady or rodgers in the second is great value rodgers at the back end of the first is viable i know everyone on this sub loves to wait for a qb but it really is fucking stupid if you play point qbtd the math bears this out beersheets bears this out dont wait on an elite qb if one falls to you in round ill take rodgers over rawls of the time
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i was coming to say this its a great and price strategy but renaming and calling it your own isnt innovative
fantasyfootball,not_removed,every site that ive played on has projections for each player in their draft room you can either do a value analysis by eyeballing the numbers or using excel or something like that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,beersheets beersheets beersheets
fantasyfootball,not_removed,no first off the difference isnt all that large since the top tes cant stay healthy and they arent raking in large td hauls second the logic is to compare top talent to the average waiver player or some other average metric which tes just never will excel at the difference between a ww wr and a is massive
fantasyfootball,not_removed,not any more it did back when we were semiconfident gronk would be healthy for games or when we were talking jimmy graham on the saints a few years ago but with how much time gronk has missed there is a much smaller at te in most formats gronk and graham were only and possibly late round picks for a few years there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is just another name for value base drafting vbd where you compare each player to a baseline player typically last starter of a position to rank points my own personal draft sheet i use yahoos adp just before my draft to estimate value over the guy at each position i could draft if i waited round to draft them adp tells me who i can expect to still be available at my next pick so i can estimate the value of drafting each position from that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is what beersheets is based on just under a new name
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is the focus of his annual draft day manifesto he breaks down the into an approximate byposition perweek amount ie something like for qb for for etc and recommends that during the draft you track that if you pick dj or leveon first maybe then you can assume for buying you points of wiggle room for a different position im more an advocate of what this article calls mpa so im trying to define something i dont really subscribe to which doesnt always work well but hopefully that helps
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i agree with everything you said i have no idea why any of that was a response to my comment in particular as opposed to being posted somewhere else i would love enlightenment on this topic but im also perfectly happy letting it be a mystery
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i have never heard of vbd but according to a number of people in this thread the two are similar im also not claiming to be innovative this is just the method i use to draft and manage teams i do not claim it to be anything else
fantasyfootball,not_removed,how accurate are these projections it seems odd going off something that is almost random what was gurley projected to score this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,can you elaborate on the spreadsheet and whyhow you use it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this although it does tend to rank qbs higher than other strategies a lot of people will wait on qbs but vbd a lot of times suggest that you take them earlier
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i dont think this is a new concept by any means many of the fantasy managers in my leagues have never heard of the idea before though so i felt inspired to write about it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,berry says this every year but i never understand how it means anything in practice okay so i know is a good score how does that at all impact my draft strategy isnt magic its not like if i can get to id say oh no thanks is enough and its not like i can do anything if i try to max out my team and end up at of course berry is the same guy who says at a fundamental level fantasy football is all about minimizing risk and giving yourself the best odds to win on a weekly basis like it was handed down from god even though the quote is some bizarre mix of nonsensical selfcontradictory obvious and wrong
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i cant remember i get pretty worked up when i hear things like play the players that will get you the most amount of points lol play your own line up not your opponents start your studs those truisms just infuriate me use your brain anyway when i get mad i get on my soapbox and i forget why i started writing in the first place
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats fair its a good strategy and a well written article
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the ff community universally uses vbd to refer to this conceptjust search the sub or google for that matter if you need verification not saying youre claiming otherwise but calling it by another name is just confusing
fantasyfootball,not_removed,what other option do you have i know im not clairvoyant
fantasyfootball,not_removed,you use the spreadsheet for this reason most leagues start dst and k are too unpredictable to accurately project and so should be taken in the last two rounds if you take a qb in the first round horrible idea by the way just an example any other qbs values should go down you shouldnt take a over say a just because theyre the next player on your vbd list a fluid spreadsheet allows you to change the values for the x number or what the vbd strategy used to rank players by a certain multiplier make sense more info can be found at the article the other guy posted im almost done with formatting mine also so i can post it tomorrow if you want
fantasyfootball,not_removed,that seems to be the one spot where i disagree with vbd i never seem to struggle to find viable qb options at the back of drafts riversryan this year palmercousins last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,all aboard the last hype train of the year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,edelman gronk in a wheelchair floyd
fantasyfootball,not_removed,serious thoughts on chris hogan anyone he is their wr now
fantasyfootball,not_removed,he basically got himself removed from a nonplayoff team to one of the best teams hard to do that being as decently talented he is damn dui might earn himself a superbowl ring good tradeoff for him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,enablers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dang floyd edelman hogan martellus mitchell dion white this is a ridiculous game of pick your poison heading into the playoffs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if someone is in a position where they are considering starting michael floyd in the championship game then i have a feeling that they are very lucky that they are there
fantasyfootball,not_removed,be careful the conductor has been drinking
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for this game probably mitchell being if edelman doesnt play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,against his former team also
fantasyfootball,not_removed,legarrette blount was worse in he gets caught with pot with leveon bell plays out a bit of the season then leaves a game early in a shitfit patriots sign him right after and he rejoins his old team on his way to getting himself a ring
fantasyfootball,not_removed,short of killing a guy i really dont think the pats care about your baggage if you can help the team win
fantasyfootball,not_removed,til hiring someone who has ever had a dwi makes you an enabler
fantasyfootball,not_removed,mitchells listed as doubtful due to a knee so i imagine itd be edelman hogan floyd though if edelman is also out im not sure who moves up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,why wouldnt edelman play
fantasyfootball,not_removed,kind of a slippery slope there floyd already has had a second chance he was hired in between a known arrest and convection i would say anybody who hires somebody in these conditions is an enabler
fantasyfootball,not_removed,think hogan or lafell is better baltimore star corner is out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats a tough one new englands gonna spread the ball for sure and theyre both going up against pretty bad secondaries with eifert out i think lafell will get more looks so id probably go with him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea thats my thought too i cant start cooper vs denver with matt mcgloin in meanwhile im starting dwill and sam bradford because leveondaktyrodmariota all are out fuck week last one i swear bradford v chi or rivers v kc playing kcsteeler def up points in the championship
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats another tough one the chiefs last games really shutout qbs with no running game for the chargers cause gordon is out i think rivers is gonna have a tough time but with no run game theyre gonna have to rely on the passing game solely bradfords coming off an amazing game and could continue it against a susceptible bears defense that being said bradford could very well burn you and drop single digits i think phillip has the safer floor while bradfords got the better ceiling so if you dont need the potential boom go with rivers
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yea im up points and headging rivers and kc def but i dont know if it is the best bet im spinning because it is the difference between and dollars
fantasyfootball,not_removed,alright last one seriously thoughts about ej manuel i am facing sammy watkins and own charles clay eifert was my starter fk but he is facing the jets safe play you think
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dunno much about ej but the jets gave up and points to miami and ne definitely risky but i think he might not be half bad the jets just looked defeated on the field while with a new hc ej will be looking to prove himself for the next season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,boom dez bryant its a little weird to be including dez as a boom and maybe some people will look at that and say duh but hes currently going as wr by ppr adp and i think he could finish as a top guy this year hes arguably the most dominant red zone receiver in the game leading the nfl in touchdowns with from the next closest were demaryius thomas and jimmy graham with over that span of players that played at least one full season during that range dezs yards per game were best hes been mired in injuries recently but he should be back to full health for this season and with how good the cowboys offense was with dak and elliott as rookies i dont see any reason they cant at least be that good again if not better dez was made a priority in the playoffs as he had yards on targets in their first game and a sensational yards and tds on targets in the game they were eliminated i think dez could easily return to the numbers he was putting up just a few years ago and has a great chance to be a top if not top receiver this season bust amari cooper cooper is currently being drafted as the receiver off the board and overall his place finish last year was an improvement on his place finish as a rookie but its difficult to see him joining the top tier of fantasy receivers right now his teammate michael crabtree has targets in the red zone over the last two years and seth roberts has another amari cooper has its not too surprising to see that considering he has a high of tds in his first two years hes a great player but until hes at least in the pecking order in the red zone its difficult to see him taking that next step hell be a very solid catch yard guy but crabtree has put up very similar lines to cooper the past two seasons while reviving his career in oakland a great for oakland but likely just a strong for fantasy not a like hes being drafted
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the reason you dont like patriots wrs is exactly why i dont like saints wrs
fantasyfootball,not_removed,bust jordan howard think hell see a lot of stacked boxes love watching him though boom if a giants rb can establish themselves there is potential there because ds need to respect the pass marcus mariota is going to find his groove zeke again with ginn gone im going to try and get kelvin benjamin this year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for the booms pryor seems like a pretty safe bet not sure why some people are down on washington for next year but if cousins is still there and the best rb in town is fat rob theyll be passing it plenty for busts i think gordon will be down next season ill admit i was wrong about him this year but he wont sustain that td production he didnt have any td runs longer than yards so hes largely dependent on game flow rather than making his own big plays plus the chargers have to add someone else in the backfield to compliment him dont they
fantasyfootball,not_removed,boom ty hilton i think luck is going to have a great year hilton is right in the prime of his career and with his talent he will be in for a ton of yards amazing floor if he has even a couple more td then last year he will be a perfect i dont see moncrief as a threat to him isaiah crowell with a few seasons under his belt he will finally have his breakout year with a much better o line they will try to run the ball a lot and dare i say if gordon comes back it will only be better melvin gordon i love backs with opportunity with woodhead gone gordon has it in spades he is one of the few clear bell cows left and with no committee to worry about i am all in he also has great size and talent it allen can stay healthy the sky is the limit for gordon bust warning unpopular opinion tom brady sure he wont be a bust in the true sense the goat will still be a great real life qb but at years old i dont think he will end up justifying his early round adp if he falls far enough sure ill take him lesean mccoy he actually hasnt missed as much time as people think but at i think some injuries catch up to him has history of hamstring issues he will miss too much time to justify his adp demarco murray similar concerns as mccoy a lot of tread on those tires too much for me to risk at his adp likely could be henry time sooner rather then later
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im not as sold on michael thomas as everybody else he had a great season sure but drew brees is notorious for spreading the ball around colston was also great at the beginning with brees but never took the next step people expected i dont see him being the next great wide receiver in the league while they are different players and wont necessarily have the same career path i think its important to look at patterns for qb play and brees has established his style of spreading the ball to multiple receivers over his career
fantasyfootball,not_removed,homer opinion incoming boom sam bradford with even a marginally better oline an extra year to work with the systemreceiving core and a backfield that can buy him more time and make red zone receptions on top of his very solid accuracy i think mn may be posed to see big numbers from their qb hell probably be spreading it out a lot but assuming murray doesnt do all the red zone work bradford could post a lot more yardage with a lot more touchdowns and few interceptions and mn wont be blowing many teams out defense will not be as good giving him more opportunities bust adrian peterson is anyone even going to risk slotting him as a keeper
fantasyfootball,not_removed,boom breshad perriman if he can stay healthy guy can offer crazy value at the position bust jay ajayi i just dont buy the hype on the guy had a couple of really good games but struggled when miami got injured on the oline he is also going way too high for me to be remotely interested
fantasyfootball,not_removed,wheres dwash on this david johnson level boom right right guys
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah ill agree with those to an extent cooper is a little more questionable though because we have seen improvement from his first year to last year and its really a question of utilization not talent cooper is insanely talented but not used in a way that gets a lot of fantasy points theres not really evidence one way or another that thats going to change next year but i dont think its unreasonable to expect a bump in targets and maybe even rz targets if he keeps getting better and shows he can sustain a high rate of production oakland got a new offensive coordinator so its pretty certain that something will change but whether that something includes cooper is to be seen ill agree with you that hes a risky pick but i think that hes actually a prime candidate for a boom year at the very least its unlikely hell do any worse than last year and getting at the spot isnt that big of a loss
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed on dez especially in standard but you need those tds
fantasyfootball,not_removed,fuck amari cooper burned me so many times with his rec for yds bs games
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats fair but as i mentioned above i think this season is a bit of a turning point for the saints as thomas is their only guy capable of taking over a game last year you had competing and never knew who was going off the patriots are full of talent now including now amazing pass catching backs in lewis white and burkhead this may be reading in a little too deep but i think the saints were only open to trading cooks because they know that thomas is their guy from now on and that he should always be getting targets and rz looks again that might be a little too optimistic but im seeing the saints crowding of offensive talent dispersion whereas the patriots are accumulating even more guys on offense to feed seriously the pats now have hogan edelman cooks mitchell gronk allen white lewis and burkhead to feed on the passing side youd be crazy to bet on any particular one of those guys other than a healthy gronk meanwhile the saints have thomas snead fleener ingram and hightower as major pieces the difference is that fleener isnt good snead isnt a takeover guy and you cant only pass to the backs so theres still quite a few targets left that almost have to go to thomas that previously floated around between cooks and thomas in varying proportions game to game
fantasyfootball,not_removed,to play devils advocate for howard he already was playing with stacked boxes and a terrible passing game i mean he had primarily hoyer and barkely as his qbs and then even a few games they were missing alshon and he still found ways to produce not that glennon is good but i think he would be hard pressed to play worse than the qb situation there last year and if kevin white can get healthy big if then i think thats at least a fairly similar environment as last year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah youd think so i mean hes not the worst very just because hes such a bellcow but i think its dangerous to take him at his current adp
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i kind of like murray as long as you can scoop up henry simply because thats one of the better handcuff situations in the league now if you dont get henry then very dangerous but having both is a fairly safe and high upside venture
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im with you on melvin gordon the new chargers coach anthony lynn is a runningback guy and focuses his game philosophy on running the ball with lynn as head coach and woodhead out of the picture im going all in on melvin gordon
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thomas is going to be very good but his ceiling is limited when compared to other types for exactly the reason you mention breessaints wr never get more than of the target share its freakishly consistent i believe brees has only had wr finish top ppr since hes been in new orleans
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i guess perriman could be a sleeper value pick especially if wallace gets hurt at any point i personally am meh on ajayi at his adp dudes crazy talented as far as power running goes but yeah miamis oline performance was troubling last year if they draft robinson id be much more optimistic for him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah i wasnt really sure who to pick for a bust right now because im still not sure how people will be valuing these guys come draft time other guys im low on are hyde ingram gurley cooks and watkins but i think there are a lot of people that feel the same way so i thought id change it up a bit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah just watch brees though hes spreads the wealth and im not using last year as my basis im using every year that ive been playing fantasy football hes had a but he still spreads the wealth like crazy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,very good point i guess i saw that they lost cutler and jeffery and figured damn good point though
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i totally agree if you can get both you are in good shape i am afraid henrys adp will be high enough that you would have to invest relatively early picks for that back field which i am not a fan of
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thank you i forgot to add that lynn is head coach now another plus i think gordon has less question marks then any rb besides the big of course another bonus he is going to be years old which on average is the year when rbs score their most fantasy points i would take gordon end of the first round and be happy
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im also low on all those guys other than ingram he got more involved in the passing game and i think payton got over his shit fit mid season and gave ingram the touches he deserved and he produced as a result that might be wishful thinking but at least based on what i saw at the end of last year im ok with ingram as an with upside
fantasyfootball,not_removed,my understanding is that he hasnt had a true receiver since the colston days and that a lot of people have been drawing comparisons between thomas and colston which would maybe indicate to me that brees spreads the ball sure but that in recent years thats been exaggerated by lacking a big body possession receiver thats an rz threat not disagreeing that its a bit of a risk to take him early but i think there are some potential indicators that more targets will start to flow towards thomas next season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah and im referring to the colston days
fantasyfootball,not_removed,a buddies league the sacko had to wear an adult diaper to a party option to wear over shorts party consisting of mostly players on our club football team and refused got kicked out and i replaced him
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we have a buyout provision where a person can pay their way out of the sacko punishment by covering the champs entry fee the next year
fantasyfootball,not_removed,depends on who the individual was if the league taco is complaining about his punishment after straight years of finishing dead last then he goneee but if it is someone very active in the league who had a down year i believe a compromise may be in order you dont want to let your best leaguemates walk also i believe it is best to have a punishment not be too overwhelming for this exact reason you want to give the loser a hard time for sucking but you dont have to go too intense on the punishment
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our last place punishment was having to wear a dress and sing karaoke at the local bar not an over the top punishment by any means due to personal reasons the kid is backing out of it hes out of the league barely checked anyways and the compromise was two bottles of booze for our league gettogether in the coming weeks
fantasyfootball,not_removed,in our league the sacko got a framed poster with various animal ball sacks on it with the year he lost his team name and a runnin list of losers same kid lost twice think we have to kick him out because he as never taken it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our sacko punishment is having to chug a pair of smirnoff ices during halftime at our superbowl party last year the loser was a guy who had quit drinking so as a compromise we had him chug na beer instead he said afterwards that it tasted so bad hed have rather done the ices
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ive had to kick people out if they dont do their punishments i give them until aug if its not done by then theyre out its happened of the years but it gets rid of the people who dont care that much
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our sacko penalty is relatively minor has to host and pay for the draft party the issue is that all our gfs wives hate fantasy football so it means that on top of that you have the obvious payment to smooth things over with them
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our punishment in our league is the guy has to eat that caroline reaper one chip challenge he will eat the day of the superbowl hes a falcons fan hope they win so he doesnt lose twice in one day
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i dont like tough sacks punishments for this very reason it is only worth having as a penalty if everyone in the league is actually prepared to go through with it which means there is a fine line that needs to be taken when balancing the punishment to the league members
fantasyfootball,not_removed,im in a league with a sacko punishment that changes every year last year it was for a calendar shoot where everyone else got to pick months of the year outfits for the sacko there were specific rules in place baring anything that would get us in trouble professionally the guy who won has been a great sport about it but another guy in the league was so terrified that it was going to be him that he quit after the season hell forever be branded a coward
fantasyfootball,not_removed,our sacko is getting pepper sprayed ill let you know how it shakes out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,had that happen to a league mate this last year was a repeat sacko first year sacko our punishment was clearly defined as a liptat are normally temporary unless something goes wrong it was decided after the season started but it was still like week or and everyone was aboard including him talked smack for sure wont be me hahaha type of shit turns out it was him bitched and moaned about it for weeks after the end of the season said he never agreed to it blah blah blah debated kicking him out then he didnt really contribute to group chat banter which is big for us keep in mind i won this year so i decided what went on the tattoo in the end after saying he wouldnt get it and then complaining about what it was to say he got it in secrecy depriving the league the fun of watching ti happen in like march months after the superbowl had he taken it stride it would have been easier on him and more enjoyable for us following year we had a greed on same punishment he talked the same smack surprise surprise he got last again he made it known he wasnt going to do it so we just moved on as a league new league mate is more competitive and contributes much more to banter worked out well for the league to move on edit we tried compromising with a mike tyson henna and a few other things but he wouldnt have any of it
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well my league which is a tightknit group of friends doesnt have a sacko penalty but we are cutthroat as fuck and wouldnt hesitate to drop a motherfucker who didnt sack up
fantasyfootball,not_removed,if they dont go through with it they failed to pay off on a bet thats a very big deal for some people not as much for others theres no universal answer for me thats a big transgression i wouldnt end a lifelong friendship over it but itd be hard for me to avoid thinking about it and id probably at least want to boot them from the league and not make any more bets with them i am very big on integrity about bets i can imagine exceptions for circumstances where it would be especially cruel or immoral to make someone go through with it eg the penalty is to take a bunch of shots and the losers brother has recently died in a drunk driving accident but in general if someone really wont want to do something they should speak up before the draft
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats pretty mild what a loser
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats a good provision i like that really i think anything where everyone agrees up front is fine
fantasyfootball,not_removed,this is a great idea ive been wondering how to bump my leagues sacko punishment and weve hesitated because we know several guys just wouldnt agree to something more but if they had a monetary out the or guys who would be hesitant to do it all have the money to buy out of the bet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i see it completely opposite if one dude has just been fucked year after year after year and he keeps coming back id feel more sympathy if a guy whos been enjoying doing well for several years and threatens to quit over his first last place fuck that guy he can leave
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i could see that also if it was a guy who poured it on when someone else finished last then he wouldnt go through with it talk a walk dick
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well clearly you have other things going for you in your life
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i guess good on him for doing any kind of compromise if hes quitting anyway
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats the punishment in your league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,well it wont turn out fun i can promise you that
fantasyfootball,not_removed,your league sounds weird and unsanitary
fantasyfootball,not_removed,yeah thats the key if you agree to the punishment before the draft once youre in you should honor it but there are some leagues where the sackos punishment is determined by the league winner and i wouldnt have as much of a problem with someone backing out if the punishment was crazy for me its like a league fee if you are told before the draft the league fee is you can either pay it or say no way im out but if you agree to pay go through the draft and then start the season and decide to drop out without paying the youre a dick on the other hand if the commissioner says there will be a fee but doesnt say what it is if he decides this year it will be more than it was last year yeah you have the right to drop out
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agree it gets brought up during practices oh well worked in my favour
fantasyfootball,not_removed,its actually also ok if everyone agrees later i mean but good luck getting that to happen without a little lessok coercion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,ya especially if is a money league
fantasyfootball,not_removed,haha it sounds like an insult but its actually pretty complimentary
fantasyfootball,not_removed,true the kid is one of the nicest guys youll meet but the personal reasons unfortunately stem from another league mate so the fact that we even get that is astounding
fantasyfootball,not_removed,we make a big list and assign point values to each punishment they pick from the list to get to a certain point total
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the joke is on him its just mellow yellow in a coke bottle
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i mean weird at the very least right
fantasyfootball,not_removed,agreed thats not fun or funny
fantasyfootball,not_removed,dude we really need to hear these personal reasons i dont think i know him i promise i wont tell it feels like another league mate banged his girlfriend or something
fantasyfootball,not_removed,whats the worst punishment on the list in your opinion
fantasyfootball,not_removed,very good guess our league is basically two friend groups commishs friends from home and commishs friends from school one of the friends from school had been making attempts with this girl at school who wasnt as interested one of the friends from home comes to visit immediately hooks up with said girl and now theyre dating long story short stupid shit
fantasyfootball,not_removed,the top ones that are worth all the points tattoo determined by the league legally add a middle name volunteer as a youth hockey coach for an entire season
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i hope the person leaving is the crybaby who didnt get the girl
fantasyfootball,not_removed,thats weak sauce wasnt even his girl he cant be mad
fantasyfootball,not_removed,for youth hockey coach do you have to grow a mullet
fantasyfootball,not_removed,oh he definitely is kid who got the girl came in second place
fantasyfootball,not_removed,i think it just happens
fantasyfootball,not_removed,looks like he probably came first tho
