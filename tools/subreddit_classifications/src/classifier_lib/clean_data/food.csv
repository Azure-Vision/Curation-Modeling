food,removed,its like a large cast iron so expect something similar but on a larger scale the grease tray at the front is helpful but the ground i have it on is not level so the grease tends to collect in the top corners small pools that dont really affect the cooking but after im done cooking i can just scrape the grease into the front lip then push it into the grease trap on the side then just scrape the cooking surface clean with a scraperspatula wait for it to get smoking hot again and pour a good amount of water to sizzle everything off then i got some of these things to clean the surface one last time then as its still hot i cover it in a thin layer of oil and spread it with a cloth to keep it seasoned and prevent it from rusting as long as you use it somewhat regularly its not a pain i let it sit once for multiple weeks without using it and it started to rust on a couple small spots so then i had to scrape it with some steel wool before i can fire it up again its not perfect they also run less than everything i described is the worst part about it if you can deal with that then youll like it its a blast to cook on and im super happy with mine

food,removed,my morning dump looks more appetizing than this
food,removed,a grilled cheese consists of only these following items cheese bread with spread usually butter this entire subreddit consist of melts almost every grilled cheese sandwich i see on here has other items added to it the fact that this subreddit is called grilledcheese is nothing short of utter blasphemy let me start out by saying i have nothing against melts i just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses adding cheese to your tuna sandwich its called a tuna melt totally different want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach i dont know what the hell youd call that but its not a grilled cheese i would be more than willing to wager ive eaten more grilled cheeses in my years than any of you had in your entire lives i have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich want to personalize your grilled cheese use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread but if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it make your own subreddit entitled melts because that is not a fucking grilled cheese im not a religious man nor am i anything close to a culinary expert but as a bland white midwestern male i am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac cheese all of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them yet again it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being shit i stopped lurking after years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this ive seen post after post of peoples grilled cheeses all over reddit and its been driving me insane the moment i saw this subreddit this morning i finally snapped hell i may even start my own subreddit just because i know this one exists now you god damn heretics respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is a melt
food,removed,nor a garbage dump where the primary meal is shit thats been fermenting in a dead raccoons ass it looks like skating rink pizza the shit food upvotes is horrendous it should be renamed cause i cant imagine anyone with a fucking brain and choice eating the shit upvoted here remember that soup that was uploaded and called stir fry i honestly had to be hospitalized after that for the safety of others i literally was going to kill everyone single person who upvoted it thankfully i told my therapist and they were able to get medical intervention i had names addresses it was a close call but now im on medication so the only danger is to myself getting cancer from seeing this shit

food,removed,i think you reach the most people for the smallest investment by contacting semiwellknown food bloggers or instagram accounts give them a couple of products and have them advertise the recipe contest or give them the to host a competition for their followers its usually a winwinwin cheap ad for the company more likesfollowers for the blogger free product for the reader ofcourse more people would participate if theres a cash prize always

food,removed,its interesting that you dont have a taco spice considering how that particular spice is pretty much the definion for taco taste in norway fwiw the spiced ground meat that has come to be thought of as taco meat internationally which is a bit odd given how many different things can be served as a taco is probably closest to a mexican picadillo if you want to look for a scratch recipe

food,removed,the day of september i was home alone watching shrek i heard a ring at the doorbell and walked over looking out the door i saw a car driving away and a small package sitting on the doorstep curious i brought it inside and unwrapped it it was a case with jacob slendtorius written on it in comic sans confused i scratched my head and pulled out the case i opened it up and inside was a cd i placed the cd in my cd player and white noise played i heard scratching at my window and as i approached the noise on the cd got louder and so did the scratching my heart was racing faint noises of breath hitting a microphone sounded from the cd i listened closer it was jacob sartoriuss distorted mixtape the sound of autotune echoed in the background suddenly from my window i saw a beanied gnomelike figure the stench of popcorn singeing my nose behind him was a tall dark figure wearing a sweatshirt and bearing the most hideous of braces the mixtape the gnome figure the scratching i knew it could be only one thing it was jacob slendtorius i thought he was just an urban legend but the hideous beast was standing mere meters away from me what is up dramalertnation lets get roiiiight into the news the gnome whispered i screamed and my ears began to bleed the taller figure the one i had now recognized to be jacob slendtorius slowly walked forward frantically i pulled up the youtube app on my phone and disliked all of his videos and unsubscribed the slendtorius approached me slowly and awkwardly now only feet away in a raspy prepubescent autotuned voice with a menacing chuckle and intrusive grin he told me that i could wear his sweatshirt i dont want to please leave me alone i replied his grin dropped and his face went blank he came closer making me increasingly uncomfortable he warned me that if i do not post this on reddit i will be forced to listen to his mixtape for the rest of my life and he will make me wear his sweatshirt the slendtorius left seven lyric pages and selfadvertisements and promotions on the ground and forced me to hide them in the forest he vanished into the night along with his smaller gnome figure i took the godforsaken cd and attempted to break it but it wouldnt crack hammered it scratched it threw it sat on it digested it but it wouldnt break i put it in the cd player once more and it was a message from the slendtorius you must share this cd give it to an unsuspecting person and do not mention me you will otherwise be forever cursed just like this cd i put it in the mail to a random address and my life has been normal ever since i had my phone on me at the time and was able to take a few pictures for proof i took pictures of the cd case the silhouette of the slendtorius at my window and a few other pictures that ended up being corrupted these are those images

food,removed,i would definitely recommend trying to build a relationship with a restaurant as almost all supermarket fish will be of slightly lesser quality most often passing through a distribution plant first then hitting stores as an example of the increase in quality ive received japanese fish still in rigor from my seafood purveyor at the restaurant i used to work at also no supermarket is going to carry aaa grade tuna or bluefin its just too expensive for them you can really tell the difference between that and supermarket tuna gasses forced into the meat preserve color but drastically change flavor and texture you can tell by the evenness of the pink in ops picture that its been gassed and frozen this excludes some fish like hamachi which doesnt suffer nearly as much from the gassing and freezing and salmon which must be frozen before consuming
food,removed,looks good not being near ive been meaning to try chef johns recipe
food,removed,i completely agree i tried and its definitely not sushi its raw fish gross but there are japanese stores that sell specifically for sushi i really think its the handling of the fish and keeping it frozen the whole time theres commercial flash freezing in liquid nitrogen that freezes so quick that the muscle doesnt degrade but regular freezing builds ice crystals that degrade the meat sushi fish is instantly flash frozen on the boat and then shipped frozen only unfrozen once the first time at the restaraunt frozen salmon at the store lays there for days getting stinky and sometimes theyll refreeze it
food,removed,jesus fuck with all of you thinking this is gross because his poor camera sucks at accurate color reproduction you are probably the same fucks that said my hand looks orange on imgur one time when i flipped off something and took a pic pictures reality i bet every one of you ew green gross posters would be salivating if you were in the same room as this cut
food,removed,depends on the fish something small pelagic and fast growing like blackfin tuna is completely fine to eat raw right on the boat something that is larger older or more towards the bottom feeder variety may be much more prone to parasites and such
food,removed,mosaicbot bee

food,removed,hasnt that been already posted
food,removed,over the last couple of weeks ive seen a few pretzel recipes in this sub that call for boiling the dough in baking soda and water andor using an egg wash to get a dark color while these techniques result in a passable pretzel to get an authentic taste and color a lye bath is needed this is not nearly as scary as it sounds and as long as you are careful its no big deal there are many recipes online i used this httpgermanfoodaboutcomodbakingssbrezelnsbshtm this time around because of its simple ingredient list but you can find more authentic versions if you look around i purchased the dont use lye you get at the hardware store because it has trace heavy metals when working with lye be sure to use nonreactive bowls and utensils like glass or plastic also be sure to wear eye protection gloves and closedtoe shoes keep a bottle of vinegar on hand for clean up and in case of spills
food,removed,you call this paella
food,removed,you can probably get pellegrino in cans at the grocery for about but its in cans its pretty goodish and you can get great flavors also also if you buy larger bottles the costoz goes down

food,removed,delicious
food,removed,is your wife single
food,removed,i came
food,removed,meats both store bought this is not charcuterie
food,removed,thats funny i thought that you were from another country and tootsies meant something specific where you were from a few days ago someone posted a picture of gammon which i had never heard of so i did a search and found out thats the word til tootsies really are candy but autocorrect thinks tomatoes are tootsies
food,removed,charcuterie is a cured meats plate there are meats on this plate this is not charcuterie it is homemade lunchables
food,removed,learn how to cook before posting next time its raw
food,removed,a
food,removed,it cheapens the word homemade though this is a homemade charcuterie
food,removed,charcuterie is a word assholes use but more specifically when they are describing sliced meats and cheeses on a rustic wooden board indeed of serving them straight off the ground where they deserve to be eating them from
food,removed,here throw away the three sad cheeses add bacon spam and bologna
food,removed,what charcuterie all i see is some generic salume identical too and maybe some cured ham could be bayonne or prosciutto no coppa no nduja no mortadella or any other salumi cotto or indeed any other variety of salumi theres a whole world out there from many different regions this just looks like some generic gift basket boring and dull if i got this as a gift idve smiled politely and fed it to the chickens at a restaurant id have turned it into a hat for the waiter rubbish
food,removed,there is literally nothing authentic about pulling open a hormell cold cut tub
food,removed,haha this is my dream meal but ive never really indulged mostly because ppl r scum
food,removed,homemade plate of delicious gout
food,removed,what do you think on the board is homemade maybe the mustard seriously certainly none of the meats none of the cheeses none of the nuts none of the fruits none of the greens so that leaves the mustard and that diplooking thing which is probably also out of a tub i dumped all of these on the board one at a time and managed to keep things kinda separated is what i see could do better could do much much better are the things in the picture edible im sure im sure they even taste good just because a spoon of salted butter mixed with lard and wrapped with bologna tastes good doesnt mean its a fine example of anything
food,removed,weird youd be downvoted on a food sub for pointing out something that should be obvious from food history no tomatoes no pizza looks delicious just call it something else
food,removed,🤤🤤🤤
food,removed,so lets just take a look at what you wrote i have no culinary skill if i made this thing that would display my lack of skill i would be proud i think it looks great and i would get into an argument with anyone who has ever actually put a goodlooking board together because i use lots of stuff on the board separated by dishes and olives and leaves as my rubric i ubreetgat think criticism is evil okay then good for you and op i never was upset i calls it like i sees it im a cheesemonger you are easily impressed
food,removed,all i see is heart burn and constipation
food,removed,food all looks fantastic if my wife looked like that id probably improve my cooking skills too
food,removed,here you go make a sourdough following this recipe i used a san francisco sourdough starter when i first began this months ago and just used that starter for this dough this makes enough dough for loaves or about large pizzas inch i used a inch cast iron skillet for this pizza cut enough enough to spread out over the cast iron mash up an whole roasted garlic head across the bottom and then spread an alfredo sauce over that baste the outer crust with a mixture of melted button and minced garlic put down a layer of cheese cover with cut up meats and thin sliced onion and then cover with cheese again i then covered with grated parmesan cheese too throw that into an oven at for minutes let it cool in the cast iron for minutes remove and cut

food,removed,downvote for the damn parsley people need to stop adding decoration where its not needed good decoration in food is edible at least parsley is edible and describes the dish so parsley works well on something with a lot of herbal flavors key lime pie might have some candied lime etc just dumping a handful of parsley or green onions on everything you cook doesnt make you a master chef it distracts from the elements that make up the dish yes it adds color but there are other ways to add color to a dish for instance cracked green peppercorns mightve been a nice way to add color and flavor to a dish that assuming thats a white gravy has a significant pepper flavor to it not that there is anything wrong with white and brown food not everything has to be bright colors otherwise this looks really great kind of want one just a pet peeve partially because i hate the taste of green onions and people put it on everything for no reason

food,removed,recipe for the jeera rice is as under again bots you make our lives harder ingredients cup of preferably long grained variety like basmati rice cups of water salt a few pinches optional tbsp of ghee clarified butter or tbsp of a cooking oil with a neutral aroma like sunflower oilolive oil tbsp of cumin seeds jeera a small handfull of fresh coriander leaves finely chopped optional method cook the rice either by pressure cooker method or open pot method or using a microwave use any method you feel comfortable with the grains of the rice should remain separate i feel the open pot method is the easiest and will describe it in the following steps wash the rice and set aside take cups of water for every cup of rice that you are cooking in a large pan a few pinches of salt if using and bring it to a boil once the water comes to a rapid boil add the rice and stir well it will take approximately minutes for the rice to cook after mins taste a few grains of rice every mins allow the rice cook because even after you turn the heat off the rice will cook a little further once done drain all the water very carefully and spread out the rice on a plate to let it cool down fluff it with a fork so that lumps dont form in the rice once it has cooled down to the room temperature prepare the tempering if you like fresh coriander leaves in the rice sprinkle some finely chopped leaves on the rice at this stage heat the ghee oil whichever you are using in a small tempering pan add cumin seeds and let it crackle but dont let them get too dark or burnt turn the heat off once they are golden brown and pour it over the rice mix with light hands or a fork taking care not to break the grains of rice serve with warm daal papad and some pickle enjoy🙂

food,removed,oatmeal cream pies food porn
food,removed,if you get the right mincer its not too bad i get plastic ones because i can put them in the dishwasher but they do break easily
food,removed,i hope you are near cornwall
food,removed,wrong cream pies wrong subredditill see my way out
food,removed,this one was a good one
food,removed,i cant remember as it was a few years back i do know there is another really good one in babbacombe in torquay that batters their chips too
food,removed,i make some delicious crème pies d
food,removed,you guys are super fat right
food,removed,just looking at this makes me have to void my bowels
food,removed,its a bit of a mission the way i cook this chop cherry tomatoes in half and put into a warm oven and leave over night in the morning put into a bowel with olive oil and garlic and salt and put into the fridge to use whenever then chop onions mushrooms garlic and herbs i just use parsley and put into a bowl with a small drop of olive oil and sea salt mix up by hand and then put in the fridge for at least a night it wilts down the mushroom and onion when you are ready to cook fry off your mushroom mix add the chicken and continue to fry take all the ingredients out of the pan and then deglaze with a glass of wine and reduce to almost nothing important to not deglaze with ingredients in the pan as it can make a bitter flavour add the chicken and mushroom and half a pint of double cream when boiled add the tomatoes and then stir into freshly cooked pasta gosh thats a mission lol
food,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
food,removed,my mrs loves mushy peas those chips look great though
food,removed,isis there a napkin in the burger oh my god
food,removed,yes i know right i am supposed to hate everyone who is not muslim as far as i gather from the media the thing is who can better understand todays muslims in europe than jews they werent welcome once and things have come a long way since hopefully we can share some lamb ribs and hummus and bread among us and not let extremism politics and media kill our love for humanity i need that cause im a convert i lose either way if this blows up we all do we just dont always see it
food,removed,yeah man i flipping love beef dripping they are def battered though but its only light
food,removed,its one of the only times when i ate a whole serving would you want more it was for lunch
food,removed,oh man i did it was such a disappointment i went to two chip shops and asked who did fresh fish both of them laughed at me and said no one no fresh fish there any more just prawns and whatnot
food,removed,nooooooooo always cut tartar by hand
food,removed,it was a lunch time special thing although i do always ask for small portions
food,removed,lol
food,removed,i had no idea they made scarves now back then they were just a couple of shops in paris although i have seen them in london now too
food,removed,yeah that can be a bit of a pain though and if you go late in the day the butcher doesnt want to get his mincer dirty for lousy customer
food,removed,iphone probably it was a long time ago
food,removed,pretty sure op already knows the fault and that was the entire point
food,removed,creampies are my favourite thing towait a minute
food,removed,haddock i find has a nicer texture and retains a nicer flavour i find cod fillets to be dry and tasteless halibut is a flat fish and if its good quality is really amazing battered really soft silky texture and sweet but to be honest of chip shops use frozen fish and they overcook it and its left in the warmer for far too long so you might as well get the cheapest
food,removed,potus penus
food,removed,i completely understand your point of view i understand that its cruel to animals but i simply dont care its not like i want them to be hurt or treated badly i just dont have that thing inside me that cares of the meat on the shelf of a supermarket is inhumanly grown ive seen someone slice a pigs neck open and listen to it screaming while it died and then i ate it its just not something that bothers me or gives me any feeling at all
food,removed,id like to recommend this recipe httpbravetartcomrecipesoatmealcreampies ive made it before and it was great it uses much less butter than ops recipe less than one stick and incudes a recipe for marshmallow fluff filling the corn syrup gives the cookies that lovely flexible almost gooey texture of the little debbie version and the taste is spot on
food,removed,not a fan of the new imgur where uploading is becoming a pain below is the recipe ingredients spring rolls lb of shrimp deveined and cooked spring roll rice papers english cucumber medium carrots large red radishes sub daikon small cabbage red or green bunch green onions bunch basil lime minced garlic clove teaspoon freshly grated ginger soy sauce sriracha or chili garlic paste for directions and more

food,removed,having worked with a couple of the top french chefs in the world foie is commonly used as an abbreviation for foie gras a lot of abbreviations for food come directly from the kitchens of such chefs go to a coffee shop and ask for a cap you will get a cappuccino go to a michelin star restaurant and ask how they cook the foie they will tell you how they cook the foie gras i would say dont be so pretentious but im not sure it would help you
food,removed,porn really ruined that word
food,removed,and they said oatmeal is healthy
food,removed,
food,removed,i think it was a lunch deal i couldnt ever eat a large portion though
food,removed,
food,removed,ewww wtf learn to cook
food,removed,i have tried a few cast iron ones but they dont like being in the dish washer and i have a rule in my house that if it doesnt go in the dishwasher it doesnt live in my house
food,removed,drives me mad that chip shops in england dont do lemon
food,removed,went to russels first and they were the ones that laughed when i mentioned fresh fish they said there simply wasnt any fish coming in and hadnt been for a long time i went round the back of that one down a quiet street to a little one and they said the same about the fresh fish but i did get some from there and they were good i was just let down that the fish wasnt fresh
food,removed,back when i was in paris that time i think it would of been
food,removed,i think i may be standing corrected it would appear they may of had a whole line of stuff back then i never came across it though
food,removed,oh and the area you went to isntisnt the best place in london it was where the soldier was beheaded in the street a couple of years ago its not a bad place by any means

food,removed,i cant remember unfortunately i was just going through some old photos and found it and remembered how awesome it was
food,removed,haha it was a lunch deal do they still use beef dripping in whitby
food,removed,i just get plastic ones because they are dishwasher safe but any are good really there are a few tricks though like putting your meat in the freezer so its really cold before mincing but trust me even for making things like chill its a total different world compared to shop stuff
food,removed,im quite shocked at how many people have complained about the portion size it was a lunch deal but i wouldnt ever eat more than that anyway

food,removed,that looks gross just a giant slab of fat and cartilage
food,removed,oddly satisfying
food,removed,doesn´t that mean they overcook the shit out of them
food,removed,anyone else get a sexual vibe from this
food,removed,the first thing it reminds me when i saw this is the poor pig and im not even a vegetarian
food,removed,nope korean bbq or die
food,removed,i like having to hold onto the bone and use my teeth to tear off the meat i feel like it soothes my barbaric instinct
food,removed,in a competition youd lose points for this
food,removed,ribs that are ruined
food,removed,i see hes mastered the pullout method
food,removed,rsmoking for anyone who wants to get on the path

food,removed,omg my erection right now
food,removed,looks amazingly delicious😋
food,removed,shudders yes please
food,removed,okay i like it when my meat comes off the bone easily but not like thisif i wanted it like this i would have ordered a steak i like my ribs to fight back a bit you know make me feel like i earned those rib bones with nothing but small pieces of meat and sauce them
food,removed,this has awoken my appetite

food,removed,dogs hate them
food,removed,ill take overcooked ribs for
food,removed,
food,removed,i hope you brought enough for everyone but really it does look good but a proper rib if there is one should be percent tender with percent firmnesss so you can taste the texture
food,removed,i know this is due to my limited exposure to this subreddit but finally something not entirely consisting ofcoated in cheese
food,removed,this is like the best game of jenga ever
food,removed,nope sorry i prefer to gnaw the meat off the bone if its tasty you want to chew it rather than it melting in your mouth
food,removed,nusret
food,removed,im going to fucking bed man its only
food,removed,slower you slut
food,removed,this needs an nsfw tag
food,removed,its like porn
food,removed,he looks like hes playing jenga
food,removed,i know this comment will be lost but in a small town about minutes drive from university of memphis is a small sleepy town called oakland tennessee watch your speed because the opd love to ticket out of towners for speeding in this town is a great little mom and pop bbq operation called lovin fresh bbq and it is by far the best bbq ive ever had come visit
food,removed,probably still a bunch of gristle and fat though
food,removed,but the bones are the best bit for you put hairs on your chest and help you hear in the dark
food,removed,just thinking about aliens making a post to alien reddit about human ribs like this then i go back to jacking off
food,removed,roddlysatisfying
food,removed,unfffff that looks so good
food,removed,nusr et in turkey
food,removed,meaty jenga
food,removed,food porn
food,removed,meat is often added on top so this happens easily
food,removed,the vegans are triggeres
food,removed,this is what happens when i braise short ribs its frickin awesome
food,removed,someone put that in my mouth
food,removed,is that horse meat
food,removed,so the point of making ribs is why seems you would get more meat eating a different part of an animal this coming from a veg
food,removed,does anyone else get an awkward erection while watching this
food,removed,im trying to get josh to make a youtube channel maybe some more attention would push him that way his family owns a small restaurant in the town i grew up in and he has taken to bbq on his own he grows his own veggies makes his own bbq sauce and does a lot of beautiful shit with a grill check him out uncledirtysbbq
food,removed,nice rack
food,removed,not sure i prefer that
food,removed,i always find all the overcooked comments funny since that is the whole point of bbq overcook the meat to a point all the connective tissues breaks down
food,removed,this is better than any porn ive ever watched
food,removed,am i going to be the only one to say that these are beef ribs beef is easy to cook ribs or not let see this redone using pork
food,removed,why tf does everyone get so technical its food eat that shit dont give a professional opinion on why its not good enough for you because that shit looks dank
food,removed,this is a thing this sub likes my dads ribs do that shit all the time pretty annoying when youre trying to eat them though
food,removed,all ribs fall off their bones after i eat them
food,removed,looks really fatty
food,removed,well since we are sharing here is some of my better work from the backyard httpimgurcomgalleryhjpmsnew
food,removed,i like ribs and meat in general but seeing this it grosses me out
food,removed,i hope one day i am cooked so very tenderly
food,removed,did they boil these
food,removed,while this isnt always what you want and certainly not for a competition this is not difficult to accomplish at home if you so desire bake in your oven covered at for hours with beer poured into the bottom of the drip tray those bones will pull right out
food,removed,i prefer to rip the meat off the bone personally i know a lot of people prefer them super tender though
food,removed,in addition to the comments about this not actually being what you want in a rib these are beef ribs everyone knows that pigs are more delicious than cows
food,removed,that are fall off nice grammar karma whoring reposter
food,removed,i literally moaned
food,removed,i too would fall off the bone for john stamos
food,removed,you want a little chew in your ribs if the bone comes out this easily the ribs will be mushy the bark is the best part of a good rib
food,removed,kind of takes the fun out of eating ribs
food,removed,all this means is that it is a little over cooked you typically wouldnt want this if you were cooking competitively a tender meat that comes off the bone when gently pulled with the teeth is much better
food,removed,rtitlegore
food,removed,i havent had lunch yet today i think this might be against the geneva convention
food,removed,meat jenga
food,removed,this is nusret nusrmeat a steak house in turkey nusret is the name of this guy in turkey peoples understanding about barbeque or meat is not well developed yet and this guy for me hes one pretentious parvenu is using this lack of information very well he has rest in turkey and one at dubai i did say pretentious didnt ı but some of his work are really good i have to hand it to him
food,removed,way way overdone
food,removed,well there goes all the fun in eating it its like boneless wings which are pointless
food,removed,not baby back ribs leaving
food,removed,httpswwweyeonspaincomimagesjustinhomersimpsonjpg
food,removed,meat eaters vegans
food,removed,
food,removed,i dont like when ribs are like this at all
food,removed,they need to have some bite this is either over cooked or not cooked at the proper tempature
food,removed,how so
food,removed,i dont care what people say i love fall off the bone ribs
food,removed,thats the sexiest thing ive ever seen
food,removed,uh thats why i called it seafood gazpacho indicates the addition of seafood you know
food,removed,pressure cooker ribs ewwww
food,removed,it looks so juicy and tender that it gave me a hard on
food,removed,so tender it falls of the bone literally
food,removed,this makes me think of those storied about people dying the tub and not being found for weeks but when someone does and goes to remove the body the bone comes clean out of the slim that was their body
food,removed,here in holland we have a franchise restaurant who used to have the best ribs of the country now they just press the meat on the bones in some kind of mold and it tastes like smoked sausages such a shame but these seem to have been cooked first and then grilled afterwards
food,removed,this beautiful creature must die its death for no reason death for no reason its murder
food,removed,oh man i just came
food,removed,i feel like im one of the few people who absolutely hates bbq ribs
food,removed,hard to believe this was a person
food,removed,i like a bit of tug myself but thats just me
food,removed,i seriously love that place
food,removed,anyone else find this gross
food,removed,i guess this is how they make the mcrib
food,removed,im not a vegan or anything but that makes me feel sick d how can people eat ribs what do they even taste like the look is so off putting also never had ribs before but the sight and smell makes me gip
food,removed,you may be a professional competition barbeque cook and your advice may be spot on but theres one problem these arent barbecued these are braised beef ribs
food,removed,wow surprising reactionits all in the technique you should taste first judge second ive had great ribs that fell off the bone you can have your tastes but damn barbecue boys dont be so picky
food,removed,somebody get tissue i mean a napkin
food,removed,thanks and yes seafood was cooked crab was steamed and shrimp was poached then the poaching liquid was reduced to a stock and added to the gazpacho for continuity of flavor
food,removed,yeah ill have the boneless ribs
food,removed,meat can be so overcooked that it comes full circle from tough to almost mush in the mouth thats generally not the desired effect when preparing ribs
food,removed,how embarrassing video proof of overcooked ribs that used to be high quality
food,removed,falloffthebone tender is how it should be written
food,removed,goooorgeous
food,removed,roddlysatisfying
food,removed,damn

food,removed,rtitlegore
food,removed,that could have been several delicious rib eyes
food,removed,these ribs suck and are overcooked i wouldnt eat that shit the meat is supposed to be on the bone not in your lap
food,removed,overcooked we call those shiners
food,removed,just thinking if i was a bovine i would be horrified
food,removed,this doesnt look appetizing at all i wouldnt go to a restaurant and order a rib steak i want the meat in the bone still
food,removed,you wont regret it their sides are alright standard country slaw and beans they also house smoke ham and turkey for deli sandwiches and seasonally make tamale pies chili and bbq pizzas etc etc
food,removed,rtitlegore
food,removed,yea but that defeats the whole purpose of eating ribs now you need a knife and a fork
food,removed,pull out game strong
food,removed,were filming our fuckups now
food,removed,remember when ribs used to be considered scraps and lobster was a delicacy people are weird
food,removed,damn if thats not food porn than i dont know what is
food,removed,overcooked
food,removed,makes me shudder gross fuck
food,removed,judging by the size of the bone those must be beef ribs i could never get into beef ribs they always had a weird flavor to me i love steak moo rare pot roast beef shanks etc but if im having ribs they got to be pork preferably spare because they have the crunchy tips anyone else like this
food,removed,i agree with many here who say that ribs shouldnt be like this i prefer mine to be cooked just before this point so that they still have a bit of bite to them when they are cooked to the point when they fall right off the bone then they are too softsoggy and the meat doesnt have any texture to it
food,removed,if this was my gif id probably slide the bone in and out p
food,removed,im an idiot i meant something that isnt pork said it in my head but forgot to write it
food,removed,i would like you to use words i use words on a regular basis look at this words words words would you like to try to use some words words can be fun they can be used to express your thoughts

food,removed,i have a very high pinko commie high horse that i like to ride and was about to take it for a spin on how surf turf is shit made up by middlerun restaurants simply to sell the two most expensive ingredients available to them is conspicuous consumption is not a tradition anywhere in any culture the flavors arent even complimentary blah blah but then i took a better look there are some things about the seafood in this picture that make me think seafood isnt every day in that kitchen there are also one or two things about the potatoes that make me think potatoes are every day in that kitchen i hope yall enjoyed

food,removed,ive studied the bible in college and spent a particularly large amount of time on this exact subject the epistles say that its ok to eat that stuff if you really need to with the specific example that if youre starving or live in an area where one of the proscribed foods must by necessity make up a part of your diet then its fine to eat them spreading the message is more important than the little things it did not say that it was perfectly fine to just forget about the rules entirely and the implication is that in modern western countries there would be no need whatsoever to overlook these rules because it would be extremely easy to subsist and thrive without those foods

food,removed,i use this same recipe except no bacon and my pasta was something i had at home i added chilli flakes and butter to this also add bit more salt
food,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized

food,removed,holy shit a shill look at your post history monsanto shill im actually almost in shock still ill bite glysophate roundup is a likely carcinogen and classified as such by the world health organization the stock market value is over billion dollars beyond that monsanto whole foods and toys r us have nothing in common and im not sure why youre comparing them other than as a gimmick i know youre just taking from your list of talking points but still btw toys r us stock market value is billion and whole foods is billion and many that did not go to trial oops consumer protection and informed consumer choices my friend if you truly believe the only reason consumers should know whats in their food or where it came from is if something is harmful then i dont see how im going to reason with you here if i had it my way every ingredient on a label would also have an explanation of its source do we really need to discuss how monsanto lobbies to keep gmo labeling off shelves really look as monsanto controls more and more of the seed market farmers have less and less options you are forcing people to buy your product and deluding yourself into thinking we have a choice i still support gmos just not monsanto or other nefarious agribiochem corps
food,removed,looking at your post history does not make me a conspiracy theorist calling me that is just uninspired and something i see you calling anyone that calls you out theyve filed lawsuits since this is about eight per year or about of the farmers that use their product oops do you want to talk about how they avoid litigation partly by harassing and intimidating farmers gmo isnt an ingredient its an arbitrary label its a qualifier i would like to know how my food was modified it wont stop me from eating it i just enjoy being an informed consumer i dont buy meat if i dont know where it comes from how the animals were treated or how the meat was processed they definitely do its too bad that your response didnt provide any sort of reason gmos need to be labeledespecially considering that thousands of studies have found them to be safe without a single credible study otherwise you seem to have misunderstood what ive been saying im not antigmo i am antimonsanto i am progmolabeling i absolutely accept and embrace the benefits of genetically modified crops in doing so however we must also proceed cautiously that is what im arguing for caution in the form of public knowledge farmers pick whatever seed performs best for them and as monsanto corners the market further they have fewer and fewer choices to pick from they overwhelmingly choose gm seed because its what they have to choose to be competitive eventually you get what happened in india with cotton since ive brought this up i assume youre going to give me another talking point addressing it im just passionate about scientific literacy i am also passionate about it and i think the public can be trusted to be informed hence why products should be properly labeled you have to have a desire to be poor as fuck i dont even own a car i dont work for a biotech company i desire to have a good time while i work it seems like you enjoy responding to antigmoantimonsanto people in addition to it being your job im just curious how that works on the back end how do they measure the impact youre having does it affect your pay that kind of stuff
food,removed,you rich fucks have to stop with these cakes seriously where does it end this does not even look inviting who gets their mouth full of saliva looking at this get your shit together fam
food,removed,their entire post history is a mix of copypaste talking points and personal responses anywhere monsanto or gmos are mentioned even in subs theyve never posted or replied in they seem like a paid shill to me but i cant prove it you dont have to agree with me by the way im not mad at them for it or anything its a fact monsanto pays people to defend them online and as the famous saying goes a mans gotta eat its funny how the only people here however all have post histories that are nearly related to monsanto and gmos im not even antigmo you guys are wasting your time here
food,removed,theres lots more on her instagram mamaschimps were in vancouver and the dessert vary between dollars
food,removed,im more of a ribeye grilling kind of guy but this looks pretty tasty
food,removed,not gonna lie this made my dick twitch a little
food,removed,no it claims that they represent something a person a company etc without disclosing so which you have admitted you have no evidence to support you do not strike me as an honest person what are you basing this observation on sorry but youre sitting here accusing me of serious legal crimes to undermine my position and my statements given your insults toward me i may actually be able to prove malice a key component in libel hahah holy shit you are actually trying to make this into a legal thing i used slander as a descriptive term for your pathetic behaviour sorry you took at as a legally binding accusation my god again their post history is the proof there doesnt need to be money involved any reasonable person would come to the same conclusion about uhambrehombres account based on their post history no they wouldnt because hisher posting history shows now evidence of payment or undisclosed representation of a company something you have already admitted however since youre having such a hard time with my use of the word shill i will henceforth refer to them instead as exuberant proponent of gmos and tireless defender of monsanto instead great now youve chosen an honest expression its a shame it took so long for you to admit your use of the claim shill was completely unjustified no you are wrong i am not claiming they are committing an unlawful or otherwise harmful act by posting i am only claiming that they clearly by evidence of their post history are an exuberant proponent of gmos and tireless defender of monsanto but you used the word shill which you yourself define as that they represent something a person a company etc without disclosing so since you have been unable to demonstrate this your accusation is without evidence you should use proper words when you talk you should inform yourself about libel and slander as a legal concept i would suggest you start by not using vocabularycom for legal definitionsunderstanding in no way do my comments fit the description of libel this is an internet forum i used in the definition i provided my use of that word is in no way legally binding and i never used the word libel or defamation you attacked a users motives with no evidence and i described these actions as slanderous it is a descriptive term stop trying to distract and desperately cling to something you think you can fight about are you going to file a law suit against me for libel against someone else for the love of christ

food,removed,first off sorry but you being a professional sushi chef means fuck all well youre wrong there the taste of the meat does not change much it is the texture that gets destroyed and the meat dries out wat wait are you being serious here the taste of the meet doesnt change when its well done vs rare youre kidding me right that being said the use of mayonnaise based sauces which is common in bad california rolls adds an extremely overpowering flavor which does ruin the taste of immitation crab and rice since you cant actually taste them anymore mayonnaise based sauces are the equivalent of drowning your steak in ketchup dude no seriously no quit with your steak analogy its so off the mark first off comparing a california roll to a steak is entirely silly you want a more apt comparison how about drowning a mcdonalds hamburger in ketchup second off california rolls are literally as you know the basic introduction to sushi for the vast majority of americans it is made for the american pallet third ruining the taste of immitation crab are you kidding me here you take pride in your craft and thats fine but youre talking about mayonnaise ruining the taste of imitation crab for people who are ordering california rolls and sorry but chances are youre a sushi chef at a restaurant where the most popular foods are chicken teriyaki and tempura statistically speaking im not a sushi chef but i did work at a sushi restaurant in my younger years ive eaten sushi in japan many times at actual sushi bars not like you see in the us and my wife is korean with a father who owns a seafood company so their life literally goes around food heres some examples of how i eat just so you understand that i know what im talking about httpimgurcomammbqq so again being pretentious about fucking california rolls and comparing them to steak makes you sound silly and you could be fucking jiro himself and id say the same thing people have different palates different tastes different preferences and if you get offended due to your pride in your craft because someone orders a fucking deep fried california roll well maybe you should get a job at an authentic sushi place instead of one that caters to the average westerner

food,removed,a grilled cheese consists of only these following items cheese bread with spread usually butter this entire subreddit consist of melts almost every grilled cheese sandwich i see on here has other items added to it the fact that this subreddit is called grilledcheese is nothing short of utter blasphemy let me start out by saying i have nothing against melts i just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses adding cheese to your tuna sandwich its called a tuna melt totally different want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach i dont know what the hell youd call that but its not a grilled cheese i would be more than willing to wager ive eaten more grilled cheeses in my years than any of you had in your entire lives i have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich want to personalize your grilled cheese use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread but if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it make your own subreddit entitled melts because that is not a fucking grilled cheese im not a religious man nor am i anything close to a culinary expert but as a bland white midwestern male i am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac cheese all of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them yet again it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being shit i stopped lurking after years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this ive seen post after post of peoples grilled cheeses all over reddit and its been driving me insane the moment i saw this subreddit this morning i finally snapped hell i may even start my own subreddit just because i know this one exists now you god damn heretics respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is a melt

food,removed,why is this on the front page and the top of rfood this is literally cooked chicken a bag of frozen stirfry vegetables and a bottle of stir fry sauce yeah it tastes good but making it to the top of rfood should mean the food took skill to make and is delicious
food,removed,vegan diets will make your kids get bullied
food,removed,stir fry is delicious
food,removed,these fucking comments
food,removed,you people will literally upvote anything this is crappy vegetables and chicken in some goup
food,removed,so the ability to chop vegetables constitutes postworthy now whats the matter did you run out of cheeseburgers to photograph
food,removed,this isnt stir fry this is boiled veggies in sauce it might taste fine but nothing in that pan has been fried at all
food,removed,looks more like a stir boil or a casserole if there is that much liquid in the wok you are not frying it you are boiling it
food,removed,is how you stir fry
food,removed,im glad you are comfortable making a meal you are not fond of for your children plus i bet your stir fry is better than your chilhood memories
food,removed,wow you put vegetables in a pan total genious
food,removed,isnt this chopseuy
food,removed,looks more like a stew
food,removed,nutritients for cups calories protein carbs fat sugar fiber pumpkin mousse sugar free gluten free cups of pumpkin boiled cooked and mashed tbsp of coconut oil tsp nutmeg tbsp cinnamon tbsp maple syrup walnuts for the top instructions mash it together and mix add the mixture evenly into the bowls or mugs add walnuts and some cinnamon on top voila hey everyone pumpkin season is here in turkey too i can only find these huge light green pumpkins here there are also small and long ones but i couldnt find those little baby pumpkins for using as a bowl for mousse
food,removed,looks watery
food,removed,there are some places listed
food,removed,looks like soup to mebut dont get me wrong i love soup
food,removed,jesus the pompous comments here this is the stir fry i grew up loving and still love the vegetables are cooked through and soft the chicken was browned and then added back in after the vegetables cooked and theres a quarter inch of some soy chili and whatever else you want sauce fuck your elitist attitude and your crisp vegetable wok made stir fry this is my childhoods stir fry and its the shit
food,removed,stirfry is a very specific method of cooking it involves a very hot wok and the actually frying occurs very quickly but there can be a lot of prep that goes into it this is why your stirfry never tastes the same as those at a proper chinese restaurant
food,removed,i understand im saying that they dont know any better im sure if they did it the proper way theyd change their tune completely after tasting it
food,removed,thats definitely the vegetable stirfry mix from costco cheap and dank im surprised nobody mentioned this yet
food,removed,i love this food some body here can show me the video
food,removed,looks like germs
food,removed,stir frying actually uses much less oil than pan frying
food,removed,far too much liquid for a stirfry thats more like braised vegetables
food,removed,i can already see that i would hate this
food,removed,thanks michelle obama
food,removed,just because you have cooked it in a wok doesnt fucking make it a stir fry this sub has some of the worst most basic bullshit food on the front page
food,removed,did you use that receipt httpfreshnewsmagazinecomteriyakichickenstirfry
food,removed,nah still hate it its like all the garbage parts of the forest
food,removed,holy shit the hate in this thread is actually insane
food,removed,jesus christ this subreddit is so cancer its almost like you cant cook popular food items your own way the way you fucking like it without getting criticized dont call it stirfry if you dont do these exact things
food,removed,lol
food,removed,front page
food,removed,those shrimp look insanely overcooked and the carrots look like you sliced them up with a dull lawnmower blade but the real question is why would you even waste the time making a pork based soup and then add seafood
food,removed,judging by the darkness of the fried foods you could have easily taken a minute off of those times
food,removed,chop seuy
food,removed,this is like asian saying they love spaghetti in a can
food,removed,way to much water for my taste more boiled than fried in your case
food,removed,yes ve gan
food,removed,sorry man this is to stir fry what sriracha is to spicy sauce you need a iron wok and a high flame and less crowding of the ingredients
food,removed,looks too liquidy
food,removed,loke like tasty food love it
food,removed,more casserole than stir fry
food,removed,im no gordon ramsay but this aint stir fry is it
food,removed,its close enough to stir fry to call it stir fry lol no theres no charring
food,removed,amen brother stir fried dishes were staples in asia where i was from so when i experienced western stir fry in america i was like wtf is this shit
food,removed,im not sure thats a stir fry though a stir fry depends on sauteing vegetables and your pan is way too crowded for that unless you threw it all together at the end and fried it separately you havent browned your ingredients correctly and dont achieve the actual taste benefits you get from it when you crowd your pain you get a very different result its why actual stir frying is kind of a pain to make unless youre in a restaurant kitchen with a giant wok
food,removed,oh i must have missed the video op posted which showed him throwing everything in the pan at once how did you assume he cooked everything at oncefrom one photo of the end result
food,removed,well all those people can suck my left nut cause every döner shop i have been in was run by turks

food,removed,unlikely because i dont feel the slightest urge to take photos of the food that i make and share it online for approval
food,removed,op just one small question if youre brave enough to have eaten that are you also brave enough to take another mans phallus in mouth too
food,removed,they have better turkish food
food,removed,well automod is apparently a nazi and says using grilled cheese in the title is a no no

food,removed,i know what it is ya dingus i was pointing out that doner kebabs shawarma and gyros are essentially the same thing dressed slightly differently
food,removed,honestly this looks amazing but i see a lot of oil eek ps opinions on my weird halloween costume httpbitbinitgtahijrm
food,removed,well schnitzel is technically only the cut of the meat wiener schnitzel is said meat then battered and pan cooked
food,removed,i would suggest ratatouille its fancy it tastes great it has a long history and is vegetarian recently someone posted about it on page i think but heres a great step by step that was posted last year i think good luck
food,removed,theyre called gyros and i been working in a gyros restaurant the rest of my life
food,removed,were im from gyros meat looks like whereas döner kebab looks like httpwwwguelkebapcomwpcontentthemesglisseoimagesskdoenerjpg they are seasoned differently and the bread is different too gyros is kind of rolled up döner is for lack of a better word the sauce is different as well
food,removed,thats fair but you can read the article i link on when doner was introduced to germany and make some deductions about the likelihood of turks having doner for years and not one put it on the most commonly eaten bread there in sandwhich form especially since theyd been doing the same with other meats like sojuk for a long time there are also a lot of turkish people reading this and likely some in bursa who can verify the iskender family restaurant has pictures of him stuffing doner in pide if im lying theyd have no problem calling me out

food,removed,for me the crock pot is all about convenience i can set up a dish go to work or otherwise go about my day and then come home to an almost complete dinner after all we dont always have a good hours free to prepare a meal here is the recipe i followed for making a very flavorful roast chicken in the crock pot i used a slightly larger bird than called for and adjusted the amounts accordingly i will be editing this with a link to the mac n cheese once i post it the creamed spinach i just made very simply by draining some canned spinach and mixing it with sour cream salt and pepper before throwing it in the microwave for a few minutes slow cooker roast chicken i used an crock pot to fit a chicken ingredients whole chicken insides removed and washedpatted dry ½ tb of paprika tb all purpose seasoning such as mrs dash or archer farms house blend ½ tb garlic powder tsp salt directions start by mixing together paprika all purpose seasoning garlic powder and salt place medium sized foil balls in bottom of crockpot this will act as a stand to prevent the chicken from drying out rub seasoning over your entire chicken including the inside of the bird place on top of foil balls cover and cook on high for hours or low for hours personal preference i know its more traditional when roasting a turkey but i love the flavor so i added a couple of bay leaves under the skin while cooking
food,removed,they look amazing although i am partial to yellow corn dough and deep fried
food,removed,ive heard dropping ice into the hot oil is best since the sudden temperature drop imprisons any free radicals so they cant commit acts of terror on the free moderates in your system

food,removed,usually minced or ground meat with sometimes other things like vegetables potatoes olives raisins or they can be made with chicken meat instead of beef it can vary a lot depending on the place or person making them ops are pino a ground beef and onion mixture with lots of spices
food,removed,nope im thinking of the empenadas pastelillos that my puerto rican family makes here is a recipe theyre filled with picadillo which is a generally cuban dish here is a recipe for that as well
food,removed,my boyfriend and his roommate ate it and complained there werent more so suck my ass
food,removed,crockpot meals are a must in my household it allows us to leave the house to do other things while the food is cooking mind you it does take a few hours for the food to be ready but it is perfect for meal prepping i normally do some chicken breast with cream of mushroom soup or a pork loin tonight we are having cabbage with smoked sausage and it is delicious
food,removed,puerto rican here and the hell im eating those nasty raisins or chickpeas in my pasteles mi abuela se mata antes de hacer o comerse una cosa asi
food,removed,the food looks pretty tasty but man your photography skills could use improvement dont use flash when youre taking pictures of food spent seconds plating get rid of that water under the beans wipe down the portion of the plate in the upper left take the fork off the plate center the plate and get the whole plate in the picture and take the picture from directly above

food,removed,i couldnt find it in the old rules so i thought id being it to you guys attention in the new rules section and ive never been automodded here before i read the list ingredients not a backstory rule but i see backstory here all the time so i dont know if it is a new rule or not

food,removed,thats nearly identical to the chicken piccata recipe i make simply substitute the lime for lemon omit the honey and cilantro and add capers to something like i make so make the lime and cilantro chicken one week and the piccata the next week same method of cooking and two different dishes cheers
food,removed,this was the design i came up with lol
food,removed,this is very much inspired from gordon ramsay there isnt a mexican restaurant within of where i live and there doesnt seem to exist a single other brand of tortilla chips sold in stores except for tostitos so this is a quick and easy way to change it up and tastes better than tostitos i think
food,removed,google calendar

food,removed,attention we have spotted the vegan
food,removed,this is a court order it says you cant eat shit anymore
food,removed,the steak looks like rubber
food,removed,scallops looks very well done
food,removed,those scallops are fucked haha pan way too hot and cooked way too long mushrooms are soggy and shrivelly and cold looking but hey whatever i cooked a pot of chili and have been eating it for days
food,removed,velcome to ze cuttings bord vere i vill show you how to cook ze foods in ze nude and vere i vill puts ze food up my anus
food,removed,what point like you ate it on a place called a point or was someone scoring it im confused
food,removed,scallops are horrible burned what are you talking about
food,removed,so why is op allowed to express his personal opinion but the rest of us cant
food,removed,judging from your comments and how you prepared everything you need to experiment more too many questionable cooking methods and waaaaay off in the portion control its like youre trying but not executing well
food,removed,you fucking charred them how are you comma argue when you admitted you have never even had scallops before they shouldnt look brown and crispy on the outside thats wrong
food,removed,helps the steak rest wtf are you talking about to rest a steak pout in on a plate or a tray and cover with aluminum foil thats it a cutting board brings nothing to the table in all honesty the wood probably soaks up the juices which is a bad thing
food,removed,cooked food is not going to breed bacteria unless you leave it out overnight you might as well say using a cutting board to cut breeds bacteria you are soo very wrong
food,removed,hes downvoted because hes acting douche my and saying the follows heston belimwnrheywhatevers perfect steak proved by science and hes clueless you dont rest a steak in an oven of degrees just stupid
food,removed,no wonder you messed the steak up youre a dirty lefty
food,removed,so the steak is definitely overcooked the scallops look too browned and the potato doesnt even look fully cooked the caesar salad is literally just parm cheese welcome to the olive garden
food,removed,overcooked scallops and the whole thing looks dry as fuck how about next time you focus more on how it tastes instead of how much bs karma you can accumulate from reddit
food,removed,you should have a channel called dont fuck up the steak where every week you cook the steak for less than two minutes on each side and every week you apologise to that steak
food,removed,
food,removed,confession i overcooked the steak mods can we get a permaban
food,removed,the whole serving shit on a cutting board is tired everthing wouldnt fit on one plate why the fuck would you want a chilled salad and a hot potato on the same plate to begin with have fun with salad going everywhere since you dont have edges did you flip the scallops or just overcook them on one side scallops pair well with root beer i hear
food,removed,steak looks great to me i bet theres no pink in there at all
food,removed,actually you overcooked the scallops too a good golden brown sear is nice but those look over to me hot pan secs per side max
food,removed,those scallops are for sure not on point they must have the consistency of old tires looking like that
food,removed,you could still see the marks where the jockey was hitting it
food,removed,did you cook a lot of scallops at cracker barrel
food,removed,donkey
food,removed,plates have been readily available and quite cheap for some time now i suggest you look into it you insufferable jackass
food,removed,the only way to cook steak is rare overlord pepe would approve
food,removed,looks like you overdone the scallops aswell tbh
food,removed,scallops are overcooked too
food,removed,steak is the worst meat
food,removed,you ruined it
food,removed,youre steak not only looks overcooked but it looks like the fat isnt rendered properly you scallops look just a bit over if not cooked too much on one side the bacon on the potato doesnt look very appetising although that could just be the fact that its a picture and not in front of me lastly are you in woodland elementary school or a chef for a hipster prison thats all i could think of as to why you put all your food on one plate including a large salad dont even get me started with the bacteria and your cutting board as an eating surface very instagrammy photo though
food,removed,salad on a cutting board jesus fucking christ
food,removed,it still looks delicious tho foodislyfe
food,removed,did you get some
food,removed,
food,removed,so a guy takes a picture of a burnt steak and it ranks to the first page how obese does a person have to be to vote up a burnt piece of meat

food,removed,steps and are together
food,removed,heres the nbsp if i actually fried enough to make the effort worthwhile i would try to make these although i admit that id probably give in to the temptation to use premade biscuit dough when doing so
food,removed,no i havent but you can tell when something is cooked in a tandoor vs not store bought stuff will never have the right char or texture and naan cooked in any other method doesnt either not saying there arent places out there that might do thatprobably wont be open too long but to say its rare to have a tandoor is misleading
food,removed,maryland is super area specific for any kind of international cuisine though when i was there there was only one good indian place near me a billion afghan places and no ethiopian food i went south a bit to silver spring and suddenly a billion ethiopian places but i had to drive a bit for legit pakistani food and frankly the indian food i had there was only good because it was what we had most other states ive lived in have much better options
food,removed,i heard that in the wild when we taste something bitter it usualy means it´s poisonous so our brain probably tells us brussel sprouts are poisenous and we should not eat that
food,removed,when broiling leave the oven door open a crack thats why theres a stop a few inches from closed think of broiling as grilling except with the heat source reversed to the top

food,removed,i love them boiled till soft steamed fried roasted blackened etc etc etc its not the preparation that is the problem for most people but genetics some people possess a gene that makes them taste bad some people do not

food,removed,sausage gravy is a traditional southern breakfast dish in the united states after loose pork sausage is cooked in a pan and removed a roux is formed by browning flour in the residual fat milk and seasonings such as salt and pepper are added to create a moderately thick gravy to which the cooked sausage is added

food,removed,agreed if you dont like the oily greasy aftertaste youre not going to like it very much i like cheese pizza i like sliced chorizo but they dont mix so well together for me chistorra which is little red chorizo sausages is delicious because it lets the oil stay in the dish when you fork it but you still need some dry baguette bread to cope

food,removed,why so you barely get enough pepperoni toppings and have to use a microscope to see the cheese this pizza is a belowaverage mess not enough toppings to cover the whole pie not enough gooey cheese way too overboard on the bread its just a loaf of fucking bread sauce overload you can see the sauce bursting through the cheesegross

food,removed,op you dont even realise how crazy your pizza is not only did your pizza provider gift you an adventure in taste they created an abstract artwork guaranteeing their faith in you enjoying their masterpiece look at the remarkable scene that had laid before you in medley of toppings both familiar and foreign a couple the husband outlined in orange and the wife outlined in blue watch with warmhearted expressions as their customer walks away with his pizza the man carrying his prize in a pizza box wears black suit pants and a bold white belt with more neutral colors above the waist his muted pink shirt and a worn strawhat my experience from being halfawake and halfpresent to an art class my freshman year of college makes me feel comfortable in making conclusions about the artistic direction of your pizza the couple a cartoonish depiction of the actual owners of the pizza joint know beyond a shadow of a doubt that the pizza they gave to their customer was perfectly crafted for their customer every pizza your pizza joint bakes is made with the love of owners and with finely tuned taste analyses based on character assumptions based on what you the customer are wearing in the piece the people at the store made a few assumptions about you first the black pants and white belt both of the colors draw attention because of the stark contrast between themselves and the more vibrantly colored portions of the pie they indicate that half of you is extremely straitlaced you like things to be by the book and you keep your nose clean trouble tends to far from what youre looking for but not always when youre outside of work youre a pretty chill dude or dudette the straw hat says you know what lifes great since i got this straw hat people that wear straw hats are genetically more likely to seek out adventure because of their outlook on life the manner in which you ordered your food told your freudmeetsfieri chef that you wanted a pizza that could push the boundaries of how people define pizza but didnt stray away from the core concepts of pizza or its papa johns

food,removed,httpwwwajwasweetscomcategorysimpleeasyrecipeschickenrecipiesbakedchickenrecipes is way better or theres a little place on royal st called cafe b thats good as well
food,removed,httpwwwajwasweetscomcategorysimpleeasyrecipeschickenrecipiesbakedchickenrecipes some tips that arent included in the recipe that help make killer cheesecakes are wrap the springform pan with extra wide tin foil use a water bath they way i do it is use a large roasting pan that the wrapped pan fits into and add in enough boiling water that the water goes up on the side of the tinfoil wrapped springform pan when done baking absolutely do not take the cheesecake out of the oven immediately the rapid temperature change can cause large cracks in the top of the cake to prevent this turn the oven off and crack the oven open about an inch and let the cake cool for an hour in the oven before you take it out once out of the oven let it cool to room temperature cover in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least hours so it chills properly hope that i was able to help you make a great cheesecake any questions feel free to pm me anytime httpwwwghirardellicomrecipeswhitechocolateraspberrycheesecake

food,removed,first off dont take this so seriously i think thats why youre getting downvoted not because of your opinion but because you come off like a pta mom hosting a year old boys slumber party in any case papa johns has been a long hated company by most of reddit mostly because of the companys practices towards employees theyre not the friendliest and the fact that the owner is an alcoholic asshole there are actually lots of stories about the guy floating around in raskreddit if you go digging for them so in my experience the hatred has little to do with the quality of the food thats not to say that the food is actually any good its not its just as shitty as the rest but reddit has done a pretty good job of exaggerating how terrible it actually is because of that personally im a donatos man and im sure there are just as many people who hate them p
food,removed,i seriously wasnt expecting this thanks for all the great feedback this dish was so easy to make and i was genuinely surprised at how tasty it turned out im really sorry for the delay i just woke up but heres the recipe for the beef i used about rump steak sliced popped them in a large bowl with cup of corn flour corn starch and mixed through well with a pinch of salt until all of the meat was covered and felt dry i fried these in organic wild coconut oil enough to submerge half of the meat in until they looked crisp only about minutes in total both sides or maybe less sorry i was too busy dodging the oil spits from the pan please be careful to fully measure the time it wasnt long oh and i let the pan get super hot prior to dropping these in and i did them in batches i heard that the secret to these types of dishes is to let the pan get really hot so i guess it was worth it in the end the sauce good god the sauce was so fucking simple but amazing cup cold water cup soy sauce cup sugar i used raw brown sugar put that aside for now it might not seem like a lot of sauce but it sufficiently covered all of the meat next i cut up cloves of garlic and about a teaspoon of ginger dicing them finely cleaning the pan i used previously i put in some more coconut oil and once hot i browned the garlic and ginger slightly then i mixed through the meat poured the sauce over it mixed it well turned down the heat and then let it simmer for a bit i also felt like a kick so i added in some chilli powder about a teaspoon roughly sliced spring onions and mixed them through letting the heat soften them served on white rice sorry guys i suck with typing up recipes but i hope if you try it you enjoy it

food,removed,so do cats my cat rumpleteazer got ahold of a squirrel carcass that had been laying in the road for about a week he didnt kill it or anything it died of natural causes hit by schoolbus unfortunately for him theres a rule in my house about eating roadkill been in place since six thanksgivings ago which was the last time we let my grandmother cook dinner rumpleteazer may have gotten away with it if not for the fact he momentarily abandoned the carcass to retrieve his favorite personal lubricant from my nanas boudoir you see rumpleteazer sometimes likes to play with his food before eating it and by play i mean he likes to fuck it first claims it tenderizes the meat apparently he saw an episode of bizarre foods where andrew zimmern encountered a rather primitive tribe of quasihumans living near the shore of new jersey that did the same thing to their meat and also to each other ive not been able to locate this episode but i did assure rumpleteazer that we were far more civilized than most everything in new jersey meaning we dont stick our dicks in anything that doesnt have a pulse

food,removed,resposting this because i think im not allowed to mention my blogwhich includes the link to the recipe i had a dragonfruit and i couldnt really think of anything to do with it either so i decided to default to macarons i ended up making a dragonfruit curd for the fillingit was an interesting taste slightly heavy on lemon i think incorporating some other tropical fruits might be super tasty but for the recipe i used mariozeatsblog spot i only have the pomegranate macaron recipe up instead of using half a pomegranate use half a dragonfruit
food,removed,check out mariozeatsblog spot replace the pomegranate half with the dragonfruit half

food,removed,this is the best time of year for those my favorite recipe is from david chang in his momofuku cookbook here is a version of that recipe ive made these several times and everyone raves about them
food,removed,full stepbystep instructions pretty basic recipe using a store bought fresh made dough until it roughly resembles concrete mix in the form of a cast iron pan preheat cast iron pan on stove until its smoking flour bottom of the pan lightly not flour burning instantly press your dough into the pan only burning your fingers slightly let it cook in the pan until the dough starts to bubble pop any really large ones lightly brush with olive oil using a silicon brush sprinkle a bit of salt and pepper over the oil add store bought mozzarella from a plastic bag open your can of pineapple chunks take a quick peek around kitchen to make sure noone else is present drink the pineapple juice from the can then spread remaining chunks over pizza search all over for the tiny container of sliced red onion that you just saw minutes ago when you find it spread some onion over the pizza put the whole thing in the oven and marvel that it doesnt explode eat remaining pizza sauce directly from the can when it looks like the picture does take it out of the oven and return it to stovetop put a small dollop of honey into a tiny bowl add a healthy splash of srirachi sauce mix with silicon brush and sample realize the brush didnt mix it at all and then mix it with a spoon like a big boy brush the crust with honey srirachi let the pizza cool before you try to slice it up perfect time for image uploads and posting to reddit

food,removed,momos
food,removed,now im just afraid to even type anything because this sub now apparently requires some sort of iso compliance to even post anymore at this point it just feels anticlimatic but anyhow using a store bought fresh made dough until it roughly resembles concrete mix in the form of a cast iron pan preheat cast iron pan on stove until its smoking flour bottom of the pan lightly not flour burning instantly press your dough into the pan only burning your fingers slightly let it cook in the pan until the dough starts to bubble pop any really large ones lightly brush with olive oil using a silicon brush sprinkle a bit of salt and pepper over the oil add store bought mozzarella from a plastic bag open your can of pineapple chunks take a quick peek around kitchen to make sure noone else is present drink the pineapple juice from the can then spread remaining chunks over pizza search all over for the tiny container of sliced red onion that you just saw minutes ago when you find it spread some onion over the pizza put the whole thing in the oven and marvel that it doesnt explode eat remaining pizza sauce directly from the can when it looks like the picture does take it out of the oven and return it to stovetop put a small dollop of honey into a tiny bowl add a healthy splash of srirachi sauce mix with silicon brush and sample realize the brush didnt mix it at all and then mix it with a spoon like a big boy brush the crust with honey srirachi let the pizza cool before you try to slice it up perfect time for image uploads and posting to reddit have your post continuously rejected by automod for rather pithy reasons take one last time to attempt to post in conformance with their requirements before just unsubbing and moving on to rcooking instead
food,removed,hm ive heard that term as well but ive mostly seenheard people equating xiao long bao with shanghai soup dumplings i always kind of thought that what you call it might depend on where youre from but i could definitely be wrong about that
food,removed,i actually asked a question about the and this looks absolutely delicious
food,removed,should have went to the httpsenwikipediaorgwikinanxiangsteamedbunrestaurant
food,removed,use your chopsticks to gently place the dumpling in the large spoon they give you and then use your chopsticks to hold the top steady while you bite the top off to release the steam inside at this point i usually put some of the hot chili oil they give you into the hole many people also add the black vinegar too but im not a big fan of that after letting it cool down for a few seconds plop the whole thing into your mouth personally im not a fan of the suck the broth out first method as i think they kind of defeats the point of ordering soup dumplings where you get all the flavors and textures at the same time
food,removed,okay that sounds amazing i was about to be like can i just get a steak and a bread roll lol
food,removed,sorry to hear that no youre not you are free to unsub and not comment at all if you feel so disgusted intruded upon and outraged i voiced a behavior that i find despicable in response to you contacting me i did not contact you this is your way of not not having an argument for the intrusive and unreasonable behavior not shocking do you know why there isnt one like i said you should find shame but here we are
food,removed,i mean you made a pastry dough rectangle with fruit filling and icing using almost the exact same ingredients save some minor differences due to industrial cooking substances you made the same thing those are the facts then you take the same tactic most stubborn redditors take when theyre too entitled and spoiled to admit when theyre factually wrong by calling the factually supported arguments trolling constructing a strawman by trying to make some loopy nonsense points as if theyre they same the basketball thing comparing the facts to something ridiculous like global warming im not going to hunt you down in real life pointing out to people that you got something wrong on an anonymous internet forum its okay to admit youre wrong on the internet its good practice to overcome this stubbornness you have when youre wrong

food,removed,testinghttpswwwredditcom
food,removed,yes i am aware or how else would i have made the argument against it you have got nothing you have no defense you are the bad actor and cower on every chance to justify it you cannot because it cannot be justified at least it is here for every one to see that your responses show no shame and offer no explanation
food,removed,httpswwwredditcom
food,removed,youre really fucking stupid
food,removed,theres food in this pic i thought you said ethiopian
food,removed,again sorry if you feel bad for wanting to call people names and not being allowed to transparent everyone knows it i can not imagine such a horrible disgusting world to live in where you do not get to call people names it is horrible who do we trust to censor this you are obviously not one who can articulate a justification so it goes to say you are not capable of policing this you have had multiple chances in this exchange to defend the act but all you can do is respond with dismissive sarcasm and then misrepresent my entire position the irony to your misrepresentation is that neither of us called each other names great example of why you cannot censor speech every response you give just digs you in a whole of demonstrating to every reader that you have a indefensible position i write this for them not you because there is no changing you the thought that someone can even defend censoring speech makes me nauseous thank goodness you dont have the courage too propose a defense this was settled hundreds of years ago

food,removed,as a californian who now lives in ct a lot of it has to do with jealousy i find innout and fg burgers are somewhat similar in taste fg bring a bit greasier but one is and one is so that settles a lot of the argument for me the fries ive had better fries than innout but i think fg fries taste like burnt garbage but a lot of people really like them so eh bottom line if the taste is comparable but one is literally twice the price there is no comparison in my opinion
food,removed,this looks amazing probably very good as well
food,removed,well you can go snuffle your pusdy then
food,removed,thats disgusting plus so many animals died for that shit

food,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized

food,removed,you know nothing about me youre right naturally occurring msg is completely different from the reproduced stuff also msg is a very simple compound the compound itself is pretty much indistinguishable whether from soy sauce or an industrially synthesizedextracted powder similar to how industrially produced salt is indistinguishable except by purity to naturally occuring salt in foods ultimately its just nacl for further reference this is what looks like this is what looks like this is what looks like msg is simply a glutamic acid bonded to a sodium atom in water that bond dissolves and what youre left with is glutamate in the presence of water the glutamate transforms to glutamic acid and back by borrowing a hydrogen from water lglutamic acid is the amino acid component of msg and has a long history of use in foods as a flavor enhancer it is added either as the purified monosodium salt or as a component of a mix of amino acids and small peptides resulting from the acid or enzymatic hydrolysis of proteins this amino acid is a major constituent of food proteins in some foods comprising of the total amino acid content a pivotal metabolic intermediate in amino acid metabolism and a major energy source for cardiac myocytes regardless of dietary source protein protein hydrolysates or salts of free glutamic acid including the monosodium salt msg all glutamate molecules entering the circulation from the gastrointestinal tract are structurally identical i know shes allergic ive seen her reaction to it science isnt perfect to date it has not been able to establish any such sensitivity with any level of consistency its possible that your mother suffers from a physiologically based sensitivity based on the current studies into the matter however it is more likely that the basis of her sensitivity is psychological as opposed to physiological as i mentioned above even if the sensitivity is of a psychological nature that doesnt mean that its a weak effect the nocebo effect is a very strong and real effect its clearly an unpleasant effect and so i mentioned a possible way to address it i just thought it was cool to share i dont mean to diagnose or treat your like an md i meant to share cool knowledge it wasnt received in that way and i apologize if it came off in any other way and dont say thats a psychological sensitivity because ive had a food challenge for that one i never tried to insinuate that allergies in general were only just psychological

food,removed,so im going to be honest and represent good taste im sure it was a delicious dessert but it looks like an eightyear old did the plating or a christmas tree shat out a delightful lump you gotta remember when youre plating that people will actually be eating the food this crap is filled with a core that people will have to wrestle with cut around making a fucking mess on a plate gaudy and impractical unless your aesthetic came out of ihop

food,removed,steak isnt an xtreme enough food for them they only eat xtreme food that fits their and fragile sense of masculinity as regards cooking as vice put it its also interest seeing how the neverflagging trend of recontextualizing fast food is interchangeable with just piling one junk food on top of another there are two basic ideas of recontextualizing food here what their parents made but bigger and what they can get in a fast food place but more gross

food,removed,except its not its not the best cheese at all provolone is nothing but the cheese haters cheese theres no enthusiasm there no passion provolone is what children ask for when they dont know what to get so the round one is fine as someone with years of experience in the cheese industry i find it frankly insulting that you would think provolone is the best cheese this exeprience uniquely qualifies my to maliciously attack you for your cheese preference the only way i could figure that you would like provolone more than say mozzarella or gouda is that you were a child when you aquired your taste for it and have only regressed into this childlike state for a cheese which frankly sucks i feel sorry for you and anyone you come in contact with may god have mercy on your provolone loving soul

food,removed,send me one wextra meat no mayo a side of fries a lemonade
food,removed,yes funny cause im in philly right now
food,removed,not an armchair demand but a trick i like to do that maybe youd like put everything into a bit of a pile that looks more or less like it should fit throw the cheese on it or mix it doesnt matter its the pile that matters then shove your cut roll spread wide on top be careful to keep that crease in tact or dont fuck it the magic happens with the big flat spatula place that sucker under and flip into some tin parchment wrap it up tight parchment at an angle and use the paper to stuff the food in there idgaf if you want to eat it right away wrap it and let it sit for at least a minute what will result is a glorious cheesesteak that will remind you of the street version change whatever you want but the spatula love and the wrap are what really make it something special added bonus is its portable
food,removed,op you are asking for a shitstorm calling this acheesesteak to the front page because people love to upvote bullshit
food,removed,looks like a breadsteak
food,removed,pepper steak
food,removed,i just knew the moment someone posted a picture of a cheesesteak that thered be something wrong with it a perfect cheesesteak is an unsolvable puzzle
food,removed,you need more steak on that roll my friend
food,removed,wheres the pounds of cheese nonsense
food,removed,bell peppers no long hots andor sweet peps yes
food,removed,in order to do it properly follow these steps get fresh baguette type bread preferably the ones that arent fully cooked and come in just a plastic sheath i know kroger and safeway sell them by the bakery turn oven to melt teaspoon of butter and brush all over the bread bake for minutes cook white onions and banana pepper rings first make sure the onions are sliced thin and use a small dab of vegetable oil after onions and peppers are sweatinfand becoming transparent add steak for minutes cook until medium pull bread out of oven cut in half and add mayo and spicy brown mustard on either side put filling and top with provolone cheese and bake additional minutes broil for minute pull it out and fold it over and go f nuts serve with a side of marinara if need be

food,removed,you mean you made garlic bread jks aside you gotta make sure the beef is flowing out of the bread so that each bite is dominated by the beef and complimented by the bread
food,removed,an amoroso roll is what makes the philly cheesesteak
food,removed,if theres one thing you can be certain of its that philadelphians are haters even if you make a mean philly cheesesteak well shit on youits kind of our schtick hopefully op you take everything they say with a grain of salt and remember we booed santa claus and destroyed that hitch hiking robot

food,removed,so cheesesteaks are real things i always thought it was just a cheese and steak meal charlie ate
food,removed,good looking cheesesteak source i am from philly
food,removed,a grilled cheese consists of only these following items cheese bread with spread usually butter this entire subreddit consist of melts almost every grilled cheese sandwich i see on here has other items added to it the fact that this subreddit is called grilledcheese is nothing short of utter blasphemy let me start out by saying i have nothing against melts i just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses adding cheese to your tuna sandwich its called a tuna melt totally different want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach i dont know what the hell youd call that but its not a grilled cheese i would be more than willing to wager ive eaten more grilled cheeses in my years than any of you had in your entire lives i have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich want to personalize your grilled cheese use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread but if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it make your own subreddit entitled melts because that is not a fucking grilled cheese im not a religious man nor am i anything close to a culinary expert but as a bland white midwestern male i am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac cheese all of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them yet again it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being shit i stopped lurking after years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this ive seen post after post of peoples grilled cheeses all over reddit and its been driving me insane the moment i saw this subreddit this morning i finally snapped hell i may even start my own subreddit just because i know this one exists now you god damn heretics respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is a melt

food,removed,i hope thats american cheese i see not mayo
food,removed,wheres the meat jk but actually
food,removed,cosmis or gooey looies are my goto spots in the city order it how you want i like mine with a lot of cheese sharp white cheddar and packed with meat add salt pepper ketchup sometimes mayo not a fan of wiz or provolone i can deal with american if i have to dont buy into the hype of the real not real cheese steak noise as long as the steak is good quality and cooked right and you have a good roll itll be good the whole simplified ordering of wiz wit or wiz wit out was just marketing to speed up of placing filling orders not so many options your customizing each cheesesteak enough to slow down the process just a handful of core options and an ordering process place your order pay move to the next window next repeat i grew up in philly still live in philly and eat cheesesteaks semidaily
food,removed,no
food,removed,looks like shit give it to me so you dont have to suffer through it
food,removed,it is because people dont always agree with you
food,removed,im assuming you mean celsius which means youre going for medium rare which is about fahrenheit
food,removed,its considered a crime in philly to put green peppers on your cheesesteak op must be from oh
food,removed,chalk it up as a loss and road trip it to philly and stop by dalessandros then youll have something to base your nirvana off of
food,removed,maybe this is an american thing here its generally understood that if you close at the shift doesnt end until at least an hour after that for cleaning and cashing up etc in my teens i worked in a fair few restaurants and as long as the customer understood that we were closing soon and they had to be fairly quick to eat then it was no problem we would often have people finishing up as we began to clear tables around them
food,removed,atlantic city bread almost as renowned as its casinos
food,removed,youre wrong this doesnt apply to quality restaurants if youre open youre open usually a restaurant will close the kitchen and stop taking food orders a certain time before closing
food,removed,you are funny you americans in france you can buy this type of bread and meat everywhere even if we dont mass produce them every town of people will have his baxkery and the meat is way more tasty than your tasteless disgusting meat produced in giant farms where degenerated cows eat chemicals all day but its the same even when the food isnt french our coffee same as italian coffee you on the other end are weird drinking tasteless watered down coffee just strange
food,removed,try working in a restaurant and then tell us how you feel
food,removed,are you proud
food,removed,i have worked in many restaurants and reservations are made by only around of the customers have you ever actually worked in one of these restaurants and for your information restaurants are not stores its a very different kind of establishment with very different etiquette you clearly dont know much about this subject from what youve been saying
food,removed,肉夹馍🥙
food,removed,the problem is that there is a lot of stuff you have to do after closing that takes quite a bit of time its not that any server is upset that they are having to work while at work theyre upset that they have to continue working for one table past close when they could have everything done while waiting on the few stragglers and be able to walk out shortly after closing kitchen staff has to clean a whole ton of stuff and it sucks having to go back and reclean a grill because some dude walked in minutes prior to closing because he wanted a burger
food,removed,bunch of fucking complainers get off my lawn
food,removed,you dont put fuckn mayonnaise on a fuckn philly
food,removed,i thought i was in rgrilledcheese for a moment and got genuinely worried about the comments after what ive seen when someone puts something not cheesey into a grilled cheese
food,removed,its different though youre assuming that people would stay long after a place closes a food place to be exact and not a store people often dont stay long when a place is closing plus if people are going minutes before a place closes going by the example op is giving then it shouldnt be a problem for people to go in and get food however youre cutting it close by saying minutes before no one in the right mind would go when its that close to closing unless you dont give a shit and no employee would let people in minutes before theyre about to close either
food,removed,lol yeah because if you dont buy anything by then maybe they shouldnt be able to buy anything if its that much of a big deal they can shut off the registers at or you can still sell them what they need because your company needs it and it shows good customer service remember not everyone coming in before close is out to get you or just doesent care some people have really restricted schedules and may even feel bad
food,removed,lol we close at and you came at so even though im getting paid and were still open you are being disrespectful how dare you make me do my job wah
food,removed,you guys dont know jack about wicked awesome steak grinders
food,removed,looks like oprah winfreys cooch

food,removed,looks like balls mixed with ass
food,removed,oh the can of worms im about to open alrighty ahem best cheesesteak recipe havent had a proper one before and the knockoffs have been okish enough to drive me towards getting the right thing
food,removed,chef captain here if you put some nice seasoning in a thick piece of steak and leave it rest for some time then you cook it whole and after that you slice it really thin and put it in your sandwich it gives a great texture and stays juicy other option is to make a stew but low temperature for a few hours with big pieces of meat after hours youll see the meat will break the fiber itself and will melt in your mouth the rest of ingredients are only defined by your imagination flies away
food,removed,id like to see one of these prepared with kobe beef lol
food,removed,i would cut it in half and dip it in thousand island
food,removed,i never understood this either especially when i worked at a restaurant that closed at in the winter we gotta be here til because of a late table big deal if you worked anywhere else youd never get home before midnight
food,removed,just had one for the first time ever last week mind you it was a one but it was still magical
food,removed,eat a salad youll feel better afterwards
food,removed,need more meat looks good though
food,removed,im not saying is right to go in or until closing but its really not up to me or the waiters or the kitchen staff or a bunch of random people on reddit its up to the owner if they say doors are open until on the sign i get the impression they want customers to be seated until you can blame a customer but this is on the employeer dont hate the player hate the game
food,removed,meat looks like the last guy in a train
food,removed,slow news day on reddit this is like joey boots on cnn right before george michael died this guy sauteed peppers onions and mushrooms threw on some minute steaks melted cheese and put it all it on a grocery store roll hurumph
food,removed,came here too late before all the comments saying this isnt a real cheese steak let the man eat
food,removed,people need to start adding their recipes as the top comment
food,removed,yes it is its just juice thats had its water removed to preserve freshness and then added again before shipping so it fills out and doesnt taste like complete ass
food,removed,very nice but i would like to see inside
food,removed,you work a minimum wage job everyone has to go through that in life before starting a career those that whine at work and complain when they have to do their job dont get much farther than that btw you contradicted yourself dont you think your time is more valuable than theirs since you know youre not doing your job complaining and being entitled you want a better job than mcdonalds than work hard and show your effort is worth it attitude is everything and you being a little baby about doing your job on the clock isnt going to get you far
food,removed,the owner is a seriously horrible person fuck this place
food,removed,yeah like french fries right
food,removed,fkng white people lol
food,removed,its this as described warm smoked salmon

food,removed,draws out moisture while this is technically correct your view of the results is not accurate the first reason is that you actually want to draw out moisture from the outside of the steak to get a good crust the httpsenwikipediaorgwikimaillardreaction better known as browning only happens when theres no water so the longer it takes to evaporate the moisture on the outside of the steak the longer it will be before your steak gets a flavorful crust even in a very hot pan thus it is preferable for the salt to draw the moisture on the outer layers of steak out so it can evaporate before you go to brown it it will end up increasing the flavor the second reason presalting is good is that while it does draw out some moisture before you cook it it actually allows the steak to retain moisture while its cooking leading to a net benefit essentially meat is made of cells when you cook unsalted meat more water comes out than if you had salted it for a clear example of the difference between water and juiciness boil a steak for a couple hours in a bunch of water i promise when you take that thing out even will all that water around it will be as dry and unpleasant to eat as a hockey puck rubbing salt on the outside of the steak a little while before searing will only help the perceived juiciness and flavor of a steak not hurt it

food,removed,mmmm delicious composition who the fuck oh a vegan
food,removed,i see too much white that means that you used or cream or too many albumen seeing its too liquid id say number one anyway so thats not a carbonara
food,removed,but then hell argue that you have to work to earn the money to buy the bread and the gas to get to the store too and the car payments and the taxes for the road and your house and the dish its served in and the table its served on and the food before that which allowed you to even be alive in the first place then off course you gotta factor in the hospital bills from when you were born carry the quick and easy pfft
food,removed,youve picked a very important cause to get so riled up about
food,removed,why the paper

food,removed,came also to inform thats rare
food,removed,mediumraw
food,removed,that doesnt look medium rare at all at the top looks just flat out rare which is how i like my steak good job
food,removed,not medium rare
food,removed,why is there crumpled paper underneath it all im so confused
food,removed,hey man this looks dank as fuck and even though this is less than med rare to me everyone is saying that and denying the dankness of this dish rfood always gets its panties twisted over steak and the rustled jimmies only speak for the dankness well done i dont see why everyone is so compelled to post just about the temperature like it nullifies the dish as a whole and why they think they need to be the person to say something
food,removed,good thing the we have that law about showing where our meat comes from oh wait
food,removed,yea thats definitely fucking blue

food,removed,its fucking raww
food,removed,get back to me when youre not just a student
food,removed,all i know is that it tastes like burning soap
food,removed,definitely cooked rare however the garlic was just for garnish for the dankness
food,removed,definitely cooked rare however the garlic becomes golden brown and delicious looking
food,removed,theres all this talk of the rareness which is definitely rarer than medium rare but peoplethere ispaperunderneaththe food why would anyone do this
food,removed,looks bloody rare to me
food,removed,lol this is proof that people in this sub will upvote anything that steak is mooing and you have paper under a sticky food mashed potatoes op cook your steak longer in a cooler pan and never put sticky foods on paper also dont plate hot foods on top of greens or other cold food also slice or smush your roasted garlic so it isnt one giant chunk on the plus side it looks like the texture of your potatoes is good and your radishes are sliced nicely
food,removed,medium rare is usually a lot rarer than people think the uninitiated order medium rare because its what they hear is the go to for steak and are often shocked by how rare it is the inside is warmed but not hot barely cooked inside at all
food,removed,it is so raw it stil got the fur on it medium rare is pink inside
food,removed,just me confused why its served on paper
food,removed,why do you think thats medium rare
food,removed,is it salad
food,removed,a disgusting aberration on life
food,removed,that steak is not mediumrare thats rare that said i like rare and that all looks bomb as fuck
food,removed,why using rusty plate
food,removed,everything else apart from the creamy cheddar garlic mash is shit stop putting food under the meat fuckfisngosigjnslikgnslrfkjgn sljgnsljgnsljgnsljgksw
food,removed,thats not medium rare or even rare its whats called blue source used to be a cook for years and cooked steaks at several of the restaurants i worked at
food,removed,the steak looks like it was taken out of the fridge a good twenty mins before cooking you have to over cook the outside for the centre to be raremedium rare you should always let it come up to room temp before cooking source i love steak
food,removed,ops in this sub never stick around once they realize theyve fucked up
food,removed,im not saying you were trying to be rude just that it seems that you didnt distill my post first paragraph answers what sazón means ie just any seasoning mix and how there are many seasoning mixes in supermarkets made mostly of herbsspices ie no we dont have your sazón as a product in supermarkets only then i digressed p i live in madrid but visit la mancha regularly id recommend parque natural del alto tajo if you like the outdoors its in the middle of nowhere and has great hiking routes and clean rivers about northern spain i love western asturias and galicia though wheather can be a bitch even in summer id recommend luarca beautiful nature and fishing villages nearby plus many landmarks to visit

food,removed,fact pigs are smarter than dogs chimpanzees and year old humans your reaction to fact downvote
food,removed,ramadan mubarak
food,removed,pigs are anatomically very similar to humans their organs are in the same orientation to our own their skin is the same as ours and surprise surprise they taste like us too so when you say you like the taste of pork what youre saying is you like the taste of human also its not the pork that tastes good its the plant oil and plant seasoning combined with smoke that make up most of the pleasant flavour boil ham dont season it with plant oils and herbs and tell me how good it tastes
food,removed,are you the same guy that butchered a pig a while ago and posted it on reddit no idea how long ago it was
food,removed,you kill enough as it is
food,removed,i never said to do anything just presented a fact
food,removed,its not necessary there are cruelty and violence free meat substitutes that are tasty just look up the beast burger from beyond meat
food,removed,this isnt sustainable free range uses far more resources than the efficiency of factory farming
food,removed,your idea of veganism is strange i can understand you were against the suffering of factory farms which is great but a main concept in veganism is that its unnecessary to eat animals so doing so is unethical because it causes unnecessary suffering another pain concept would be the act of slaughter itself is inherently cruel and violent so unethical im not sure how id label you but its hard to say you were a vegan when you missed those concepts
food,removed,its probably more respectful and honorable to not slaughter and eat the animal unnecessarily at all
food,removed,this isnt sustainable for the environment free range uses far more resources than the efficiency of factory farming

food,removed,youve gotta see the charcuterie post he made about a year ago
food,removed,hmm what industry already exists that provides the meaty texture and flavor without the ethical environmental or health concerns of the meat industry any guesses ufoxicwaste
food,removed,hey im locked out of my other account not trying to liesockpuppet same as lg so youd rather someone eat an industrial farmed animal with the shittiest living conditions than go out into nature and huntkill it no one said that im asking why you need either basically i dont get why killing for the pleasure of eating something you like is morally superior to killing for the pleasure of engaging in a sport you like meat is one of the most efficient foods for you what on earth does that mean are you packing a bag for a trip and you need the lowest possible weight ratio last i checked most of the western world isnt in dire need of more caloriedenseefficient food i was covering what i saw as all possible objections either you eat meat for pleasure or you eat it because of some need since you have nutrition available without killing animals the only way need could come into play is if hunting was cheaper and the only way you could afford proper nutrition meat is one of the most efficient foods for you why wouldnt i eat it not trying to debate eating meat well i dont get it you are saying trophy hunting is immoral but you cant think of a reason not to kill something you dont need when your only reason for eating it amounts to convenience or pleasure
food,removed,um yeah why do we need to eat meat anymore

food,removed,i never said anything like this you act like we need to eat animals or well die you can eat plants and be healthy in many cases more healthy than when eating meat plants are not sentient beings that suffer cant compare the two things
food,removed,a disgusting attempt at an eye catcher
food,removed,a wickedly disgusting looking tornado of a piece of shit between two buns
food,removed,we eat animals because its what weve done for countless generations this has to be one of the worst arguments to defend anything you could make the same argument about keeping slaves or riding horses we did this for a long time so we cant possibly stop also its pretty hotly debated how much meat we ate in the past we certainly did not eat the amount people eat today and we didnt have thousands of factory farms and we didnt kill billion animals a year either we also didnt have cars or computers so how is this valid in any way we did a thing in the past now we cant ever stop so after evolving for millions of years the human race is supposed to be the one branch on the tree of life that is morally obligated to change its behavior considering that we arent actually part of the food chain anymore and were the most intelligent creatures on earth the answer is yes we have more power than any other creature in the world do to our brains and technology we have empathy we have morals and ethics somehow these things disappear when it comes to hamburgers the fuck out of here that doesnt even make any sense did you write this last part after reading your post
food,removed,really was so interesting you feel it should be posted again year later with basically same title i wouldnt have a problem with reposters provided they were not trying to take credit for someone elses work

food,removed,a well rounded high carb diet is the only diet thats able to not only protect you from but also cure most of our chronic diseases a high proteinhigh fat diet is what causes most of them but please get more specific
food,removed,man i just woke up and i am so hungry i want to kill me some piggy and cook it just like this so good also damn hot wife she is a keeper my girlfriend faints seeing a little bit of blood i should find a women willing to get her hands dirty
food,removed,the good thing about science is that its true wether you agree or not you said you can get more specific dont ask me what you mean
food,removed,well for starters farmed meat is given a quick and relatively painless death lolol srslydoe
food,removed,you dont need meat to survive but thats a different debate on its own its not its the core of his argument doing shitting things because you feel like it is still doing shitty things its just how it is
food,removed,i switched recipes and used the serious eats hack and the results were amazing i added about a little bit more water than the recipe calls for around a cup which really made it easy to knead the dough and get it super thin without tearing i used the following ingredients and dough preparation i followed a lot of the principles mentioned by jeff varasano particularly about kneading the dough a lot and how the sauce is made httpwwwvarasanoscompizzarecipehtm by the way i have found that the best surface to work dough on is marble the dough never sticks and you need very little flour to keep it that way i only move over to the wooden peel seconds before putting it in the oven for the bake i didnt use a cast iron instead i used a dough joe like pizza steel in an oven that was heated for over minutes at on the bottom rack and had an empty shelf on the top rack as well just before putting the pizza in the oven i turned on the broiler on high i then slide the pie onto the pizza steel for seconds by which time the bottom was already charred perfectly i then used a cold cooling rack to slide the pie on and put on the top shelf just under the broiler this takes about another seconds to char the top and melt the cheese perfectly of all the methods i have played around with this has proven to be the easiest most reliable and delicious short of going to new york i wont find a better pizza than in my home pizza was a thicker rounder pie while pizza was a super thin square pie it came out square because my tupper wares where the dough proofed were square and when stretching the dough it really wanted to stay square lol
food,removed,is the green stuff pickles or jalapenos looks great but hope its the first lol
food,removed,but liberals told me eating healthy food was expensive and thats why people on food stamps buy fried chicken and soda
food,removed,as a women i apologize for the harm our kind has brought upon your house
food,removed,a cheesecake consists of only these following items graham cracker crust cheesy frosting usually cream cheese this entire recipe consist of a pie almost every cheesecake i see on here has other items added to it the fact that this recipe is called cheesecake is nothing short of utter blasphemy let me start out by saying i have nothing against pies i just hate their association with desserts that are not cheesecakes adding pretzel to your crust its called a pretzel crust pie totally different want to add whipped cream and some pretentious strawberries on top i dont know what the hell youd call that but its not a cheesecake i would be more than willing to wager ive eaten more cheesecakes in my years than any of you had in your entire lives i have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one slice want to personalize your cheesecake use a mix of different flavored frostings or use sourcream or a raspberry swirl but if you want to add some pretzels and take a picture of it make your own recipe entitled pies because that is not a fucking cheescake im not a religious man nor am i anything close to a culinary expert but as a bland white midwestern male i am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to cheesecake and icecream cake all of you foodies stay the hell away from our cheescakes and stop associating your pies with them yet again it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being shit i stopped lurking after years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this ive seen post after post of peoples cheescakes all over reddit and its been driving me insane the moment i saw this recipe this morning i finally snapped hell i may even make my own recipe just because i know this one exists now oh theres quotation marks my bad
food,removed,you arent nitpicking but you are showing how biased you are and how little your know about nutrition i compliment your bravery for being so obviously ignorant and proud even the fitness bros of reddit know which are best this is even before you get to urine protein excretion studies tlcant read protein is enough for basic biological needs up to a max of kg body weight for olympic liftersmr universe lots of vegans are world champs medalists and record holders in both strength and endurance sports shudder because it turns out that macro nutrients dont need to come from a specific source
food,removed,the thread if youre interested this was back in the day when submissions topped out at maybe upvotes mostly it kicked off the conversation that got the mods moving

food,removed,i bet he hates muslims what a racist
food,removed,pigs are as intelligent if not more intelligent than many of your pet dogs i would challenge all of you who think this is awesome and tantalizing to imagine that instead of it being a pig roast it were a golden retriever roast i imagine that most of you would be disgusted there is no quantifiable difference between consuming pork or consuming dog by picking and choosing many people are acting in a speciesist manner ie arbitrarily deciding some species deserve to live while others deserve to be eaten i dont think that people who eat meat are malicious or bad people but i wish they would see that there is an alternative to it that is healthy happy and cruelty free i hope that in the future your annual roasts can be seitan roasts rather than an innocent pig
food,removed,poor pig committing a crime killing the pig does not validate an act of kindness bloody savages
food,removed,why should this deserve appreciation an innocent life was needlessly taken and its postmortem mutilation is celebrated replace that pig with a dog or a human being and youd be outraged try asking yourself what makes my life anymore meaningful
food,removed,actually according to my friends who have gone to southeast asia and consumed dog flesh they say it tastes quite good similar to chicken
food,removed,white neighbourhoods are amazing i bet if even the neighbourhood was black this wouldnt happen
food,removed,better then that dog eating festival going on🙊🙊🙊
food,removed,i dont think taking a cows breast milk or a chickens eggs to be humane the milk and egg industries are arguably the worst if a baby chick is born male of the time it is immediately slaughtered usually by sending the day old chick through a shredder the dairy industry is the veal industry if a calf is born male it is immediately sent to become veal regardless of gender the calves are taken away from their moms after a day and its traumatic for both after about years a dairy cow is spent and is sent to the slaughterhouse to become cheaper ground beef breast milk is for babies and chickens who lay eggs spend their lives in horrible conditions i can elaborate if needed would i eat laboratory meat yes they are coming up with new faux meats all the time and i think they are great the trickiest part of being vegan is changing your mentality on what is food i struggled at first to make dinner because i was hung up on the idea of having a meat take up half my plate i think thats your struggle with the idea of a vegan diet i eat plenty of bread and i very rarely eat a veggie sandwich for lunch seriously check out rveganrecipies for some inspiration

food,removed,man he really smashed the dough down with his finger tips not much reason to do that in my opinion the video from pagliaccis shows a better technique that is faster and doesnt compress everything so much
food,removed,if you know how to toss or stretch dough it wont be overhandled or torn you get overhandled pizza precisely because you didnt toss or stretch it correctly the reason you toss in the first place is because it gives you the diameter you want without having to man handle the dough constantly with your finger tips does no one understand this pros dont toss it for fun

food,removed,hi guys please forgive me if the linksformatting are horrible and wrong i have next to no internet skill i can upload stuff and copypaste this is the original topic that made me want to make this pork and the bins and there is a link to the recipe pretty high up in the comments i followed it exactly where the pork is concerned and for the buns all i changed was i halved the recipe amount as i didnt need buns here is a link to a couple of pics of how the pork turned out it was amazing httpingurcomaszakn fairly salty so if i did it again the only thing i would change would be to rinse the brine off before cooking which i found out after was something recipe commenters recommended but is not a step in the official recipe it cools to something very like a delicious ham but when it is sliced and panfried it turns as soft as butter and the fat is to die for so unctuous and with the caramelisation from the pan it is like slices of thick incredible superbacon which i seriously wondered how well it would go in these very sesametasting buns with hoisin sauce but once you take a bite you know it was just meant to be very time consuming took me a whole weekend to make all the components what with brining time and rising time on the buns and cooking and cooling times etc etc but totally worth it we invited friends over so thee were of us and buns in total there were but i lost a few the day before to trial and error with steaming times and taste testing there were buns left and one slice of pork which i ate the next day in its hamlike state this was after eating to bursting ill stop rambling tldr make these they are fucking amazing
food,removed,yeah and those of us that lost lbs and are in the best shape of their life say screw you and your views on diet the best diet is the one you can stick to

food,removed,poutine is an abortion no one should destroy a perfectly crispy fry by pouring a sauce over it if you want a fucking sauce with a fry it should be served on the side for dipping anyone whod put liquid on the fried crispy surface of any food should be shunned
food,removed,the reason you fry a chicken or any food is to obtain a crispy delicious surface on said chicken do you know what destroys the crispy delicious surface of fried food liquid dont fucking sauce a fried food dont fucking sauce fried chicken put the sauce on the side for dimwits who dont have enough fucking sense to enjoy the fried crispy surface of fried chicken

food,removed,ecoli is only really a risk with corn fed beef and not grass fed beef the gut of corn fed beef allows ecoli to flourish and can contaminate the meat at slaughter time cows that are grass fed do not have ecoli colonies in their stomaches also factory made patties will contain many cuts from many cows increasing your likelyhood of cross contamination single cut grinds done close to sale time prevent the bacterial colony from flourishing cheap beef is more likely to be corn fed and a higher risk because of american corn subsidies

food,removed,rotichapati does swell on a pan it needs to be pressed down firmly on the pan a couple a times first sometimes an open fire is needed in order for it to swell roti should not have so much melted ghee or oil that it turns yellow like that rotta picture i have a north indian heritage and like i said i make proper roti on a regular basis i also worked in the north indian food industry which i cant go into detail as it could divulge my identity clearly rotta and roti is not the same thing so youre only spreading misinformation watching south indian bread made is not the same as making north indian bread also most indians have eaten indian bread their entire lives so your sources is highly irrelevant
food,removed,why do you keep calling it rotta i googled rotta and nothing came up ive never heard anyone call rotichapatis rotta so i assumed theyre different breads from a different part of india especially since you told op that his roti are not supposed not fluff up you posted multiple replies with wrong information and after i corrected you you were still adamant that roti does not fluff up on a pan which they do as it turns that im right clearly i know more about these breads than you do therefore my source that i make roti and have experience in the industry are more credible than you watching your mummy make it
food,removed,maybe i do have limited exposure to that country but you clearly have a limited intelligence let me dumb it down for you not knowing what the word rotta means is not the same as not knowing about how food is made thats a matter of dialect not cooking your source was that you watched it being made and you ate it your entire life that is laughable and doesnt back up your comment at all you and your mother are not the same person watching your mother make it is not the same as making it yourself i dont know whether i know more about indian cooking than your mother but since im right i obviously know more about it than you my practical experience have shown to be a more credible source than your watching and eating before spreading misinformation and replying to people correcting them find out the facts first before you reply
food,removed,not trying to you must admit since i was right all along i must know more about it than you although i probably dont know more about it than your amma ammas know everything i just find a bit frustrating when people say the wrong thing out of ignorance as if theyre right and then being so determined that theyre right after correction without checking first certain subjects like this peeve me off the most its a trivial subject anyway dont take it to heart as we say over here its just banter mate d

food,removed,what part of cooking a steak arent you good at my process is put steak out to get room temperature salt and or season how you want dont be afraid of too much i just throw kosher salt on there to taste and get a nice thick crust of salt a lot of this salt will be cooked or washed away heat up cast iron skillet and throw in in butter and veggies they cook while i wait for pan to get very hot if skillet is hot but veggies not done to your liking just keep them moving in the pan hopefully a bit of charred gunk has built up in the bottom of the pan from the veggies that will give the steak some color throw more butter and your steak in pan and sear if your pan is super hot like it should be it should take seconds per side touch and push your finger gently to get an idea of how firm it is what this feels like is a raw steak and probably similar to the softness of your ear lobe take out veggies or leave them in depending how done they are throw more butter on top of steak some people do oil flip steak and give it turn move pan to broiler check it after a bit depending on thickness of steak flip it somewhere between to minutes sometimes minutes on each side if its very thick after you flip it throw more butter on top of steak and give it a turn after minutes touch with your finger if it feels like your ear obe its rare if it feels like your cheek its medium if it feels like the tip of your nose its well done take out of oven if you like rare leave it in oven and poke with your finger every minutes to see if its done the way you like after youve removed steak from broiler take note of the color is it grey or brown like you see on tv if still grey or not brown enough remove steak and veggies from pan and put a few tablespoons of water in there and scrape the pan with a spatula hopefull you have a darkish liquid if not or you just want to make sure it looks beautiful throw some steak sauce in the liquid you wont taste it it just gives color reduce it till a small amount of the liquid just barely covers the bottom of the pan then throw the steak back in for a few seconds maybe the veggies too because it makes them delicious imo but your taste may be different you should have a delicious steak now remember cooking to temperature is done by touch not sight if you want to be gordon ramsey about it keep ladling liquid from the bottom of the pan over the steak it will keep it from drying out let the steak just sit on the kitchen counter for minutes clean your space in this time cause now youre a pro and thats what pros do

food,removed,how black is the birthday boy
food,removed,why did you repost the same picture in the same subreddit just days apart its not even a good looking hotdog
food,removed,realy good work
food,removed,you do have steak n shakes near you if you get a bottle of their pepper sauce stuff you can use the peppers inside or just amazon if you want to go nuts with it pepperoncinis have a similar flavor but the texture is off you need that snap when you bite
food,removed,alright its actually pretty easy once you get the hang of shaping the dough here is the bbq sauce recipe its amazing here is the dough recipe it comes out nice and crispy and bready on the inside the only tweak i make is use fleischmanns pizza crust yeast packets i use one packet per recipe batch ive let it rise anywhere from hours to and its pretty much the same i cook one chicken breast whole then cut it remains jucier toss in bbq sauce as desired chop up some red onions cilantro shred low moisture whole milk mozz smoked gouda spread your dough using this technique on a heavily floured surface i usually skip the last tossing step it usually is already thin enough after the other steps important transfer dough to whatever cornmeal covered surface you will transfer to the oven i use a peel a large cutting board should work dont press down on dough very much after this point it will make transferring to the oven miserable top dough with a nice layer of bbq sauce then cheese blend then coated chicken onions cilantro cook at for minutes until bottom is nice and spotty browncrispy its really important here to have a pizza stonesteel i dont know the cook time if you dont also your steel should preheat for minutes remove and top with heated bbq sauce drizzle
food,removed,the goal is to either look like a circle or a square not whatever the fuck this atrocity is

food,removed,its thinly sliced ribeye i can find it at trader joes up in boston but i know that isnt gonna be universal you pretty much want to chop it up while you are cooking it you will see cooks hitting it with the sides of their spatulas while on the griddle it prevents it from being stringy when you eat it and helps the cheese saturate more this is when you want to be adding salt and pepper because of this it is good to be cooking this in a cast iron if you dont have a griddle toppings are basically just onions and cheese i like mine with mushrooms but that isnt traditional when the meat is just about done cooking go with medium high and go down from there as needed there should be just a little bit of browning put a shitload of cheese on it like you probably would think slices is enough but it isnt do like or slices minimum and let it really soak into the meat also i swear i never went to a place that fucked around with provolone maybe i just ignored it cooper cheese is my favorite to use it is what you get when you go to a real deli and ask for american the roll is what makes the sandwich people dont understand that you cant just get like a grinder roll or a baguette and call it a philly cheesesteak one thing you will notice in philadelphia is that they are fucking serious about the bread being used on their sandwiches what you are looking for is called an italian baguette which is going to be soft but chewy on the inside and just a little crispy on the outside in theory a true kaiser roll not that shit in a bag should be relatively similar even though it doesnt have the right aesthetic at all seeded rolls are the best the meatbread ratio varies between and so really just your preference between there

food,removed,with a user name like celerystickfigure it might be fascinating to see your bmi
food,removed,i am not giving out answers to weight problems i am saying if you have an eating problem why do you browse a subreddit with pictures of food
food,removed,excoriating yes i am so harshly critisizing the overweight people here right i am simply asking why if you had an eating problem would you want to browse pictures of food i just quit smoking a month ago i find it easier when i dont actively seek out cigarettes
food,removed,i am not saying it is the issue dont get me wrong here my question is if you have a problem with eating too much why would you willingly browse through pictures of food
food,removed,hmmm considering i stay on a calorie deficit with as little sugar intake while only drinking water tea and black coffee i doubt i will my grandfather just had his first triple bypass that is not really the way i want to live
food,removed,so you make an assumption and when i point out that i am on a strict diet you tell me that i am still wrong fat doesnt come from nowhere inputoutput i have watched my diet and eating habits since i was years old i was chubby why would you think id go back on years of work and practice and habits
food,removed,i think the key to keeping it juicy is aging and then cooking hot and quick the key to keeping it juicy is to cook it to midrare at most and as evenly as possible you will get the juiciest steak if you cook it at the temperature that you want it so at about degrees you can do this with sousvide equipment on a grill you have to take the thickness into account if its less than inch thick then grill it on as hot a grill as possible anything more than that cook it at lower temperature degrees on indirect heat until it reaches a bit below and then sear it directly on the chimney starter filled all the way up

food,removed,i actually found this one of reddits better threads i looked at the photo i read the comments i can totally appreciate the naysayers points of view but living somewhere where lobsters just not done available i would also eat the shit out of that thats the beauty of it all someone took time to post it it was debated i just enjoyed it after a finish last night and a hour planning meeting in germany today i appreciated it all that said there are some ribs on the front page i just saw just now that i got a full on chub about
food,removed,if these were people ribs we would all be grimacing in disgust
food,removed,for those who want to learn to cook good spare ribs check out franklins youtube channel if you dont know who he is franklin owns a successful bbq joint in austin tx part part i have used his recipes many times and have always had excellent results his methods are simple easy to follow and produces great bbq hes a big advocate of just seasoning with salt and pepper so its a great base to play around with more complex rubs as well it all depends on the flavor profile you want to produce at the end have fun
food,removed,
food,removed,the comment right under yours seems like a good candidate
food,removed,oh that looks delicious do you have the recipe im sure itll trump the bbq places around my house they all suck
food,removed,i use the franklin bbq recipe with an offset smoker remove membrane coat in olive oil dust with a peppersalt mix plus any extra paprikachiligarliconion if you want more flavor get smoker up to starting with coal and then only burning oak or hickory chunks put the ribs meatup on the grill with a pan of water and smoke for hours spritzing occasionally with apple cider vinegar then put on foil spritz again and lightly sauce with whatever you like wrap and put back for an additional hours meatdown highly tasty

food,removed,very easy to find tuna that has never been frozen where i live in fact they charge a premium for it but since most salmon is farmed it is likely frozen during processing i assume they do it at bulk to cut down costs i doubt a grocery store carries salmon that hasnt been through processing that involves freezing i doubt they would bother spending the extra money and hassle to acquire it never frozen from a farm i mean there is still a chance it isnt frozen though i guess

food,removed,this isnt a japanese pancake you wouldnt know a japanese pancake if it hit you up the blindside of a face a japanese pancake is made with heaps of cabbage and basically whatever you want in it and they eat it for dinner they dont use maple syrup they drench it with savory fruit syrup depending on which region you go to they server you a different kind of japanese pancake like in horoshima which serves their own pancakes always make sure to put the special seaweed on top too no butter in japan they didnt always have butter so they use seaweed instead like pepper

food,removed,go to buffalo wild wings they have them and theyre delicious the ones in this picture look overcooked they should not be open like that
food,removed,thats more or less correct when cheese is made the first part in the process that you can actually call it cheese is when the milk curdles which is why its called a curd some cheeses take more processing after that but some are just salted and packaged when people from the midwest refer to cheese curds they usually dont differentiate between deep fried and fresh fresh packaged cheese curds usually look something like this
food,removed,cheese jizz

food,removed,cook on a lower temp itll be beter cant rush perfectionbut not bad not bad tat all

food,removed,day of apple cleanse knew i shouldnt have clicked the link
food,removed,you can get a good look at a butchers ass by sticking your head up there but wouldnt you rather take his word for it
food,removed,its very burnt and uneven
food,removed,if you want it raw then why bother cooking it that
food,removed,outside is too burnt eating black char causes cancer
food,removed,well if the idea is to burn it on the outside while leaving it uncooked in the middle i would call it a success well done or not
food,removed,thats probably why we are seemingly on opposite ends i absolutely love charred sugar
food,removed,looks a bit burnt
food,removed,yes but that also is actually not deep dish but rather stuffed another chicago variant
food,removed,daddy
food,removed,jeaus you yanks like a bit of raw meat
food,removed,meh depends on how you cook it in iron my roomate insists to turn the temp up to make any oils vaporize then he puts the cow meat on that thing to burn a nice crust as fast as possible it ruins the cast iron though every time i prefer my way i cook the same cut on the same night low and slow with water and oil no problem at all to achieve a nice black crust it just takes more time and doesnt ruin the pan
food,removed,make sure to post a picture when you finish cooking it too how do people just eat raw fucking meat like that i wish i could breathe fire so i could burn any meat i ate completely dry just how i like it
food,removed,your sear is way overdone
food,removed,gotta get dem cancer ay
food,removed,its burnt
food,removed,i just dont get the appeal of these cumbersome monstrosities i like french fries cheese sticks and popcorn chicken as much as the next person im no elitist but theres something disgusting and kinda disturbing about the need to pack every fried delight imaginable on top of a perfectly good sandwich whats wrong with having fries with your sandwich not on top with cheese sticks and popcorn chicken and gummy bears wrapped in bacon deep fried in a cotton candy shell seriously at some point this shit goes to far is it too much to ask to be able to fit the sandwich in my mouth i dont even wanna eat at a joint that serves this i dont wanna have to watch some fucker ram this down his gullet laughing like a fucking lunatic as grease drips down his arms and half the sandwich sticks to his face this is the fierification of food fuck this downvote
food,removed,your heat was too hot
food,removed,are you the op weird to post a picture and a recipe with different accounts
food,removed,aha this is one of those threads fuck everyone and merry christmas
food,removed,
food,removed,have you even cooked a steak before bringing it to room temperature does nothing and risks airborne pathogens olive oil can add astringent flavored of its not a good kind canola oil has a neutral flavor and a far higher smoke point making making it superior for crust formation olive oil is perfectly fine for finishing a steak its how they do it in italy searing it first before putting in the oven causes it to steam ruining the crust you fail to account for oven and stove differences the sure fire way for medium rare is by taking the temperature
food,removed,wtf is this outside is burn and inside is to red
food,removed,lol im sorry but that has too taste burnt as fuck fool proof indeed

food,removed,in this post you talk about having sex with a year old girl when you were now you are into boys

food,removed,i guess its better than eating a gun
food,removed,no its not like that パン粉 in that metaphor is the hot sauce not the sriracha let me lay it out for you again パン粉 refers to any kind of breadcrumb big small dry fresh toasted whatever the word is also literally bread crumbs so using this word to refer to a specific type of breadcrumbs is like insisting that the word car refers only to porsches and no other form of motorized vehicle
food,removed,no it most definitely is not its literally breadcrumbs i can go down to my local supermarket and every single variety of breadcrumbs there will be called パン粉 all of them
food,removed,thank you for your help in the battle against hipster food vocabulary
food,removed,yeah no thanks thats just more hipster bullshit written by someone in the field of hipster bullshit every variety of breadcrumb you can find is called パン粉 in japan including the fine dry type used for tempura the coarse fresh type used for katsu and everything in between
food,removed,why do i have to keep on repeating this its not its any type of breadcrumb what youre talking about is just the way hipsters in the us have decided to appropriate the term

food,removed,no wonder people are getting so fat
food,removed,looks like the inside of the cum box
food,removed,stop posting your cooking shit
food,removed,i know this is an out of place question for this subreddit but does a pregnant mothers diet affect the unborn child like if alcohol and drugs can affect the baby negatively why cant too much sugar
food,removed,gotta eat for two and balloon up
food,removed,that is a list of random cookie recipes good job

food,removed,i dont think we should allow pregnant women to just eat whatever junk food they want but ill eat the cookies
food,removed,stfu youre not a reddit authority figure
food,removed,using public health data for a heuristical approach is a good way to go in some cases for example calculated antibiotic treatment adding fluoride to table salt vitamine d substitution for most fertile women still to come however telling someone not to eat cookies without asking for their body composition before because half of the us has a weight problem is not one of them dude stop being an ass
food,removed,reminds me of this joke rice is great if youre really hungry and you want to eat of something
food,removed,you make me sick
food,removed,i like that suggesting cookies might not be the best choice for a fetus counts as activism here i am a radical terrorist

food,removed,you shouldnt be encouraging them
food,removed,this is great and all but i want to advise people not to take food from strangers you never know if it was intentionally poisoned or if it has ingredients that you are allergic to it is much better to be safe than sorry
food,removed,should put some instruments outside and encourage people to learn an actual skill
food,removed,such a waste of time make the pokemon dorks pay you for them
food,removed,you cant really apply the same logic to any of those situations because the people there would most certainly not be strangers

food,removed,its funny that i get more attention for carb delicacies on food and my carnitas gets more attention on imgur i wonder how over weight a majority of the people are in this sub
food,removed,not hard to do with a pasta roller i even did something like op the problem was the sauce covered it up so it couldnt be appreciated
food,removed,i do not have the scientific approach you take to pizza but i do admire it quite a bit frankly i really prefer the cornmeal crust in lous but ive never had uno or due next time im getting a deep dish pie i absolutely will you may have just led me to my new favorite place as for the chunks of tomato in the sauce im actually a fan of that i make homemade pasta sauce every month and i love to keep a few tomato chunks intact so well have to agree to disagree on that matter note on your additional note yes get your silverware off that pizza pie and your greasy mitts on it

food,removed,thatll be and for your drink sir
food,removed,hope you get out of prison soon op they serve nice food though
food,removed,you call that toast
food,removed,the way your drink lines up with the horizon is pleasing to the eye
food,removed,i really bothers me that the fruit slice doesnt line up with the horizon other than that great
food,removed,you had three eggs bacon and cheese on toast and a mimosa im even questioning the view but thats not my area of expertise
food,removed,thats some raw toast
food,removed,idk the view ruins it for me
food,removed,i have a friend who lives with a view like this and thinks its totally normal
food,removed,really wish it was angled just slightly different so the lime was seated on the horizon
food,removed,i upvoted this because the position of the orange relative to the horizon is symbolic of the sun
food,removed,how does a picture of eggs and bacon make ground page how are so many lives so bad that they upvote a photo of bacon and eggs
food,removed,if only that bottom of the lemon was in line of the horizon
food,removed,looks like regular ol bread to me
food,removed,and we name is uitsmijter
food,removed,time for a new toaster
food,removed,that fucking ship
food,removed,my ocd is kicking ini just want the orange slice to sit right on the horizon
food,removed,if only the angle was a bit lowerthe lemon slice would be level with the horizonnow that woulda been a neat pic
food,removed,the orange looks like a sunset
food,removed,i dont know why but i thought that lemon wedge was the sun rising over the water
food,removed,that looks horrible is it supposed to be made into a sandwich that bread doesnt look toasted

food,removed,am i the only one that never feels the need garnish their drink or dish
food,removed,that setting sun looks like a lemon
food,removed,the orange made it look like the sun was setting
food,removed,upvotes what is wrong with this subreddit the only thing more average than the food is the view
food,removed,i see one egg on a piece of white bread next to some water ok
food,removed,the fact that the orange slice doesnt line up with the coast line bugs me more than it should but other than that nice picture bon appetit
food,removed,none of this looks good the view is mediocre
food,removed,oh wow i want all of that just some butter on the toast though and clearly more cheese is needed

food,removed,its hilarious how nobody is really that impressed
food,removed,i apologise for being critical but the salad looks like someone decided to stick some red onion on rocket salad which imo is the worst tasting of all salad the bread doesnt look toasted why supply butter after putting the food on top cheese slices are not proper cheese and to top it all off a slice of orange in an orange drink is just plain silly having said that the view is lovely the table has a worn look that you could only get from being on the beach for years on end and the sand looks divine with all those rocks please take my comment with the playful humour intended
food,removed,i bet your food got cold while trying to take that picture
food,removed,that looks terrible my year old nephew can whip up a better looking sandwich looks like cafe slop
food,removed,almost everything about this is subpar toast wonderbread straight out of the bag cheese kraft singles with the plastic melted in eggs seem burned bacon i guess looks like bacon that saladlike thing looks pretty nasty the view is pretty meh as far as water goes

food,removed,what the fuck are you on about im feeding large groups of people these are typically bone in rib steaks im not going to cut bone and im butchering whole primals so the steer itself has dictated the thickness of a steak a single rib a portion as you seem to be defining it would probably be slices possibly taken from different steaks why the fuck would i rub post cooking again what the fuck are you on about can you picture a large party of people all being served numerous different steaks in numerous different styles yeah ive spent seconds trying to make sense of you thats enough

food,removed,its a german recipe so im not sure if the translation for the ingredients are correct i use about of potatos potato flour and tablespoons of semolina boil the potatos peel and mash them add the semolina and flour until the dough is no longer sticky at all add a generous amount of salt a little bit of nutmeg and pepper and form the dumplings throw them into boiling salt water and then immediately reduce the heat let them simmer for minutes then just let them cool off for about minutes they have a firm but still kinda sticky texture they are also called gummiknödel in germany which translates to rubberdumplings
food,removed,recipe httpimgurcomgalleryeutvr disclaimer english is not my native language so im not sure whether or not i used the different cooking terms boiling simmering deglazing etc correctly

food,removed,ibss worst nightmare wish i could have this
food,removed,op did you follow the traditional chinese recipe
food,removed,we use this recipe in our house for a more authentic chicken you should use corn starch instead of flour and do what is called velveting the chicken
food,removed,you quite obviously know nothing about upper class cuisinefine dining that beef looks like its about ready to get up and jump off from that plate this is a serious risk from salmonella or ecoli you should ensure that meat is cooked to an internal temperature of or until the juices run dry such a shame to see a decent slab of meat get ruined by a clumsy amateur
food,removed,actually you are incorrect steak tartare frequently appears on the menus for some of the most expensive restaurants in the world
food,removed,or they could provide some hot sauces that actually taste good
food,removed,anytime mate unless you love to pour lots of shoyu or soy on your food go easy on the marinade time the eggs will soak up a ton of soy sauce and flavor in a short time you can always go longer but hard to remove flavor certainly a personal preference making me hungry mmmm
food,removed,can you explain this i dont use them because i think tobasco is awful but who doesnt like hot sauce on their burrito
food,removed,but i like the taste of hot sauce especially on a burrito you should try it sometime lol
food,removed,brine by using water equal to at least of the weight of the meat then multiply the total weight by the desired concentration of salt between and brine for hours drain and refrigerate for another hours uncovered dredge in seasoned flour and egg wash coat in panko bread crumbs fry in oil until internal reaches degrees enjoy
food,removed,thats not a survey and edgy lol what

food,removed,this thing is not paella
food,removed,it doesnt have rice in it yet is what you must mean perhaps hell serve it over rice perhaps he doesnt care for rice or was out of rice heres a fun fact except in the tiny corner of the internet and world you live in a seafood heavy stew based heavily on tomatoes and saffron is paella
food,removed,ill add it right now
food,removed,keep proving my point champ
food,removed,excellent
food,removed,blah blah blah risotto is a rice dish if you remove the rice you dont have risotto paella is a soupy spanish mess that can contain any number of things the inclusion or exclusion of rice is no more important that the inclusion or exclusion of chicken chorizo shrimp or anything else that may or may not be in paella
food,removed,oh right the culture of paella my mistake
food,removed,this would be distusting with rice
food,removed,i think it looks absolutely fantastic and delicious dont listen to these chumps
food,removed,whats small and pathetic is jumping down ops throat because he wanted to share the food his dad made and committed the unforgivable internet sin of calling his dish paella instead of spanish inspired seafood dish served in a large flat pan without rice or whatever the hell you people expect from him as i said in my original post youre as bad if not worse than the texans who jump in whenever somebody posts a picture of chili with beans in it or the new yorkers who comment on ever deep dish pizza post thats some good looking pizza flavored casserole the dish posted above is colloquially paella everywhere outside of valencia and the minds of some of the people on the internet you want me to admit that somebodys spanish grandmother wouldnt accept that dish as paella fine im wrong and youre right you want me to tell you that most of the people on planet earth wouldnt happily call that paella and never think twice about it never in a million years
food,removed,thats awesome nobody cares heres a traditional pizza heres a chicago deep dish pizza heres some kind of pizza baked in a muffin tin heres a recipe for pizza that doesnt have a crust httpwwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesnigellalawsoncrustlesspizzarecipehtml guess what its all fucking pizza and having an argument about it so you can be kind of the internet is pointless
food,removed,updated
food,removed,you know my mother made all this paella
food,removed,
food,removed,i see your paella and raise you this made by my family
food,removed,you keep bringing up examples like vanilla ice cream vs pineapple yogurt and now horse vs chicken since youre still not getting it this isnt horse vs chicken this is horse vs zebra and even that is a big time stretch httpswwwncmiccomwebresimageprcriskmgmtclinicalriskshorsevszebrajpg
food,removed,thats not paella thats a melt
food,removed,theres absolutely nothing wrong with cooking the rice separately and allowing the dinner guests to add it together obviously ops father has respect for whoever is requesting this deviation from procedure you purist assholes must be so lonely and miserable to not be able to imagine a scenario where a cook accommodates the needs of vegetarians or low carb dieters or people with nut allergies and the rest of the group is fine with it they dont freak and out and scream the paella is ruined this is not a paella you fucking pretender there is no rice
food,removed,rfood is the king of shit comments
food,removed,so he made stew hey could you make me a pizza with the bread on the side
food,removed,equally as bad but with rfood i already know with oc that people will criticize anything and everything about the post from how its presented how op spelled the dish how the lighting hits the shrimp too harshly and brigs the picture out of balance etc
food,removed,not paella at all
food,removed,i often criticise valencian people for being pedantic when it comes to their local pride and joy but even i have to saythis is not by any stretch of the imagination a paella as far as paellas go this is like fish and chips without the chipsor the fish
food,removed,that is not paella lol
food,removed,no he didnt
food,removed,that looks delicious but uh no he didnt
food,removed,tell your dad i will give him a bj for a nice hot bowl of pealla

food,removed,i dont get why you think slaughtering conscious and emotional beings ripping up their corpses and putting them on a table is endearing in any way but ok bracing for downvotes from coward meat eaters who cant handle the truth
food,removed,i think its cowardly to be like most meat eaters and disassociate yourself from the idea that animals are actually emotional sentient creatures like us and while we care so much about retorted people or someone in a coma or unborn children we totally neglect the fact that there are essentially no animal rights for livestock and they are treated accordingly most meat eaters i know dont want to read about the abuse the animals that they consume have to suffer a long time ago we hunted or we farmed and killed our own animals the cowardice in my opinion sprouted when people could cast all that abuse out of their minds so they feel more comfortable while being able to simply hand over cash to eat an animal
food,removed,good i means im talking to the right people then
food,removed,its sushi robata style httpsyoutubeosdandcyypi

food,removed,at least the meats still raw though huh
food,removed,fuck safe its still gonna taste like raw meat
food,removed,its a long and somewhat complicated story but as simply as possible it has to do with jim crow laws back in the day bbq was sold in meat markets to avoid being classed as a restaurant and having to enforce the jim crow laws the meat markets didnt have silverware plates or anything so workers would come and buy the smoked meat and eat it with whatever the store had on hand theyd buy the bread and maybe some pickles and eat their meal right off the butcher paper the cue was packed in
food,removed,hrm yes freedoms is about half a murica
food,removed,humans evolved intelligence because of cooked meals eating like this is just going backwards i like meat as much as anyone else so your completely oblivious guess that im a vegan is wrong

food,removed,if youre working out try not to pay attention to your weight as much for instance someone is super jacked an are like foot tall but by weight standards without seeing the person that person is overweight however we know thats not true if you have a lot of muscle muscle is more dense than fat is which means if youre losing fat but getting muscle than you wont lose too much weight but you will be thinning out weight is sometimes a mind trap especially with women because they are always told they need to weigh a certain amount instead of be lead and feel healthy
food,removed,that does not help someone who lives in a noncheese state he wants better cheese
food,removed,ugh it was at blue ribbon sushi bar and grill at the cosmopolitan but i just checked their menu and it looks like it was replaced by a wagyu tongue dish it was also the first time ive had actual otoro and it was fucking delicious also if you can be loose with your money the seasonal tasting menu at latelier de joël robuchon is fucking fantastic and cheaper than his other flagship restaurant at the mgm around other than a small bistro in paris it was the best meal that ive ever had the fucking mashed potatoes omfg i wish i could rub them all over my body i just wish i had the money for the guy savoy tasting menu in vegas some day

food,removed,and for cream cheese math bro
food,removed,a grilled cheese consists of only these following items cheese bread with spread usually butter this entire subreddit consist of melts almost every grilled cheese sandwich i see on here has other items added to it the fact that this subreddit is called grilledcheese is nothing short of utter blasphemy let me start out by saying i have nothing against melts i just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses adding cheese to your tuna sandwich its called a tuna melt totally different want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach i dont know what the hell youd call that but its not a grilled cheese i would be more than willing to wager ive eaten more grilled cheeses in my years than any of you had in your entire lives i have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich want to personalize your grilled cheese use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread but if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it make your own subreddit entitled melts because that is not a fucking grilled cheese im not a religious man nor am i anything close to a culinary expert but as a bland white midwestern male i am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac cheese all of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them yet again it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being shit i stopped lurking after years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this ive seen post after post of peoples grilled cheeses all over reddit and its been driving me insane the moment i saw this subreddit this morning i finally snapped hell i may even start my own subreddit just because i know this one exists now you god damn heretics respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is a melt

food,removed,i made a bomb ass fried chicken and mashed potato burrito thingy and dipped it in siracha yesterday
food,removed,looking very delicious
food,removed,this recipe is amazing thanks
food,removed,keep in mind that they might not always be available if you live somewhere where the produce tends to be seasonal also they are more expensive than the other varieties its not like you cant make a decent guac with different avocados than hass in fact there are good uses for the other ones in my opinion for example if im making tacos fajitas or my imitation chipotle burrito bowl among other things and i want some guac to add to it as a sidecomponent then ill use the other avocados but you have to be especially careful that they are ripe if now they are just terrible what i do differently here is that i use one of those stick mixerblender things a regular blender works too you just have to baby it more once i have the avocado salt pepper and lime in there in order to just get a very smooth texture with a hass avocado you can do this but its unnecessary and you actually lose some of the nice texture from hand mashed avocado anyhow once that is done then i throw in some finely diced red onions and cilantro and i have a very basic acceptable guac to add to other foods if a guac is supposed to be a star like as a dip then hass only though what i described above is a nice outofseason solution

food,removed,oh nope just a sicilianstyle pizza theyre typically rectangular slices have a relatively thick and light interior with a crisp crust the cheese also goes beneath the sauce and toppings for some reason my earlier comment on the recipe and method isnt showing up but here it is copied pretty much just followed this guide friends and i had a pizza night where we split quadrants and topped it with what we wanted all of us pretty much stuck to pepperoni and green peppers i think the pan i used was a bit small so the slices came out a little thicker than i wanted i also had to increase the cooking time a bit and move the pizza form the bottom of the oven to under the broiler for mins end result was pretty great wish i had more pics but i was shaking from anticipation of stuffing my face full of cheese

food,not_removed,looks good reminds me of gordon ramsays scrambled eggs video
food,not_removed,yes i was too lazy to cook the tomatoes they were more of a last minute thought when i remembered i had them lol
food,not_removed,that coffee doesnt look so black
food,not_removed,love chives in scrambled egg always use it if im having it on an evening makes it more savoury
food,not_removed,yeh thats the technique i used
food,not_removed,trust me it was knock your socks off black thats just the crema i had to focus the camera on it so that any colour would show up which is why the eggs are a bit over bright
food,not_removed,from where
food,not_removed,recipe video found httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoptbwyyvas makes four calorie servings before rice ingredients be sure to play around and add flavors you enjoy lb sushigrade tuna spring onions ¼ cup chopped macadamia nuts ¼ cup soy sauce tbsp sesame oil tsp grated ginger tsp grate garlic ½ tsp kosher salt ¼ tsp cayenne pepper for garnish sesame seeds lemon wedge instructions step mix everything but the tuna into a bowl step cut tuna into cubes step add in tuna and refrigerate for hours then serve over rice or on its own enjoy
food,not_removed,try adding some form of seaweed too
food,not_removed,i totally wanted to but my local grocery store didnt have it the day i wanted to record the video definitely works as a base recipe though open to plenty of interpretation d
food,not_removed,id eat it
food,not_removed,i love that rooster sauce
food,not_removed,that tomato looks divine
food,not_removed,cilantro rice is good chipotle always had good rice until they got people sick that is lol
food,not_removed,looks great love roasting tomatoes
food,not_removed,thanks sprinkled with the perfect amount of salt
food,not_removed,lol yeah thankfully ive only had chipotle a handful of times freshly made is much better too i love making rice
food,not_removed,thank you i can not have grilled meat without a roasted tomato on the side
food,not_removed,i only have potatoes and dry cereal in the apartment right now gonna have to make a trip to the store definitely going to recreate this or at least try to
food,not_removed,let me know if you need any help i love cooking
food,not_removed,i wouldnt eat that
food,not_removed,looks good enough for me try a piece or two and see if you live
food,not_removed,it looks off to me maybe the shipment was left out a bit i have bacon times a week if it adds to my expertise
food,not_removed,i used to buy cheap bacon but after a friend showed me the joy of thick cut from a better brand i started buying it i never really paid much attention to what bacon looks like because it was pretty consistent with the other brand though i noticed the different shades throughout this one it doesnt have a bad smell or anything so i may just be overly cautious but a second opinion would be good
food,not_removed,yeah a lot of store bought bacon looks like this youre better off with buying it from a butcher or making your own
food,not_removed,just a word to the general users of rfood round crust is actually not that hard to make
food,not_removed,this must have been heaven to eat oh my god
food,not_removed,good job how was it
food,not_removed,wow then im a liar all i made from scratch was the dough and obviously cutting up the topping i did the pork the night before in the crock pot i did not make the sauce by scratch
food,not_removed,admittedly given that it was my first time it was ok it needs less dough or at least spread thinner the toppings were plenty but they just got overwhelmed by the crust
food,not_removed,i know what you mean the crust thinness is hard to master good luck with your future pizza endeavors
food,not_removed,following
food,not_removed,damn i need to visit portland httplardosandwichescomgallery
food,not_removed,lardos great but i think olympia provisions wins as my favorite portland sandwich spot
food,not_removed,sounds like grand rapids michigan and portland have a lot in common
food,not_removed,lardo is where i take out of town coworkers for their first portland lunch in a town known for great food lardo stands out im a huge fan of the banmi and the dirty fries but they usually have a rotating sandwich created by a guest chef that is pretty good they started out as a food cart but now have three physical locations
food,not_removed,that just looks like standard fare nothing special
food,not_removed,portland is cool and they are the kings of food trucks and northwest micro breweries
food,not_removed,the plates are underneath its just easier clean up this way
food,not_removed,hello utheincrediblemrsfox thank you for your submission unfortunately your submission has been removed for the following reasons please make sure the title of your submission simply describes the food itself please save additional details including context about how where or why the food was made for the comments section instead if you resubmitted this to rfood with a different title it would be allowed thanks
food,not_removed,f yeah waterton
food,not_removed,ah sorry thanks for letting me know it was my first submission
food,not_removed,what did you use for the sauce
food,not_removed,i should have taken the photo before cutting it shrug a little fresh mozzarella scattered on the crust potatoes sliced inch tossed with olive oil crushed garlic and rosemary a lot of grated parmigianoreggiano just a little whole milk mozzarella sprinkled over top this turned out pretty good i gotta say
food,not_removed,looking nice
food,not_removed,we crossed i was adding the description when you posted your q a little fresh mozzarella scattered on the crust potatoes sliced inch tossed with olive oil crushed garlic and rosemary a lot of grated parmigianoreggiano just a little whole milk mozzarella sprinkled over top
food,not_removed,yum that sounds tasty ill have to give it a go thanks for sharing
food,not_removed,httpwwwfoodnetworkcomrecipescroquetesaburgershtml
food,not_removed,i only see two salmon
food,not_removed,the rice has salmon in it and behind are fried salmon skin i shouldve put more salmon sashimi on it
food,not_removed,salmonlicious
food,not_removed,for myself i would go easier on the salt thrice the garlic and half the lemon juice other than that its pretty spot on
food,not_removed,because the main ingredient of this recipe is the yogourt i would try to use a good quality one instead of the lowfat
food,not_removed,i usually salt my grated cucumber and place it in a strainer above a bowl overnight to allow a lot of its natural water to strain out it helps keep the dip thicker and you will not have any unwanted separation of yogurt water when the dip is sitting in the fridge also its no traditional but substituting in a quarter of the amount of yoghurt with sour cream makes it pretty damn good
food,not_removed,thank you i actually ended up tweaking it in a way similar to yours and it was fantastic
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,thats a great idea im going to have to try salting my cucumber next time thanks for the response
food,not_removed,acadiana here well done
food,not_removed,beautiful
food,not_removed,thank you sir
food,not_removed,thank you much
food,not_removed,because they are not par cooked it is push potato through grate so they look like fries and fry almost everywhere else par cooks freezes then fries again before consumption allows for fry to be soft and pillowy in inside fried on outside basically they are making shoestring potato chips
food,not_removed,asking for them well done makes them percent better
food,not_removed,im going to say it and ill take the hate animal style fries are gross a bunch of icky american cheese with chunky thousand island dressing on fries is not my cup of tea i really like the burgers not cheeseburgers and regular fries though shakes are great too
food,not_removed,animal style is a must
food,not_removed,i personally think theyre fine but i think the answer to your question might be because they cut them fresh and fry them right out of the cutter other fast food joints have a process sorry i dont remember the exact process where they do something like cut the fries soak them in ice brine fry them briefly then flash freeze them for shipment then fry a final time at the restaurant sorry all you fast foodies if i butchered the steps of the process but i know its something like that
food,not_removed,they arent bad
food,not_removed,because you dont order them well done
food,not_removed,came here to say because you didnt order them animal style
food,not_removed,they are so different from every other fast food place because they are just cut potatoes fried most other places have i think potato in their fries they are just sticks of fat and salt to get you to come back again
food,not_removed,the reason theyre so different in taste is because theyre the real deal actual potatoes cut and fried no additives just natural taste other places serve processed fries something most americans have gotten used to eating so frequently they dont even know what a real potato tastes like
food,not_removed,they are a christian conservative company that posts bible liturgy on their burger and fry cardboard propaganda that us why innout fries are so bad
food,not_removed,so they go from hot garbage to just garbage
food,not_removed,what is animal style fries
food,not_removed,this
food,not_removed,as a fry purist i feel that if you have to add gobs of sauce and cheese and other items to make them edible the fries are bad im not saying animal style fries are bad but the question here is why are the fries themselves bad and they really fucking are
food,not_removed,this is also the process for fine dining fries too a buddy told me how much time they spend on fries in his kitchen and it blew my mind
food,not_removed,youre right theyre awful
food,not_removed,all fries except for special items such as beerbattered fries are about potato snd fat of innout fries have of fat which is exactly the same amount as a similar weight of mcdonalds fries the innout fries actually have more sodium than the mcdonalds per versus therefore there is actually more potato in mcdonalds fries since there is slightly less weight taken up by salt the difference is that mcdonalds first boils the potatoes in water to get rid of excess sugars and strengthen the pectin in the potato fries them to cook the potato freezes them to let the ice crystals puncture the cell walls and make the inside fluffier and then fries them again right before serving innout only fries them once which means they are either underdone and limp or if you order them well done dark brown and burnt tasting since the excess sugar carmelizes and in either case theyll never be fluffy inside
food,not_removed,plenty of restaurants cut potatoes for fries in house difference is in and out dont par fry and chill before finishing them with a final fry those steps are critical for a soft fluffy interior and a defined crispy exterior
food,not_removed,crispier mofo
food,not_removed,its fries topped with melted cheese sauce and chopped grilled onions
food,not_removed,in n out fries seem to have a tenminute window of deliciousness once they get cold they are not so good
food,not_removed,yup for prep cook cut then soak in ice water rinsesoak in cold water rinse soak in cold water rinse soak in cold water rinse soak in ice water for minutes this takes almost hours shake all water off in large collander par fry at low oil if anyone cares immediately blast chill to degrees after blast chill refrigerate till unfrozen then they are ready for service for the fry cookimmediately load serving to serving size bowl and put into the fryer in as little time as possible fry high temp fast as soon as timer chimes take out of fryer shake vigorously in basket with spending as little time possible above fryer as water vapors are still present put in bowl toss with coarse sea salt or we seasonings were ordered with flips salting with shaking the seasoning shaker constantly plate and prey to god you didnt fuck up the timing or seasonings this is from a extremely high end restaurant i used to work at and the only course with fries was steak and fries but it cost dollars with ounces of dry aged for days grass fed filet which was prime plus as well as hand selected by the butcher that works for the restaurant and aged by the most expensive and exclusive butcher in the cityregion
food,not_removed,thats your opinion i like them
food,not_removed,that sounds sooooo goood we dont have that in sg where do you find animal style fries is it a common term everywhere on the menu like restaurants will call their fries animal styled instead of like truffle fries or smth

food,not_removed,whats a mountain style deep dish
food,not_removed,eaten with honey i have to try that i doubt i will find that style of pizza here
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,whoops i totally shouldve put the honey in the picture
food,not_removed,as usual i kind of just winged the recipe but i can definitely write up about what i did for you my boyfriend used httpwwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesbobbyflaypizzadoughrecipehtml for the dough and it was fantastic we let it set up in the oven covered in paper towels we didnt turn it on its just a nice incubator for about hours or so with a bowl of water underneath then i lined the bottom of my cast iron pan with olive oil and placed the rolled out crust inside fitting it to the edges of the pan from there i added about half a cup of kroger brand parlor style pizza sauce a small swirl of honey some basil and italian seasoning i added an entire layer of thick cut onions another layer of thick cut green peppers and a final layer of thick cut baby portobello mushrooms i sprinkled a few cloves of roughly cut garlic over the top then i added close to a whole package of mozzarella cheese a little bit of camembert it has a nice smoky flavor and makes the mozzarella a little gooier which i like and a good amount of freshly grated asagio i then added a few handfuls of a mixed cheese from the store just to give it a little more color and i mean who doesnt love more cheese i then topped the cheese with more italian seasoning and basil which allowed the top of the cheese to crisp up beautifully finally i baked it at degrees for minutes on the bottom rack then another on the top rack to get it nice and browned and to crisp up the cheese on top nbsp edit ill link a picture of the cross section when i get to work edit i accidentally ate the cross section before i took a picture i have another one at home in the fridge though if my girlfriend hasnt snagged it yet
food,not_removed,a lot of people think a mountain style is just a chicago style with a different name but they actually have a few crucial differences that set them apart the focus is more on a mound of toppings and a thick crust rather than on a thick chunky sauce the ingredients arent assembled upside down it goes sauce ingredients cheese just like a standard pizza edit thanks ualta for correcting me and my false pizza statements the crust is usually eaten with honey its a specialty which started with a restaurant called beaujos out here in colorado
food,not_removed,sounds amazing congrats to you and your boyfriendgirlfriend hope the pic works out
food,not_removed,the ingredients arent assembled upside down it goes sauce ingredients cheese just like a standard pizza id still call that upside down yo every pizza ive ever eaten has been sauce cheese toppings
food,not_removed,one of each actually heres an image of the cross section i just took it out of the fridge so it isnt the prettiest thing in the world but it gives you an idea
food,not_removed,i feel like a moron now youre right of course but its different for mountain style pizza all the same
food,not_removed,irresistible chili recipes to spice up your life
food,not_removed,radishes yum
food,not_removed,awesome beer too

food,not_removed,yeah kinda have to admit its all about the lime
food,not_removed,both are necessities
food,not_removed,long time amateur chef long time reddit reader first time poster here in ufood the sauce isnt shown because in the photos i took it looked like dog waste edit for those asking for pictures of the dog waste here it is httpsimgurcomaldctg
food,not_removed,like dog wasteawesome
food,not_removed,good job buddy for professional chefs looking at this how would you plate something like this im looking to step up my plating game but when it comes to a standard meat and potatoes and a veg dish i find it hard to make it elegant perhaps rest the steak on the potatoes with the asparagus draped on top
food,not_removed,not enough pepper on the steak and the sauce is missing yes i read your comment but thats what makes it au poivre
food,not_removed,not steak au poivre you show pan seared strip steak with mushroom bourbon cream sauce lookin damn good too perfect potatoes and asparagus dont try to rewrite classical french cuisine
food,not_removed,proud of you
food,not_removed,ive honestly never seen an au poivre sauce that looked any different good job
food,not_removed,sauce looks good to me
food,not_removed,i left a comment about leaving the sauce off for the photo because it looks horrible in photos but here it is httpsimgurcomaldctg
food,not_removed,professionel chef here first i would use a round plate as squared plates are usally used for dessert if you grilled the meat the sauce comes firstif you cooked it in its own juice the sauce comes on the meat you could use the meat as the center and put the potatoes on the left side and cut the asparagus in half on the right then some herbbutter on the meat and you are done you could also use a salad leaf with some raw cucumbers as garnish
food,not_removed,chef here aswell a good trick is to buid in height just build it as tall as you can peronsally with theese components id probably put the greens at the bottom meat on top and potatos around if i was gonna serve this id put something crunchy on top like fried salsify or something and please for the love of god dont call your steak au poivre it sounds so fucking snobish you just put pepper on it nothing fancy bout it
food,not_removed,httpmimgurcomgallerypwfchto
food,not_removed,if you look closely you can see them but yes this one does not have as many as the other did my wife doesnt like it pepper crusted so i used about half the peppercorns on hers also true i didnt use whole corns i ground them slightly so yes based on the photo of her steak au poivre probably is not an accurate description i would just call this one seared
food,not_removed,commented below but yes this was my wifes and she doesnt like it peppercrusted hers just looked better than mine for photos as shown youre correct not au poivre and now i cant edit the title
food,not_removed,wow good thing youre here to tell people that for no reason
food,not_removed,thank you for clarifying what i am an what im not good thing i have you around
food,not_removed,amen
food,not_removed,dammit woodhouse
food,not_removed,seriously tho amateur chef is like professional unemployed
food,not_removed,this wasnt woodhouses doing
food,not_removed,then thats pretty accurate after taking the classes ended up changing professions now its just a lot of debt for a hobby
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,looks good good job making the crust thin yet not too thin
food,not_removed,i could never make it in the coal mine id be give me four of those
food,not_removed,great job youve inspired me to give it a go
food,not_removed,so overcooked you make me sick
food,not_removed,the food swap thing sounds fun how often do you swap if you dont mind me asking seems like a great way to keep things creative
food,not_removed,yeah its rad probably on average once every weeks
food,not_removed,they live forever in the fridge seriously months months months the suggestion to crack each one into a small bowl or cup before adding it to your ingredients is always a good idea with eggs even newer eggs can have a baddie as eggs get older the air inside the shell expands pushing the entire egg in its sack into one end of the shell youll end up with less actual liquid in the egg so if you see that going on it may be time to toss the rest of them but seriously people in alaska used to only get eggs delivered once a year trust me ive had some for over a year in the fridge and theyve been fine
food,not_removed,id say to open them and smell them you can tell when an egg is rotten if the yolk breaks when you open the egg it means its old and probably best not to consume it
food,not_removed,put them in a glass of water if they sink theyre good if they float probably not
food,not_removed,eggs last all long time and dont need to be refrigerated crack it open into a small bowl if the yolk stays together and it doesnt smell of anything then it is fine
food,not_removed,thats a freshness test not an edible issue
food,not_removed,eggs straight from the chickens ass are fine at room temperature eggs that have been washed store bought should be refrigerated
food,not_removed,the stores here sell them unrefrigerated presumably they are fine to keep without refrigeration in practice we do keep them in the fridge simply because theres a convenient tray for them there
food,not_removed,in the united states eggs are washed at the factory whatever you call it in the process they lose a coating on the shell that keeps them shelfstable american eggs need to be refrigerated
food,not_removed,oh yeah if theyre sold that way i would assume its fine

food,not_removed,my mom used to do a basic meat and cheese stuff but i never enjoyed it as much as i should have now im and putting this as my sunday dinner plan thanks
food,not_removed,why do i always click on these pictures when i am hungry ugh
food,not_removed,never heard of anyone put cheese in them but my grandmother fills them with beef and my father recently made some with rice vegetables and coconut milk
food,not_removed,beef rice onions and cubanelle pepper mixture and topped with a tomato slice 🤤
food,not_removed,stuffed peppers are one of my favorite foods i especially love having them for my birthday dinner in late july with fresh bell peppers from the garden ive never had them with a cheese topping just with tomato sauce on top that looks good
food,not_removed,got a recipe to share
food,not_removed,that looks so good nice frst time
food,not_removed,ya know what try the cheese as the first layer it melts beautifully
food,not_removed,yum hope its as good as your moms dish and i know what you mean i appreciate my moms cooking more now than when i was younger
food,not_removed,instead of cheese put dry cayenne pepper and rice you will be amazed
food,not_removed,surfing this sub until the store opens to get groceries haha
food,not_removed,i have extras and i would share with you
food,not_removed,we put cheese on the ones i make at work i think it makes it a lot better
food,not_removed,share the recipe and well call it even
food,not_removed,k see below
food,not_removed,i used to eat this all the time when i was a kid or eggs and maggi in a french baguette banh mi style banh mi trung so delicious
food,not_removed,is that a giant egg or a tiny bowl i love scrambled fried egg rice and soy sauce i put in seasame oil sometimes too so good all you need is something pickled and salty and youve got a good low cost meal
food,not_removed,that yoke is huge
food,not_removed,that looks delicious definitely going to try this with my so 😍
food,not_removed,kind of like soy sauce very salty but a little sweet too
food,not_removed,yeah i would say its soy saucelike saltier without the sweet profile that regular soy sauce has they dont really sell them in normal grocery stores you can find them in asian supermarkets im curious as to what ops nationality is maggi is extremely common in certain cultures but totally nonexistent in others
food,not_removed,haha probably a bit of both its about the size of a standard rice bowl and the egg did spread a lot when i broke it into the pan
food,not_removed,the way i would eat this would not quite do justice to the patience it took to create it
food,not_removed,ahhhh cake the bane of my existence
food,not_removed,the swirls speak for themselves
food,not_removed,this with a rainbow center is a little girls dream cake i almost expect fairys rainbow unicorns and fairytale creatures to jump out from within xd
food,not_removed,this cake looks so beautiful its so pretty and it looks so yummy i really wanted to try make this cake
food,not_removed,gorgeous looking cake
food,not_removed,i love the color on that frosting
food,not_removed,my wife is going to die when she sees this shes always loved to make baked goods but now shes wanting to delve into deeper into decorating can anyone recommend a good websitestore to buy decorating supplies
food,not_removed,mmmmm cake
food,not_removed,great to look at but that is way too much buttercream to actually eat
food,not_removed,you can actually see the cuts on the top at that point there wouldnt be much to do except just take out a piece and eat it like any other cake
food,not_removed,no such thing as too much buttercream
food,not_removed,is that actually precut or are those just guides to cut it evenly
food,not_removed,just guides
food,not_removed,mmm just kidding takes allot of work to make it look like that bravo
food,not_removed,rhubarb is one of my favourite things bravo sir

food,not_removed,requesting recipe for these
food,not_removed,these money shot annoy me from halfcooked eggs yolk getting splashed in half to these i hope you licked it clean because it is a waste it is pretentious and wasteful
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,we have differing definitions of gorgeous they look like they are supposed to look but they look disgusting lol well done just gross
food,not_removed,actually that is quite wasteful scramble them and feed them to your dog instead d obviously not all at once maybe the equivalent of egg mixed into his dog food per day it adds a bit of extra protein for especially active dogs edit why am i giving dog food advice on this subreddit
food,not_removed,the look in the dogs eyes
food,not_removed,garlic naan and pizza combo sounds and looks amazing
food,not_removed,why did hooman not cook it on higher heat it had so much potential
food,not_removed,they look a little undercooked
food,not_removed,i should have said this was prior to the baking lol
food,not_removed,they didnt mix any sauce with the noodles before plating s
food,not_removed,well stop making noodles with ketchup
food,not_removed,a lot of way too specific criticism for this year old
food,not_removed,the sauce doesnt look bad the pasta looks dry and its not gonna mix well with the sauce on the plate just fish it directly out of the water drop it in the pot or pan with the sauce and mix it up
food,not_removed,that makes me hungry d
food,not_removed,because he doesnt overthink it
food,not_removed,yup that is some super naked pasta right there gonna be bland
food,not_removed,want

food,not_removed,be served in a newspaper you mean the food is wrapped up in a newspaper never happened to me
food,not_removed,nah id at least like a paper plate or those little paper boats or the plastic basket lined with some deli wraps
food,not_removed,are you a freegan true some people prefer eating from trash bins others find it a tad gross
food,not_removed,i know that is traditional in england for fish and chips but frankly i dont really care a plate is fine
food,not_removed,i dont like beer but if i do drink it i have either a heineken or a carlsberg blonde is my prefernce also that looks like a great piece of meat
food,not_removed,welp looks like you got a new prospect can i have my filet now
food,not_removed,i dont own motorcycle but i need to get into your club
food,not_removed,whats the first rule of motorcycle club
food,not_removed,looks a bit more like duck to me ive been vegitarian most of my life though so its just a guess might want to talk to your butcher did you grind these up yourself its important to grind your own meat for safety reasons
food,not_removed,lol thanks heineken is good i didnt separate the chain cause why bother haha
food,not_removed,haha we had a day long dirt riding trip so we made over the top meals every night i was responsible for steak night
food,not_removed,dont talk about motorcycle club
food,not_removed,lol if youre trying to troll youre doing a bad job
food,not_removed,as i think about it they ride without shoes or shirts is probably a terrible rule for motorcycle club
food,not_removed,yeah were an off road club lol that could be slightly dangerous
food,not_removed,are these not real wings
food,not_removed,theres no wings just drumsticks
food,not_removed,looking good need banana for scale

food,not_removed,cups bread flour this gives you a crispy crust all purpose flour for a chewy crust tsp sugar packet instant yeast tbsp kosher salt cups water at degrees tbsp olive oil just mix all dry ingredients in a mixer bowl and while the mixer is running add the water and half of the oil mix until it forms a ball and than knead into as smooth and tight of a ball as you can get on a floured surface grease a bowl with the remaining olive oil and add the dough cover with plastic wrap and let is sit in a warm area to double in size about an hour once doubled cut into two equal pieces and let rest another minutes the rolling out of the dough to the correct thinness and size is where the work comes in practice makes perfect

food,not_removed,anything with cheese will taste good to me
food,not_removed,i mean id try it even though im not a big fan of cauliflower and it looks kind of like rotting pie
food,not_removed,im never buying a purple cauliflower again looks strange
food,not_removed,just tasted not bad for my first attempt more cheese next time
food,not_removed,does it taste different to white cauliflower
food,not_removed,i bet its absolutely delicious just looks like alien fetus
food,not_removed,nope exactly the same
food,not_removed,thank you it did taste great just looked straight up weird
food,not_removed,the lack of action is purely a reflection of peoples feelings on tofu not ur cooking
food,not_removed,tofu is so good man and that looks delicious reminds me of the time where my family would just grace me with the filipino inspired stirfry tofu nothing but soy sauce black pepper annatto powder and caramelized onions
food,not_removed,is that fuchsia dunlops book thats definitely been underutilized in my kitchen i think i have weekend cooking plans now
food,not_removed,that looks delicious i see mushrooms
food,not_removed,should have posted a picture of some donuts
food,not_removed,the tofu had a great texture it is food processed with chopped carrot egg white and potato flour before being fried by the spoonful it is a little fiddly but worth it
food,not_removed,yes it is every recipe we have cooked from there has turned out amazingly well
food,not_removed,anything but tofu
food,not_removed,couldnt tell ya what of that stuff isespecially since once i realized how big the gallery was i scrolled ahead but all of it looks hella good and i would try and probably enjoy most of it
food,not_removed,ive lived in hong kong my entire life hong kong is in guangdong region which is the food region of china im scrolled only through a of your photo album so far and im fucking impressed
food,not_removed,ugly food
food,not_removed,holy hell what the fuck i honestly dont even like chocolate chip cookies all that much but that is gorgeous

food,not_removed,recipe for the chimichurri
food,not_removed,whats the leaf
food,not_removed,are the leaves just for presentation
food,not_removed,perfectly balanced meal
food,not_removed,in a food processor blend the following until fine cups of italian parsley washed stemmed cup oregano cloves garlic crushed cup red wine vinegar a good pinch of kosher salt a good pinch of red pepper flakes fresh ground black pepper to taste with food processor on slowly drizzle in a cup of extra virgin olive oil adjust seasoning to taste and then let it set up in the fridge for at least an hour preferably overnight really easy and really tasty also a lot of room to improvise can use basil or cilantro can use a fresh chili pepper if you want it spicier can use onion or shallot can use some citrus lemon or lime
food,not_removed,a design on the ceramic plates
food,not_removed,theyre a part of the plate not real leaves painted
food,not_removed,is the oregano fresh or dry
food,not_removed,nice presentation
food,not_removed,fresh you can use dry just use less of it as its more concentrated
food,not_removed,these look amazing recipe
food,not_removed,this looks simple and beautiful and i appreciate the more what you didnt put in it leaving two very rich flavors to become the focus im totally going to try this
food,not_removed,please sir i want some more
food,not_removed,starving to death in style
food,not_removed,this is the second chunk ive bought in a week so delicious its aged so it is sharp but not overwhelming ive tried some sharp cheddar in the past that just about knocked me back and thankfully this wasnt that kind of cheese its subtle when you cut it its a bit crumbly but melts in your mouth when i first sampled it i ate two pieces because it was so good
food,not_removed,the dragonfruit really brings the whole thing together
food,not_removed,its a dragon fruit
food,not_removed,is that
food,not_removed,nope its blueberry gravy i was feeling adventurous
food,not_removed,its kimchi fried rice so yes kimchi
food,not_removed,marone those look like my nannies meatballs
food,not_removed,i am going out to buy meat now need to have meatballs as soon as possible thanks for the inspiration
food,not_removed,recipe please
food,not_removed,so nice
food,not_removed,look amazing i always make them homemade at my house my son wont eat them unless theyre homemade now lol
food,not_removed,lol we taught my year old to say oh marone i agree those meatballs look slamming
food,not_removed,thats so cute
food,not_removed,hmm would love to know how to make it
food,not_removed,before the picture even finished loading i was thinking that sounds like an awesome high snack annnnd theres a grinder in the background but for real thats a pretty solid idea could see it thriving as a bar snack or something
food,not_removed,there is was already a chain that offered that i believe it was call tslotskys
food,not_removed,ill go in business with you and match startup capital if you also let me add my idea a breakfast menu that includes both omlettes and skillets with a full coffee menu where you can order any type of coffee you would at starbuckscaribouddi cannot express the utter disappoint of existence that fills me when i am forced to settle for sugar and creamer with my all meat and vegetable skillet i should be able to have a satisfying cup of great fucking caramel mochiatto the way i want it and god dammit thats what are customer deserve
food,not_removed,i would totally eat there
food,not_removed,sounds bready
food,not_removed,theres actually a restaurant in my hometown called the nook and cranny its greek food
food,not_removed,so basically bagel bites then
food,not_removed,lol nice eye
food,not_removed,find a local hipsterish place that does breakfast and look for a proper espresso machine behind the bar they might not have it on the menu but if theyve got the machine they can do anything place i worked we had a grinder and espresso machine in the kitchen and everyone had barista training but all the menu said was espresso drinks under the beverage and desert sections
food,not_removed,clearly you havent been to any midwest suburbs its a untapped market to say the least we do have amazing breweries organic beef burgers sushi and this place redefining chilibut alas no one seems to understand that the choice between skillet or omlette shouldnt be based on location or that i shouldnt have to go to starbucks after breakfast
food,not_removed,midwest market is for steaks and burgers you would find out how costly it is to have a food operation that has starbucks level coffee and to hire employees to make it seems like more of a pain in the neck rather than a restaraunts selling point
food,not_removed,yea ive smoked weed before too
food,not_removed,ive never been so thirsty in my entire life
food,not_removed,try baked sweet potato chips or zucchini chips you just need a mandoline slicer to slice them super thin
food,not_removed,quinoa chips a local store called sprouts has many good chip options
food,not_removed,the other day i sliced ready made polenta into thin small squares and baked at for minutes they puffed up and were slightly salty and completely awesome very similar to those posh puffed potato chips you see around sometimes
food,not_removed,cheese filled naan there is such a thing god is good
food,not_removed,im gonna eat my phone
food,not_removed,thats right theres cheese melted inside of the naan
food,not_removed,the gods
food,not_removed,it legit changed my life these guys make it fresh on order too its ahmed indian restaurant located in orlando fl
food,not_removed,chutney is more of a jam
food,not_removed,isnt this commonplace ive been eating cheese garlic naan since forever here in australia theres also keema naan which is spiced mince inside the naan anyway welcome to nonplain naan l guess
food,not_removed,that is a north american or western adaptation kinda like tex mex or general toas chicken not saying its bad tho i would love to try it
food,not_removed,paneer is a type of cheese but cheese naan is usually made with cheddar those sauces are different kinds of chutney the red is usually a kind of sweet chili chutney and the green is a spicy coriander chutney hope that helps
food,not_removed,i have eaten paneer naan in new delhi they just put the paneer on top it was delicious
food,not_removed,brown is tamarind and the green is mint and cilantro get your game together i live in nashville at the moment and we have onion paneer kulcha just got some last night we also have paneer chile rellenos samosa nachos and calamari sincerely doubt any of those are traditional paneer is technically any type of cheese but the enlightened know what is paneer and what isnt the stuff i get has legit paneer
food,not_removed,try chili capsicum and cheese sooo good or just chilli and cheese or cheese and spinach or cheese and garlic
food,not_removed,so jealous
food,not_removed,dayum i live in india and havent heard about cheese naan up till now
food,not_removed,im pakistani myself and have never seen this at all of the indianpakistani places ive been to in the us alookeemagarlic naan is pretty standard and whata im use to especially at home too when my mom would make it herself back in the day never had seen cheese naan until this restaurant

food,not_removed,looks delicious brown sugar on top
food,not_removed,i season my chicken breast bonelessskinless with garlic salt pepper onion powder and a drizzle of olive oil optional i preheat the oven to ° f and line my baking sheet with tinfoil i cook the breast for minutes a side depending on weight after that time i take them out flip them and cook them for another minutes once done remove from oven and let sit for two minutes before serving enjoy edit formatting
food,not_removed,its really not an issue of how hot the oven is its understanding whats going on regardless of how hot the oven is when a protein type of food is heated its proteins begin to unravel upon which afterwards they connect with each other like velcro the longer they heat the more tighter the protein bond becomes squeezing out moisture as this happens so the secret then first and foremost is not to overcook the meat note though that the thighs are more forgiving when overcookedthey have more fat in thembut not the legs which have less meat and fat so as the meat cooks check with a meat thermometer for about for breasts and for thighs a bit lower for legs andor check for pinkcolored blood with a small slit no you wont let all the juices out so dont worry about that the point is you dont want to cook the meat until its done but juuuuuust almost done why because once its out off the heat it will continue to cook when you let it rest a while due to the residual heat inside it a few more degrees which will finish it off this is the secret for cooking just about any meat fish included which is not forgiving when you overcook it
food,not_removed,i generally cook chicken breast at for minutes per side and it comes out just as good
food,not_removed,i bake and sell cookies once a month these are my knock knock cookies which i came up with for the month of october the name is a playful reference to going trick or treating as a kid since these cookies are studded with reeses pieces candies i was happy with how my photo turned out

food,not_removed,i went to taco bell on my way home decided to spice things up a bit conversation went like this me so ive got a weird order taco bell lady okay thats fine me okay can i get a nachos bell grande with extra everything her thats not weird haha me but i want all of that in a taco salad shell her okay thats weird but we both ended up having a good laugh and in the end it was delicious
food,not_removed,that looks delicious what is it normally served in also this should be a thing
food,not_removed,its normally just nachos in a plastic container i wanted the bowl to be nacho as well figured why not they have the taco salad not a prominent menu item but delicious
food,not_removed,your idea makes so much more sense
food,not_removed,i mean its probably like calories however worth it i rarely eat fast food but when i do its stuff like this
food,not_removed,taco bell is just superior fast food its delicious its cheap its fast the only fast food i would say i like better is innout even though the lines are always a quarter mile long its so worth the wait
food,not_removed,its taco bell definitely not my go to for healthy food
food,not_removed,exactly i cook at home way too often to justify fast food most of the time i mean at home i can whip something up in minutes and have leftovers afterwards for tomorrows work lunch taco bell exact portions and crappy after refrigeration however this was a hangover kind of day

food,not_removed,ranch has a place with buffalo wings that place is in the garbage
food,not_removed,to add to this the kraft and wishbone blue cheeses are disgusting and not the blue cheese referred to here this is thick delicious blue cheese dressing

food,not_removed,as someone whos diet is buff wings but is also english could you provide me with your favourite recipe so i might try and make my own smiley face

food,not_removed,can i have carrots instead of celery
food,not_removed,blue cheese with wings or go fuck your mother
food,not_removed,ok so franks has a good base for wing sauce but everyone needs to stop letting that be your sauce here is how i make mine base with franks stick of butter garlic put in pan first with a little better or oil to reduce and break out flavors and aromas chopped onion in with pan while cooking off garlic table spoon or two of favorite bbq sauce to add a touch of sweetness if you dont like bbq use honey spice up with table spoon of chili flakes black pepper to taste preferably course ground touch of salt and garlic powder i allow a boil for a minute or two if you wish to get a little wild add a bit of cream cheese to your sauce and stir in to give a really creamy finish its good i promise
food,not_removed,fuck bleu cheese give me ranch instead

food,not_removed,why do they add celery i never understood why
food,not_removed,i make some pretty damn good wings on the grill i put dry rub grill them then glaze them with a bbq sauce last couple mins one of my greatest creations lol i put more effort into bbq than cooking
food,not_removed,recipe what sauce do you use i use anchor bar sauce have to order online since i dont live in buffalo
food,not_removed,its and i want some buffalo wings
food,not_removed,this is a bold claim but they have my favorite wings i like them very crispy though check them out sometime theyre on allen st near downtown
food,not_removed,pretty harshbut fair
food,not_removed,i make my sauce with franks extra hot by reducing the franks in a sauce pan with chopped garlic until its noticeably thick then add a corn starch slurry before letting european style butter melt in add the butter after you remove the pan from the heat and straight from the fridge and you get an emulsion that will hold and is full of garlic and heat i use about parts franks to part butter
food,not_removed,at first i thought it was gonna be a nosleep
food,not_removed,why do wings usually come with celery is it tradition or is there a functional purpose for the celery
food,not_removed,damn i want some good wings i moved from rochester to denver and fuck are these wings bad buffalo sauce isnt even hard to make
food,not_removed,wait is buffalo sauce from buffalo ho lee shit i never knew where it came from
food,not_removed,the original buffalo wing restaurant in buffalo is trash some of the worst wings ive ever had

food,not_removed,how do you feel about blanch
food,not_removed,im lucky enough to have this place in my town httpsjtimothyscommenusstarterswingsmenu
food,not_removed,i love making wings i usually find that the first batches dont come out as crispy as the later rounds anyone have any tips for how i can get the early batches to turn out better
food,not_removed,if your looking to find the best sushi in the world where do you go you dont go to some gas station to buy sushi the same principle applies to buffalo wings im not about to go buy some wings from some pretentious stuck up place in la the point isnt that theyre hard to make the point is that wings are inherently better from buffalo
food,not_removed,i hate you so much im hungry and there arent any wings places near me
food,not_removed,going to buffalo for at the ralph never call it the new name and i am looking to hit multiple wing spots i know anchor bar is the original what other suggestions do you have
food,not_removed,that looks amazing i love good wings hard to find in tx but now we have a duffs which makes everything better
food,not_removed,can someone please tell me why regular wings cost more than boneless wings
food,not_removed,blue cheese with wings or go fuck your mother joey coco diaz
food,not_removed,i am definitely a heathen i mix blue cheese and ranch together with a little garlic and cajun seasoning for my wings
food,not_removed,honestly i dont care what anyone says duffs is trash being from niagara falls ny only two places i will go judis across from the factory outlet mall if im feeling hot wingsthey mix the sauce for the hot wings with ketchup to mild it a bit plus on sundays its wings or the wagon wheel on niagara falls blvd across from tops international plus you can get drunk so its even better other than that if im making my own all i use is basically a stick of butter and franks hot saucea lot of butter to make it thicker and then cut up some jalapenos to make it spicier after that use rooties blue cheese anything else can go fuck itself right of wny
food,not_removed,how you feel about boneless wings tho
food,not_removed,hell yes celery is optional may as well be eating water chestnuts with your wings franks is a pretty weak sauce choice
food,not_removed,i saw this earlier at work went home and tried it thank you i now know how to make delicious wings
food,not_removed,please teach me your wing recipe we have buffalo wings where i work and they are horrid
food,not_removed,attempting my first homemade wings this weekend thanks to your post
food,not_removed,blue cheese is some of the worst stuff i have ever tasted and i once ate a raw catfish liver also celery is just a bunch of strings soaked in water
food,not_removed,ranch or riot keep your moldy cheese dip
food,not_removed,i see you mentioned blue cheese what are your opinions on ranch its not acceptable right
food,not_removed,at first i misread it as blue cheese and celery are optional and i was thinking no they are mandatory
food,not_removed,came in her just to comment on the blue cheese celery not being optional thank you in fl people seem to think that just serving a bunch of wings no matter how good is enough wheres my dipping sauce to perfectly control the heat of each bite
food,not_removed,bleu cheese and celery can stay the hell off my plate when i wanna get my wing on i dont want a salad with it
food,not_removed,blue cheese is definitely optional tastes like feet
food,not_removed,am i the only one here who prefers ranch
food,not_removed,cmon man whats the recipe for these good wings
food,not_removed,with celery
food,not_removed,mmhhmhhmmmhmhmmmmmm
food,not_removed,why do you die
food,not_removed,or you dieholy shit
food,not_removed,never tell someone from western ny that you prefer ranch with your wings
food,not_removed,so buffalo ny is the actual home of the buffalo wing like really i always thought that was just a coincidence
food,not_removed,i have a hard time choosing between blue cheese or ranch but pickle over celery every time
food,not_removed,ranch
food,not_removed,agreed its either blue cheese with wings or fuck ya mother
food,not_removed,ranch
food,not_removed,ranch master race
food,not_removed,blue cheese is grossranch until i die
food,not_removed,the people saying they use ranch are the same people who put it on everything no matter what it is
food,not_removed,dicksoutforbluecheese
food,not_removed,ill take some ranch and a couple of tums with that
food,not_removed,im more of a ranch guy
food,not_removed,ranch
food,not_removed,death is a pretty serious consequence
food,not_removed,sauce for the sauce
food,not_removed,does anyone here besides me mix the bleu cheese and each with each other i find it helps if bleu cheese is a little bit too strong for you and buttermilk ranch will keep it rich
food,not_removed,or you dieholy shit
food,not_removed,why do people serve hot foods with creamy dips that do nothing but lessen the heat when i want heat id rather it burn longer and then drink milk at my leisure rather than be forced to do creamy dip
food,not_removed,celery is the devil
food,not_removed,but celery is disgusting
food,not_removed,now i would love to have authentic buffalo wings from buffalo i am not sure if there is a difference but now i want to know thanks also is blue cheese the go to sauce when it comes to buffalo wings southerner who eats them with ranch just wondering thanks
food,not_removed,the people i was eating lunch with today told me they prefer ranch with their wings i dont want to live on this planet anymore
food,not_removed,a family member from buffalo has stated numerous times that buffalo is famous for having invented them but that doesnt reflect quality these look like tiny little tasteless fryers have you had real wings before like real man wings not this turtle food
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,grosss
food,not_removed,celery sure but fuck blue cheese or any dressing for that matter if im gonna eat wings i want to taste wings not salad dressing
food,not_removed,where i come from dressing and celery are for people who cant take the heat
food,not_removed,growing up in buffalo you learn to leave town or become a health pro or professor
food,not_removed,i have a friend who always eats all the celery and absolutely drenches the wings in blue cheese eating some of the celery and putting a little blue cheese on is fine but i just think hes a wimp who cant handle the heat and is lucky enough to also enjoy the taste of blue cheese i love the heat though and im not a huge fan of blue cheese so i prefer the wings on their own
food,not_removed,sorry rather die than grow up in buffalo
food,not_removed,looks great apart from the celery that aniseedy vile stuff can piss off
food,not_removed,this the bills being such a shitty team need to look forward to something on sunday
food,not_removed,i thought in buffalo you learned to play pingpong or you die how bout next time you just post kraft mac n cheese
food,not_removed,add a bit of minced garlic or garlic powder to the sauce makes an incredible difference
food,not_removed,am i the only one who likes wing tips theres pretty much nothing on them but theyre so crispy
food,not_removed,freeze wing tips and save for making stock
food,not_removed,i never used extra vinegar since franks is already pretty vinegary other than that you got it
food,not_removed,any particular reason to use corn oil over canola or vegetable oil
food,not_removed,i lived with two guys from buffalo back in the they would have strangled you for using corn oil peanut oil was the mandated item
food,not_removed,damn ive always used sticks of butter for my sauce
food,not_removed,question on the sauce people in my family have been using pepsi instead of the vinegar for as long as i can remember i wont get lynched if i try that in buffalo will i
food,not_removed,so many people dont get that its just hot sauce and butter no need for more ingredients
food,not_removed,disappointed on your hotsauce choice
food,not_removed,cant buy franks here what to replace it with tabasco
food,not_removed,franks and butter all day get out of here wild wings or whatever the fuck with your flavours there is one flavour its hot
food,not_removed,why toss the tips
food,not_removed,i love you
food,not_removed,i add a little lime juice instead of vinegar to mine the extra tang is awesome
food,not_removed,is a decent substitute or is homebrew the way to go
food,not_removed,dip them in sauce are you a three year old who isnt allowed to make a mess they need to be tossed in the sauce until they cant be any more covered
food,not_removed,you dont do anything here you just heat up premade sauce s
food,not_removed,franks red hot sauce you lost me already franks red hot is piss and vinegar
food,not_removed,but the tips are the best part
food,not_removed,red wine vinegar cup weird way to spell lemon juice
food,not_removed,those who live in buffalo dont call it the buffalo wing they are just called wings
food,not_removed,i forgot which one of these statements was said to me in medical school buffalo has the highest incidence of cardiovascular disease or buffalo has the most heart attacks in america neither was good news
food,not_removed,will you pay all my gas if i just drive there im really feeling a road trip
food,not_removed,joey coco diaz approves thy cry
food,not_removed,pretty sure thats blue cheese in the pic
food,not_removed,i literally checked this thread for this comment i love you and coco
food,not_removed,well thats sort of rude
food,not_removed,you like the taste of stomach acid
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,which duffs was it
food,not_removed,god i went on a work trip to buffalo and got a chance to eat at duffs the wings were sooo good went there more times before we left
food,not_removed,any restaurant that ive worked at used canola oil i dont know if thats because of cost or allergy issues but its all ive ever known
food,not_removed,peanut oil burns at a higher temp than most so you can get it hotter without it smoking or imparting a burned flavor that means you can get things crispier
food,not_removed,yay for education
food,not_removed,in buffalo they are just wings my friends dad who is from buffalo
food,not_removed,thats acceptable better than ranch by far
food,not_removed,i never dip my wings my fries will be dipped in copious amounts of ketchup though
food,not_removed,the sauce bauce
food,not_removed,do you know what specifically made you break out maybe you could make your own at home without whatever caused the reaction
food,not_removed,right on top of the blue cheese at the bottom of the trash can
food,not_removed,next to the chicken bones
food,not_removed,afaik we use kens at the restaurant where i work
food,not_removed,why not both
food,not_removed,considering she called it buffalo chicken id probably skeptical of her claim to being from buffalo
food,not_removed,well honestly if your not from buffalo you dont know good buffalo chicken thats just how it works we dont claim to make good cajun food
food,not_removed,you disgust me
food,not_removed,very much i work in a hotel near the buffalo airport and it drives me crazy the amount of people that get ranch instead of blue cheese
food,not_removed,its not an option
food,not_removed,yes
food,not_removed,ranch is the sauce of choice here ive never seen someone dip in blue cheese
food,not_removed,chicken plus wings and others heat to hot
food,not_removed,the sauce has ingredients franks red hot butter vinegar portions vary according to tastespicy preference heat the sauce til the butter melts fry the wings and drain toss them in the sauce and serve with side of celery and bleu cheese dressing this is universal across upstate ny
food,not_removed,it helps cool the heat of the wings when you eat the celery
food,not_removed,also the crisp neutral flavor of celery cuts the rich tangy winds and is a bit of a palate cleaner
food,not_removed,httpportfoliodustweborgwebpokesiteimagesfarfetchdgif
food,not_removed,both are there to cut the heat of the wings
food,not_removed,ill be honest ive never understood the celery maybe its there to cut the heat down if it gets to be too much the blue cheese is there for dipping the hot sauce and blue cheese go together like pbj in my opinion
food,not_removed,weve all been there man just stay strong
food,not_removed,i dont think you know what a vegan is
food,not_removed,you got something against the greatest condiment of all time
food,not_removed,ill admit im not a celery fan either for me i only eat it with wings and ill only eat a stalk or two at most
food,not_removed,theres no secret to authentic wings fry raw unbreaded wings in oil at degrees for minutes take them out of the fryer and immediately put them in a bowl and toss them in franks red hot sauce and melted butter i like mine hot so i only put in a splash of butter the more butter you put in the more mild theyll be eat them immediately while theyre still steaming im also a big fan of garlic parmesan wings franks red hot sauce and butter about medium heat add in a pinch of dried basil some fresh garlic and a good amount of grated parm such a good flavor
food,not_removed,i like to do a spicy bbq style it involves making a wing sauce out of just any old cheap but thick bbq sauce i then add honey garlic powder red pepper flakes and an amount of powerful hot sauce that last part is important as the hotter the hot sauce the less of it you need and the less your bbq sauce takes on of its flavor and simply just adds the heat i have made my own in that regard using an extract of serrano chilis but the best results i have had was with a little bottle of hot sauce that had a skull on it all i needed was a cap full small cap and that would provide plenty of heat to the sauce i fry the wings at for mins and then toss in sauce till coated all over i find this sauce to be my favorite because it has just the right amount of sweet and heat but make sure to taste as you make it because everyones preference is different
food,not_removed,buffalo born here we found an even better trick than boiling steam for minutes minimal wingonwing contact cool in a fridge for minutes until wings reach room temperature bake
food,not_removed,definitely gonna need to try this im assuming that boiling for min should cook them all the way through also how long do you recommend baking
food,not_removed,yes sir
food,not_removed,absolutely
food,not_removed,fuck me im going to make this
food,not_removed,buffalo wild wings does not help with that lol
food,not_removed,this guy is the real og right here
food,not_removed,dude i live in there new place to try
food,not_removed,as it should cuz blue cheese is the only way
food,not_removed,you wanna fight cuz it sounds like you wanna fight
food,not_removed,you can use ranch sure you can if you are a millennial tight pants wearing look at my fohawk big glasses piece of bullshit if you go somewhere and cant get wings with celery and bleu cheese you should slap the owner leave and then piss on the door handle so no one else walks in this sub par establishment
food,not_removed,coating them in flour makes them breaded
food,not_removed,i do something similar at work sometimes i fry them toss in bbq sauce with honey and franks and then caramelize them on the grill
food,not_removed,i just use franks red hot and butter more likely than not thats what anchor bar uses too they just sell anchor bar sauce to make extra money on the side
food,not_removed,dont act like youve never woken up and eaten wings first thing weve all been there
food,not_removed,whats the name of the place
food,not_removed,buffalostyle chicken wings aka wings were invented at the anchor bar in buffalo ny
food,not_removed,i completely agree i always tell people from out of town to go there so they can say theyve been but pretty much any pizza place in the city is gonna have wings that are on par with if not better than anchor bar
food,not_removed,im not sure what that is
food,not_removed,cook them longer or cook them most of the way pull them out if the fryer for a few minutes and fry them a few minutes more
food,not_removed,i made these at work lol
food,not_removed,dont go to anchor bar if youve never been take a picture outside but dont eat there because their wings are average at best duffs is by far the best and theres one fairly close to the ralph bar bills in east aurora next town over from orchard park has really good wings too after those two everyone tends to disagree
food,not_removed,my guess would be that boneless wings are more processed and they normally come breaded
food,not_removed,you sound like someone from the falls
food,not_removed,theyre fancy chicken nuggets
food,not_removed,i just use franks red hot sauce and a little bit of butter but how good they depends on other stuff too for authentic buffalo wings you just fry them raw and unbreaded for about and then toss them immediately in the sauce
food,not_removed,while i do agree with your general distaste for blue cheese i find celery very light and refreshing its like biting into a small sip of water
food,not_removed,you probably had an overripe cheese blue cheese is a live cheese this means that it will ripen over time if it is left in storage too long the mold will become overripe and taste bad when first exposing your palate to cheese its best to start with a young cheese you dont acquire a taste for sharp stuff overnight
food,not_removed,agreed sir i care not for bleu cheese and celery joins cucumbers in that category for me water in vegetable form no flavor a cucumber that hasnt been pickled has not achieved its destiny
food,not_removed,amen
food,not_removed,i honestly didnt even know people ate them with wings until i was about years old ive still never tried it so i couldnt tell you lol
food,not_removed,not even close but youre all wrong d
food,not_removed,butter and franks he probably assume it was widely known
food,not_removed,when you move out of your parents house you starve to death
food,not_removed,fuck that if i ever go to buffalo im bringing my own bottle of ranch dressing with me and if i ever go to chicago bringing the ketchup
food,not_removed,invented at anchor bar on the corner of main north
food,not_removed,sorry is this sounds blunt but thats the weirdest thing ive ever heard
food,not_removed,every time i order wings and they ask blue cheese or ranch i wonder who are the psychos ordering ranch
food,not_removed,i use ranch for wings and thats it
food,not_removed,i use ranch for wings and absolutely nothing else
food,not_removed,people who use ranch probably order the wings mild too
food,not_removed,you say that like its a bad thing
food,not_removed,both its amazing
food,not_removed,its just franks red hot and a splash of butter
food,not_removed,yeah if youre from buffalo it seems weird to think about eating them with ranch i actually didnt even know people ate them with ranch until i was about years old
food,not_removed,what qualifies wings to be real wings just curious
food,not_removed,me too thanks
food,not_removed,how do you do it where you live wing master
food,not_removed,or for people who like dressing and celery
food,not_removed,sounds like you could be worse things
food,not_removed,we wouldnt want you here anyway
food,not_removed,absolutely agree i actually do mine by color i add in butter then franks until its a little darker than i would want for a buffalo sauce then garlic powder until its a little lighter awesome stuff
food,not_removed,if im frying wings i keep them on because i like eating crispy skin if im smoking wings i cut them off because they just burn
food,not_removed,nope no need to waste them just the tips
food,not_removed,someone down lower says they make chicken stock from the tips i have too but it really got to the point where i had little baggies full of wing tips in the freezer and never made the stock
food,not_removed,never throw out anything
food,not_removed,yes but will you actually make the stock or will you have little baggies throughout your freezer with wing tips
food,not_removed,its blue cheese and wings or go fuck your mother
food,not_removed,i use white vinegar when it heats up you get the bite on the nose when you eat them i think it adds a lot
food,not_removed,im lazy and i just use the franks buffalo wing sauce course i dont live in buffalo so i suppose im allowed to be a little lazy
food,not_removed,yes you are right but we just love the vinegar cutting through the sauce and the butter for that tang so actually i guess i was being conservative in my recipe above i put enough vinegar over the sauce in the pan to almost cover the surface of the sauce
food,not_removed,the extra vinegar seems to make it spicier could be my imagination
food,not_removed,i saved this comment hoping that someone would reply any answers
food,not_removed,my answer is that i was taught to make wings originally from an nearly original buffalo wingmaker no reason was given just stated as part of the deal in my experience though corn oil just seems to make a better overall fry if that makes sense certainly way different thatn regular vegetable oil which i have had to use under desperate conditions someone elsewhere seems bent on using peanut oil which i must say i have never tried but i do know that peanut oil is way more expensive than ordinary corn oil which too is sometimes expensive as it is wings are people food they break the ice between new friends because you have to eat with your hands and make a mess which makes them more inclined toward those on budgets and not those that go out to restaurants a lot
food,not_removed,auuuuuughhh consider me strangled ive used peanut oil to make omelettes and then have it go rancid in the cupboard due to disuse because it seemed like a kind of luxury oh i learned in the before anyone ever even heard of buffalo wings i should try it though because well wings
food,not_removed,depends on how mild you want the sauce i like mine hot so i only use a splash just to thicken it up a little and help the sauce stick
food,not_removed,yes but how much sauce everything is relative if you see my recipe ounces is half the regular size bottle so sticks of butter is about a cup or ounces so you would have more butter than sauce depends on proportions we often make wings just for the two of us so we dont need gallons of sauce like you might for a party
food,not_removed,pepsi doesnt sound like it would make any more difference than water vinegar is acidic and always has an affect on foods when used and are you kidding they strangled me for using corn oil pick a rope you like
food,not_removed,and vinegar ingredients
food,not_removed,franks ive tried a lot of other brands and they are usually quite harsh there are a lot of louisiana hot sauces out there probably more than i have ever tried franks is the sauce of choice for me after years of making wings in fact even franks can have greatly differing batches depending on many factors including weather fertilizers season length etc if you open a bottle of franks put your nose right over it and it should have a sweetly pungent and agreeable aroma not a peppery and harsh odor it should smell good if you get a new bottle that smells bad like that you might as well go to another store and try to find another date code batch because otherwise your wings will just taste like the frozen buffalo wings in your grocers freezer case made with inferior hot sauce also if you leave an open bottle of franks in your refrigerator for too long it too will develop into a different tasting and harsh sauce never boil the sauce when you make it if you do and you have more sauce start over because you just wrecked your sauce
food,not_removed,some form of louisiana hot sauce is usually available where are you located
food,not_removed,it isnt nearly as delicious better to stick with franks and butter
food,not_removed,ive never actually even tried it ive always just give with franks and butter
food,not_removed,its frozen pizza vs restaurant has its uses if you just want a reasonable facsimile with no work but without the butter and additional seasonings its a pretty pale comparison
food,not_removed,its just semantics calm down
food,not_removed,haha yes we used to fry our wings keep them warm in the oven and then in a large dutch oven pour the sauce over them and then toss them in there upside down etc for the last years we have made wings straight from the fryer to the mouth if you will fry them let cool slightly dip in sauce or roll them in sauce until they cant soak up any more depending on your taste and serve them up immediately the crispiness is best at this point an holding wings in an oven just loses some of the great delightfulness sometimes people have to wait to eat with this method while watching wing sauce roll down the chin of their friends
food,not_removed,hate you are getting downvotes for enjoying messy food and having an opinion this sub is full of anger i was diagnosed with celiac a while back and can eat buffalo wings with one precaution sauce on the side some of the asian type sauces contain gluten in the soy sauce i thought the very same thing you did and bemoaned the idea of dipping my wings and not eating them like messy stubby wolverine claws wedged between my fingers alas i need some junk food so i ordered my wings with sauce on the side like some gentrified pedestrian what i discovered changed my outlook on wings forever and i will never return to messy wings even if they cure this damned wheat allergy my friend the wings stay crispy not just for a moment but the entire meal you can also put as much sauce as you like all over the crispy chicken flippers and let it run down to your elbows if you like they usually give you more than enough sauce to just get all fucked up on vinegar spice seriously give it a try and if you still dont feel it does it justice pour the side sauce on the wings and toss them at the table like some fancy waiter making a caesar salad
food,not_removed,ha
food,not_removed,or chicken wings if youre being fancy
food,not_removed,once i left buffalo i had to start referring to them as the one true wing
food,not_removed,its a line from a comedian gotta love uncle joey
food,not_removed,yes
food,not_removed,sheridan in amherst
food,not_removed,bonchon chicken anyone if you love crispy wings you gotta try korean style basically season wings to your liking and toss in corn starch fry let rest for min and then fry again once they are done prepare as traditional buffalo or whatever else makes them extra crispy and they dont get soggy after tossing in sauce game changer for sure
food,not_removed,these look like they came out of duffs on sheridan nice work buddy
food,not_removed,quick note i dont think peanut oil contains the allergen that we typically associate with peanut allergies edit it seems to depend on the person but its not source family allergist we have a peanut allergy in our household we were told not to avoid peanut oil
food,not_removed,makes sense probably both reasons my buddys mom was from buffalo and gave me the peanut oil suggestion it was a game changer crispcrunch on another level highly recommend its expensive though so kind of a bitch for a larger deep fryer although whats also great about it is it doesnt absorb the flavor of the food you are frying as much so its solid to reuse andor fry different types of food in the same session
food,not_removed,ive read that canola oil can retain much more heat than most oils and therefore can give you a crispier wing
food,not_removed,im gonna go with smoke point nonresearched guess
food,not_removed,outback uses beef tallow
food,not_removed,ya weve been big fans of peanut oil too much crispy
food,not_removed,fuck the down votes stay strong blue cheese dressing
food,not_removed,im allergic to penicillin and most molds i guessfound out later after a test the only thing i can think of trying is to see if it was more the amount that made me break out that bad or if even the smallest bit would do it to me
food,not_removed,both would b fine
food,not_removed,well considering it was in a hoagie it probably wasnt a wing
food,not_removed,how so its just chicken wings with franks red hot and butter its not like theres regional specific ingredients that can only be found in buffalo
food,not_removed,blue cheese disgusts me
food,not_removed,the question is why do you care what other people eat
food,not_removed,you cant tell me what to do ill put god damn ketchup on my buffalo wings if i want
food,not_removed,when i lived in buffalo as a kid we moved away in there was a place by the airport called the wing king i think i often wonder if its still there bc it was where i fell in love with wings
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,i work at an alarm company by the airport wings are looking good friend
food,not_removed,i think you have too high of an opinion of yourself for someone who works at an airport hotel
food,not_removed,i visited the us for two weeks uker i had it with blue cheese in that short amount of time
food,not_removed,get out
food,not_removed,youve never seen anyone eat a proper order of wings then
food,not_removed,how many heats do you need
food,not_removed,uh yeah ive done franks red hot sauce and butter but would love a recipe that is better and more authentic
food,not_removed,yeah same reason ginger goes with sushi
food,not_removed,thats a leek not celery
food,not_removed,no but i do have something against ranch
food,not_removed,you put franks red hot for your garlic parmesan i just use melted butter and garlic with the parm of course
food,not_removed,is there a secret to making the sauce stick to the wings better i feel like every time i make wings the sauce will run off
food,not_removed,i like mine hot franks red hot httpiimgurcomjgnsdbjjpg
food,not_removed,love me some hot bbq wings
food,not_removed,i have tried the steaming i dont find much differance but personally find boiling easier mainly because i have a big pot for lots of wings and not a big steamer
food,not_removed,doest cook them all the way but for cooking time in oven i just wait till they look great on all sides good luck
food,not_removed,never boil meat
food,not_removed,blue cheese tastes like feet ranch is the only way
food,not_removed,goddamn smartest thing ive read all day
food,not_removed,ranch is what white trash and black people eatrich yuppies and hipsters are the ones eating blue cheese what america do you live in ive worked in restaurants that serve chicken wings also if youre whoring out so hard for blue cheese you should at least learn how to spell it
food,not_removed,agree to disagree might be splitting hairs here i meant that i did not use an egg wash for a thick breading just a coating of flourbaking powder
food,not_removed,frying than grilling seems like an intestine combo got to try it
food,not_removed,thanks ive tried franks and is one of my top go to sauces i try buffalo sauce on almost everything
food,not_removed,more like i wanted to be there but was in bed staring at yours
food,not_removed,blue cheese ranch blanch its excellent
food,not_removed,i ate at anchor bar before and i guess just being so young it was lost on me but i was pretty impressed heard great things about duffs but i am also looking for somewhere totally local that you know
food,not_removed,haha true but still good 😏
food,not_removed,yeah i can get why some water strings might be appealing it just isnt to me
food,not_removed,i love celery so much i wake up in the middle of the night craving it my husband thinks im crazy hey at least im not eating junk food
food,not_removed,im with op here blue cheese tastes horrible to me ive tried it many times thinking maybe this one would be different nope
food,not_removed,seriously i could make this stuff in my sleep
food,not_removed,yeah its like asking the recipe for lemonade
food,not_removed,til something new thanks
food,not_removed,hot chicken
food,not_removed,this just sounds like the south i miss upstate ny even most places in pa and nj manage to screw up wings by trying to improve the recipe weird tangy orange sauce breaded wings baked wings theyre all wrong
food,not_removed,i mean i dont dip the pickle in the sauce i just eat it im glad i have made an impact in your life though
food,not_removed,thanks looks good thats how i do mine as well
food,not_removed,so i was at buffalo wild wings this past weekend eating spicy garlic wings with buffalo and ranch i can see the appeal i thought about this post after i ate them
food,not_removed,nice roasters for something that takes longer than minutes to deep fry whether it be breaded or naked simple seasoning is key although i will say now that im at work and look at the image on a computer they dont look as small as i initially thought
food,not_removed,that sounds good
food,not_removed,ah ok fair i usually just end up eating them when they come from a roast
food,not_removed,mad flavor if you dont know what were referencing take a chance bitch columbus did
food,not_removed,came here for this was not disappointed
food,not_removed,i will try that next time makes sense
food,not_removed,it increases acidity which can bring out some more flavor it doesnt make it spicier
food,not_removed,i looked up smoke points and refined corn oil is higher than refined canola or vegatable the higher temperatures could mean a better fry
food,not_removed,general rule is sticks is mild stick is hot and reduce from there if you like it hotter
food,not_removed,i feel like pepsi is going to result in a sweeter sauce than using water though or vinegar for that matter and oh oh my
food,not_removed,im in germany i love hot sauce but i have never tried franks red hot and ordering it is very expensive i will try a lousiana style thank you very much
food,not_removed,not disputing that im disputing that its any good
food,not_removed,just come on back ill buy you an order
food,not_removed,i drove past there yesterday and really considered going in i wound up just making them at work for myself duffs is king though 👑
food,not_removed,the og
food,not_removed,ayyy drove past duffs several times a week going to ub
food,not_removed,every bon chon ive been to has had terrible service and is way overpriced however their food is pretty good
food,not_removed,korean style chicken for life
food,not_removed,what type of oil would you use with this method sounds great
food,not_removed,deep fry or frying panfry
food,not_removed,duffs and coles down on elmwood were my favorite wings
food,not_removed,my son has a peanut allergy and has reactions to peanut oil depends on the person imo
food,not_removed,the type of oil you fry in has no bearing on the crispiness if you want super crispy look into double frying whereby you partially cook em first then finish them in the hot oil works fantastic with fries as well
food,not_removed,the only thing i can think of trying is to see if it was more the amount that made me break out that bad or if even the smallest bit would do it to me dont fuck with allergic reactions you dont have a fixed threshold with allergic reactions
food,not_removed,yeah i mean molds what makes the blue cheese blue so that makes sense too bad too blue cheese is effing awesome i love it on a nice rare steak not even the dressing just some blue cheese crumbled into some butter and allowed to melt all over when it comes off the grillpan
food,not_removed,i hate all blue cheese dressing except for homemade buttermilk mayo blue cheese crumbles spices the end its not that runny sweet crap most places sell
food,not_removed,how is this possible
food,not_removed,elitism
food,not_removed,its like its betraying the originality of it its like going to philly and getting a cheese steak from pats with mozzarella or getting a hot dog in chicago with ketchup
food,not_removed,for me its the feeling that other people are missing out on something amazing
food,not_removed,ill use fucking honey mustard i can and have
food,not_removed,i dont approve of you putting ketchup on your wings but you can damn do whatever you please
food,not_removed,ive never heard of it and i work right across the street from the airport
food,not_removed,this is my restaurant job in the buffalo area and this one is by far the best i didnt learn to make wings here though also its a really nice hotel not some roach infested dungeon
food,not_removed,id say franks and butter is authentic ive never had wings in buffalo but everywhere ive worked that sold wings that tasted like classic wings used franks and butter although i think franks does a separate buffalo style sauce which i havent tried so i may be talking out of my ass
food,not_removed,like the other guy said franks and butter is the traditional recipe ive watched a few short documents about the original buffalo wing and everyone does no breading franks red hot and butter you have to remember that wings were created in a bar in about minutes not some fancy restaurant that had tons of ingredients sitting around and all day to build a pepper sauce
food,not_removed,yea except youre eating a plate of the exact same stuff
food,not_removed,ehh i find sushi alright bad joke
food,not_removed,youre a leek
food,not_removed,yeah its more for the flavor than for the heat though
food,not_removed,sick bro
food,not_removed,a good majority of breaded wing recipes out there dont use an egg wash just flour i dont really see the point since the skin should get crispy in its own
food,not_removed,if youre in buffalo thats how laportas does their bbq wings which makes them really good
food,not_removed,duffs is local but if you want super local bar bills is good la nova is good just pizza is also good really any local pizzeria is gonna have good wings
food,not_removed,username checks out
food,not_removed,pickles are to nashville hot chicken as celery is to buffalo wings
food,not_removed,my sister lives in colorado for a while one day a family invited her over for dinner with a surprise they made her wings but the were breaded and baked they didnt even have hot sauce on them if it wouldve been me i wouldve dragged them out to the kitchen immediately and taught them how to do them the right way
food,not_removed,dont think ive ever been offered a pickle with wings but i want now because now thats my fetish
food,not_removed,yeah man these are xl theyre not the biggest ive seen but they take about to fry all the way through
food,not_removed,better get there soon its almost october
food,not_removed,thats exactly what i was doing actually i was on the stampede when i looked up
food,not_removed,definitly worth a try even if you fry them up yourself its pretty awesome method
food,not_removed,theres a chicken place in k town called turntable its one of my favorite places in the city
food,not_removed,peanut oil if youre pan frying
food,not_removed,high smoke point so peanut or coconut is what we use
food,not_removed,deep fry
food,not_removed,i deliver for coles occasionally but ive never eaten there even though i live down the street ill have to try them out soon
food,not_removed,barbill in east aurora is my favorite
food,not_removed,good to know they werent very clear but i was surprised at how they kind of waved it off probably just because we had never avoided it in the past and they didnt appear to react to it then
food,not_removed,totally depends i am one of the lucky ones i once read it was
food,not_removed,it depends on how refined the oil is iirc
food,not_removed,the last place i worked at did this they fried the wings for about minutes pulled them out for and put them back in for another or so crisped the hell out of them
food,not_removed,it could different oils have different smoke temperatures this could potentially limit how hot you can get the oil
food,not_removed,the type of oil you fry in has no bearing on the crispiness do you have a source on this claim
food,not_removed,im still sticking to my opinion having fried with a plethora of oils crisp flavor color peanut oil
food,not_removed,try this stuff its usually in the produce section near the bags of lettuce at the supermarket
food,not_removed,what spices would you recomend my place of work just had a standard recipe of buttermilk mayo and blue cheese crumbles but id like to spice it up edit lol i did not actually intend that pun
food,not_removed,come visit us in buffalo my friend
food,not_removed,i prefer roquefort
food,not_removed,try the cheesecake factorys wicked good
food,not_removed,no one living in buffalo is elite in any sense of the word
food,not_removed,thats a shame because bleu cheese tastes like soap to me so its not possible for me to enjoy it even if i wanted to
food,not_removed,grow up edit anyone that is going to actually bash on someone for a condiment preference is a childish jackass keep on downvoting it just proves me right
food,not_removed,thats rarely the case though most people get ranch because they tried blue cheese and didnt like it for them its not amazing
food,not_removed,you are still way too pretentious about offal drenched in hot sauce
food,not_removed,any restaurant ive worked at in the buffalo area just used franks red hot and butter for classic wings including duffs and anchor bar
food,not_removed,franks buffalo sauce isnt authentic the real deal is franks red hot butter and some vinegar heat but dont let it boil
food,not_removed,wasnt the legend that they were snowed in and basically just used whatever they had left to feed their patrons thats the story i heard growing up
food,not_removed,isnt that the exact same situation pictured above
food,not_removed,so youre saying im delicious and mouthwatering thanks
food,not_removed,youre a root youre a damn root
food,not_removed,and how does one make this red sauce you speak of
food,not_removed,better than the anchor bar i always heard good things about that place
food,not_removed,they made her wings but the were breaded and baked ummm thats just fried chicken
food,not_removed,fried pickles are amazing if youve never had them i go to this one hometown place and get fried pickles and honey hot sauce wings
food,not_removed,duffs on sheridan i where its at
food,not_removed,used to be monday night football was free wings they were huge enourmous things with just a nice bbq sauce i spent way way too much timemoney in that place and goodbar
food,not_removed,barbill and goodbar for dayyyys i miss buffalo sometimes
food,not_removed,we always baked ours in sheet trays first then only had to fry for min less of a beating on your fryer when frying raw wings which usually take minutes
food,not_removed,these look like gabriels gate wings any chance you worked there
food,not_removed,i always understood that crispness had everything to do with the heat and heat capacity of the oil which would vary depending on oil
food,not_removed,years of experience think about it oil is just the medium in which you cook the wings a deep fryer typically runs in the f range thats what cooks the wings the hot oil evaporating moisture at high temp it makes absolutely no difference what the type of oil is now for taste totally different but crispiness nope
food,not_removed,ive had that stuff its not bad
food,not_removed,marzettis is better and its right next to maries in my supermarketif they have it try marzettis ultimate blue cheese
food,not_removed,garlic and onion powder celery salt smoked paprika cayenne sugar white vinegar obviously salt and white pepper i think thats about it
food,not_removed,well thats not really a pun since its where that saying comes from right
food,not_removed,i was a ranch fan when i lived in ny
food,not_removed,i do too but i wouldnt drown it in buttermilk and mayo just the crumbles are great
food,not_removed,i dont care for cheesecake factorys truckedin foods but if i ever end up at one for some reason ill try to remember that thx
food,not_removed,except at a bills game when your rooting for the other team or at mighty taco down the street after the game when my team lost
food,not_removed,except when it comes to wings
food,not_removed,same here it doesnt even taste like something people should eat
food,not_removed,samefreakin gross
food,not_removed,fuck blue cheese ranch for life seriously though fuck blue cheese that shit is so nasty to me
food,not_removed,well thats fine for those people but im talking about the people who say they dont like it but have never tried it
food,not_removed,im so sad none of my friends wanted to go to duffs after the bills win this past sunday
food,not_removed,there are many places in buffalo that serve great wings duffs is good but over rated i would suggest gabriels gate in the city or tavern in the burbs i suggest the bar bill in east aurora they have a hybrid bbq hot wing that will make your heart sing
food,not_removed,i keep the sauce at room temp and let the wings straight from the fryer heat it up
food,not_removed,cleansing your palette so you caneat more wings
food,not_removed,you just buy it in a jug if it aint broke dont fix it
food,not_removed,ive only been to anchor bar once but in buffalo pretty much every pizza place is also a wing place and has good wings if i want bbq wings i go with laportas because they grill them after tossing them in sauce which chars the sauce and is really good here they are on the right
food,not_removed,ive tried them a few times but part of what i love about pickles is them being cool and crisp that has been lost on each one that ive tried ive only tried them as chips though i wonder if trying them as spears they would retain that better with less surface area
food,not_removed,a restaurant i worked at did that for parties that ordered wings it does make it a lot easier
food,not_removed,this thread is actually the first ive ever heard of them even though apparently theyre right around the corner from my building
food,not_removed,yes but deep fryers run so you have a large selection of neutral oils to choose from that will do the exact same job
food,not_removed,thanks im pretty sure we were running low tonight so ill try this tomorrow night
food,not_removed,my father knows a killer roquefort dressing recipe from when he worked at a classic diner the diner eventually closed after years due to state law forbidding selling of alcohol within yards of a church but still their salads were great
food,not_removed,trucked in foods sure the ingredients may be trucked there but theres assembly required they make all sauces from scratch
food,not_removed,well youre both wrong and were all right so go fuck your mother
food,not_removed,why would you want to do that to yourself all i can imagine is waiting for an hour to get a single order nothing against them theyre the best but that place must be a mad house on bills game day
food,not_removed,i used to live in east aurora and got bar bills a few times i agree that theyre bomb
food,not_removed,yea those look good
food,not_removed,the oils ability to hold heat release and regain is also important when it comes to frying if i have pots of oil at and drop a batch in both it will still take them different amounts of time to cook the wings to donenes then reheat for the next batch because of the heat that is lost during the cooking process the faster the wing cooks the crisper they are
food,not_removed,let me know what you think
food,not_removed,oh goddamn it i hate rules like that you ought to be grandfathered in if youre there before the law is passed also dafuq separation of church and state
food,not_removed,oh thats good its been a long time since i ate there but they used to preorder desserts from sysco not even cheesecake factory brand foods just the generic cheesecake off the order form then foofooed it up and sold it for the price i stopped going because the food was applebees quality has it improved
food,not_removed,the wings come fairly quick once you sit down and if you get there fast enough the wait to sit isnt too bad plus were still usually waiting for the tailgating buzz to wear off before driving back to rochester
food,not_removed,well its utah but the church was completely fine with it and it wasnt full chapel the church was there first because the diner moved to get more parking as they couldnt support all their customers so once they got their license revoked people stopped coming because they drink wine with their classic italian food but still that place was around since the and i considered it a historical landmark and it gave my father a job when he was to help support his family after his father got hit by a drunk driver
food,not_removed,they have always made their own cheesecakes in ca then flash freezed them to ready them for shipping now the cheesecakes at sams club costco bjs etc with cheesecake factorys name on it those are bullshit and made by another company ive worked for several restaurants in my life and although i hated the cheesecake factory by the time i quit i will tell you they hold themselves to a standard
food,not_removed,they arrive by truck predeep frozen
food,not_removed,recipe dozen wings really ripe banana cup of sriracha salt and pepper to taste juice of half a lime a cup of pickle juice wash wings place in container with pickle juice and allow to brine in fridge for at least one hour remove peel from banana remove chicken from fridge and drain remaining juice place dried wings and banana in smoker allow chicken and banana to smoke for half hour between after one hour remove banana and allow wings to become crispy to preference place banana and sriracha in food processor pulse until smooth remove wings from smoker and toss wings in sauce eat them all by yourself
food,not_removed,banana though seems odd talk dirty to me how strong is the banana taste do you dip in anything they look good on their own are they spicy gimme dem statistics
food,not_removed,wings are my favorite thing to eat looks great
food,not_removed,i wouldve never thought to use banana in a wing sauce they look amazing though
food,not_removed,banana was to add some healthy sweetness and to mellow out the sriracha and i wont food sext the particulars

food,not_removed,daww well aint that the cutest lil pie you ever did see
food,not_removed,is that pecan piecupcake that looks fucking delish
food,not_removed,looks delicious but id rather eat each of those things separately
food,not_removed,little biiiiits
food,not_removed,wow my two favorite kinds of deserts
food,not_removed,keep going put a tiny cake on the pie then a tiny cookie then a tiny ball of ice cream
food,not_removed,as if my weakness for both cupcakes and pecan pie couldnt get any worse
food,not_removed,cute
food,not_removed,where did you get this
food,not_removed,there is nowhere near enough cream on that pie especially if it is a tiny piece of pie the cream must be miniscule it needs swamping with cream
food,not_removed,this needs more updates this needs to be more common there should not be a cupcake eaten without its slice of pie everytime anyone asks for a cupcake the response should be which kind of pie do you want with that
food,not_removed,thats cute and looks delicious
food,not_removed,can you imagine turning that into a cupcake sandwich sweet jesus

food,not_removed,what does swiss chalet sauce taste like by the way good looking birds
food,not_removed,they closed the last swiss chalet in my area about years ago now i have to cross the border to get my fix i tell my friends that im going to ontario for cuban cigars and cannabis seeds when in actuality its simply to get a harveys burger for lunch and a chicken and ribs combo at swiss chalet
food,not_removed,it sort of tastes like you took the cooked skin off of a rotisserie chicken and make it into a sauce its really hard to describe but its so good edit order some on ebay try it
food,not_removed,where are you from if youre in new jersey or near i could drop off a package of the sauce
food,not_removed,haha yes i live in ontario and i cant fathom the thought of not being with swiss chalet for a long duration
food,not_removed,went on amazon and everyone confirmed its awesomeness i buy
food,not_removed,thank you so much that is very kind i am in california and order through amazon thanks again
food,not_removed,theyre a staple of my youth as well on both sides of the border we had or sc locations in the buffaloniagara falls area until they closed the us operations and no trip up north was complete without a stop for chicken and ribs and a dash into reids for hockey stuff oh yeah and the brewers retail for a of brador or diamond lager sweet memories
food,not_removed,no worries let me know when you get it and tell me how it is
food,not_removed,looks greatdelicious i would like to taste it
food,not_removed,agreed
food,not_removed,that looks like an orgasm

food,not_removed,my best guess lb ground beef cups bread crumbs eggs tsp salt onion minced little celery chopped cup horse radish tbsp mustard tsp worchester sauce drops tobasco cup catsup cant make out that bottom word
food,not_removed,heres what i got mr johnsons meast goof beef grindr cups bread crumbs eggs tsp salt onion munchies crooked hillary chopped cup boo radley fap mustard fap worcestershire sauce drops tobacco cup cat nip meow cup mcdees
food,not_removed,what part cant you read pretty clear to me
food,not_removed,what is it i m not doing the exercise cause someone did it only word i cant find out is the last one
food,not_removed,thats a lot of breadcrumbs and horseradish
food,not_removed,what is it for
food,not_removed,beef breadcrumbs eggs celery onion horseradish worcestershire sauce ketchup tabasco and mustard sorry this isnt in the right order it was from memory edit salt
food,not_removed,is ketchup the same as catsup
food,not_removed,makes half cup
food,not_removed,this is what i got as well
food,not_removed,im crying i love you
food,not_removed,same
food,not_removed,very bottom line is makes cup
food,not_removed,i dont think that makes sense and that doesnt look like a k to me
food,not_removed,look at the way the writer writes m at the beginning of other words and d in others no way that says makes at the bottom also lbs of meat plus a bunch of other stuff makes many times more than half a cup
food,not_removed,tsp worshishire sauce
food,not_removed,thats a lot of horseradish
food,not_removed,but cursive is hard p
food,not_removed,thought so i have all my nanas recipes in a box and i havent made her meatloaf yet my daughter and i make her christmas pudding every year at christmas well the last years shes only i leave her in charge of adding the brandy now thats parenting
food,not_removed,alright cool hope you enjoy
food,not_removed,it could be some kind of alternative to the catsup quantity very hard to make out but you are correct that this recipe could not make cup
food,not_removed,maybe used is but missing the space i zoomed in and examined similar letters throughout the recipe thats my best guess
food,not_removed,is there someone named mr j it looks like mr j usedes cup
food,not_removed,first attempt at beef short ribs rubbed with meatheads big bad beef rub with a little more black pepper and pasilla and new mexican chile powders instead of what he recommends cooked about hours in a weber kettle partitioned for indirect with a couple red bricks and held between and used hickory chunks for the smoke
food,not_removed,bark and moistness finally someone doing it right
food,not_removed,i need to try these on my rig the next time i get a brisket jones and dont want to invest bucks and hrs on a piece of meat
food,not_removed,looks like it melts in your mouth
food,not_removed,damn that looks bomb
food,not_removed,oh my god this is what ive always wanted
food,not_removed,i dont like smoked meats but i would humor you and eat a few dozen
food,not_removed,omg those look heavenly
food,not_removed,ive only made short ribs once before and they were basically all fat it was delicious but it was a bunch of crispy fat with barely any meat yours look meatier did i just happen to get some very fatty short ribs or what
food,not_removed,wow that looks delicious
food,not_removed,ive never worked with short ribs before but these were the meatiest on the shelf at the store pieces other than pictured were fattier i wouldnt say any were mostly fat
food,not_removed,the different types of olive oil refer to how refined they are extra virgin is the lightest pressed and has a more concentrated olive flavor light what youre calling regular olive oil is more refined and is generally used as a cooking oil cooking with extra virgin in place of light isnt usually recommended for two reasons the impurities make its smoke point lower and heating it can wreck the flavor compounds
food,not_removed,the virgin means that no chemicals have been used to extract the oil the extra means that the producer has send the oil to the lab and it has passed and also a panel has tasted it and there are no defects i disagree with the dont cook with evoo but i would agree with trying to not burn it i produce olive oil but that makes me a farmer not a expert
food,not_removed,it burns faster and is not ideal for frying can be used in salads
food,not_removed,so ive bought the wrong one to cook pasta with ive been using corn oil in the past and saw that many people were using olive oil so thats why i chose evoo didnt know there was a difference in cooking
food,not_removed,what exactly do you mean by cooking pasta if youre boiling the pasta in water then tossing it in the oil like a sauce thats fine if youre adding oil to the water that youre going to cook the pasta in you should also be okay but this sicilian is sideeyeing you hard for it im stretching to think of any other way to utilize oil specifically in regard to pasta
food,not_removed,like putting evoo in the pan to cook off the garlic and onions the first step towards the pasta sauce then after that just pouring a little bit of evoo to top off the dish
food,not_removed,its probably fine for that limited use but evoo burns at the lowest temperature so its not really ideal for fryingsautéing when you toss in the tomatoes and other sauce ingredients it cools it down quickly just dont use it for frying chicken and the like extra virgin is best suited for low temp or cold dishes like dressing you just have to worry about the smoke point
food,not_removed,i wish i knew this a long time ago thank you
food,not_removed,pan fried five cheese tortellini with butter garlic parsley red pepper flakes and vintage farmstead sheep milk cheese courtesy of bravo farms vintage cheese factory i may have cried a little
food,not_removed,i should not be on this subreddit before lunch
food,not_removed,looks amazing
food,not_removed,yes pan fry everything
food,not_removed,yum
food,not_removed,fuck im so hungry right now i did not need to see this
food,not_removed,i made something similar last night only my sauce was melted marscarpone cheese with crab meat garlic and chili flakes i forgot to get parsleyit would have help lift the dish
food,not_removed,if you are looking for good fried dumplings chinese cuisine has tons
food,not_removed,looks great may i also recommend pan fried gnocchi
food,not_removed,the best time
food,not_removed,pan fried pans pan fries your food even better than regular frying pans
food,not_removed,ooo yum crab meat sounds like a fun addition
food,not_removed,yes definitely fried gnocchi are like little psuedoroasties they are the bomb
food,not_removed,wait did you fry them and crispy cause i thought i was the first person on the planet to do that
food,not_removed,did you apply any egg wash before you put them in the oven
food,not_removed,these look great im not sure which version these cinnamon buns are but ive tried freshly baked finnish ones my goodness they were the best cinnamon buns ive tried so far
food,not_removed,a little bit yes i followed the recipe but didnt put all of the wash on a whole egg and a tablespoon of milk as i felt that would drown them too little perhaps
food,not_removed,i normally dont put any milk in it but in my opinion they should be fully covered the slightly matte finish is usually a sign of too little egg wash in sweden theyre also almost always topped with nib sugar before baking
food,not_removed,you cant do that and not share the recipe
food,not_removed,looks great recipe please edit well since its been hours since op posted and no recipe i found a similar one online httpwwwtheendlessmealcomthebestcrockpotgeneraltsoschicken
food,not_removed,need recipe pls
food,not_removed,recipe pleeeeeeease
food,not_removed,op pls you torture us for your own amusement
food,not_removed,sorry i didnt have notifications on heres the recipe i used
food,not_removed,before i say anything else i must say this looks amazing i just ate am not hungry but i would absolutely devour this that being said so there were recipes posted since i saw this they both had coat the chicken in cornstarch and brown in hot oil steps to them this is frying not deep frying although it is closer to wok frying or stir frying but its what gives general tsos chicken its characteristic crispiness then its drenched in sauce to me it seems these recipes arent really being made in the crock pot youre just replacing the vessel they get coated in with a crock pot i know the one recipe author linked to said they skipped that part but doesnt it then just become chicken in sauce i love my crock pot and frying is a messy pain in the ass but i dont think any of these crock pot variations are going to stack up to the actual fried versions as both of these recipes show frying is still a component
food,not_removed,this looks really great btw
food,not_removed,i have to try this please post
food,not_removed,thank you i needed to understand this wizardry
food,not_removed,one time i tried making chia pudding that same day i consumed too many chia seeds i got a stomach ache and went to bed i had nightmares that they wouldnt stop expanding in the house when i woke up i threw out the chia pudding so fast couldnt look at it now i cannot eat them tt i really needed to get that off my chest i feel better now
food,not_removed,grumpy cat face
food,not_removed,gross id just stick to making some stuff yourself with the help of almond milk the packaged stuff is usually not very good in my opinion
food,not_removed,sorry but this has been removed rule you may repost with a descriptive title that just describes the food thanks
food,not_removed,absolute madman
food,not_removed,doesnt your steak get cold before you are finished eating it if you slice it all up like that
food,not_removed,why do people precut the steak like this why not cut as you go
food,not_removed,why do people cut their steak before eating it i never understood that
food,not_removed,celebrating my birthday with a bone in prime ribeye steak twiced baked potatoes recipe courtesy of matty matheson on youtube and sautéed spinach o and an amazing dollar bottle of wine girlfriend wont eat steak anything less then medium so i bit the bullet still amazing also try the potato recipe they were absolutely amazing ill leave the link this guys hilariously amazing edit girlfriends an ex vegetarian so she easing her way back into meat she doesnt force me to eat any particular way i sous vide these steaks then seared them ive never attempted this method before so instead of over complicating it i made both steaks the same doneness
food,not_removed,beautiful doing it yourself is the only way you know your birthday dinner is going to be perfect funny side story on my birthday my friends took me to a steakhouse now i like my steak rare seared on the outside but hotred center however in experience up to that point every time i went to a restaurant and ordered a rare steak they always presented me with a medium well one it was my birthday and i wanted it done right i figured if i overdid the description id get it served close to how i wanted it when the waitress asked me how id like the steak i used every old overused phrases rare threaten it with a lit match run it through a warm room i want to see arterial spray when i cut into it well this waitress pretty much done exactly what i had asked she presented me with a slab of warmhot but raw beautiful piece of prime rib i had felt rather terrible i was not going to send it back she and the cook had gave me exactly what i had asked for on top of that my food came out at the same time my friends did as well as it should and they had already started eating i didnt want to be that guy who sits awkwardly inactive while everyone else is eating or my friends politely insisting on not eating until i had gotten mine as well i tried i really really tried to eat this steak but about a third of the way in i could do it no longer just the slimy texture was turning me off to eat any more naturally i asked for a box so i could take it home and cook it a bit and i tipped the waitress an extra than i normally do which is a lot in general ive had multiple serving gigs and am a generous tipper unless they really really suck because she had really gave me exactly what i ordered now at i just ask the server how they would describe the rare steaks that they serve and order accordingly
food,not_removed,you accidentally topped your potato with broccoli instead of butter sour cream cheese and bacon bits
food,not_removed,that looks amazing
food,not_removed,youre not supposed to preslice your steak you damn fool it looses too much heat and some of the the juices you are supposed to slice one bite sized piece at a time as you eat it
food,not_removed,looks fantastic but i would have probably selected a slightly better wine for my birthday dinner
food,not_removed,was that wine thirty seven fifty
food,not_removed,luckily you didnt order the thirty seven fifty wine
food,not_removed,happy birthday
food,not_removed,looks good steak looks overdone to me but looks good p
food,not_removed,for my birthday i cooked my friends a course meal they thought i was joking when i asked what they wanted to eat
food,not_removed,i did not only my own food but food for my own birthday party i hosted an italian afternoon starters mains and the obligatory tiramisu in my local approximately people attended and i loved it
food,not_removed,why did you cut it all up at once like that is that a special method i thought you werent supposed to cut steak up all at once seriously asking
food,not_removed,is that a matty matheson recipe i see
food,not_removed,they were right that steak is absolutely ruined
food,not_removed,if you know what you want and you know you can make it go for it im thinking of making my own birthday cake for the same reason
food,not_removed,looks delicious but proteins at six veggies at two and starches at eleven next time
food,not_removed,looks awesome but why dit you slice the chop thats some eating of the bone shit right there get your face all grease like
food,not_removed,a
food,not_removed,will you cook my birthday dinner
food,not_removed,calm down hannibal
food,not_removed,mad lad
food,not_removed,i cant decide whether you should be knighted or beaten
food,not_removed,that doesnt look that good my birthday dinner was much better than that
food,not_removed,the bears lair wine was a nice touch or was it seems kind of like getting a prostitute when youre married to a model
food,not_removed,the best birthday is what you make of it
food,not_removed,i wouldnt call you crazy id just feel a push inside to cook you a birthday meal or try to do the one you wanted
food,not_removed,crazy ive been cooking for my own party for years now i take my friends on the super market and let them pick what they want to eat i cook it when we go home then we have a laneatingbirthday party
food,not_removed,no put broccoli and potato put broccoli put potato but please no broccoli potato please broccoli is strange tree vegetables it spoil potato
food,not_removed,why did you go with pinot noir its certainly one of the more versatile wines but its also probably the lightest body wine typically you want big and bold wine with red meat
food,not_removed,damn
food,not_removed,crazy awesome
food,not_removed,damn this made me remembered i havent had a steak in two weeks heading to costco first thing tomorrow
food,not_removed,why dont you use a wine glass for wine like a sane person
food,not_removed,a loose canon unhinged mad as a march hare
food,not_removed,chefs hate him
food,not_removed,rmadlads
food,not_removed,but then it wouldnt be paper shredder steak
food,not_removed,looks cooler on reddit
food,not_removed,i wouldnt cut my steak up prior to eating it but i have to admit it looks aesthetically pleasing in this pic
food,not_removed,so he can have lots of ministeaks
food,not_removed,this is going to make me seem like a spoiled brat but all growing up my dad cut my steak up for me he cuts my moms up too so we had this pile of steak bites and put it on our plates from there so my husband being the giver he is just kind of took over and cut my steak but then we had kids and he started cutting up their steak and i became a grown ass woman and discovered that cutting as you go retains juiciness and flavor i feel sad about all the time i wasted on precut meat
food,not_removed,its done sous vide which gets redder as the internal flesh is exposed dont ask me why and its pretty edit nm the redness he did it medium but its true
food,not_removed,because my son is only maybe this guys really young
food,not_removed,apparently they like a large amount of the juicy goodness to leave the meat before they get to eating it seems counter productive after someone has gone to a lot of effort to output a perfectly cooked piece of expensive dead red meat
food,not_removed,i dont do it but it seems like you can get more sauce or gravy flavour on it that way
food,not_removed,i see a second steak why couldnt you pull yours early still looks good happy birthday
food,not_removed,lolol fuckin hell that dude is hilarious thanks for the heads up on him i subscribed those potatoes look amazing too i have done similar stuffed spuds before but those are on another level defo giving them a whirl shirl nice one mate and happy bday to you
food,not_removed,🚮 lol jk im just hangry
food,not_removed,this looks good as hell and matty is always a funny guy to watch haha happy birthday

food,not_removed,mars capone als youngest potatoloving brother
food,not_removed,this is the one day of the year that she should have compromised not you you even had to cook dinner i hope she made it up to you in other ways op
food,not_removed,sounds like soon to be ex girlfriend and vegetarian
food,not_removed,why did you slice up the steak like that really bad idea all the juices and flavored escape and it cools off quickly you should take some cooking lessons
food,not_removed,ohhhhh thats terrible as the spouse of a server you sound like a great guest but im sure a good staff wouldve understood if youd told them your plight a really good restaurant will doublecheck for example when someone orders mediumrare from my husband hell echo back warm red center just to make sure and people still return things many times per night its okay to do that
food,not_removed,with the astronomical cost at an alacarte steakhouse you should get you steak cooked perfectly where i live you want to ask for your steak to be cooked black blue thats cooked over the flaming part of their degree grill so the outside is close to charred almost burnt and little more concern will be paid to cooking the center all the heat getting the black done correctly will slightly cook the meat throughout be sure you ask for black blue not blackened they will let it rest then serve and you should be extremely happy charred outside and practically still mooing on the inside any properly knowledgeable steakhouse server will sak ok and move on to the next and would you like x also question the upsell worst case they will define the term to you right away illustrating to everyone seated with you you have a better understanding of food and therefore almost everything on gods green earth than they can possibly hope to obtain causing envy with your gender and desire among the other carnivore
food,not_removed,haha i scooped out the inside mixed it with pancetta butter mascarpone fresh mozzarella cheddar scallions sour cream and broccoli stems then stuffed it all back into the potato skin then broiled it then i was feeling healthy and sautéed the broccoli tops with butter and put it on top to hide the evidence
food,not_removed,thank you it was so delicious
food,not_removed,haha i had all the intentions to but after i found out how much the actual steaks themselves were going to cost i quickly grew fond of this lovely bottle plus after we drank the bottle we made strawberry daiquiris haha
food,not_removed,not to mention its the wrong sort of glass great decanter but needs the stem shouldnt hold the wine and warm it
food,not_removed,nah haggled it down to a tad over grand
food,not_removed,haha ok second comment like this im definetly missing something here
food,not_removed,hell yea it is haha i love him people usually write him off based on how he looks and acts but hes a hell of a chef
food,not_removed,honestly i couldnt agree more thats the exact same thing i told people go for it if you know what youre doing and you enjoy cooking and eating then making your own cake should be a no brained i also feel making something on your own tastes better because you know you did it and you have a little pride in it plus that meal would of cost more at any restaurant here in chicago haha good luck
food,not_removed,haha after reading all the comments i honestly feel the same way
food,not_removed,haha sounds about right when you realize you spent almost all your money on the model and the only thing you can afford is a semidecent cheap prostitute but still better then no prostitute
food,not_removed,girlfriend picked it out it actually surprisingly had some good body and nice tannins worked well i was surprised
food,not_removed,haha girlfriend says its a stemless wine glass
food,not_removed,why dont you use a wine glass for wine like a sane pretentious person ftfy actually as long as youre not chugging from the bottle
food,not_removed,lol what a giant bag of douche you are huh imagine if someone actually conducted themselves in this manner in person rather than hiding behind a monitorkeyboard youd get no where in life
food,not_removed,his trolley but a distant memory never for op to be on again
food,not_removed,lol best answer
food,not_removed,and thank you
food,not_removed,haha she gets grossed out by steak thats raremedium rare so i just made them both the same at the end of the day i prefer medium rare but medium was still great
food,not_removed,haha shes a keeper shes in the last year of dental school and i work in the restaurant business soon to be retired from the restaurant business to spend my days golfing and cooking lol
food,not_removed,damn dude well carry on then
food,not_removed,sounds like a great night
food,not_removed,my man
food,not_removed,steak cools faster if you cut it loses alot of flavor that way
food,not_removed,httpamazingribscomtipsandtechniquemythbustingrestingmeathtml you may not know of amazingribscom but they imo are meat gods
food,not_removed,im glad you had a good birthday but that seems insane to me i would never tell my husband on his birthday that he has to overcook his own portion of an expensive dinner that he himself prepared just because im grossed out by it holy cow
food,not_removed,just to help see it from a different angle haha she gets grossed out by mushrooms so i just dont eat them at the end of the day i like mushrooms but i wont eat them to appease her thats really controlling and not cool
food,not_removed,this is why you are banned
food,not_removed,hes only hell learn
food,not_removed,based on the feed back and downvotes maybe i didnt explain everything haha my girlfriends an ex vegetarian and started eating meat again a few months ago by no means does she make me eat meat any way cooked or not cooked shes just still easing her way back into meat so the redness freaks her out i sous vide these steaks and then seared them after i never sous vide a steak before so i didnt want to complicate it so i just made them both the same doneness i wasnt forced into eating it that way it was just more convenient and i have no problem at the end of the day eating my steak at medium if thats the way she likes it
food,not_removed,true to that
food,not_removed,its not controlling if its an uncoerced choice done out of respect for your partner
food,not_removed,oh my god mate creating something in your head that isnt there just to get angry at something is weird why do people do this he cooked a couple steaks his mrs isnt into rare meat as shes getting used to not being a vegetarian does both medium to save a bit of dicking around and keeps the mrs happy err thats it
food,not_removed,dude dont let these assholes batter you for having a healthy relationship where both parties make concessions to the others feelings my girlfriend doesnt eat baked beans in front of me because she knows they gross me out theres give and take in any healthy relationship
food,not_removed,one way you could have sous vide them is to cook the well done one first and then leave it in while you cook the med rare at a lower temperature that way none will get cold you also could have sous vided them both med rare and seared hers for a bit longer without drying it before that way the moisture in the steak heats up the inside cooking the whole thing they still look amazing nonetheless
food,not_removed,exactly we shared a meal together and birthday or not as the cook i honestly wanted her to enjoy to steak more then i did and hell throw any piece of meat in front of me and im a happy camper
food,not_removed,you know that because you have a relationship they sort of guys that obsess about other peoples steaks being rare probably dont
food,not_removed,looking back at it now i agree but it was my first time and i didnt want to screw it up too much but next time i will definitely try this thank you
food,not_removed,i can definitely see it now didnt really think about how it looked but yes birthday was great thank you
food,not_removed,i find it funny when people act like a relationship is some sort of rare achievement i am married and i would be the first to point out the proper temperature of a steak because it is important its like if someone said they prefer eating ice cream when it is room temperature like you understand that they may be weird and they may have some weird preference but the point is it is scientifically proven to yield better quality taste and texture in a certain temperature range just like a steak
food,not_removed,awsome job on cooking the steaks i always use sous vide now that i can it makes a huge difference for next time put your gfs steak on the grill first and give it an extra minutes head start then flip it when you throw yours on it will cook through and head to medium or even to well done if you leave it long enough i did steaks for a group of a dozen and used that to get everyones to their desired doneness you did a great job for the first time as you practice more youll be amazed that everyone isnt doing this
food,not_removed,no problem mate always glad to help
food,not_removed,so he ate a less than perfect steak because a rare steak would gross out his girlfriend an issue they are working through together through mutually supportive behaviour its not about the steak its about give and take and btw i prefer my steaks bloody as hell sorry that doesnt meet your medium rare taste for perfection but ill eat my steak how i damn well like and that includes deciding not to eat it that way if i think it might gross out my partner
food,not_removed,someones elses steak preference is important to you 😂
food,not_removed,i have no problem with ops post i have aproblem with the dude because he said people who comment on steak rarity are just jealous of the ops relationship i would have a problem with ops post if he has only ever had medium steaks and says i dont want to try rarer steaks medium is just how i like it its like someone who drinks bud light and has never tried a finer beer saying the same
food,not_removed,steak is important to me
food,not_removed,fair enough
food,not_removed,d
food,not_removed,i dont like oysters but wow
food,not_removed,fresh oyster taste best no matter how you cook it
food,not_removed,those would be even better with vermicelli noodles
food,not_removed,this is probably one of my favorite recipe for oysters its simple quick and delicious
food,not_removed,when i made these i didnt have them in hand
food,not_removed,mmmm
food,not_removed,did you make the bread too i love homemade bread
food,not_removed,recipe
food,not_removed,looks delicious but i would prefer to have nothing on top except maybe some syrup still that kicks the shit out of my breakfast this morning consisting of a breakfast bar and a leftover pizza stick from toppers
food,not_removed,my brother made eggnog for our thanksgiving meal for the eggnog you usually have two parts the egg yolks cream sugar spices and separately the egg whites which you whip and fold in right before you consume the eggnog we had leftovers of the first part so we used it as french toast batter the next morning topped with bananas and freshly whipped cream sweetened with maple syrup the real stuff of course definitely the best french toast ive ever had good quality bread helps too
food,not_removed,i wager i could eat that in a day or two
food,not_removed,it is blocking the emergency exit
food,not_removed,insert heavy breathing sounds here
food,not_removed,they can go for upwards of
food,not_removed,i want to bury my face in this

food,not_removed,as a line cook at an italian mom n pop shop fuck these things ever try forcing a knife through get of concrete because itd probably easier than cutting that wheel of cheese in half

food,not_removed,top rated in chinatown shrug
food,not_removed,which is the worst place to find a japanese style dish looks like itd still taste decent but is nowhere near top in chicago have you tried takeya or wasabi theyll blow your mind if you liked that super yummy

food,not_removed,make jam that many strawberries could easily make you a years supply with some left over if theyre really good strawberries though id use them fresh and eat them in salads etc
food,not_removed,fresh or frozen
food,not_removed,jams or make some pies and freeze them

food,not_removed,nice dish
food,not_removed,that browning doe
food,not_removed,i would love to read that recipe
food,not_removed,doesnt look thick enough to me but its kind of hard to tell from a picture
food,not_removed,i based it off a green curry i had for lunch from a thai restaurant theirs was really runny but very good i thought mine tasted fairly similar so i am not sure if some is runny and others not p
food,not_removed,if youre ever in fort worth check out angelos bbq on white settlement fantastic ribs chopped sandwiches and always cold beer on tap
food,not_removed,meat u anywhere grapevine near old townmain street i think they are opening up another location in frisco soon too still the best brisket i have had in dallas they also make breakfast tacos using their brisket served all day
food,not_removed,im a jewish guy and my best friend lives in the dallas area so this spoke to me ive been to dallas a bunch of times but the last time i went pecan lodge was closed so i went to lockhart smokehouse which was fantastic i hate to say it but the kreuzs sausages were terrible and i was very disappointed
food,not_removed,just had this for lunch for the uninitiated nasi padang is a malay dish which basically has steamed rice and an assortment of cooked dishes to choose from i had the following sambal goreng a vegetarian dish of fried long beans bean curd cake tah kwa and fermented soya bean cake tempe usually fried with spices and some chili begedil fried potato patty sambal brinjal egg plant steamed egg plant although some versions are fried with a belachan shrimp and chili paste dengdeng belado thats the beef jerky looking thing basically dried beef marinated in a sweet sauce with a chili paste then theres this sweet savoury chili thing you see on top of that delicious mess not spicy at all but tangy and goes very well with the rice was fantastic overall although i probably have to go for a jog or once the food settles this is in singapore btw
food,not_removed,padang is a city in sumatera indonesia
food,not_removed,i think your spicy stuff on that spicy stuff needs more spicy stuff
food,not_removed,oh man i love dengdeng its quite a difficult dish to make too
food,not_removed,it wasnt really that spicy although im pretty used to spicy stuff but yea more spicy stuff man
food,not_removed,first time having it it was certainly interesting the texture and taste was really not what i expected of it it was like tastier beef jerky
food,not_removed,this just took pumpkin pie to a whole new level of awesome all hail the great mustachioed pumpkin
food,not_removed,recipe
food,not_removed,pie crust cup vegetable shortening cups allpurpose flour whole egg tablespoons cold water teaspoons white vinegar teaspoon salt in a large bowl work the shortening into the flour for about or minutes in a seperate bowl beat an egg and then pour it into the flourshortening mixture add cold water white vinegar and salt stir together until all of the ingredients are incorporated form a ball of dough and place into a large ziploc bag using a rolling pin slightly flatten seal the bag and place it in the freezer or minutes roll with flour to about inch press into ungreased mini tartlet pans filling ounce can pumpkin ounce can sweetened condensed milk large eggs teaspoon ground cinnamon teaspoon ground ginger teaspoon ground clove teaspoon ground nutmeg teaspoon salt whisk all ingredients together fill mini tartlet pans full bake at for minutes
food,not_removed,slap ya mamma is some good stuff
food,not_removed,nothing says im a grown adult and can eat whatever i want to like some chicken nuggets theres this dry cajun rubseasoning called slap ya mama that is fantastic so i mixed it in with some panko to fry up these bad boys i mixed cup buttermilk with one egg cut up some chicken and coated it with the buttermilkegg mix and rolled it around in the slap ya mamapanko mix turned out way better than i anticipated if anything it could have used a bit more seasoning because it wasnt quite spicy enough for my taste i had intended to make enough to have left overs for lunch tomorrow but that did not happen
food,not_removed,those look perfect
food,not_removed,my mom made me a big plate of those the other day
food,not_removed,by far my favorite seasoning
food,not_removed,how do you cut the chicken i cut breasts into squares and it never comes out quite right i dont know how to describe it though
food,not_removed,i make them almost the same way the trick i use is to season the chicken with slap ya mamma prior to coating it so that its not wasted i find you have to add a lot to the mix to get a good flavor as it tends to go to the bottom of the panko and also seems to rinse off some in the oil hit the chicken prior to coating it and all those good cajun seasoning will stay in there
food,not_removed,thank you i found it at a walmart in tulip wa of all places
food,not_removed,they were rather fantastic
food,not_removed,i mainly did squaresrectangles too i just put the chicken on the cutting board and sliced it into strips about a half a centimeter wide and then cut the strips up into halves or thirds depending on how long they were
food,not_removed,i was actually thinking i might put the slap ya mama in small bowl or dish and roll the nuggets in it right after they are done cooking and still a bit wet from the oil like ive seen some places do with chicken wings or boneless wings
food,not_removed,hmmm perhaps im just cooking them wrong ill try again tonight
food,not_removed,that sounds like a good idea im gonna try that next time too
food,not_removed,define not quite right you have to submerse fully in the oil or if not then you have to flip them half way through give it like minutes in there depending on how crunchy you want the breading to be
food,not_removed,report back if you give it a go im not sure when im going to try this next
food,not_removed,this is gonna be hard to describe but its almost like the meat itself is crunchy and not the breading you know almost like im biting through an orange slice does that make sense it usually only happens to thicker pieces of chicken maybe i just dont cook those pieces long enough but they are always white when i check
food,not_removed,will do
food,not_removed,either not cooked enough or its cooked too much i had a few pieces that were really crunchy and im pretty sure i cooked them too long
food,not_removed,i guess i just need to practice my kentucky ancestors would be ashamed of my lack of fried chicken skills
food,not_removed,looks very bland tbh
food,not_removed,more corn
food,not_removed,potatoes were put in first because of the cook time then layered with the sausage onion corn and shrimp it was laid out how it was in the pot and not mixed because we did it kinda buffet style old bay was definitely added even though ive lived in the south for years this is the first time ive ever had a shrimp boil but it all was delicious
food,not_removed,is it all boiled in the same pot or how does this work
food,not_removed,needs crawfish and blue crabs
food,not_removed,i may have to do try this
food,not_removed,would anyone else just join me at the top end for some potatoes and a side of potatoes
food,not_removed,the shrimp have no heads losing a major flavor component there and no mushrooms the mushrooms soak up the zatarains and shrimp flavors and are so good im sure you cant get andouiile if you are using polish sausage but leave the heads on
food,not_removed,a country boil is supposed to be a great mix this is like sectioned off and clean looking it just seemsoff
food,not_removed,kinda my thoughts little seasoning and just threw a bunch of shit together is that even warm
food,not_removed,yes with seasoning like zatarains crab boil seasoning or old bay or anything else ive seen crab legs ox tails and even eggs boiled in the pots its definitely going to be the top things you ever eat its always an event
food,not_removed,this is my question too are there other ingredients
food,not_removed,boiled for ease not taste boiled potato and boiled corn and boiled prawns oh hell yeah 😐😒😒😒
food,not_removed,crawfish are out of season now and boil times btw crabs and shrimp are so different its usually a bitch to get the timing right
food,not_removed,maybe potatoes were put in ist because of cook time
food,not_removed,til that people pay money for spam
food,not_removed,both spam fries and ube ube are ono where did you get em
food,not_removed,this cool spot in nyc called manila social club
food,not_removed,looks like someone was on the gordon ramsey ama
food,not_removed,its just butter made with milk from cows in devon england iirc the google results about clotted cream youre getting are due to devonshire cream a type of unsweetened clotted cream topping for scones made with devon cow milk its basically just englands version of jersey cow milk a regioncow type that people think makes especially good dairy products
food,not_removed,that real devonshire butter used to be made from clotted cream whether it still is or not i cant say
food,not_removed,where ya going
food,not_removed,go to maine for lobster rolls no joke anywhere on commercial street in portland like the porthole anywhere like stewmans in bar harbor will have great lobster rolls but you wont find much until summer anywhere
food,not_removed,if you are going to be in connecticut i suggest you go to abbotts lobster in the rough great lobster by the water they open the last week of may closed for the season now httpabbottslobstercom
food,not_removed,check out newport rhode island great lobster chowder and oysters depending on your level of fancy you could go from benjamins bar with great oysters to the mooring for a lobster roll also the mansions are pretty damned interesting to see
food,not_removed,mid april if you like it cool and not super busy businesses start opening in april but in may its perfect weather and still not too busy june is when it really starts to pick up july through august is nuts
food,not_removed,is nuts can confirm
food,not_removed,if you can only explore one part of maine choose bar harbor and fly into bangor intl airport bangor has the closest major airport and its about an hour away bangor is absolutely nothing special so dont spend too much time there bar harbor has the world famous acadia national park with hundreds of miles of biking and hiking trails beautiful mountains and tons more portland southern maine is not much like why people love maine it has great food and some cool streets with loud bars but other than that its not much if you wanted to experience a lot of maine and have a good road trip you could fly into portland jetport rent a car go up route which is a beautiful scenic route all the way up the maine coast you can stop at all the maine attractions like rockland boothbay and a few others i would save the most time for bar harbor as theres so much to do not much reason to go past bar harbor though you could either go back to portland from bar harbor hour drive or fly out of bangor if you dont buy a two way flight
food,not_removed,acadia is historical built by the rockefellers in the i believe cars were not aloud on the island for quite some time i dont quite remember what year a few specific spots like horse barns and stuff theres the abbe museum about the native americans that used to inhabit mount desert island where bar harbor is if you arent into hiking or anything like that acadia has whats called the park loop road its a mile long road taking you around acadia with many stops for people to see ranging from beautiful views to historical houses portland on the other hand has some good historical places to visit and quite a few museums longfellow house victorias mansion art museum science museum a museum about mythical animals and a few more if you want a lobster roll while in portland go to eventide on middle street my girlfriend said they have the best lobster roll in maine heres a link to the portland tourism site httpswwwvisitportlandcom bar harbor tourism site httpwwwbarharborinfocomthingstodoaspx

food,not_removed,my new favorite sub
food,not_removed,we love some sous vide steaks over at rsteak
food,not_removed,best food
food,not_removed,wow those look great how did you prepare them
food,not_removed,recipe please i would like to make this for my mom toblerone is her favorite
food,not_removed,this looks awfully dry is it op
food,not_removed,daaaaaammmmmnn
food,not_removed,recipe
food,not_removed,this cake looks so delicious i will definitely try this cake on special occasions
food,not_removed,heavy breathing
food,not_removed,uff such a breath taking cake can you share your recipe hopefully will make same as yours
food,not_removed,i would cut each layer in half so that i can stuff in more fillings p
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,rdiabeetusporn
food,not_removed,i need a change of pants
food,not_removed,i really dont like toblerone but this cake looks quite yummy
food,not_removed,it aint pretty but id eat the fuck out of that cake
food,not_removed,so basically it was a french vanilla betty crocker cake mix with martha stewart icing once you make the icing put a little less than half of it aside cut up toblerone pieces and add them to that icing bowl mix then spread across bottom cake put the other cake on top then ice the entire thing with the other bowl of your icingthat doesnt have toblerone pieces in it then sprinkle the remainder of your toblerone pieces all over hopefully that helps sorry i cant offer a more comprehensive recipe
food,not_removed,well i was saying in another comment reply that the actual cake is very light and fluffy there is just a bit too much of it the cakes were a little tall however there is a ton of icing to make up for it my suggestion if you were ever to try and make it is make your actual cakes a little thinner to make the ratio perfect i always have a massive glass of milk with it anyway so its always good haha
food,not_removed,yea one thing i was a little disappointed about was the thickness of the actual cakes i wanted to make sure the ratio of icing to cake was good which it is but if i made them again id try and make the cakes a little thinner
food,not_removed,haha i love steve coogan
food,not_removed,yea it was more of a messy look but damn did it taste good
food,not_removed,thank you
food,not_removed,single cream too 😵 what are your thoughts on the recent toblerone scandal
food,not_removed,what size pan you used because usually with box cake mix pan would be just perfect heights
food,not_removed,i think it looks great much better than cakes so perfect they no longer look like food
food,not_removed,yea a double cream mightve evened it out but the actual cake wasnt dry thankfully i think the toblerone scandal was actually kinda funny just because i can imagine the executives at toblerone thinking it was a great idea and that no one would noticethen the shitstorm ensued
food,not_removed,it was a nine inch pan i had to use twice however wouldnt that make the cake less tall since it is spread out an inch more than the inch one
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,i thought those were rotten teeth looks good though
food,not_removed,oh no you didnt
food,not_removed,assuming that the food was great but not so appetizing half eaten
food,not_removed,if i found this tray unattended at a bus stop id probably eat it
food,not_removed,steak looks really well cookednice happy birthday
food,not_removed,hope you had a lovely day you arent eating dinner alone are you
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,just needs some olives and ill have one how long for delivery to australia
food,not_removed,i would eat that
food,not_removed,dang ole broccolini dang ole
food,not_removed,so does the chicken dry out while the bacon is cooking seems like the difference in the cooking times lends itself to that
food,not_removed,roasted broocoli mmmm
food,not_removed,so hunters chicken
food,not_removed,actually no not if you know when and how long to keep the grill hood open and when and how long to keep it closed it takes a lot of attention but the chicken ended up juicy as ever and the bacon actually just under crispy on the meat side and crispy on the outside good texture overall and nothing was over or underdone like i said lots of attention and heat change and anything is possible
food,not_removed,is that a thing never heard of it i just make my own recipes because i have a decent palette and keep a nice stock of everything so i can be innovative i didnt know hunters chicken was even a thing but i guess great minds think alike eh
food,not_removed,does that really work doesnt seem like it would work
food,not_removed,this looks awesome
food,not_removed,made on the grill the tenderloin and the knife look ridiculous
food,not_removed,that looks delicious
food,not_removed,yum tendorolin
food,not_removed,kai knives
food,not_removed,perfectly cooked not overdone and dry like so many are used to
food,not_removed,look ridiculous why
food,not_removed,ridiculously good those type of knives are typically in the hundreds and the tenderloin just looks bomb both are good things
food,not_removed,with the right sauce raos rketo and rketorecipes would eat this up
food,not_removed,mansagna i cant only imagine that being a hairy porno
food,not_removed,lbs of meat pepperoni peppered salami london broil prosciutto hotcopi ground italian sausage of cheese asiago parmesan mozzarella fontina deli american provolone romano i know its excessive but my oh my its delicious
food,not_removed,my god i dont know what to say how was it
food,not_removed,id definitely try it though i dunno about deli american in there
food,not_removed,twas quite amazing intense but amazing
food,not_removed,yeah i find that american cheese although it has its own place in the food world doesnt play well with other cheeses its like mixing spam with waigu beef
food,not_removed,weird concept but im interested to try it also whats next in burrito form
food,not_removed,whopperito
food,not_removed,big macito
food,not_removed,i could make something like this today breakfast sausage a potato cheese and probably pico de gallo in the wrap that would be really good
food,not_removed,kind of like a california burrito
food,not_removed,we were so preoccupied with whether or not we could that we didnt stop to think if we should
food,not_removed,souprito
food,not_removed,i really wish panko didnt make me feel so nauseous
food,not_removed,whats that sauce on top
food,not_removed,what exactly is that crunch they use for some rolls and where can i buy it
food,not_removed,thats not sushi those are rolls
food,not_removed,we have a place by that name in my town if its the same place im supa dupa jelly
food,not_removed,sushi gives you worms
food,not_removed,nitsume eel sauce
food,not_removed,its tempura batter like when you fry shrimp or whatever in tempura you can knock off little crumbs of the fried batter thats what it is
food,not_removed,puffed rice or bread crumbs your local store some cereal is just puffed rice or id suggest a panko bread crumb as theyre especially crunchy
food,not_removed,does yours had the sushi on an actual train it might be the same
food,not_removed,let me die happy
food,not_removed,your point being
food,not_removed,neat
food,not_removed,this guy fuckswith sushi
food,not_removed,rolls are just a waste of time just give me a big plate of sashimi with a little side of rice
food,not_removed,that is california type which is not authentic sushi whatsoever you will never find that in japan especially with all the pussy toppings and eel sauce they smother it in
food,not_removed,you wont find this type of sushi in japan
food,not_removed,i like rolls simply because if i just eat sashimi or nigiri i will spend theyre wallet preservation man
food,not_removed,im always one extreme or the other i either want just salmon sashimi by itself or i want the dolled up modern sushi rolls
food,not_removed,youre not wrong but i didnt claim it to be traditional sushi i claimed that my family recognizes it as sushi as well as many other types
food,not_removed,so what you wont find a cuban sandwich in cuba
food,not_removed,thats not true at all you find maki sushi all over the place in japan
food,not_removed,right bc cuban sandwich started in miamitampa cubans never claimed that sandwich as their own how is your reasoning apply to this im saying this pic isnt sushi its some americanized version so you find what op claims as sushi in japan where it originates from
food,not_removed,so if i go to sukiya or yoshinoya in japan and ask for sushi they will just give me a beef teriyaki bowl because sushi is supposed to be anything with rice
food,not_removed,yup a cuban sandwich is cuban food i am cuban and i definitely consider it cuban food just like sushi is japanese food the hilarious part is that op didnt even claim that this was japanese food it is both sushi and japanese food if you go to a japanese food restaurant you can order this youre just being a food snob
food,not_removed,where is the rest of the porterhouse
food,not_removed,ive never had esquites but this photo makes me want to change that
food,not_removed,this looks delicious but what the heck are cilantro chimichurri and esquites
food,not_removed,cilantro chimichurri is just a green sauce that normally uses parsley just throw cilantro garlic onion white wine vinegar oil salt and pepper oregano and red chili flakes into a food processor and esquites is a mexican corn salad

food,not_removed,is it really cake or like the french cooking just eggs butter cocoa and sugar
food,not_removed,oh my that looks lovely have u tried it yet is it nice x
food,not_removed,when i was making it the idea was to make it look like a birch tree i used a dark chocolate ganache and covered it in powdered sugar and white chocolate shavings however the ganache started to melt in my car and absorbed the powdered sugar i only have a shitty picture of it with the powdered sugar
food,not_removed,yeah it was pretty good the buttercream was the best part cake was a bit chewy however i think its just the way the cake needed to be to roll
food,not_removed,you can see slight remnant of the powdered sugar on the top of the cake kinda looks like frost
food,not_removed,nice they look home made

food,not_removed,are you interested by a semifreddo recipe i posted that days ago check my submitted the title is caramelized banana and armagnac semifreddo check if you like it if interested i can give you the recipe you dont even need a ice cream machine to do it
food,not_removed,not ice cream per se but for chocolate sorbet is damn delicious and it just happens to be vegan and only use ingredients besides water edit sometimes this subreddit blocks links so ill just copy pasta that recipe here ingredients cups ml water cup g sugar cup g unsweetened dutchprocess cocoa powder pinch of salt ounces g bittersweet or semisweet chocolate finely chopped teaspoon vanilla extract preparation in a large saucepan whisk together cups ml of the water with the sugar cocoa powder and salt bring to a boil whisking frequently let it boil continuing to whisk for seconds remove from the heat and stir in the chocolate until its melted then stir in the vanilla extract and the remaining cup ml water transfer the mixture to a blender and blend for seconds chill the mixture thoroughly then freeze it in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturers instructions if the mixture has become too thick to pour into your machine whisk it vigorously to thin it out
food,not_removed,tyvm
food,not_removed,thanks ill check it out
food,not_removed,ok if you like it tell me ill give you my recipe you can do it in like minutes its quite easy and fast and very tasty
food,not_removed,pls i would like the recipe
food,not_removed,ok so ill try not to forget anything d do some flambée banana the way you like and mix them how i do them banana cut in half hot pan brown them a bit then sugar on top once its caramelized a bit of butter a big spoon of alcohol armagnac is my favorite to flambée them and voila you are done separate one egg drop the yolk in the mixed banana add a teaspoon of vanilla extract and remix keep the white and beat them until they are stiff take a cream brick mostly or something like that and beat it in a whipped cream with some sugar to your taste so now you should have a whipped cream mixed banana and stiff white eggs get all of that together gently fold everything together and put it a mold in your freezer should set quite fast give it a few hours top when you want to eat it take them out on a plate of the freezer and put them in your fridge homemade things like that are rock solid so you want them to be softer i take them out minute before and they are nice to eat if you want to make a chocolate topping like i did its super easy a few chocolate chip in a bowl a bit of water microwave seconds done and the banana on the side the first recipe i gave but dont mix them

food,not_removed,looks yummy but it is more a tian aux légumes than a ratatouille
food,not_removed,at ouille
food,not_removed,oh yes parmesan d
food,not_removed,do you have to boil the lobster first
food,not_removed,yep for three minutes
food,not_removed,what is the crumbly stuff on the outside of the cake looks tasty
food,not_removed,thank you thats just the cake
food,not_removed,httpiimgurcomtdwmzbcgifv sorry didnt know how to put gifvs in albums
food,not_removed,i have got to start dating indians
food,not_removed,that looks so tasty whats in the dough i know of a similiar asian one where they put sesame seeds on top its a bit sweet but savory as well so yummy
food,not_removed,so the base is normal white flour atta other ingredients are yeast sugar oil salt its basically like making pizza dough from scratch and frying it but dont take me on that im not entirely sure
food,not_removed,i didnt know what that big ball was in the middle so i just ate it by itself wasnt sure if i was supposed to mix it with the soup or something
food,not_removed,try minca ramen thank me later
food,not_removed,i knew a guy who worked there the stories i heard about how disgusting that place is id never eat there
food,not_removed,its miso paste youre supposed to mix it into the broth but whatever floats your ramen boat lol
food,not_removed,minca is by far my favorite in nyc ippudo is a very close
food,not_removed,i just assume every place i eat is filthy i dont lose much sleep over it
food,not_removed,and ground pork i believe right i usually mix it in as is typical but will always have a bit on its own first so good
food,not_removed,so who ended up getting the baby
food,not_removed,never heard of king cake looks really good
food,not_removed,i read the title like paula dean
food,not_removed,that looks so darn good i would love a slice
food,not_removed,looks nasty sick fuck
food,not_removed,no one yet this thing is massive they havent gotten to it yet
food,not_removed,its for mardi gras
food,not_removed,that would be king cake yawwwwwwl
food,not_removed,you need a hug
food,not_removed,dont choke on the baby
food,not_removed,okay so could someone explain the downvote do they just not know what a kingcake is
food,not_removed,that would be my guess i didnt remember what it was until you mentioned the chocking hazard
food,not_removed,where
food,not_removed,beaufort
food,not_removed,rwewantplates
food,not_removed,stuff dreams are made of
food,not_removed,x im always on the look out for great brunch in mtl
food,not_removed,it was at brasserie bernard in the miles end neighborhood
food,not_removed,thats disgustingnice work
food,not_removed,for the record if you serve these to people you should just call it cinnamintestines
food,not_removed,how
food,not_removed,this makes me extremely uncomfortable im sure its delicious tho
food,not_removed,yes yes i should
food,not_removed,im guessing cinnamon rolls shaped to look weird and then some sort of raspberry or strawberry glaze along with the normal glaze for the blood and shininess
food,not_removed,i followed this httpwwwfoodnetworkcomrecipespauladeencinnamonrollsrecipeamphtml but added a little bit of red colored food gel to the dough once the cinnamon rolls are cut and divided out carefully unroll each roll loosely into the pan in intestine like shapes before proofing them out the second time be sure to leave some space between some of the bits so that they can expand making the shaping look much more organlike i divided the glaze into two parts after making the whole batch for the bloody half i mixed in red and copper food gels to give it an aged blood look i put that into a piping bag you can use a zip lock bag with the corner snipped too and piped it in between some of the folds after baking as well as injecting it slightly into parts i thinned the other half out with another tbsp of hot water and drizzled that over the whole thing and swirled it around to give it that extra oozy and glossy look edit format
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,perfect portions
food,not_removed,the legs in your table are uneven edit the food looks good also
food,not_removed,looks great but we need to cut our portions in half as the fattest continent on the planet
food,not_removed,is that banana bread
food,not_removed,this is definitely above standard college fair
food,not_removed,that meatloaf looks delish
food,not_removed,i dont want to party with you sorry 😉
food,not_removed,why is your sour cream yellow and crying
food,not_removed,one loaf is regular and the other has chocolate chips
food,not_removed,came here expecting pizza rolls pizza and bacon am disappointed
food,not_removed,its honey butter for the banana bread
food,not_removed,i liek me some crème brùlée
food,not_removed,my sister is in town so of course i had to show off my sous vide skills main course was faux dry aged flatiron steak sous vide roasted asparagus and brussel sprouts and scalloped potatoes i totally intended to make yorkshire pudding as well but after a few beers i forgot about it oh welldinner still turned out great without it if you want to make crème brûlée as good or better than what you get at a restaurant check out wwwchefstepscom thats where i got the recipe that i used faux dry aged marinade was from sainsaire website just make sure to watch out for the jars trying to flip over when you put them in the bath because of trapped air use tongs and hold them underwater until enough air escapes
food,not_removed,ive never knew people actually cooked things other than steaks using sous vide
food,not_removed,you should definitely try making duck or chicken confit sous vide it is incredibly easy and the result is amazing i would even say that it is arguably better than the traditional method of cooking confit
food,not_removed,organic what food clothing etc you need to give details
food,not_removed,delivery stand alone store or a brand that would be sold in grocery or specialty stores
food,not_removed,recently started a diet and this isnt even fair
food,not_removed,beautiful burger did you post this in rburgers cause you should
food,not_removed,looks delicious and healthy care to share the recipe and if so do you have any suggestion what can replace the grapefruit juice thanks
food,not_removed,i need to try this
food,not_removed,chicken breast sliced tbls minced garlic tbls unsalted butter brussel sprouts green beans cajon sauce sliced the chicken while roasting the garlic in butter squeezed half a grapefruit in the pan and added the chicken steamed the brussel sprouts and green beans in a separate pan when the chicken had cooked i added an of cup of cajon sauce and cooked it down then added the brussel sprouts i played the green beans and topped it with the chicken and brussel sprouts sorry i dont really know much more im still learning to cook but i dont really follow directions and cook what feels good
food,not_removed,where did you get this from i want one
food,not_removed,this looks mediocre at best
food,not_removed,bet that was an expensive piece of coleslaw bread
food,not_removed,a place called rolld in sydney
food,not_removed,probably does but had one recently and it was unexpectedly amazing
food,not_removed,i love using turkey in meatballs blends really well with the flavour of the onion garlic and parsley in the meatballs
food,not_removed,there wasnt really a set recipe lean ground beef ground turkey egg then a lot of eyeballing worcestershire sauce garlic powder ground mustard seed salt pepper parsley chopped onions and chopped mushrooms possibly a few other spices i cant recall my mom and i made these together and she doesnt really write down recipes but shes excellent at estimating and having things come out tasting great
food,not_removed,i could eat that in one bite
food,not_removed,two of my favorite dishes combined nice i would quadruple the amount of cheese though
food,not_removed,i did make it with a chicken tender so while eating it in one bite wasnt my original intention its totally feasible fancy kitchens do make dishes in tiny portions amirite
food,not_removed,bahaha trust me there is so much cheese involved in this
food,not_removed,yes they do one of the many reasons i dont go to fancy restaurants
food,not_removed,good thing i get to control my own portions extra extra alfredo yes please
food,not_removed,i might have to try the tomato sauce next to the alfredo though i dont think ive ever done that of course i will make a whole box of pasta and chicken breasts to adequately try it and no im not fat lol
food,not_removed,i just combined my two favorite pasta dishes give me all the sauce
food,not_removed,dude kfc might bankrupt if you start selling these
food,not_removed,saved thanks
food,not_removed,looking so darn good
food,not_removed,sowhat is hpbrown sauce
food,not_removed,thanks i vaguely remember a movie with colin ferrel where they were putting it in coffee that is what had me confused i assumed it would be sweet if it was going in a cup of joe now thinking about dumping into my morning brew im thinking that movie was pretty fucked up
food,not_removed,this looks great but i would love to see the actual color without any photoshop color correction the last three pictures are dramatically different color sauces
food,not_removed,i am so hungry right now and this is not helping
food,not_removed,not sure that things can be both sticky and crispy
food,not_removed,its not a healthy food but its so appetizing nice execution i think it lacks green vegetables to be a complete dish
food,not_removed,jack daniels isnt bourbon its tennessee whiskey
food,not_removed,i am gunning for them as well
food,not_removed,in moscow kfc sells horrendous chicken yet its not went bankrupt
food,not_removed,wow httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgnvkbvuqo
food,not_removed,iirc its a british condiment i dont remember tasting it but i think it is similar to i found that explains a bit about it
food,not_removed,it is a british sauce get some goes great with a bacon or sausage sandwich get some also goes great with any sort of pie
food,not_removed,the coating is very crispy and the sauce is sticky
food,not_removed,you could also add them to a tortilla wrap with a bit of salad
food,not_removed,lol its bourbon
food,not_removed,those look delicious ive always wondered what the best options are for doing chicken like your post here ive tried frozen fingers before and they never are that great what would you suggest op
food,not_removed,i found a bottle in denver at a specialty meat purveyor its a little sweeter than also more brown like heinz just go for which ever one of those you like maybe add a touch of worcherstershire cough
food,not_removed,that would be perfect
food,not_removed,at a pinch i have found using precooked chicken tenderloins work fine the ones for salad obviously if they are frozen defrost them first i know many people will disagree with me but if you have the bbq sauce already made up using fresh precooked chicken tenderloins saves a huge amount of time as you just need to fry them long enough for the coating to get crispy then it just takes a few minutes to cook them in the sauce it takes about minutes to cook these if the bbq sauce is already prepared and you use precooked chicken tenderloins
food,not_removed,well im also in tn and thats pretty ignorant jd chooses to call it tn whiskey it is in fact bourbon
food,not_removed,i believe the correct term is shitty cheap american alcohol
food,not_removed,if its not made in kentucky it aint bourbon i dont care what the new laws say and jd doesnt choose anything until they changed the standards for what could and couldnt be called bourbon they fell short of the standard just like how its not scotch whiskey either and im sure youll find this just as ignorant but the only jack daniels is good for anyway is cleaning open wounds if im the woods and hurt myself you want to taste quality bourbon whiskey try blanton bookers boathouse or pappy van winkle the last one is pretty hard to get your hands on though so maybe learn a little bit about the topic before you call someone ignorant
food,not_removed,amazing no dig at your daughter but i just cant understand why some people prefer to cook shrimp shell on id still be drooling over this either way
food,not_removed,wow im and i made noodles for dinner
food,not_removed,thats incredible at i could barely make kraft dinner
food,not_removed,tell her it looks fantastic
food,not_removed,it looks delicious i will try it too
food,not_removed,so heres hoping that she opens a restaurant one day so all can enjoy this amazing looking dish
food,not_removed,wow looking a very spicy
food,not_removed,im hungry now
food,not_removed,prawn shells have amazing complex flavours when you cook prawns with the shell intact it infuses the sweet briny flavours into the prawns and the dish itself thats how the french makes bouillabaisse and bisque and how south east asians makes their soups they cook out the shellfishs flavour from the shells into the stews and soups
food,not_removed,recipe
food,not_removed,but hummus tho
food,not_removed,ill take mine with no cilantro please
food,not_removed,is the place to start
food,not_removed,ill take mine with extra cilantro but like the amount of food seriously this looks delicious but it looks like a snack
food,not_removed,beautiful
food,not_removed,great photography avocado toast is my favourite breakfast
food,not_removed,nothing beats a ribeye
food,not_removed,why are people touting me ugh
food,not_removed,pretty presentation the carrots are a nice touch for color
food,not_removed,raw minced pork im not seeing any raw pork
food,not_removed,yo that christmas star tho
food,not_removed,raw pork is likesuper dangerous
food,not_removed,thanks the blueberries themselves are also so cute
food,not_removed,its covered by the red onion on the side
food,not_removed,yep it has been there for months now🙈
food,not_removed,couldnt dare to try at first but in love with it now in germany there are some specific regulations about the meat quality when its about the mett so its pretty safep
food,not_removed,not in germany its like one of our national dishes
food,not_removed,right ill stick to the lovely looking ham and sausage thanks
food,not_removed,still theres certain parasites that pigs pick up with prett high frequency regardless of regulations i just wwouldnt risk muscle worms for a snack
food,not_removed,no it isnt pretty high frequency trichinosis has been virtually eradicated in the usa and eu so eating raw pork is relatively safe certainly as safe as eating raw or rare beef
food,not_removed,has been eradicated amongst humans however not in animal populations the reason it is uncommon in humans is due to the myriad of educational campaigns that have been run about cooking pork thouroughly before eating it
food,not_removed,it hasbeen virtually eradicated in domestic animal populations there are virtually no cases in germany where they eat raw pork trichinosis is rare in humans because trichinella is rare in modern farming
food,not_removed,whats the texture of the octopus octopus to me alwayssuper chewy
food,not_removed,that looks really good ahaha must have been super fragrant
food,not_removed,that looks fantastic did you braise then grill or saute it
food,not_removed,i actually braised it in white wine pickle juice for minutes first the pickle juice may sound weird but really pairs well if you undercook octopus its chewy if you overcook it its chewy i find roughly minutes low boil is usually right for this kind of octopus to answer your question this wasnt the most tender octopus ive had but it was still pretty good
food,not_removed,thank you braised and then charred in a cast iron skillet then tossed in butter sauce
food,not_removed,good information
food,not_removed,poor doggy lol
food,not_removed,late as in how late • ε •
food,not_removed,well you know we have to ask for the recipe now
food,not_removed,heavy breathing
food,not_removed,im more impressed that it fits around the bowl so perfectly
food,not_removed,teach us im in need of knowing how to create this deliciousness
food,not_removed,and no recipe
food,not_removed,op we need that recipe dammit
food,not_removed,ranimalslookingatfood
food,not_removed,i need to make this
food,not_removed,id like to know the recipe too this looks awesome
food,not_removed,hmmmmm
food,not_removed,yes please
food,not_removed,i think a nice table cloth would make the food look even better i would think its all part of the presentation if he had candles and a white table cloth that alone adds value you can ask gordon ramsey if that pizza was on a prison floor it wouldnt look as good
food,not_removed,i mean thats great buts lets hear more about the doggo
food,not_removed,that looks good af that rug on the other hand
food,not_removed,how u make this emoji
food,not_removed,thats his tablecloth dude
food,not_removed,but the title
food,not_removed,• ε • just like this
food,not_removed,huh how bout that
food,not_removed,🙄😔 i didnt even bother to read im sorry for the wasted time haha
food,not_removed,• € • 😭
food,not_removed,question is if this tablecloth were much nicer would it deter from the food looking good did he strategically put an ugly tablecloth to make his food pop out im awaiting your answer so we can discuss this further
food,not_removed,nah its all cool pretty dumb that you got downvoted for that people on here act like they never make mistakes
food,not_removed,i know right haha well either way that looked fantastic have a great weekend
food,not_removed,cheers
food,not_removed,salad broiled cabbage carrots bell pepper red onion topping broiled portobella mushroom with cayenne and cumin and a combination of andouille and garlic herb chicken sausage salsa tomatillo pureed with garlic and cilantro and spices with fresh corn and red onion tortillas mission flour tortillas cheese land o lakes white american cheese oh yeah taste so good would make again but i dont know when ill have this combo of leftovers again
food,not_removed,that looks fire im here laying in bed at am craving some spicy cheesy crunchy nachos now
food,not_removed,hope you scored some hours later
food,not_removed,eh its a homemade cheddar sauce sorry it disagrees with your visual palate it was pretty damn good in real life
food,not_removed,i guess that qualifies as food
food,not_removed,im sure it tasted awesome but it looks like a plate of random crap
food,not_removed,the ranch at outback is bangin
food,not_removed,there is a brand called kens steakhouse for storebought there is no better
food,not_removed,any peppercorn ranch
food,not_removed,the perfect ranch is some you make yourself its not hard either mayo buttermilk ranch packet from hidden valley im not sure on the ratios because the last time i worked in a restaurant was years ago and we made a very large amount at a time
food,not_removed,the rstaurants that make it make it using hidden valley powder and add buttermilk and mayonaisse yup
food,not_removed,omg im not even a huge ranch person and that stuff is like straight up crack
food,not_removed,yeah it is why cant there just be ranch like that in real life
food,not_removed,darn ill have to try it out
food,not_removed,okay cool so which bottle from the store is that
food,not_removed,cant tell if serious or wanting to get banned
food,not_removed,the ones labeled hiddn valley ranch powder packets just add buttermilk and mayo they are in the salad dressing aisle next to the bottles of hidden valley ranch
food,not_removed,my bad just annoying that someone would just go find a similar question on yahoo and copy paste answers from there
food,not_removed,soit doesnt come in a bottle
food,not_removed,sure once you make it it is cost effective to make your own but if you insistthe powder is conveniently located right next to the bottled stuff
food,not_removed,does the company that sells the packets or any other company offer a service where you can just bring all the stuff and they can make it and put it in a bottle for you i feel like if i attempted something like this somethings going to catch on fire
food,not_removed,no they will sell you a bottle it is right next to the powder stuff in every grocery store in the world trust me i have been to every single one it is there btwi have removed your post this is gone on long enough i think you have found your answers and if not you can always go to raskreddit
food,not_removed,wait they do have bottled versions cause the hidden valley ranch is really not that good in my opinion its flavor is nothing like restaurants and is way thick
food,not_removed,that is why i recommended the powder version you can cotrol the add ins like buttermilk add more for more vinegar flavor and mayo
food,not_removed,oh buttermilk is what gives it the vinegar flavor
food,not_removed,send her to my house yum
food,not_removed,thats beautiful my stomach totally just growled looking at this
food,not_removed,recipe please
food,not_removed,this looks seriously amazing recipe

food,not_removed,oh god bittermelon
food,not_removed,this is neat i work at a japanese place in texas and we have plastic boxes like those but shittier
food,not_removed,i like goya champuru when i eat out i can not make it at home and make it taste good
food,not_removed,yeah but thats a bento not a plate
food,not_removed,goya champru is definitely something you have to eat when out what part of japan p s that is my dream plate no food touches
food,not_removed,okinawa
food,not_removed,yassssssss i miss living there
food,not_removed,these are hands down the best looking homemade nachos ive ever witnessed
food,not_removed,dude if you get the nachos stuck together thats one nacho
food,not_removed,that looks amazingbut i can see a sea horse on the top
food,not_removed,i am physically attracted to these nachos
food,not_removed,look good but a bit dry
food,not_removed,are the tortilla chips homemade seems like no matter what brand i buy they never taste as good as pretty much any mexican restaurants chips
food,not_removed,while the preparation of the ingredients is commendable the execution could use improvement the slight char on the perimeter chips is excessive you want a caramel color at most not chocolate a true nacho artist uses the individual nacho stack method over the pile method the resultant eating experience is far superior texmex expert
food,not_removed,nachos are burnt cheese may as well be burnt too not enough of it anyways kidney beans and what look like pinto beans have been drained and blasted with water leading to peeling and bbs bland bean syndrome lacks salsa or really any condiment good effort but work on your presentation and flavors also when washing your beans do it gently so they dont peel i will accept downvotes for what i have said
food,not_removed,holy guacamole whats next ravioli
food,not_removed,how are these burnt ass chips getting so many upvotes they look way overcooked
food,not_removed,looks like shit
food,not_removed,these nachos kick ass
food,not_removed,looks like you burned the tortillas
food,not_removed,i bet those chips taste like crap burned

food,not_removed,damn that looks good
food,not_removed,whats all that green stuff
food,not_removed,gonna need a recipe boss
food,not_removed,yum belongs in rtryphobia though
food,not_removed,are some of the beans on top kidney beans or just really dark pinto beans
food,not_removed,thats looking yummy i will really love to make it
food,not_removed,this looks so amazing
food,not_removed,whats in it
food,not_removed,those look amazing and must have lead to some amazing farts
food,not_removed,almost enough for me
food,not_removed,do you deliver
food,not_removed,that looks yummy
food,not_removed,my favorite food and these look delicious needs some more jalapeño
food,not_removed,every single time ive eaten nachos ive felt like ive already eaten too much by the third bite as to make it completely unenjoyable but it sure is beautiful to look at it i give you that
food,not_removed,everything done home is much better and tastier
food,not_removed,best i can do is buy a bag of tortillas and cheese dip feelsbadman
food,not_removed,recipe
food,not_removed,that char on those outside chips tho you should be proud of yourself
food,not_removed,wow these look awesome
food,not_removed,that looks delicious it reminds me of baja fresh nachos
food,not_removed,looks good enough to eat to me
food,not_removed,this is a fucking masterpiece im a little teary eyed
food,not_removed,hello your post was removed because it violates rule it does not contain the correct tag the new tag system requires or to show the source of your image the tag system might be better explained in please do not use multiple tags and only use the tags listed here
food,not_removed,this looks fucking disgusting
food,not_removed,woah there chris traeger i didnt know you browsed reddit
food,not_removed,not nearly enough cheese for homemade nachos if you are making your own dont be holding back with a few strands like a spider made these
food,not_removed,i have never did anything that fancy for nachos the most i do is some tortilla chips on a cookie sheet some taco meat and some onion and shredded cheddar cheese sprinkle it over the chips cook it in oven a few mins till crisp and done sometimes i use just plain hamburger instead of taco meat once i mixed the taco meat with some refried beans and then added some tomato on top along with the onion and cheese it doesnt look pretty like what you did there but it sure taste good to me at least
food,not_removed,you havent seen mine
food,not_removed,probably because he baked them instead of microwaving
food,not_removed,challenge accepted
food,not_removed,need more cheese is you ask me edit well you can say that about just everything
food,not_removed,you are not looking hard enough the cheese and chips are both burnt just saying ive seen better
food,not_removed,jokes on you its actually rubber playfood nachos
food,not_removed,hands down this is the best nach i can ever remember
food,not_removed,die replacement friends
food,not_removed,rdude
food,not_removed,oclock
food,not_removed,i looked forever for this damn seahorse and i cannot find it
food,not_removed,ok you got me ive been looking for this damn seahorse for the past minutes
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,he looks really smug as well
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,salsa
food,not_removed,food networks website has a pretty good methodrecipe for making your own i tried it with mission brand corn tortillas and my chips came out pretty much just like a restaurants except that i over salted them whoops
food,not_removed,would you say youre atexmexpert
food,not_removed,what self respecting nacho eater uses the individual stack method nachos are meant to be piled high in this fashion nachos arent meant to be tidy they arent meant to be the exact same ingredient every bite they are meant to be a mountain of delicious flavors no one bite the same they are meant to be messy and glorious how long would it take to prepare a similar portion to the meal pictured minutes who the hell has time for that prep by the time your nachos are done cooking mine are devoured and my pants unbuttoned to relieve my satisfied mangut
food,not_removed,is this where there are like pita chips on a plate with some cheese and its called nachos
food,not_removed,my man
food,not_removed,i would eat the nachos from the pic but sure as hell id always eat yours over his
food,not_removed,break a tooth on those fuckers
food,not_removed,im sure the ones on the edge are the only ones burnt downvote and move on if it bothers you id eat the shit out of those nachos
food,not_removed,this is where boners go to die
food,not_removed,put the non green things on the nachos make hot put the green things on the nachos
food,not_removed,just look at the picture
food,not_removed,looks like jalapeños and scallions pretty standard fare
food,not_removed,recipe theyre fucking nachos
food,not_removed,did you not see the fucking picture what else do you need
food,not_removed,do you just hate nachos
food,not_removed,literally the greatest nachos ever made
food,not_removed,hahaha this made my morning
food,not_removed,i believe that one ounce of that would literally kill me my body is like a microchip
food,not_removed,im chris hanson and i want to talk to you about these nachos
food,not_removed,nachos need cheese sauce that wont separate under heat then you can put a layer of real cheese on top and hold back on the heat a bit
food,not_removed,that sounds so good
food,not_removed,refried beans are gasm inducing do you make them yourself
food,not_removed,microwave nachos are blasphemy
food,not_removed,i believe the word youre looking for is caramelised my father
food,not_removed,thank you
food,not_removed,haha i see it now thanks by top i thought you meant towards the top of the picture not on top
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,its more like oclock
food,not_removed,its small but it sticks out because its a different color than its surroundings its a little towards the center
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,its a bean with the skin peeled off a bit
food,not_removed,half past
food,not_removed,avocado
food,not_removed,i certainly will from this moment on
food,not_removed,get out
food,not_removed,delete this

food,not_removed,recipe please
food,not_removed,oh god thats going to take me some time its not a small task i can tell you that the rub was made of spices and the sauce was made with apple cider vinegar fresh thyme fresh onion fresh garlic ketchup salt black pepper cayenne pepper smoked paprika cumin and slices of bacon i wrapped the fresh thyme around the bacon and then removed it after the sauce was ready very smoky a little spicy and pretty great i also let them smoke at for hours put them in foil for hours and then finished them uncovered i tented the foil and put a little apple juice in the bottom of the tent foil to help infuse some sweetness and moisture after the tenting i waited until minutes left in smoker and brushed the sauce on and finished it off in the smoker i used pecan chips for the wood i also marinated the ribs in the fridge for hours in the dry rub removed the ribs minutes prior to cooking i cant go into measurements on the stuff because i just eye ball it and taste as i go i know thats probably not super helpful but i hope its better than nothing
food,not_removed,nice job 👍
food,not_removed,what oil did you use to sear it
food,not_removed,in addition to the herbs i marinate the beef in i infused neutral oil with rosemary months or so so you get more flavor without having to deal with the touch leafs and stem
food,not_removed,are you complaining about the lack of juice
food,not_removed,wow thats dedication great work obviously not your first roast
food,not_removed,its handy to have a bottle sitting around works on many stuff sometimes add teaspoon to your beef au jus if youre feeling fancy

food,not_removed,poke chop sammich sounds pretty damn good right about now
food,not_removed,this looks absolutely disgusting ill take two d
food,not_removed,in the mid west pork chop sandwiches are really popular and fairly common they generally use a meat tenderizer and flatten a boneless pork chop then bread it and fry it
food,not_removed,hell yeah buddy hell yeah
food,not_removed,you cooked it while vacuum sealed
food,not_removed,isnt it a tenderloin medallion thats smashed flat at least thats how ive always cooked them and thought thats what they were called
food,not_removed,the devil
food,not_removed,never heard of chickfila closed every sunday sucks too because i feel like that is the day i usually crave it most often haha
food,not_removed,yes in a food saver bag with pickle juice in a sous vide circulator
food,not_removed,ive only seen them called tenderloins
food,not_removed,s ftfy
food,not_removed,never heard of that after googling and finding out what it is i am surprised to eat fast food seems like you would be a pretty good chef
food,not_removed,im not surprised if it was true the company is run by a guy who is very serious about his christianity so its probably not a super gay friendly environment to work in anyway the whole reason its not open on sundays is because of the owner of the company wants no one to work on sunday and give time for employees to go to church
food,not_removed,question is it normal to put bamboo in a glass vase with water before it is eaten
food,not_removed,share recipe please
food,not_removed,how did you slice it so thin for the second bake without it crumbling
food,not_removed,i dont know wtf that is but it looks like salsa soup so id eat the hell out of it with some corn chips
food,not_removed,its a brazilian stew with coconut milk tomatoes jalapeño peanuts cilantro ginger and garlic i always make it with my leftover turkey
food,not_removed,this looks way more delicious than a tv dinner good job
food,not_removed,i miss having those
food,not_removed,wheres the brownie
food,not_removed,thanks a shot of the patties in the pan
food,not_removed,lmao how is one shrimp a course but it still looks damn tasty
food,not_removed,that technically wasnt one of the seven that was more of an amusebouche
food,not_removed,if at any point in time youre holding a plate with a sauce sideways stop youre doing it wrong
food,not_removed,i dont care how they hold it as long as they tell me whats in it
food,not_removed,make it in a high side oven safe pan add milk into the scrambled egg mixture then bake congrats you just made a fritata its an open omelette
food,not_removed,they do like great before folding but something about a folded omelette that just tastes because i think it is the unknown surprise that hits your taste buds
food,not_removed,folded omelettes can look great too this video gets thrown around a lot on reddit but if you havent seen it id definitely recommend i love making the american style variety he shows
food,not_removed,that does look greati do agree with the titlei have been making omellettes for breakfast now for a few days and have thought the exact same thingtoday i had mushroomsliced tomato mozzarella and bacon
food,not_removed,makes me hungrythanks
food,not_removed,live life on the dangerous side and skip the fold
food,not_removed,they look better before you put mushrooms on them also
food,not_removed,i always have these big plans when i want to make in omelette than i realize i am at home and not in a restaurant kitchen and i am the only one eating it so i just make some kind of skillet aha
food,not_removed,thank you i never like folded omelettes they look like nasty crepes an open one though is a thing of beauty especially if you use colorful ingredients like mini tomatoes green onions bell peppers sausage
food,not_removed,mushrooms italian sausage hopefully of the hot variety and basil
food,not_removed,this is the way to go you dont need to fold just throw that thing under a broil for a min different yes but still delicious
food,not_removed,frittata in my experience in the us a frittata is often cooked in the oven though that doesnt make too much sense considering frittata basically means fried
food,not_removed,yeah this was a clear out the fridge omelette italian sausage mushroom and baby spinach was for dinner so it was rather large for two people
food,not_removed,someone downvoted you for hating on mushrooms i love mushrooms but you are allowed to not like mushrooms thats okay have an upvote
food,not_removed,high five fellow mushroom hater
food,not_removed,spinach
food,not_removed,personally i make them in a well season cast iron skillet and will cook the ingredients with heat on the stove add the eggs at the end and then bake
food,not_removed,thats just the way the world works bud lol some people suck
food,not_removed,i actually really love the flavor of mushrooms but the texture just ruins everything
food,not_removed,yum
food,not_removed,thats exactly what i noticed they do in the us usually it comes out pretty fluffy and not to brown at the top that is different than what a frittata is in italy where it gets flipped at least once and its typically fried in a pan
food,not_removed,mushroom haters have a hard time in life i understand
food,not_removed,i flip mine for service so the top is browned
food,not_removed,ah a new twist on the sour donut
food,not_removed,as opposed to savory donuts
food,not_removed,those look more like prison doughnuts
food,not_removed,do you have a recipe
food,not_removed,a shot glass works well for cutting the hole
food,not_removed,sourdough
food,not_removed,sour cream donuts are great
food,not_removed,wouldnt that be a deep fried bagel

food,not_removed,uwoohaa thought you two might appreciate
food,not_removed,was it good rate out of and describe the texture and flavor
food,not_removed,what a waste of perfectly good without egg udon noodles
food,not_removed,wow thanks for the mention dude looks yummy did you make it nice thick udon
food,not_removed,it was beef flavor texture was perfect not soggy cause i ate it right off the stove didnt even let it cool
food,not_removed,amen to that brother
food,not_removed,yeah i made it but not from scratch it comes in a package from safeway basically just like top ramen but its refrigerated cause the noodles arent dry still super good tho
food,not_removed,ah so are they preboiled
food,not_removed,im not sure they might be or they might be the raw dough the noodle is made from ill read the package tomorrow and get back to you on that
food,not_removed,sweet thanks the udon i usually get is dry in a package like pasta
food,not_removed,we have a bunch of that too its basically a brick like top ramen this is different they probably have it at your local major grocery store like safeway or fred meyers if you have either of those near you at my safeway its kinda by the produce at the back of the store in one of those open endcap refrigerators its actually at the end of the very last row by produce the end of the fridge row where all the pre cut lettuce bags for salads are
food,not_removed,thanks for the detailed directions but im in greece we dont have those stores here the udon i get are not in a brick they look similar to pasta in their packaging like im guessing the brick ones are preboiled the ones i get need their time to prepare
food,not_removed,the ones i get look like this
food,not_removed,yeh these are precooked
food,not_removed,i believe the cuban version of sloppy joe all over latin america you can find sloppy joe looking sandwiches made out of ground sausage or meat and tomato sauce just recently in mexico i had chorizo and tomatoe sauce torta with cabbage

food,not_removed,someone fried up foghorn leghorn
food,not_removed,ty so much
food,not_removed,of course i brined it over night in water pepper garlic salt lawrys and then generously coated in flour seasoned with pepper salt and paprika
food,not_removed,i did i made french fries to take advantage of the oil i was using for the fried chicken was gonna make mac n cheese and mashed potatoes but too lazy i didnt use buttermilk just brined it in seasoned water then coated it in seasoned flour
food,not_removed,i think im gonna have to get me some kfc now
food,not_removed,try it with waffles if you havent already the maple syrup goes great with chicken
food,not_removed,most definitely if only i could find my waffle maker
food,not_removed,how do they buns hold up while waiting to be servedeaten can you make the buns for instance hour in advance before serving
food,not_removed,yup so the first complete image in the gallery is right after the buns were done but the ones with a bunch of bubs in a plate were served a free his later at a buddys house the buns stuck together a little so you have to take care pulling them apart but taste wise theyre fine i would suggest throwing them back in the steamer for a few minutes if possible or into a pan with some tinfoil and splashing some water beside the tinfoil to warm them up a touch you can also wet your finger and throw rub them on both sides and throw them in the microwave for seconds but id use this as a last resort since they warm up and stay most but arent steamy the recipe link also says they freeze who but i havent tried that yet
food,not_removed,mmmmmmmmmmm
food,not_removed,eggporn those look amazing
food,not_removed,eggs and cado is definitely one of my top favorite flavor combos looks amazing
food,not_removed,i would fight someone for the tuna at the core we are gonna miss tuna once we have eaten the last one but geez its so good
food,not_removed,nrrrgggfff this looks delicious but why so little tuna
food,not_removed,jesus
food,not_removed,i will take all the salmon no worries
food,not_removed,drool
food,not_removed,where can i buy salmon like this philadelphia
food,not_removed,i like plain sushi like that but my favorite sushi usually has some more going on my favorite local roll has super white tuna avocado cucumber kani kama with unagi sauce and masago maybe that is super american but i dig it
food,not_removed,ugh sushi is one of the foods that look so delicious to me but i cant force myself to like it
food,not_removed,the stuff is really expensive
food,not_removed,good
food,not_removed,where do you buy your fish
food,not_removed,wow that looks amazing who was the lucky person that you served this too
food,not_removed,not seasoned looks nice but dry
food,not_removed,based on the stainless steel background im assuming this was taken in a kitchen and that you made this good fucking job bud you made a salad
food,not_removed,woops i didnt include my cornish hens that i made the broth for my soup from
food,not_removed,recipe please
food,not_removed,pls can you post your recipe it looks yummy
food,not_removed,uhhhhhhhg i just want a satisfying video of it being scooped out and cheeze oozing everywhere looks amazing
food,not_removed,i feel like this made a huge mess somewhere
food,not_removed,this looks better than the noodles and co mac cheese thats disagreeing with my stomach right now
food,not_removed,have you ever tried cubing up a ham steak and tossing it in there that is how i do mine sometimes some broccoli also
food,not_removed,made in a cast iron pan to give in to the hype
food,not_removed,take a gander at the top comment enjoy
food,not_removed,next time i cook this up ill be sure to record that its amazing when the spoon breaks through the light crust and then you just have steaming gooey mac and cheese as you plop it in your bowl mmmmmmm
food,not_removed,no mess except that some of the butter dripped off the skillet while it was in the oven but we had laid aluminum foil under it to catch the mess it was an awesomely cheesy meal
food,not_removed,ive never found noodles and company to be that great
food,not_removed,that sounds good we will throw in some jalapeños and bacon sometimes and thats always delicious
food,not_removed,just what i imagined mmmmm
food,not_removed,so cheezy
food,not_removed,tjs colormatches their miniroses and buttercream frosting
food,not_removed,looks amazing especially the corn
food,not_removed,i cant believe ive never tried to use fries to pick out the best bits of marrow
food,not_removed,marrow is amazingly versatile if you know what youre doing i like adding it to gravy
food,not_removed,what does marrow taste like
food,not_removed,it tastes like meat butter
food,not_removed,its hard to describe beef marrow which i think is pictured up there has this unique fatty taste and texture since its mainly the yellow marrow thats found in long bones which has a ton of fat in it i definitely recommend you try it at least once in your life i grew up eating it and i have it every chance that i get
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,interesting ps lol love your username
food,not_removed,i find it strange that so many havent perhaps its because my dad can only cook curry and meat used in them generally covers marrow bones love marrow
food,not_removed,where did you grow up and on what occasions did you have it dinners at fancy restaraunts on special occasions or for dinner every once in a while etc
food,not_removed,im chinese and my mom would boil beefporklamb soup bones a lot so whenever she did the marrow was pretty much a treat for all of us its not really something you make an entire meal out of just something you have on the side its super rich if you ate enough of it in one sitting to get full youd probably feel awful afterwards lol ive had it a few times at trendier restaurants and some grocery stores stock precut bones for baking now
food,not_removed,interesting we had bone soups as well but i dont remember ever seeing anyone eat the bone marrow i probably wouldnt have wanted to even if i was offered it though
food,not_removed,thai basil charsui pork soft egg prawns baby book choy mmmmm
food,not_removed,isnt that rice noodles glass not vermicilli
food,not_removed,not sure rice noodle or glass noodle are all made with starchrice yam potato mung bean etc the one i used said 米粉絲
food,not_removed,gorgeous op
food,not_removed,french madeleines
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,exercising creative license with those sprinkles
food,not_removed,looks a little more like chopped up celophane to me
food,not_removed,haha very much so
food,not_removed,looks great proud of you sides
food,not_removed,did you sear first or just uncover
food,not_removed,awesome ill try that
food,not_removed,god damnit now in hungry
food,not_removed,thanks roasted it in top of a bed of potatoes onions carrots celery and garlic
food,not_removed,i leave my chicken uncovered and it turns out like this
food,not_removed,good
food,not_removed,dried goods bags of rice and lentils and chickpeas etc are ridiculously cheap and last forever
food,not_removed,if theres a local asian grocery store or one not far they usually have like a gazillion flavors of ramen its pretty awesome
food,not_removed,find some good food blogs watch some cooking tutorials if you can you can rent cookbooks from your library i can send you some suggestions if youd like simple tacos are a pretty good basic starting point you can load them up with veggies beans rice andor chickenturkey ground or not stirfry is a good way to get in lots of veggies too you can use frozen making your own curries is a lot simpler than you might think if you have the spices let me know if you need more specifics i cook for both me and my roommate on a pretty cheap budget
food,not_removed,get a big bag of rice at one of those ethnic stores beans and lentils and stuff too veggies are dirtcheap you should probably also splurge on some spices too
food,not_removed,get a skillet a pot and a small strainer and a small cooking sheet thaw chicken breast and cut it into strips and cook it in the skillet i will sometimes make a packet of rice a roni in the skillet and when it starts boiling put the chiken breast cut into strips in it and cover it and turn the heat down to a simmer by the time the water boils off or is absorbed the chicken will be cooked you can also bake the the chicken breast from frozen preheat to place on a cookie sheet and wait about an hour too long and it will be dry though along with any of these meals buy some frozen mixed veggies and place cups in water apply high heat and as soon as the water starts to boil turn off the stove and strain out the water season any of this stuff however you want its tasty and healthy low carb granola and sausage or bacon is good for breakfast if you like that
food,not_removed,the frozen food section is your friend a lot of stores sell like bags of frozen chicken breasts they usually are flash frozen individually so they dont stick together and are normally very cheap these are perfect because you can take out an individual serving and let it thaw frozen vegetables are great because they dont go bad as quickly as fresh veggies but still have plenty of nutrients they also sell frozen herbs that are perfect for the same reason as the vegetables and come in these like little individual cubes rice pasta and beans are a great way to add some carbs to your diet and are relatively cheap especially when bought in bulk learn to like generic things i grew up in a name brand household and a lot of generic brand items taste just as good as the name brand if not better you may have to go through trial and error though as some generic products are also absolutely awful
food,not_removed,check out rmealprepsunday
food,not_removed,a couple of recommendations here make sure to stock up on your basic herbs and spices namely salt pepper garlic powder onion powder cumin oregano paprika cinnamon basil thyme rosemary ginger tumeric and curry powder with these basic herbs and spices you will have most food items covered dont forget to get your basic soy sauce oils and vinegars as well to have those on hand now my advice is start basic take a couple of breasts of chicken and simply cook them in a skillet with oilbutter salt and pepper toss them in the fridge but take one or two each night and prepare them a different way one night you can slice the chicken up and use it on a salad another night dice up some of those breasts and cook them in a butter milk and flour mix to make a alfredo sauce pasta a different night perhaps quickly pan fry more breasts over high heat with veggies in soy sauce ginger and sesame seed oil for a quick stirfry also sammiches are a great way to quickly put things together that are tasty compliments to each ingredient in the sammich enjoy
food,not_removed,once you have your herbs and spice pantry built up the dried foods are your best friend one of my favorite things is to go to the bean section and get a bag of bean soup mix for it even comes with a spice packet although its not very strong so i tend to ditch it and use a few boullion cubes instead the quick soak method works fine just boil the beans on the package as directed a few hours later theyll be rehydrated and you can start adding spices basil sage thyme rosemary cayenne paprika just about anything works here to your taste and veg this will make a massive pot of beans and in the end it may end up looking more like chili than soup but its all the same in your stomach i augment it with diced onion garlic sweet potatoes and cabbage which are all cheap always keep some cabbage around you can chop up half of it to use immediately for soups and stirfries and the rest chop up and put into ziploc bags in the freezer to use as needed i freeze a lot of veg immediately so that it wont go bad and i can continue to stretch it out anyway when youre ready to serve the soup top it with cheese hot sauces or perhaps bacon to keep things interesting even with just plain rice brown recommended it will give you complete protein just in case you have those weeks youre feeling extra tight and if you get stuff for mexican food it can also serve as your refried beans substitute and as for ramen oh god please just do yourself a favor and spend the extra for something better than top ramen istg even a few cents more goes a loooooooooooong way for a better noodle experience and i always pile the tofu and veg on those too
food,not_removed,if youre comfortable cooking i recommend veggie lasagna turkey chili coconut rice tandoori spice chicken all super easy and excellent leftovers for lunch the next day cook double or triple the amount you need then freeze individual portions for a later date these are also a great goto meals to impress dinner guests i second the advice to purchase dried legumes and i add quinoa couscous and frozen or canned veggies to the list if you want to make your own hand cut pasta all you need is flour an egg and water super easy and impressive i make sure my kids know how to cook from scratch because its so much cheaper and tastier they are aged and can make everything from tacos and chili to bread and a killer greek marinade
food,not_removed,because you said you are not very good at cooking you eat chicken and also asked cooking equipment i want to remind you to properly handle raw chickenpoultry if you are not aware of that by the way if possible consider rgardening
food,not_removed,ramen all you need is ramen man
food,not_removed,enter the ramen life
food,not_removed,yeah and a fairly large container of good curry powder is inexpensive
food,not_removed,good plan basically just dried anything can be made in so many ways if you just eat the same way a college kid does adding all sorts of bulk stuff to your food it lasts so much longer
food,not_removed,this is restaurant quality looks amazing do you have a recipe
food,not_removed,the recipe for the breading is a blend of panko cornmeal flour garlic powder onion powder paprika salt and pepper the sauce is a bang bang sauce which is a mixture of mayo thai sweet chili sauce and chili paste i love the suggestion of brining it in apple cider vinegar
food,not_removed,are the tomatoes coated then fried or do they need to be dried out first
food,not_removed,whats the sauce on the side those look delicious im not a huge fan of tomatoes but id definitely eat those
food,not_removed,uk here all i know about fried green tomatoes is the fried green tomatoes at the whistle stop cafe movie theyre not a thing in uk but these look incredible do they have to be green unripe they look so good i want to try them now but i dont have green tomatoes noted the tips for soaking in vinegar steeping in salt it all sounds gorgeous
food,not_removed,look really good love them
food,not_removed,are these ready where you are at i have been harassing everyone i know to get some my fav part of summer one of many your username is a lot like the town i live inhmmm
food,not_removed,recipe
food,not_removed,oh i like fried tomatoeswhy i see this at midnight tt
food,not_removed,how can you call them fried green tomatoes when they arent green they look golden
food,not_removed,i use the same thing when breading pretty much anything i tried just corn meal and spices last time when making chicken nuggets which made them really pretty but the crust was grainy and gritty
food,not_removed,i actually like to quickpickle them in some apple cider vinegar with salt before frying gives them an extra zing
food,not_removed,i salt mine for a few hours it helps bring out the liquid makes a far superior product imo it could also all be in my head but i digress
food,not_removed,the crust will absorb the moisture and create kind of a wick that when applied to heat will allow the moisture to wick out quickly as it cooks when you remove the slices as they cool they will wick oil back into the tomato from the crust which causes the crust to slide off generally not the left over moisture to prevent this dip your whatever in just flour first then a binder like beaten eggs then your final crust mixture the binder does most of the work but having the flour in their first helps it stick a lot better similar to glue
food,not_removed,i sliced then battered

food,not_removed,thank you
food,not_removed,how did you make it
food,not_removed,first we made a asian inspired rub and roasted it on a mire poix while it was roasting we made a sweet but spicy glaze for the chicken with a little orange in it then blanch and shocked the broccoli and sauted in tree nuts and garlic garnished with roasted pine nuts
food,not_removed,ive found most of the chicken and waffles ive had to be way too sour and bitter was this one any better
food,not_removed,which vancouver
food,not_removed,this one is fantastic in my opinion youre right they are often done poorly does it compare to ma mommas or sugar park in new orleans no but its damn good for up here in canada
food,not_removed,this is the recipe
food,not_removed,how can you call this a grilled cheese if it has beef avocado salsa in it
food,not_removed,youre right its actually a taco fried cheese
food,not_removed,i like the ring of that
food,not_removed,small place called truly tasty in halifax nova scotia

food,not_removed,oh wow thats how you know its good and made from scratch im jealous eat some extra for me next time d
food,not_removed,tim hortons does variations of chocolate yeast doughnuts though perhaps not as a regular feature their chocolate whoppie pie doughnut used a round chocolate yeast doughnut unless im very much mistaken and i think their reeses doughnut promotion a year ago had filled chocolate doughnuts which i assume would be yeasted cuz how do you fill a cake doughtnut
food,not_removed,i worked at tim hortons and yes those were all chocolate yeast the very first one was the oreo donut they just announced a new donut caramel brownie batter which is also chocolate yeast
food,not_removed,oh man that sounds pretty good and im not even a big doughnut lover on second thought thats probably why it sounds so good to me because it sounds like a brownie rather than a doughnut
food,not_removed,is the picture upside down
food,not_removed,basically turbo garlic bread
food,not_removed,warm sauce on the side for dipping
food,not_removed,thought wed give these new spicy tenders a try when the food came home all i could smell was chili powder and for good reason in fact these tenders arent overcooked thats just chili powder lots and lots of chili powder we make blackened chicken about once a month and its a family favorite but if you want to experience these tenders run dont walk to your spices fill a spoon with chili powder put it in your mouth congratulations you have experienced hardees new chicken tenders

food,not_removed,okay and i did t even notice the name

food,not_removed,just started getting the vodoo in my work vending machine i have my first addiction
food,not_removed,route dill pickle is the greatest potato chip ever come fight me
food,not_removed,agreed voodoo is amazing i used to get them at wawa but havent figured out where to get them now that ive moved
food,not_removed,zapps are the best potato chips period i personally really like the barbeque
food,not_removed,the spicy cajun crawtators are so damn season heavy they could have been good i agree that these are by far the best
food,not_removed,i like the pickles then crawtators then voodoo but they are all good
food,not_removed,ive seen those voodoo bags before what exactly does voodoo taste like besides a dash of black magic
food,not_removed,i totally agree
food,not_removed,its like salt and vinegar mixed with bbq flavor
food,not_removed,oh my god just hearing that sounds good as f

food,not_removed,typical vegan propaganda the fuck out of here with that shit
food,not_removed,whats the difference between stock and broth i just dont know
food,not_removed,this looks amazing and how i picture them making the pho broth
food,not_removed,the smell must be amazing
food,not_removed,gimme a spoon man
food,not_removed,whats the thing calles that youre cooking it in never seen one
food,not_removed,a pain in the derriere but real beef stock tastes awesome
food,not_removed,how long do you cook it down and steep all the herbs and veggies
food,not_removed,it looks amazing what all do you use
food,not_removed,stock is made with mostly bones broth can be made with meat
food,not_removed,broth is just code for brown salt water
food,not_removed,and a nice toasty baguette
food,not_removed,its called a tilt skillet youll really only find them in professional kitchens
food,not_removed,maybe buying the stuff but stock is one of those things that ranks real low in the culinary difficulty realm
food,not_removed,this cooked for another full day after the pic was taken usually the total time is about full days
food,not_removed,to add to this stock is also made from the parts of the animal nobody wants to eat so the bones and undesirables are put together in a pot with other ingredients to draw out the flavor in the end its all strained so you end up with a nice flavorful liquid
food,not_removed,worked in a lot of kitchens most were a bit dated but some newer ones too just never seen one pretty cool
food,not_removed,tilt skillets are awesome couldnt agree more
food,not_removed,it just takes forever
food,not_removed,stock is also thicker due to the gelatin from the bones
food,not_removed,yeahthe beef you can see in the pic is the trimmings from two cuts of sirloin stuff we otherwise wouldnt have served the leek stalks arent usable either since only the bottoms are used even though the tops still have flavor in them theres also basil leaf stalks in the middle of the pic its just a combination of a ton of ingredients that still have flavor but cant be used in other dishes
food,not_removed,they are awesome can cook anything in them once made a million pancakes in one and tomatoe soup
food,not_removed,ahh gawd how do you not just stand and stare at that in all its gloryapart from having other shit to do
food,not_removed,its a pizza dough thin in a pan add cup of garlic butterl cup parmesan cheese cups shredded mozzarella sprinkle cup of diced raw bacon drizzle remaining garlic butter and let sit for min turn oven up to and bake for about minutes take out and add cup more finely grated parmesan and a little oregano retain excess oil in the pan for a pasta garnish cut into small sizes it is very rich enjoy
food,not_removed,okay
food,not_removed,have you tried mozzarellonester
food,not_removed,i thought shoestring fries were the real skinny ones that cheesesteak looks absolutely amazing the fries are lookin a little weak
food,not_removed,get your fokkin tentacle out of my face
food,not_removed,fries look a little bland but damn do i ever love a good cheesesteak
food,not_removed,when she says she a virgin
food,not_removed,i spy all the meats from the costco charcuterie pack that is a great buy and our go to hiking snack
food,not_removed,what is the split knifefork thing
food,not_removed,you know whats always missing from these reddit style charcuterie boards sardines and smoked fish various pates good bread not fucking crackers theyre always the i have an entry level knowledge of food charcuterie boards like a bunch of rednecks who went off to college want to try and show off their knowledge of food but fail miserably in some way
food,not_removed,wines

food,not_removed,at a time i get packs of something from costco to snack on
food,not_removed,high end you say
food,not_removed,yeah i would mix almonds cheese and grape or strawberry olive and grape
food,not_removed,i always see utensils and think what the heel
food,not_removed,aw shit well i gotta leave it now
food,not_removed,need recipe pls
food,not_removed,yeah tyvm
food,not_removed,i used golden yukon potatoes but you could also use baby yukons and not cut them in half this is also a variation of rachel rays pepin potatoes but the recipe she lists is slightly incomplete no heat levels and i used different ingredients tools used deep skillet with lid tongs wooden spoon sturdy knife ingredients enough potatoes to fill the bottom of your skillet golden yukons split in half evenly or whole fingerlings make sure they are roughly the same size table spoons of salted butter unsalted chicken broth or stock about cups salt and pepper minced garlic fresh basil or other herb chopped place potatoes in skillet season with salt and pepper however much you like fill skillet with enough stock to cover the potatoes halfway turn on medium high heat and put lid on skillet bring to a rolling boil for minutes or until potatoes are tender the fork should be able to pierce through the potatoes easily once tender press down lightly on potatoes until they are slightly cracked add garlic and if you find it necessary more saltpepper leave lid off and cook for another minutes until the liquid has evaporated cook for five more minutes flipping halfway through the potato should be nicely browned on each side you might need to turn heat down to prevent burning use your best judgement once you are satisfied add your fresh herb and enjoy good luck
food,not_removed,i think maybe more basil in the sauce would make it look more traditional as a pesto here is one i made a few weeks ago when basil was fresh in the garden httpimgurcomgalleryxtuea
food,not_removed,vegetables are not the enemy
food,not_removed,apply cold water on the burned area
food,not_removed,you should really wipe the plate before taking the photo
food,not_removed,i forgot
food,not_removed,that plate is so dirty kanye west is trying to fuck it
food,not_removed,mirrors on the ceiling cold turkey on white
food,not_removed,id change thousand island to southwest ranch edit and jalapenos
food,not_removed,the veggies look so crunchy and fresh the turkey smoked diced cucumbers i would devour that where did you get it
food,not_removed,how can any mouth fit such a monstrosity
food,not_removed,the title says i just have one question how
food,not_removed,i hope subway can make this cuz im lazy and now hungry
food,not_removed,why do they call it a hotel california sandwich
food,not_removed,just too much stuff there there comes a point where there are too many flavours combined into one and it tastes like nowt
food,not_removed,eeyore checking in
food,not_removed,my thoughts exactly less is more
food,not_removed,this one was pretty simple but very satisfying i really like using freshly grated wholemilk mozzarella and tonight i tried a nice picante salami sliced about inch instead of a typical american factory pepperoni it turned out a lot better i gotta say i put some bits of fresh mozzarella and grated reggianoparmigiano on top is it bad to say that my tomato sauce is from a jar rather than making my own the marzano stuff is really bright and tasty
food,not_removed,oh my god its its just beautiful
food,not_removed,thats looking very delicious
food,not_removed,looks great but the correct translation is salame piccante which for an italian sounds much better then pepperoni means pepper in italian d
food,not_removed,thanks it was
food,not_removed,ah thanks its always nice to learn from somebody who knows im mixing in my spanish and american influenced spellings oops ive been searching for a better meat for my pepperoni pizza since the standard pepperoni i get at the grocery just doesnt have a truly awesome texture and taste i picked this salame piccante up and we all agreed that it was much better though more expensive and takes more effort to peel and slice shrug are you italian do you have a suggestion for a pizza topping combo to try that i may not have been exposed to in american pizza culture
food,not_removed,i love topping with black olives pancetta and little pieces of sausage the problem is that bacon and your sausage are not the same as we use so im not really sure of the final result give it a try though p edit yes im italian
food,not_removed,pancetta is pretty commonly available where i live and the grocers here typically have both spicy and mild italian sausage i have no idea if that compares at all to the sausage you would have access to in the same way that american bologna is really a very sad attempt at mortadella
food,not_removed,our sausage is something lilke this if its available there you definitely have to try it on pizza i suggest to take off the skin make little pieces and spread them out on top
food,not_removed,thanks that looks a bit like the mild italian sausage we have here the way you describe thisyou just take the sausage out of the casing and put it directly on top of the pizza before cooking it you dont cook the sausage bits at all before putting on top of the pizza and baking
food,not_removed,poke bowl spots have been popping up all over new york lately while they are delicious they are so over priced and undersized costs like for a bowl and i probably need like at least to be full i would eat them everyday if they had a better price and bigger portions if only i lived in hawaii
food,not_removed,whoah looking ultra delicious i see corn edamame fish roe salmon tuna sesame seeds and noriim sure im missing some other components care to share
food,not_removed,where from
food,not_removed,right on theres also seaweed poke and sesame dressing mango bits pickled radish ginger green onions and cucumbers
food,not_removed,oh man getting seriously hungry are you from hawaii apologies if i come off as rude just curious
food,not_removed,im not but i found a place that makes the best poke bowl around here
food,not_removed,if you really made them chipotle style youll be leaning over your toilet for the next hours seriously man all kidding aside they look delicious
food,not_removed,homemade carnitas homemade guacamole savory seasoned black beans cilantro lime rice julienned iceberg lettuce cheese blend light sour cream choice of salsahot sauce second time making it turned out way better than last time and last time was pretty good
food,not_removed,thank you i used some light beer cayenne lime pepper and salt for the stock i also put roasted tomatoes green chilies a jalapeño a serrano sweet onion garlic and cilantro in with the meat and slow cooked them all together then i broiled it in the oven with a little bit of adobo seasoning before serving edit i keep forgetting ingredients p
food,not_removed,proud to say no e coli in these burritos haha
food,not_removed,seriously awesome work i love my mexican food whenever i get a chance to make it im all about fresh guacamole and freshly choppedup onions i like your rice but i often cheat and use mexican rice mix but other than that i like making my carnitas over hours in the crockpot what are you use for seasoning in it anything
food,not_removed,my girlfriend would never do that can i live with you
food,not_removed,looking very tasty
food,not_removed,how many dishes did you do for his birthday meal

food,not_removed,thanks d
food,not_removed,how did you make the pasta
food,not_removed,i added about cup of pureed spinach blanched for about to my pasta mixture of large egg at room temperature with cup of all purpose white flour kneaded as required and let it rest for before using really simple to make def give it a try im thinking of using beets next to add a purplereddish colour edit fixed wording
food,not_removed,you put some shit on a bagel good job
food,not_removed,that looks tasty needs bacon though bacon makes everything better
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,ive actually made a bacon and cheddar pizza before in the past as an experiment it wasok haha the bacon wasnt bad but the cheddar taste was very strong
food,not_removed,the mustard seeds look like diseased boils just sayin but rest assured i upvoted
food,not_removed,yeah idk why those were there it didnt add anything to the dish imho
food,not_removed,mmm salivary glands drools
food,not_removed,hey i ate some of that brand of chorizo today its delicious i dont care what is in it
food,not_removed,i dont think i mind knowing what is in food
food,not_removed,those lymph nodes are delicious
food,not_removed,laws like sausages cease to inspire respect in proportion as we know how they are made john godfrey saxe that said i like the specificity there are products labeled chorizo with just regular meat and they dont cook down as far but they also dont contain the gristle and cheery bits that i absolutely love their labeling helps me find them
food,not_removed,i almost bought that brand once read the ingredient list and slowly put the package back in the cooler
food,not_removed,grossmustard
food,not_removed,i see what you did there 👍
food,not_removed,i just finished dinner so im in the same boat
food,not_removed,there are worse parts of a pig to be eaten

food,not_removed,chicken thighs marinated in pineapple juice soy sauce brown sugar ketchup garlic ginger pineapple coated with cinnamon and grilled all cooked on my traeger woodpellet grill
food,not_removed,and you cooked dinner
food,not_removed,i found a high end simac i believe swiss made ice cream machine at goodwill i was going to flip the machine for some cash but i decided to keep it when i discovered how incredible the results are it automatically chills the bowl so there is no ice needed all you do is make a custard and pour the ingredients in the machine it only takes minutes to churn the custard into a delicious batch of ice cream so far i have made mm peach and strawberry the strawberry is so good i gave a batch to my mom for mothers day the only ingredients are strawberries cream egg yolks sugar lemon juice and a pinch of salt no food coloring needed
food,not_removed,im super jealous but its probably for the best that i dont have that since id be eating ice cream everyday if i did
food,not_removed,i have been on a binge for sure steadily gaining some weight this month im not hating it though
food,not_removed,damn that looks phenomenal just got homesick

food,not_removed,man i thought id like peas in time i still hate peas more power to you op
food,not_removed,looks delicious luv steak
food,not_removed,nothing like a bit of smooth mash and gravy
food,not_removed,that mash looks buttery af in a good way
food,not_removed,did have to cover it in plastic and freeze it to get that authentic salisbury steak frozen dinner flavor
food,not_removed,when the meal looks good as fuck but is of a serving and you feel bad asking for seconds
food,not_removed,i guess mushrooms are a regional thing ive never seen someone put mushrooms on a steak or in mashed potatoes in my life around here
food,not_removed,mmmm looks like the simpsons type of dinner
food,not_removed,id like your recipe mine is just a couple of cans of cream of mushroom soup and a couple of cans of french onion soup mix it and pour it over a few pounds of cube steak and cook low for few hours
food,not_removed,thank you i hated them as a child as well but now i love the sweet creamy taste
food,not_removed,hahah thanks dear
food,not_removed,it looks like a serving give or take an ounce and a bunch of potatoes should be reasonably filling
food,not_removed,thats sounds amazing
food,not_removed,i weigh pounds man what are you a twig
food,not_removed,not going to lie i read this as ginger beer at first i was a little disappointed when i got the the cups of flank steak

food,not_removed,sure thing
food,not_removed,mmmh they seem sooo delicious
food,not_removed,wheres the chocolate chips
food,not_removed,theyre inside i think they were too puffy so they covered them up
food,not_removed,so in prep i salt and pepper the shoulder then light coating of american mustard to keep the rub stuck tho olive oil works too there is no mustard taste once its cooked the rub i used was sweet rub o mine a great store bought rub spend a little more for a good one from the us im in australia coat heavily i wrapped and left in the fridge over night smoked on a weber smokey mountain for hours at between i like to blaze it the first hour or two to set the bark nice and black like this then adjust the oxygen intake until it drops to and continue at this point id begin using a light mop of apple juice apple cider vinegar and seasoning to it every hour or so for moisture but not too much to damage the coating at the hour id blast it again to or use the oven until the internal temp hits when the tough bits finally break down nicely and then i let rest covered in foil for mins finally when i pull it i might add a touch more of the apple juice mix but this didnt need it as it was so juicy its very hard to over cook shoulder its a great beginner cut for smoking it pulled apart with two forks easily and tasted amazing my fourth or fifth attempt and paying attention to internal temp really made the extra little difference i also use charcoal and not briquettes and i used an apple flavoured wood for the first couple hours of the cook good luck
food,not_removed,what part of the pork is that on the animal ive been bbqing professionally for years and never have seen anything like it i usually cook pork chops in the slow cooker
food,not_removed,ewwww

food,not_removed,it looks like shit
food,not_removed,recipe time first off i should mention that i do not bake with eggs boyfriend doesnt eat them while im fairly certain this recipe would work just as well using them i cant guarantee they would be exactly the same stick cup butter i use european style butter cup creamy peanut butter ive used crunchy too and it was yummy i use peanut butter co brand cups white sugar teaspoons vanilla extract veganeggs which is an egg substitute i buy for my bf regular eggs should work fine teaspoon baking soda pinch of salt peanut butter can be pretty salty depending on brand use your own judgement here cup unsweetened cocoa powder get the good shit i use valrhona cups all purpose flour cups reeses pieces candies cup dark chocolate chunks preheat oven to blend butter and peanut butter together cream butter mixture with sugar mix in vanilla add eggs one at a time and blend until well incorporated blend in salt and baking soda then add the cocoa powder and mix until dark and smooth add in flour one cup at a time fold in the candy pieces and chocolate chunks using a medium sized cookie scoop or heaping tablespoon spoon out dough onto a parchment lined sheet they dont spread too much while baking but give them maybe inches of breathing room i like to slightly dampen my hands and gently pat down any rough edges then very slightly flatten each dough ball its not necessary but i think the cookies look a little nicer out of the oven when i do this pop in the oven and bake for about minutes i baked one batch at and they were very soft and gooey not raw but incredibly soft and fudgey i did another at and the edges came out crispier and one cool the cookie had more chew was perfect to me but the perfect cookie is different for everyone so use your own judgement enjoy
food,not_removed,im in bed right now but ill write it up for you tomorrow
food,not_removed,omg real devilled kidneys in blood pudding
food,not_removed,where can i get these
food,not_removed,thank you the sun does most of the work having good lighting is everything
food,not_removed,same here
food,not_removed,i guess you would say its a very very very strong distaste for eggs haha he says he can taste eggs in many recipes especially things like brownies that call for so many he is generally grossed out by them i guess hehe
food,not_removed,awesome im so glad you like them as much as i do really pleased to hear results on how the recipe worked with eggs too thanks for the comment
food,not_removed,im sure hell love em glad to hear they turned out well d
food,not_removed,thank you
food,not_removed,looks great to me
food,not_removed,i use a really good quality cocoa powder that is quite dark
food,not_removed,haha nothing beats the classics
food,not_removed,these arent dark chocolate
food,not_removed,yeah but i can almost guarantee ops recipe tastes better
food,not_removed,they contain peanut products however they do not contain cocoa or chocolate
food,not_removed,that doesnt mean there isnt peanut butter in the cookies
food,not_removed,there is peanut butter in the dough as well
food,not_removed,you say that like its a bad thing
food,not_removed,get thee to a gastroenterologist
food,not_removed,those look dank have you never had chocolate cookies
food,not_removed,fuckin saved watch me eat it all before my wife gets home
food,not_removed,i think you forgot to mention how much sugar to use in your recipe
food,not_removed,by european style butter do you mean salted butter or butter as we call it
food,not_removed,literally just made my dayi love rfood but a lot of times i cant make the recipes due to my egg allergythese look delicious and im definitely going to try them thanks so much op
food,not_removed,i dont have experience with cupmeasuring its a murican thing right as awesome as it is how much butter would equal one cup its pretty hard to squeeze it in
food,not_removed,why vegan eggs with cow butter
food,not_removed,this wouldnt even make it to the oven
food,not_removed,thanks perfect halloween theme cookie
food,not_removed,yum thank you so much for sharing
food,not_removed,these are absolutely amazing thank you for sharing using real eggs made it very cakey but still delicious
food,not_removed,how much sugar is added
food,not_removed,me too
food,not_removed,remindme hours delicious cookies
food,not_removed,unfortunately i can only sell locally under texas cottage food law i dont have a food managers license or commercial kitchen to be able to ship them to people but even if i did i find the shipping costs to be way too high for something like cookies a painful lesson i learn each year at christmas when i want to mail cookies to friends and family 😭
food,not_removed,probably but god damn i love the otis spunkmeyer cookies
food,not_removed,less than ‰ peanut i round down like tacs
food,not_removed,they arent peanut butter cookies was my point
food,not_removed,whoops added it in there
food,not_removed,plenty of sugar in the candy peanut butter and dark chocolate chunks id say
food,not_removed,i would assume plugra or something similar it has a higher percentage of fat and less moisture
food,not_removed,i use either veganegg or energ egg replacer in all of my baking energ is what i use for of my cookie recipes but these are a bit more brownielike and veganegg offers more structure everyone is shocked when i tell them my cookies are free of eggs its definitely doable d
food,not_removed,egg allergy huh til
food,not_removed,i learnt this when baking for vegans in a lot of baking eggs can be subbed with ripe bananas ive made some killer brownies this way but havent tried it in cookies yet
food,not_removed,two sticks edit just realized that was how op measured it in the first place
food,not_removed,do you do metric measures how does that work like do you weigh every ingredient this is why canadians use american measures for cooking
food,not_removed,hes not vegan just doesnt eat eggs i do make vegan versions of my cookies but reeces pieces have dairy so my vegan version for these uses justins dark chocolate peanut butter cups or crunchy peanut butter
food,not_removed,remindme hours get the sugar measurement for those cookies
food,not_removed,oops its cups
food,not_removed,dang 😢 is there a recipe anywhere that we could know of
food,not_removed,true enough they also dont have that crisscross pattern sometimes associated with peanut butter cookies
food,not_removed,sugar doesnt just add sweetness its also an important structural component to baked goods
food,not_removed,believe it or not its actually one of the more common food allergies haha makes baking a bit hard sometimes
food,not_removed,yeah it just depends on the dishwith baked stuff like brownies ive heard of people using applesauce or cornstarch i think sometimes for other types of stuff like pancakes i think those kinds of substitutions dont work too well ive never heard of bananas though ill definitely try that thanks
food,not_removed,sticks are also an american only thing most other places just have bricks wrapped in a kind of wrapper and you measure it by weighing on a scale
food,not_removed,yeah thats pretty much how it is done here at least in germany cant speak for other europeans obviously its just the way we learn it and how recipes are written a friend of mine whos dad is us american explained the cup measuring to me like or years ago never heard of that before it truly simplifies things its just super uncommon here edit we dont use metric measures only btw measures like a teaspoon or a tablespoon or pinch are common in addition to it
food,not_removed,vegan recipe please
food,not_removed,its posted above in the comments
food,not_removed,thats enough internet for one day
food,not_removed,this is incredibly creepy but also surprisingly random
food,not_removed,i see is it possible to get good cookies with just the sugar in the ingredients i mentioned i would love to have tasty nice texture cookies without a ton of added sugar in them
food,not_removed,that sucks eggs are a beautiful food do you use banana as a substitute in baked goods thats what i do sometimes
food,not_removed,i could imagine lol so what exactly in the egg causes the reaction are you allergic to chicken as well or live chickens im really not being facetious im actually quite curious
food,not_removed,zucchini in brownies and chocolate cake is amazing substitute for eggs as well
food,not_removed,thats kinda my problem here im okay with cups but for something like butter im lost
food,not_removed,ah thanks i didnt realize
food,not_removed,sweeet thank you
food,not_removed,there are substitution tables for various alternative sweeteners note ive never used them but as said above sugar isnt simply a sweetener its a huge part of the science of baked goods acting as both a liquid and a solid as it cooks and causing all sorts of texture and structure that will be altered with substitutions so no or at least maybe partially but with varying results ultimately its a treat so treat it as such and reduce intake on the postbaked side of things rather than trying to fix the recipe to be healthier its sugar eggs peanuts and flour essentially so its not going to be good for anything other than your soul no matter how you cut it
food,not_removed,you must make sacrifices in order to eat cookies you dont want to eat a lot of sugar either dont eat them or have one
food,not_removed,not really the sugar doesnt really leave those specific parts of the cookie that structure comes from sugar being distributed through the dough you could try using sweeteners or something to replace the sugar however im not so sure about how thatd work
food,not_removed,its fine haha i get asked that kind of stuff all the time its a protein compound in the egg im only allergic to eggs themselves meaning the whites and the yolk theoretically i can eat eggshells though idk why i ever would some people are only allergic to the whites and some only to the yolks im not an allergist so i dont know exactly how it works but i can tell you i eat lots of chicken and have never had any reaction its also only when ingestedsome people with peanut allergies can have reactions in response to touching them or even being in the same room as peanuts but with egg its only when ingested for memost people fun fact according to my allergist theres a chance microwaving eggs in advance could breakweaken the culprit protein and make me able to eat itthat doesnt seem to make sense to me from a chemistry standpoint but apparently it works for some people with fruit allergens im a math major though so im terrible at chemistry lol
food,not_removed,i knew the oil of peanuts can cause the out break wasnt sure if contact could cause it with eggs guess its all based on severity thanks for the info
food,not_removed,thank you sir so your sticks are actually the same size as ours ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
food,not_removed,any pix of the tandoor
food,not_removed,looks good to me

food,not_removed,sure im on mobile right now never figured out how to use it using it ill post it when im at my desktop
food,not_removed,hey thanks it was honestly the best chicken ive eaten in terms of texture and juiciness the masala wasnt too bad either but ive madeeaten better

food,not_removed,i would definitely be interested in checking that out might just have to be my next project

food,not_removed,paellapansrus ripped off op
food,not_removed,nice
food,not_removed,so cheesy
food,not_removed,left to right burnt ends flat iron steak brisket pork back ribs
food,not_removed,dont even need a fork just stick your face into it like a rottweiler eating a birthday cake
food,not_removed,bruh
food,not_removed,looks dank
food,not_removed,throw a filet in there and youve fit exactly what im making tomorrow night except im doing mushrooms instead of cauliflower
food,not_removed,looks delicious
food,not_removed,looks good the italian food snob in me cant stand the alfredo though
food,not_removed,oooooh fancy looks yummy
food,not_removed,i would love this recipe looks delicious
food,not_removed,im gonna need that recipe very colorful good job
food,not_removed,original recipe is from hellofresh i used it for a while to add to my stash of dishes to make pretty decent stuff from them the link is the recipe card
food,not_removed,thanks for posting the recipe
food,not_removed,sorry for the poor quality picture
food,not_removed,what did you have to drink mountain dew or crab juice
food,not_removed,thats either shawarma or kebab then gyro is a greek thing they might be identical but cultural linguistics is important americans would get butthurt if some international bodies forced everyone to call people who went to space cosmonauts just to make the term uniform same thing here
food,not_removed,those are soo good good amount of food for the money every time i go into the city i make it an effort to buy at least one
food,not_removed,how much was it
food,not_removed,you should come visit greece then d the original gyro flavor with huge portion for
food,not_removed,why do you have a spoonfork in the gyro
food,not_removed,fuck i wanna be inside that
food,not_removed,for halal im loyal to halal guys their hot sauce is fire
food,not_removed,arent gyros usually made with pork at least the ones ive eaten in greece were because that is quite haram
food,not_removed,ugh love love love that take i ate food truck gyros i was in the bathroom for hours will still be eating it come oct
food,not_removed,you can get the most amazing shits from food carts in nyc and yet a decent restaurant around here seems to be worth half their salt its just not fair man
food,not_removed,i wonder if any halal carts have vegetarian options maybe like a mushroom shawarma
food,not_removed,oh wow ill have to try the combo i usually just get chicken over rice or a gyro with white hot sauce nyc really does run on halal carts though i love it
food,not_removed,the halal carts in nyc typically call them gyro i dont understand it either but op is correct
food,not_removed,its just how theyre marketed here every cart in nyc calls it that definitely didnt mean to offend anyone my apologies if i have
food,not_removed,its sort of a hybrid greek turkish and levantine cuisines have kind of been smooshed together in the us under the umbrella of mediterranean cuisine featuring pseudogyros pseudoshawarma falafel fake greek salad consisting mostly of lettuce and halfhearted attempts at hummus and moussaka i dont think this does any of the individual cuisines much justice but thats what people here expect and pay for
food,not_removed,paid for this one
food,not_removed,are there normally french fries on gyros in greece i may need to move to greece
food,not_removed,gyros in athens are amazing
food,not_removed,damn that looks amazing
food,not_removed,and bonus that its not halal
food,not_removed,it can be made with pretty much any meat
food,not_removed,seriously it really isnt fair i feel like cart food is usually a better bet than restaurant food half the time tbh
food,not_removed,easy to understand gryo came to the us first so americans would be more accustomed to gyro no need to introduce a new term to confuse customers theyre essentially the same anyway meat from a vertical skewer be it called gyro or doner placed in pita bread
food,not_removed,gyros is usually pork at least in greece so it makes no sense at all to call them halal
food,not_removed,and a drink eh i know you are down by water st
food,not_removed,one can also do a thanksgiving dinner with swan instead of a turkey doesnt change the fact that it would be unusual the typical meat for gyros is pork
food,not_removed,well some sort of bread shawarma doesnt use pita generally tacos al pastor fall into this general family as well
food,not_removed,they are not essentially the same i realize most americans dont know the difference because for some reason food stands use the terms interchangeably but when you eat them in their homes countries they are very very different starting from the spices on the meat to the sauces and the usual condiments and most importantly the bread the basic idea meat from a spit is the same the rest very much not
food,not_removed,no necessarily there are chicken and lamb gyros too
food,not_removed,the basic idea thats what essentially means the very essence the base
food,not_removed,chicken has grown in popularity in the past few years lamb is traditional but more expensive the fact remains that pork gyro is what you will see most often in greece
food,not_removed,yeah sure lets just get rid of all those confusing names pizza taco torta sandwich hamburger its all stuff on bread and who can remember all those names anyway right
food,not_removed,actually the ones i saw most often were chicken lamb and beef
food,not_removed,except they all have a common nucleus userfdomgotsaga isnt wrong pizza is actually a good example do i have to call a pizza with corn potato eel and mayonnaise ピザ piza because thats a japanese pizza nope still a pizza to me because they have a common core their basic idea is the same much like gyro schwarma and döner
food,not_removed,this is what the butthurt about language changes i previously mentioned looks like im not the one calling for changing food names go blame the food carters or the culturally ignorant people
food,not_removed,might be a regional thing but i definitely saw mostly pork gyros in greece as well that was a few years ago though
food,not_removed,i dont think i have ever seen a beef gyros and i spend several months each year in greece pork is without a doubt the most common type by far
food,not_removed,butthurt about language changes where exactly do you see that i couldnt care less if you call a döner a schawarma what i find bizarre is how people talk endlessly especially here on rfood about the minutiae of the styles of bbq but cannot even be bothered to recognize the differences of some iconic dishes of foreign cuisines
food,not_removed,please be civil
food,not_removed,i am
food,not_removed,saying someone is being an idiot is definitely not civil
food,not_removed,i asked you about your issues with my statement about gyros in its native land you gave an answer that gave me the impression that you are not exactly the sharpest knife in the drawer nothing uncivil about it just an observation
food,not_removed,uh im not the person you were having the argument with still our first rule is be nice to each other
food,not_removed,ah right sorry about that but my point stands even though it applies to him not you
food,not_removed,here we go again
food,not_removed,i know everyone is going to freak out that its not a traditional cheesesteak but it still looks good
food,not_removed,green peppers
food,not_removed,he never said it was philly style and it looks freaking good
food,not_removed,didnt this just happen like two hours ago
food,not_removed,im in the dc area theres a steak and cheese sandwich which is not a cheesesteak plain and simple same thing about having to explain the differences all the time preedit look it up im not going down the rabbit hole
food,not_removed,i dont know you tell me
food,not_removed,things in life are certain death taxes and people on rfood arguing about what counts as a philly cheesesteak
food,not_removed,those look interesting
food,not_removed,maybe theyre just stating what they want to eat

food,not_removed,most appealing food ive seen posted in quite a while whatd you use for sauce
food,not_removed,recipe plzzzz
food,not_removed,that looks insanely amazing
food,not_removed,you have been invited to rseattle
food,not_removed,that looks absolutely delicious sadly im too lazy to cook a meal and instead resort to arbys
food,not_removed,chicken teriyaki boy
food,not_removed,dat glaze tho
food,not_removed,good job looks great and the glaze on point
food,not_removed,serious question why is it chicken teriyaki and not teriyaki chicken
food,not_removed,instantly hungry i should never click food posts at work
food,not_removed,uuummm i think the nice thing to do is share with your redit buddiesdamn now im starving thanks op ill be over soon dm me your address
food,not_removed,this looks great good job
food,not_removed,nicely done bet it tasted heavenly thanks for sharing
food,not_removed,this would be a nice recipe for rtiki too
food,not_removed,pfffft i make that every day in subway
food,not_removed,can you please tell us all how to make this wonderfully looking declicious chicken teriyaki i wont promise it looking and tasting as good but its always worth a try
food,not_removed,my kids love when i make wings this way
food,not_removed,udankgadenk
food,not_removed,that presentation do you always prepare like that
food,not_removed,beautiful mind sharing your recipe and prep technique
food,not_removed,hnnnggg fuck this sub i cant afford all this food great work btw
food,not_removed,soy sauce on the rice and cheese melted on the broccolio my god
food,not_removed,just soy sauce brown sugar sesame oil and some ginger garlic
food,not_removed,the ratio depends on how sweet or salty you like your teriyaki but heres the recipe teriyaki sauce sou sauce brown sugar sesame oil sesame seeds ginger garlic orange juice optional you also need some skinless boneless chicken thighs skin burns too easily in the broiler how to make this figure out a sauce mix you like heat it in a sauce pan pan fry the chicken thighs use high temp oil fry it until both side are some what golden let the sauce simmer and let the chicken sit in the sauce for min make sure everything is covered take them out when the chicken is covered with sauce meanwhile turn in broiler cook the sauce down as much as possible low heat depends on how much sugar you put it it will thicken like syrup brush the chicken with a layer of sauce put it high in broiler for take it out brush another layer and put it back for another min thats just the process it really depends on personal tastes
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,i fucking love arbys
food,not_removed,brown sugar and sesame oil man
food,not_removed,hmm if youve got a kitchen you can probably afford this at least as a treat rice is about the cheapest thing in existence broccoli isnt too bad either chicken thigh is probably ne of the cheapest cuts there is where i am the soy sugar and oil will be the most expensive but theyll keep forever and youll get a ton of meals out of it so the per meal cost is still really low for final exams i made pounds of teriyaki chicken and ate it for about meals total cost was and i overpaid for the soy shouldve been about
food,not_removed,and some ketchup on the chicken the chicken needs ketchup and why dont we add some nice pepperoni to the rice to spice it up a bit top it off with a deep fried pickle and now we have a beautiful pile of fucking garbage
food,not_removed,that sounds good but i downvoted you because everyone else did and i am very susceptible to peer pressure
food,not_removed,apparently people dont like cheese on broccoli or maybe soy sauce on rice i think its the cheese because it doesnt fit in with the teriyaki
food,not_removed,so teriyaki like the title says
food,not_removed,in what ratios is that chicken thighs youve got there is this pan seared i need details man
food,not_removed,so just to be clear here the chicken is first pan seared with no sauce or flour or anything then the sauce is simmered while the chicken sits in the sauce then you remove the chicken from the sauce and leave it on the side while the sauce continues to cook down then you brush the chicken with the sauce and throw it in the broiler to finish
food,not_removed,haha though i am not from seattle i lived there for about years
food,not_removed,not from seattle but lived there for about years great deduction
food,not_removed,really im from portland and all ive ever known is chicken teriyaki that looks like that ive been thinking about opening a drivethrough chicken teriyaki chain for a while now your comment might have just given me some extra motivation knowing theres not as much competition as i maybe thought
food,not_removed,im from the midwest and always called it chicken teriyaki ive never been to the pacific northwest whats the difference
food,not_removed,does chicken alfredo also seem incomplete or chicken cacciatore or chicken casserole
food,not_removed,yeah these are pretty cheap
food,not_removed,i thought it was ribs °•°
food,not_removed,what are you doing next friday want to go to universal studios with me
food,not_removed,nope no mirin
food,not_removed,traditional teriyaki uses mirin and often some sake and does not have sesame oil but its wonderful to be creative and be inspired by tradition
food,not_removed,oh boy do i but unfortunately its over miles away and i just went last year maybe next time
food,not_removed,caught me mirin that teriyaki sauce
food,not_removed,mirin is key to getting the nice glaze
food,not_removed,its the cornstarch actually that helps everything stick by thickening the sugar itself is what glazes
food,not_removed,some people like to reduce the teriyaki and allow the sugars to thicken you can usually know if someone uses this method because the sauce is much saltier and sweeter more intense
food,not_removed,no traditional teriyaki contains no cornstarch
food,not_removed,yea thats another method my main point is mirin has nothing to do with getting a glaze
food,not_removed,point taken ill also add that its just a matter of preference sometimes i find dishes that use reduced teriyaki to be overly sweet and salty because the cook applies it too generously
food,not_removed,yea and later that night i end up having weird ass dreams and gastrointestinal issues
food,not_removed,that looks so damn good i think i gained a pound just thinking about it
food,not_removed,holy mother of cheese did you have any mac in there
food,not_removed,you know i never knew people baked mac and cheese till i got out of my parents house we never baked it just out of the pan best thing ever with ketchup i though other people were weird shows i was the weird one
food,not_removed,i miss the old government cheese from the the only thing that comes close to that is the premium american cheese from the deli
food,not_removed,boars head is the best in my opinion white american
food,not_removed,i like tilamook cheddar can be found at most american supermarkets other suggestions in this thread are good also
food,not_removed,i have worked in restaurants for years some things need american cheese people are so pretentious and say it is not real cheese i argue yeah you could say that but tell me you dont like a chili mac and cheese with it or a burger with it i work with ingredients that if i fucked up would cost more than i make in a day sometimes a week sometimes even a months worth with truffles and caviar and i feel most chefscooks will agree it has its place and most i have met love it i honestly would rather eat a grilled cheese with american cheese cooked with butter on a cast iron served alongside with campbells tomato soup with whole milk or kraft macaroni mixed with canned chili and sambel olek or any hotsauce than have the dollar a plate meals i make times out of wash it down with a ipa and a chaser of rye and i am happy but if you want to listen to these snobs and go with the cheeses they recommend people in the uk call our cheddars even the vermont and wisconsin ones blasphemy because the milk is pasteurized hell ask italians what they think about the cheese they export to the us where they have to pasteurize it most agree cheese is ruined in the us unless you get the very small time farm unpasteurized stuff which is hard to find the techniques used in those small farms havent been used for of years so most europeans will still not like it american cheese is good dont be ashamed
food,not_removed,land o lakes hands down
food,not_removed,i love bar s its the best yellow american cheese out there for things like burgers grilled cheese bologna sandwichesetc strangely enough my local grocery stocks it in the meat department not in the cheese aisle with the other packaged american cheese slices or in the deli cheese section maybe because most of what bar s makes are processed meats it comes sliced but it does not come individually wrapped like lots of your american cheese slices do
food,not_removed,muenster or smoked jack cheeses are the best
food,not_removed,im a bigger fan of comté
food,not_removed,dont buy anything with american on the label go to the deli and get double gloucester instead
food,not_removed,get a more flavorful cheese like pepper jack or swiss and forgo that plastic yogurt substance
food,not_removed,that crap isnt even really cheese its cheese product look at the label get some real cheese in a block or from the deli muenster swiss cheddar pepper jack
food,not_removed,had some best i ever had
food,not_removed,i work with ingredients that if i fucked up would cost more than i make in a day sometimes a week sometimes even a months worth with truffles and caviar sounds like snobs are paying your bills also just because someone likes one product over another doesnt mean they are a snob im not saying people eating caviar and truffles are snobs im saying you seem to be pissed off at people you see as snobs and this is your outlet maybe they are a struggling lowermiddle class couple who just saved up for their anniversary or honeymoon classic pissed off chef taking their shit out on their peers dude you didnt even make a suggestion for op years of experience wasted when you likely are in the upper of wisdom in this sub also i see no signs of op showing shame you are just projecting your own experience with shamenegativitywork problems onto op and ranting about yourself sure some people shared their opinion of distaste for cheese product but i agree that a classic grilled cheese is great with the cheese product actually more like person and they got downvoted to zero for their negativity not trying to argue with you or whatever just saying that your negativity is same shit different smell as someone being an opinionated snob if someone is gonna say to melt year old truffleflakedgoldencrusted brie collected from the stool of henry viii himself on a burger well let them just shine on without bringing yourself near their level

food,not_removed,i admire your input it makes sense the reason i left the comment was because people in said forum were leaving comments in the idea of using a real cheese which i find to be a ever growing problem people seem to dismiss individuals who like american cheese and i see that as wrong i do think my label of snobs was a little aggressive however i do not care for people who i deem the whole food crowd who mock those that use said products they name as bad fake and terrible i see your point and i probably should have not been so forward and thank you for pointing this out but i argue those whole foods crowds especially when working in the food industry can be very annoying and i feel snob is sometimes appropriate i mean when someone asks for a gluten free version of a already gluten free menu item asks for well done on a plate that is ruined in well done hell i had a request that pissed me off for weeks it was our sword fish ceviche in a wrap without lime juice i had to turn on a burner to cook the fish in a wrap which we dont have so i had to throw some corn inch tortillas in a pot of boiling water to combine them flatten them out on a skillet with a smaller skillet to shape and cook them to be honest man it gets old very fast however i understand what you are saying and i agree my previous comment was harsh
food,not_removed,hey i admire your ability to take criticism so well and actually write back to me in such a heartful way which made me realize your original comment was from the heart despite being kinda negative it was real talk i can honestly say i dont do as well with criticism nor am i so respectful of my own opinions and feelings to truly express them like you did yeah i can feel the sentiment of when people order a dish overdone also you went ahead and made the ceviche without lime juice thats going waaaay above and beyond really shines a light on another part of your personality that i believe is what defines you of the time versus the of the time we are all negative or maybe admittedly more it has hard to balance a dedication to the culinary arts as well as a dedication to customer servicemaking people happy when what makes people happy kinda takes a huge dump on the culinary arts added also my pointing out that op was not being ashamed etc was kinda a misinterpretation of who you were speaking to i realize now also you were not simply speaking to op but to anyone participating inthe entire internet that could be reading this and not participating i believe for every comment and post there are a dozen phantom readerslurkers who never upvote nor post im sure if someone googles a similar question to ops the google results will show reddit resultsmaybe even this thread near the top
food,not_removed,i admire your response thanks for the input edit dont fuck with american cheese haha shit is so comforting in so many dishes we all love it in the food business if you dont i will help you with some recipes
food,not_removed,im thinking that due to ops username hes just pissed about possibly getting meat juices on his inch veggie and snapple combo
food,not_removed,classaction lawsuit for what nothing has actually happened if a standard practice in a popular restaurant was harmful the effects would have been heavily documented by now
food,not_removed,i dont think you understand crosscontamination everything on subways line is ready to eat as long as gloves are worn and hands are washed its ok for the varying ingredients to be in contact with each other if its an allergy issue there are other measures that would be taken to accomodate the customer
food,not_removed,you literally watch them make it in front of you if you choose to eat there even after seeing it all happen then youve no real reason to complain
food,not_removed,the meat is already cooked i dont see the issue here
food,not_removed,i love how th op thinks this is a subway only type problem go look at a prep area of any chain restaurant just ignorance on the ops part
food,not_removed,vegan logic
food,not_removed,posts like this are exactly the reason we meateaters laugh at vegans this is hilarious
food,not_removed,the words you have chosen here i bet no one has or will ever again say this combination of them for all eternity
food,not_removed,that and im pissed at the fact that my partner and i had nothing but subway yesterday and have spent all day today vomiting
food,not_removed,hes vegan there isnt a valid argument in the first place
food,not_removed,nice username dax is my shit hes a cool guy in real life mellow as can be
food,not_removed,i eat taco del mar all the time they dont do this
food,not_removed,that italian family at the next table sure is quiet
food,not_removed,all bullshit aside youre much more likely to have microbial food borne illnesses caused by poorly washed and handled vegetables with some fun stuff like e coli coming atcha food service workers tend to pay much more attention to meats than vegetables when it comes to proper safety so you should probably blame your lettuce
food,not_removed,i know your feels i have had food poisoning from subway as well it doesnt taste nearly as good coming back up
food,not_removed,jadzia dax is best dax
food,not_removed,what exactly do you eat at taco del mar all the time
food,not_removed,blasphemy haha
food,not_removed,mondo burrito with black and pinto beans lettuce pico de gallo guacamole and salsa
food,not_removed,a mondo burrito with black and pinto beans rice lettuce pico de gallo guacamole and salsa sometimes ill do the same ingredients inside a couple tacos
food,not_removed,bad idea scrolling through new posts while in bed 😫 looks marvelous
food,not_removed,thats a beautiful pie
food,not_removed,that pizza looks like dogshit why is it green
food,not_removed,pesto would be my nonexpert opinion
food,not_removed,when life gives you green pizza you dont ask why you just eat it
food,not_removed,as mentioned before no
food,not_removed,no mayonnaise has egg in it which will go bad the vinegar smell is from bacteria feeding off of the mayo
food,not_removed,when cooked egg goes sour it smells like vinegar just dont do it
food,not_removed,nope
food,not_removed,if its been refrigerated upompadourius its fine source someone who actually eats expired mayo and miracle whip all the time
food,not_removed,not only is it safe but me a real actual doctor in real life who works in hospitals and does doctoring in extange for money recommends that you eat it the first thing i learnted when i was being educated at doctor school where you learn how to be a doctor was the healing properties of expired mayonnaise the bacteria that feeds on rotting eggs are called micoflompopers and their strong sulphur smell is good for curing sinus infections and when consumed will purge your stomach of all and any harmful contents
food,not_removed,the vinegar smell could also be from the vinegar
food,not_removed,i guess i assumed he was implying it as having a strong vinegar smell or acidic smell either way mayo isnt that expensive why risk it buy some more
food,not_removed,are you planning on bathing in it
food,not_removed,people like saying salsah
food,not_removed,any roasted veggie pics or of the finished product

food,not_removed,why not just say rabbit tacos and with wine
food,not_removed,quewas
food,not_removed,yes folks hes having rabbit tacos let me just say that this is not mexican i am mexican and this is weird its as authentic as taco bells waffle taco
food,not_removed,you dont eat rabbits or just not in a taco
food,not_removed,looks crunchy
food,not_removed,fuck i want some
food,not_removed,were you able to eat all of that
food,not_removed,not all but a good amount i was tasting my menu i just opened a new burger place and i was sampling the menu
food,not_removed,does it taste like your username feels
food,not_removed,mercury levels okay
food,not_removed,looks terrific where
food,not_removed,have to sayif i got to eat that twice a week id be feeling like a baller nice
food,not_removed,are you a sea lion
food,not_removed,what does eel taste like
food,not_removed,i love all of those save for the squid ive had it more than a few times but i just dont like the texture
food,not_removed,yum
food,not_removed,good for you dude
food,not_removed,nothing wrong with that
food,not_removed,i would love that
food,not_removed,nngh
food,not_removed,i find your name somewhat disturbing
food,not_removed,hamachi is the best but it isnt common at all in uk fishmongers
food,not_removed,i ate it me either last week in reastaurantit was delicious
food,not_removed,the salmon is my favorite
food,not_removed,do you have worms
food,not_removed,people worried about this i eat so much fish a week salmon is so good for you and delicious raw or cooked
food,not_removed,looks delicious
food,not_removed,get in my belly
food,not_removed,you must be rich thats like tax per plate
food,not_removed,chelation therapy is in your future
food,not_removed,arent you hungry you should eat more and at least times a day not times a week
food,not_removed,you can make lobster sashimi with an autoclave it would fit in well with the plate
food,not_removed,i eat this twice a week meaning that you just go out to treat yourself to this twice a week or perhaps its a date ritual chef friend invites you etc
food,not_removed,wait you eat the same thing at a restaurant more than once is that a thing people do
food,not_removed,looks expensive and slimy each to their own enjoy
food,not_removed,must be nice to be wealthy
food,not_removed,the exact same things twice a week with so many amazing things to try at a sushi bar i find this odd
food,not_removed,man i would be choking out that chef that squid doesnt look fresh enough
food,not_removed,did you know fish is full of mercury and cholesterol
food,not_removed,i sure hope so
food,not_removed,ah mercury sweetest of the transition metals
food,not_removed,the epa only advises against eating certain fish to pregnant and nursing women and to children at the same time they advise eating oz of fish a week to those same groups for the health benefits if hes a healthy man and hes not nursing or pregnant he should be just fine eating that amount of fish twice a week
food,not_removed,thats what im saying seems like a bit much in the fish department for one week
food,not_removed,those will lower soon right right
food,not_removed,eel is the bees knees the cats pajamas its my absolute favorite like op said mild flavor but that sauce is so good like he said buttery and rich and deep and sweet id eat dirt of it had enough eel sauce
food,not_removed,its a sweetish meat with a texture sorta like chicken but more tender no fishy taste at all i have a couple when i go out for sushi for dessert salmon is my jam though
food,not_removed,my friend calls it the steak of the sea probably not so correct but it is delicious af
food,not_removed,eel is what i would call starter sushi its cooked and has a sweet sauce basted on top the taste is very agreeable for most people provided theyre adventurous enough to eat fish in general theres nothing really weird about the flavor or texture it tastes like grilled fish basically
food,not_removed,despite that other guys unflattering fish stick description eel is quite good and its worth giving it a shot
food,not_removed,honestly to me tastes like chicken cooked eel of course raw eel tastes less great
food,not_removed,unagi is heavenly
food,not_removed,watch out for bones though not sure why but everywhere i eat eel i end up finding bones
food,not_removed,i love good squid that said i eat a lot of sushi i live in ny and have had it in la holy crap good ive had terrible squid that i have to chew forever and squid that melts in the mouth when you have to chew through it or it has terrible texture its a shame i sat down at the bar of a local sushi place where i grew up and ordered a bunch of oddball stuff squid included when the waitress was surprised i ordered squid i knew i was in trouble was shame the generic fish was great but the squid was like jerky tldr non standard sushi can bite you in the ass if they dont move a lot of it
food,not_removed,dont beat it till you try it
food,not_removed,meh the albacore is the only concern and what it that like a week thats pretty safe skipjack or bonito would be a better option id avoid the salmon tbh its farmed tastes great though especially salmon belly wild salmon sushi is rarely an option unfortunately
food,not_removed,yep i alternate between two things at my deli a cold cut and a roast beef never venture those two things are perfect every time
food,not_removed,did you know that oxygen is highly dangerous to your health
food,not_removed,looks amazing i had the same in yokohama
food,not_removed,you think youre funny but youre not
food,not_removed,did you know that the average fish today contains more mercury than a rectal thermometer would you eat a rectal thermometer
food,not_removed,salmon would be the only fish there with higher mercury levels and twice a week would be fine i eat cod or tilapia almost every other day
food,not_removed,just drink some liquid gold it will absorb all the mercury
food,not_removed,eel is amazing i always get some eel when eating sushi
food,not_removed,im going to try eel
food,not_removed,eel is the bees knees the cats pajamas but does it taste like the dogs bollocks
food,not_removed,equal parts light soy dark soy mirin sugarbring to simmer for bang eel sauce
food,not_removed,when people use delish i want to punch them in the face
food,not_removed,is it chewy eels look like they would be chewy
food,not_removed,i dont understand why eating fish is adventurous people confuse me they have no hesitation eating something from a package that has so many chemicals or hard to pronounce lab created ingredients but freak out over eating something normal like fish or eel or even freak out over eating bugs like so many nations around the world do
food,not_removed,how do you even taste karate
food,not_removed,thanks for the heads up haha
food,not_removed,no there are no bones in eel sushi its cooked and completely boneless its cut perfectly of course why else would you buy sushi
food,not_removed,i have never once found a bone in eel when eating it like this are you getting your eel from super sketchy places maybe its not actually eel youre getting
food,not_removed,i live in the bay area so great sushi is fairly easy to come by years later still dont like squid or octopus
food,not_removed,i had awful chewy squid when i was young so i ended up hating it for years one day i had good squid havent hated it since
food,not_removed,never order uni or ikura unless there is an actual sushi bar and they say its great today always ask your server that said those are my two favorite things
food,not_removed,ive had it mediterranean style as well i just cant get down with the texture as you probably can imagine i dont like octopus either
food,not_removed,you forgot copious ammounts of garlic most grilled squid i had in italy and croatia was usually filled with some delicious garlic based stuffing
food,not_removed,we mankind is fishing the oceans clean of life i do not contribute to this ecocide you go ahead though
food,not_removed,i pay all my own bills have a mile daily commute and am not what id consider well off and i could easily afford a week on eating sushi twice a week seriously there are plenty of things people spend that amount of money on weekly that arent necessary for survival as far as im concerned a week on food is pretty much the bottom of the scale unless youre a making absolutely everything from scratch with cheap ingredients or b you dont eat very much
food,not_removed,op could be well off or he could totally not be and just prioritizes his expenses differently than you or others lets say each of those meals is so a week i know plenty of people that dont make much money but spend as much or more than that on equally unnecessary expenses such as cigarettes alcohol weed cable tv gaming netflix etc people spend their money differently and someone making per year could easily afford this depending on what they choose to spend their money on
food,not_removed,yeah im insanely jealous of you wow that all looks amazing what part of the world are you in
food,not_removed,salmon and squid is amongst the lowest containing mercury seafood lowest none of the items you showed have the slight amount of mercury in them if they did id have to reconsider what i believed to be reality
food,not_removed,id avoid the salmon tbh its farmed youre not going to offer any more than that its just farmed like most food
food,not_removed,nice i wish i could afford that edit but i will be able to soon enough
food,not_removed,someone who eats sushi for fish and not the sauces why arent there more of you out there
food,not_removed,sassy
food,not_removed,yeah
food,not_removed,source needed
food,not_removed,not if it hadnt been used yet i mean whats even the point then
food,not_removed,i drown salmon in olive oil
food,not_removed,looks like im gonna have to up my fish game thanks for enlightening me thats wicked cool about your grandma definitely something to the diet of the mediterranean people
food,not_removed,tell that to jeremy piven
food,not_removed,the japanese dont eat sushi as often as you might imagine its a treat usually consumed once or twice a month this quora response is on par with other things ive read httpswwwquoracomhowoftendopeopleinjapaneatsushi
food,not_removed,yellowtail is the highest there even pregnant women can eat servings of salmon a week and be fine its pretty low same with squid and eel
food,not_removed,what species is tilapia
food,not_removed,drinks velveeta shells and cheese ninja edit rearrange words
food,not_removed,you drink piss for breakfast
food,not_removed,it tastes like those fish sticks you had as a kid but without the breading crisped on the edges and drizzled with likehoneysoybutter sauce
food,not_removed,delish on your way over to my house to punch my face can you pick up a quart of milk i am all out and i dont feel like going out
food,not_removed,nope quite tender and nice
food,not_removed,you eat your bugs im gonna microwave a burrito
food,not_removed,did you know that fish contains chemicals its true everything contains chemicals including you
food,not_removed,that has not been my experience
food,not_removed,i once had to go to the emergency room after eating some eel sushi because an eel bone got lodged in my throat so no i would say that is not always the case
food,not_removed,fairly up scale
food,not_removed,there are so many ways to cook both slow cooked with lots of flavor works great too they soften up they must either be eaten close to raw or slow cooked or they are rubbery
food,not_removed,dont mind if i do
food,not_removed,nevermind mathed wrong
food,not_removed,many many ocean predators contain mercury
food,not_removed,objectively you even have a slight bit of mercury in you
food,not_removed,sorry lots of antibiotics living in over crowed conditions fed crap food dyed pink to look healthy google that shit
food,not_removed,overfarmed i imagine
food,not_removed,skip to
food,not_removed,shh bby only need a little
food,not_removed,theres more fish in japanese cuisine than just sushi most of the japanese food i have is just grilled fish
food,not_removed,oh wow i had no clue about yellowtail
food,not_removed,its tilapia thats the name of the fish
food,not_removed,fish sticks are disgusting i dont think eel tastes anything like them
food,not_removed,yes obviously but im not talking about all chemicals ever im talking about the shit used to make food last through the end of the world ingredients that cant be found in nature and were made in a lab or shit thats been so modified for preservationconsistency it doesnt even taste like its supposed to like orange juice the flavors are all removed when they remove oxygen so they can make it shelf stable and added back in essentially a perfume pack or something like beef jerky which is typically naturally preserved by dehydration or smoking but in stores it comes loaded with preservatives
food,not_removed,and none of them i find palatable
food,not_removed,thats the spirit remember to keep a journal of all the fish and how they taste so you can tell your grandchildren how it was
food,not_removed,and why do you eat this times a week by choice or by profession or benefits from work
food,not_removed,downvoted for uncomfortable truth
food,not_removed,why are antibiotics a problem
food,not_removed,i literally drown live salmon in olive oil its how i get my kicks
food,not_removed,its a hard thing to compare too eel but the mild fishyness of fish sticks combined with the soft texture is the closest thing i can think of
food,not_removed,you know those preservatives are usually naturally occurring antioxidants that have been purified
food,not_removed,like mercury
food,not_removed,or rich
food,not_removed,its indicative of their living conditions and the general ethos of the producer if my food needs drugs just to survive until the slaughter im pretty sure its not the best thing to be consuming especially raw
food,not_removed,cute but killing a living creature for a pair of shoes seems pretty ruthless
food,not_removed,this would cost where i live which is typically how much i spend on dinner regularly im a school teacher shrug
food,not_removed,oh i see thanks for the clarification so the antibiotics themselves arent the issue
food,not_removed,i usually need a prescription for antibiotics
food,not_removed,not a waste to live well enjoy it
food,not_removed,okay but thats not telling me anything you need a prescription for a lot of things
food,not_removed,do you typically get those from your diet
food,not_removed,im going to start using that as a sun tan lotion
food,not_removed,that looks amazing ever thought of putting the butter between the meat and the skin
food,not_removed,can we get the full recipetechnique looks delicious
food,not_removed,while the chicken must have been delicious i would not at all be surprised if the potatoes stole the show very few things i like more than roasted potatoes with meat drippings
food,not_removed,recipe is from tyler florences book stirring the pot for hours every minutes i was taking out the bird and basting with reserved parsley butter sticks of butter all in by the end cavity was stuffed with lemon bay leaf thyme rosemary and a whole head of garlic the drippings made an incredible gravy for the potatoes and finished chicken
food,not_removed,damn very well done i will have to wait for fall on this one cookin that thing in my small apartment right now would broil me with the summer we have had
food,not_removed,that skin tho crispier than the first fallen leaf of autumn
food,not_removed,amazing job
food,not_removed,what about the inside how do you get it tasty
food,not_removed,you done good op
food,not_removed,its so beautiful
food,not_removed,daaaaannnngggg
food,not_removed,that came out well
food,not_removed,looks wonderful how did it taste
food,not_removed,how hot and long did you have to cook it
food,not_removed,linkrecipe
food,not_removed,you cook it with vegetables on the bottom
food,not_removed,why do you have to tie its feet so it wont run away during the baking but its already dead
food,not_removed,does coating the skin like that really make much of a difference seems like brining or injecting is more impactful
food,not_removed,it worked for kramer
food,not_removed,i do that to my turkey every year i put butter and fresh minced garlic under the skin delicious
food,not_removed,came here for delicious buttery chicken fatty roast taters have an upvote
food,not_removed,absolutely perfect potatoes
food,not_removed,baste with melted butter
food,not_removed,i usually put some of the herb butter under the skin as well get the meat nice and flavorful
food,not_removed,fingerling potatoes and mushrooms
food,not_removed,stick a fork in me jerry
food,not_removed,butter was room temp
food,not_removed,im done
food,not_removed,the burger looks alright those fries are just depressing though hope theyre free with the burger
food,not_removed,man the burger looks great id be pretty unhappy though if i ordered cheese fries and thats how much cheese they had
food,not_removed,burger meister meister burger
food,not_removed,i miss bread
food,not_removed,loved that place i stumbled upon it randomly while walking around you got it on a good day though i had a huge line
food,not_removed,damnthis was my favorite place i ate when i visited berlin
food,not_removed,i went here we called it toilet burger as it used to be a public toilet id kill for one of those right now
food,not_removed,oh look an ordinary hamburger maybe this will make the front page because this sub is garbage
food,not_removed,cheese fries
food,not_removed,im pretty unhappy any time i get fries that thick with no skin the thinness is integral to the crunchiness
food,not_removed,id be unhappy if i ordered cheese fries and got cheese fries instead
food,not_removed,i went at their opening hour which is luckily i was the first one there
food,not_removed,lol
food,not_removed,should be fine the fridge and freezer should be working independently of one another when in doubt sniff that shit
food,not_removed,as long as the fridge door was closed everything in there should be fine
food,not_removed,maybe the fridge will go back in time and stop the freezer from being left open if it gets reversed everything should be fine
food,not_removed,a repairman once explained to me that the refrigerator is kept cold by the air in the freezer which is circulated through the fridge with fans the only thing being kept cold by the coils is then the freezer
food,not_removed,well then youre probably gonna die if you eat that
food,not_removed,that looks delicious whats the story on the fork
food,not_removed,is that a canvas or a linen napkin linens going to fold nicer
food,not_removed,clearly not mac n cheese those are shells and cheese must be the offbrand
food,not_removed,that fork has seen some shit
food,not_removed,that looks appetizing whats the chronicle of the bowl
food,not_removed,that looks exquisite whats the history behind the towel
food,not_removed,yknow i never really stopped to wonder how the hell we got that fork probably from an antique store or something
food,not_removed,correction organic shells and white cheddar macaroni and cheese from a box p
food,not_removed,that looks succulent whats the tale of the table
food,not_removed,annies
food,not_removed,that looks moist whats the deal with the doughnut holes
food,not_removed,trader joes
food,not_removed,theyre meatballs
food,not_removed,high falutenwhat did those run like mac n cheese snob
food,not_removed,i count myself among those who have developed a most sophisticated palate my good sir
food,not_removed,lack just a bit of cooking but seriously looks amazing how much did you pay for that the roquette on top makes it even better how was it
food,not_removed,yeah it could have been cooked slightly longer i think due to new staff using a proper pizza oven it was around cad
food,not_removed,not expensive and looked quite good d wish i had a good pizza place like that where i live i ended up doing them myself now cause i m always disapointed by the ones i order
food,not_removed,do you live in na or uk im guessing uk because you called arugula roquette i moved to na and found there to be an abundance of good pizza as long as you avoid the chains thin crust is probably my favourite but theres nothing wrong with a deep dish nothing wrong with homemade either but a pizza oven makes a hell of a difference
food,not_removed,i live in new caledonia google image it get jealous p i think i prefer thin crust in the end it taste better when its too big you end up eating bread with pizza topping its not bad but not what i m looking for honestly concerning the oven i really dont have any problem i bought quite a nice bosch oven and it burns really hot so my pizza is cooked in like to minutes check my submitted post i posted one with roquette on it tell me if you like it
food,not_removed,looks beautiful super jealous id give all the pizza in the world to live there
food,not_removed,ahahah you have a deal send me all the pizza first btw
food,not_removed,i prefer spapeggy with meatballs
food,not_removed,but is it your moms
food,not_removed,spaghet
food,not_removed,thats really tasty looking spaghetti op
food,not_removed,i have to kill it with cheese this has far from enough on it
food,not_removed,im in
food,not_removed,wow amazing how did you do that
food,not_removed,recipe
food,not_removed,i just want to put my hands in it
food,not_removed,i might literally die if i dont get some spaghetti right now
food,not_removed,good and simple recipe thank you for sharing
food,not_removed,i really like the huge lumps of diced tomatoes this legit looks like something youd find in a comfort food restaurant yum whats the recipe for the sauce
food,not_removed,i was hoping someone would post this strange gif of a woman scraping her feet and the next is spaghettis being drizzled with cheese or this dancerchicken in a can thing as consolation
food,not_removed,home made sauce
food,not_removed,totally relevant bisgetti looks great man
food,not_removed,next time finish your pasta in the sauce cook the pasta to al dente drain reserving a little bit of pasta water and then finish the pasta by simmering it in the sauce in a pan on the stove splash a little of the reserved pasta water if youd like to get the sauce to adhere to the pasta this is a good time to add your parmesan as well it also acts as a binder for the sauce and noodles when sauce is just placed atop noodles it slides off and you end up eating plain noodles with bites of sauce instead of a married spaghetti which is no fun
food,not_removed,i had pasta for supperreally delicious
food,not_removed,yes and for dessert apple brown betty
food,not_removed,ick no no no meat ragu
food,not_removed,the wifes
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,thanks it was quite tasty
food,not_removed,haha yeah more was added as it was eaten
food,not_removed,this is my recipe but its fairly standard chop carrots celery stalks if there are any leaves chop them up and add them towards the end and onion and saute in lardons minced pancetta or minced bacon fat with butter once about cooked through add finely minced cloves of garlic a lot of people suggest skipping the garlic but i love garlic so i sneak in a little anyway after the garlic has cooked add mixed ground porkbeef or porkveal and brown the meat deglaze the pan with cup dry white wine add a small can of tomato paste maybe and mix it thoroughly do not use fresh or canned tomatoes this is not a tomato sauce it is primarily a meat sauce season with a little salt and pepper be careful with the salt as your pasta will add some and the stock as well if you use any you can throw in a bay leaf too if you feel like it add a cup or so of chicken stock and let the sauce cook you can also use water instead or even a little more wine to avoid excessive saltiness you will need to do this every so often as the liquid reduces dont add too much at once scrape down the sides of the pot when you add additional liquid theres usually a little concentrated sauce stuck to the side and this can add a lot of flavor cook as long as possible at least hour minimum when content with your sauce in a separate pot boil water add salt generously and add of your chosen pasta cooking al dente according to instructions and taste when the pasta is finished drain it except for a little reserve water and add the pasta to the sauce on the stove with the tiny bit of saved pasta water mix for seconds and remove from heat your pasta is finished serve with grated parmesan or your chosen similar cheese
food,not_removed,my recipe which undoubtedly tastes similar if not even better goes as follows sautéed onions and garlic add ground beef add tomato puré add minced tomatoes canned if you cant be arsed to make your own mushrooms if you like chopped fresh chili herbes de provence pepper lots imo beef bullion dices in one deciliter boiling water red wine grams of dark chocolate or more secret ingredient half a teaspoon of ground cinnamon it is the easiest thing to cook and takes about minutes and will only taste better the longer you let it cook i put the ingredients in more or less in the order as i wrote
food,not_removed,unfortunately my wife didnt really follow a recipe it was whole wheat pasta kirkland brand sauce added to sautéed ground beef onions and garlic she added some chicken bullion to the sauce which made it extra savory but also more salty so she had to be careful with traditional seasoning topped with parmesean
food,not_removed,he used a jarred sauce i believe
food,not_removed,it was actually kirkland organic sauce but added sautéed ground beef garlic and onions
food,not_removed,are your knees weak though
food,not_removed,yall use that fancy new cheese grater for the parmesan
food,not_removed,next time try it with pecorino
food,not_removed,only the fanciest
food,not_removed,sauce recipe cup soy sauce cup honey cup molasses tbsp sriracha tsp ground ginger cloves garlic minced
food,not_removed,eh awfully sweet it would seem but they do look pretty edit for my taste that is i am not a big sweet and savory person most people are i am not like most people
food,not_removed,polished gloss that deep dark stain
food,not_removed,totally forgot to add the photo during the first attempt to post lol my bad 🤗

food,not_removed,white or italian maybe serve it up with mayo extra cheese the more the better and peppered up steak
food,not_removed,theres nothing philly about a philly cheesesteak on a ciabatta
food,not_removed,cheesesteak sandwich is redundant
food,not_removed,that looks amazing mouth watering
food,not_removed,what kind of bread do you need i am in the uk

food,not_removed,and the meat sweats
food,not_removed,this brings me back i used to work at a place that made fudge like that
food,not_removed,very cool video the company itself is pretty neat as well they have a lot of interesting videos up on youtube and they sometimes stream from httpwwwloftypursuitscom just piqued my interest thought you guys would appreciate
food,not_removed,can we just take a moment to appreciate his narration skill hes handling hot sugar for goodness sake﻿
food,not_removed,i love when they stretch it﻿
food,not_removed,nice following a recipe or one of your own ive always wanted to preserve things may i ask how long these will keep for
food,not_removed,would you mind sharing your recipe
food,not_removed,how long will the last on the shelf also ill bring the chips
food,not_removed,if that is your salsa backup how big is your entire larder
food,not_removed,did you use the banana peppers in the salsa if so how did you like them in it i have a fuck ton of banana peppers and tomatoes about to be able to pick already pickled some but didnt think about putting them into my salsas
food,not_removed,is that corn
food,not_removed,does anyone have an idea on how to preserve the green color of cilantro in canned salsa i tried canning salsa verde and the cilantro turned an unappealing brown blanching the cilantro first didnt help alternately anyone tried the cilantro paste that comes in tubes
food,not_removed,you better sissy that salsa
food,not_removed,op you got a recipe to share ive yet to found a salsa i like but those look yummy
food,not_removed,damn its so tasty but it always looks like someone else ate it before thats why i never keep it in glass bottles in sight
food,not_removed,hi sorrywhatd you say your address is😜
food,not_removed,jars too clear
food,not_removed,that was fast you went from posting the raw ingredients to the final product in hour
food,not_removed,you should check out rcanning to me this recipe is likely dangerous since it wasnt explicitly stated to be a pressure canned recipe i can see corn and corn needs to be pressure canned to be safe from botulism water bath canning low acid foods or foods without sufficient acid is dangerous i would highly recommend not taking old family canning recipes and assuming they are safe people can things with no care about safe canning practices rcanning has links to usda approved recipes ive seen people on youtube suggesting water bath canning butter and meat
food,not_removed,cant share a family secret sorry
food,not_removed,as long as the recipe follows the correct acidity and the jars are properly processed boiled or pressure cooker they can last a year or more
food,not_removed,thats why i used the majority of my roma tomatoes and banana peppers are producing a lot edit i think im getting downvotes because i didnt really answer the question i do enjoy banana peppers in my salsa and will be pickling some by themselves tonight
food,not_removed,id way rather see the contents of my salsa jar than pour it out of some opaque mystery jar
food,not_removed,thanks mate there is nothing better than finding a niche thread that suits you well
food,not_removed,thats a load of crap
food,not_removed,my wifes uncle had a secret potato salad the recipe died with him its really sad recipes should be shared as part of culture and heritage a secret family recipe should only be a secret if it is a business and you dont want others to sell your same product for less i doubt your secret recipe is that big of a deal btw you may have left too much air in some of those jars eat those ones first they may not keep as long
food,not_removed,what
food,not_removed,dang it nevertheless enjoy your salsa
food,not_removed,my exs mom would can every summer salsa tomato sauce chicken peaches pickles and we would eat it throughout the winter and spring she would throw anything away when the next summer rolled around
food,not_removed,a couple what weeks or months
food,not_removed,like any family recipe its not really listed in anything measurable pretty much just fresh veggies from my previous post vinegar and a little bit of sugar to taste i cant really say this many tomatoes and this many peppers and this many cups of this because i simply dont know
food,not_removed,canned chicken you say
food,not_removed,years
food,not_removed,what plenty of family recipes have exact measurements even if you dont have measurements you still could have given a full list of ingredients i just find it rather pretentious to say that its a family secret when its likely nothing special
food,not_removed,yes they would raise chickens in the spring and then kill them they would freeze some of them others they would can i dont eat meat so i couldnt tell you how they tasted but she canned them with spices and such
food,not_removed,well say what you want but i cant give you exact measurements there is no original recipe on paper nor will there ever be in my opinion i learned to make it the same way my dad did in the garden picking and in the kitchen cooking its changed generation to generation and we do sell it and make money so sorry but all you can have are the pics regardless of how many downvotes i get ill have more jars of salsa than internet points so im ok with it
food,not_removed,so sort of like canned tuna but with chicken instead i would try that
food,not_removed,cant get meat without killing
food,not_removed,i didnt ask for the recipe or exact measurements or even ask for the recipe so why are you telling me i cant have them i simply said that if you didnt have exact measurements then you could provide a simple list of ingredients it wouldnt have to be the original recipe just a list of what you used this time its not that i even want the recipe doesnt look spicy enough for me but the way youve acted when asked is just arrogant recipes are meant to be shared ill have more jars of salsa than internet points so im ok with it i realize im just being pedantic now but i highly doubt that at this moment you have total reddit points ill bet that you dont have more than jars of salsa
food,not_removed,this is the homemade version of chicken in a can no not processed chicken meat in a small can chicken in a can it exists it is real it is a small chicken cooked in a can
food,not_removed,thats pretty far from the truth actually my family and i hit jars pretty much every summer and if my total points keeps going down it should be manageable i also have already listed the ingredients i used so i hope you have a good time making it this batch was a small test batch with corn and cilantro
food,not_removed,okay i was mistaken about that where do you have them listed none of your other posts contain the words corn or cilantro im not sure why youre telling me to have fun making it i wasnt the one who asked your for the recipe as i said before it doesnt look like my kind of salsa
food,not_removed,oh your right you just said it was a load of crap that i wouldnt share it almost implying you wanted it also if moruga scorpions arent spicyhot enough for you im not sure what else youd want you replied to the comment i said the ingredients so id hope you can find it
food,not_removed,no i did not imply that i also wanted it i just had to comment on how ridiculous you sounded no there is no comment where you list the full ingredients im not sure why youre lying to me
food,not_removed,i said the crush veggies from my previous post vinegar and a bit of sugar you know where my karma is so im sure you can find a submitted post to the same sub reddit
food,not_removed,thats still not a full listing its not completely clear what exactly all of the veggies in your previous post are
food,not_removed,i am thoroughly enjoying op make a a bigger and bigger fool out of himself with every comment if i stop being lazy i might post this to rquityourbullshit
food,not_removed,recipe tiramisu might be the only dessert i like better than creme brulee

food,not_removed,you have a tiger guy
food,not_removed,looks fantastic if he had the ingredients in his videos that would be perfect
food,not_removed,how much of this is fruit
food,not_removed,i think this is just regular salad
food,not_removed,my grandma used to make me fruit salad but i am inclined to believe hers had marshmallow and jello sooo not exactly the same
food,not_removed,that might fill up an african toddler
food,not_removed,well there is a tomato 🍅
food,not_removed,someone should probably think of a name other than cupnuts
food,not_removed,cupcakes you made cupcakes
food,not_removed,if theres not a hole its not donut lol
food,not_removed,nutcups
food,not_removed,then what are filled doughnuts and bars
food,not_removed,that looks sexy as hell
food,not_removed,gotta love some egg benedict
food,not_removed,damn
food,not_removed,this is what dreams are made of
food,not_removed,i i love you
food,not_removed,that looks delicious
food,not_removed,im assuming you braised the short rib what was your preparation for it
food,not_removed,ill replace all of the family photos i have for this one
food,not_removed,the prime rib looks way over cooked
food,not_removed,ive never looked at an eggs benedict and had my mouth watering that looks really delicious
food,not_removed,colorizebot
food,not_removed,thanks ive been working on my holly sauce
food,not_removed,prime rib and it was roasted chilled sliced and seared on a flat top
food,not_removed,hi im colorizebot i was trained to color bw photos not comics or rgb photos please do not abuse me this is my attempt to color your image here you go httpiimgurcomuveqntsjpg this is still a betabot if you called the bot and didnt get a response pm us and help us make it better httpsgithubcomdannyvairedditcrawlerstreemasterredditbotcolorize
food,not_removed,here are the ingredients needed and a link to the recipe large egg yolks cup white sugar cups heavy cream teaspoon kosher salt or teaspoon fine salt teaspoons vanilla extract cup whole milk
food,not_removed,i love how everyone is so bent on critiquing the pasta that no one has noticed the salad in a tupperware container
food,not_removed,gettin lazy and not finishing the pasta in the saucetisk tisk
food,not_removed,i see you put carrots in your pasta sauceyou got skills
food,not_removed,looks good but you forgot the pieces of garlic toast
food,not_removed,just another fsm apparition ramen
food,not_removed,i think this dish is called spaghetti alla mangiacake
food,not_removed,everyone is so fucking nitpicky i think it looks great
food,not_removed,hate seeing the sauce just plopped on top of the dry pasta like that try mixing the sauce with the spaghetti in the pan before serving next time
food,not_removed,i would eat that what do you put in your meatballs
food,not_removed,that looks bomb op
food,not_removed,ive never heard it called red sauce before
food,not_removed,it was the only square dish i had
food,not_removed,i was cooking my meatballs in the sauce for a couple of hours no room for noodles in there too
food,not_removed,putting the pasta in the sauce is not finishing it it is just plating the meal differently
food,not_removed,thanks man apparently no one else in this thread thinks so because they are all complaining about my noodles
food,not_removed,calorie counting and garlic bread didnt fit my daily caloric budget
food,not_removed,til the term mangiacake
food,not_removed,i agree it looks nice like this but if its just for you why
food,not_removed,mix of ground italian sausage and ground beef bread crumbs milk a touch of olive oil garlic salt pepper italian seasoning parmesan parsley and eggs
food,not_removed,what do you call it genuinely curious
food,not_removed,the easiest way is to do individual plates at a time in a saute pan so as your pasta cooks you heat up a saute pan with some of your sauceput the al dente pasta into the pan and let a bit of the starchy water drip in too then toss and plate as usual i dont mean to nit pick your saucemeatballs and plating looks greatbut theres a reason every single good italian restaurant does it this way its better
food,not_removed,they mean finish cooking the pasta in the sauce doing this soaks up some of the sauce into the noodles
food,not_removed,nah it changes your pasta from bland noodles to noodles that taste like this delicious complex pasta sauce i just spent hours making its really much tastier
food,not_removed,wrongly
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,id call a sauce usually by the main ingredient though considering the spanish terms it does have precedent
food,not_removed,i think its just for photo esthetics
food,not_removed,or they could make it into a pie
food,not_removed,thats fair id probably call it tomato sauce personally but i have heard it called red sauce before
food,not_removed,actually in britain you ask for red sauce and you will get a bottle of the red sauce that sits next to the brown sauce in every single cafe so it turns out im full of shit
food,not_removed,you must not be poor enough see whatcha do is add a small amount of water and shake it up until and use it all until the bottle is bone dry voila
food,not_removed,if it works it works i dont mind whole grilling veggies typically if im not gonna eat them whole ill at least sprout an idea for grilled ingredients write the book think of the title later kind of thing
food,not_removed,like including the wheelchair
food,not_removed,the mushrooms didnt cook all the way i would suggest at least halving larger veggies 😄
food,not_removed,looks awesome what did you season with
food,not_removed,agreed same here
food,not_removed,yeah id probably have at least one bite of that
food,not_removed,hey look another pic of a fucking hamburger
food,not_removed,this place they have a menu that allows you to create a burger that you select out of many many toppings heres my combo i made for brunch
food,not_removed,wow youre correct
food,not_removed,yay buffalo
food,not_removed,rbuffalo
food,not_removed,go bills
food,not_removed,doesnt look like biryani looks more like pilau
food,not_removed,keep it frozen for years and pass it on to your children
food,not_removed,i always just defrost it and it is fine
food,not_removed,either way works youll get about the same shelf life at room temp whether it has been frozen or not so if it was already close to going badleave it frozen and just take out what you use if you froze a very fresh loaf and plan to use it all feel free to take it out i dont use much bread so i always keep my loaves in the freezer and just take off what i need frozen bread is easier to spread condiments on and by the time im ready to eat the sandwich the bread is thawed
food,not_removed,i would keep it frozen the only way bread goes bad is if gets wet aka moldy if you thaw it chances are its going to get moist and it can go bad
food,not_removed,forgive my ignorance but what is that noodle pizza looking thing
food,not_removed,thats beautiful and looks tasty
food,not_removed,what is between what looks like shredded nori and wasabi on the condiment plate
food,not_removed,soba noodles the pizzalooking thing is the wicker plate
food,not_removed,those blackberries look devine
food,not_removed,super
food,not_removed,thats a big ol zucchini
food,not_removed,or just all the other veg is really small and in tiny bowls theres really no way to tell the op didnt give us a banana for scale
food,not_removed,ive failed in life
food,not_removed,crushed peanuts over it always make it so damn good
food,not_removed,looks good did you include the dried shrimp and tamarind paste edit a word
food,not_removed,yum
food,not_removed,looks scrumptious
food,not_removed,yep tamarind sauce squeezed by hand
food,not_removed,the plate was a good choice too
food,not_removed,no just no the creative jackson pollack spray sauce is not good a nice drizzle or small ramekin on the side
food,not_removed,been working on my plating skills yall on rfood are a tough crowd lol sorry not really immediately after shot i smothered that baby in an unholy amount of hollandaise sauce my guilt was quickly overpowered by mmm mmm mmm enter food coma
food,not_removed,thanks thats my go to food porn plate
food,not_removed,someone show egoraptor
food,not_removed,they did a good job fitting a square into a circle
food,not_removed,they just wanted to make sure you knew where what they called a burger was by circling it with an onion ring
food,not_removed,historically americans and brits have tended to boil brussel sprouts until soft which does them absolutely no favors and has earned them their bad reputation my grandmother was the only person who ever served me brussel sprouts as a kid and she was a horrible cook they were mushy and bitter and just gross and i instantly understood why they were widely recognized as the worst vegetable around it wasnt until i was in my and living with a vegetarian roommate that i had sprouts prepared correctly ie halved basted with olive oil and rock salt then broiled absolutely delicious
food,not_removed,it may have something to do with that gene that some people carry that makes a certain bitter chemical in sprouts stand out to them they actually have a genetic disposition against the flavor
food,not_removed,i love to burn mine in a skillet with some onions and brown sugar
food,not_removed,brussels sprouts may be one of my favorite veggies so simple i generally roast them with just olive oil salt and pepper until they get nice and caramelized
food,not_removed,celery though thats a tough one to sell
food,not_removed,because people dont know how to cook them
food,not_removed,i think its because parents force children to eat these things which impacts all future encounters
food,not_removed,you werent kidding about a little i only see two chili flakes thats white people spicy right there
food,not_removed,well you know they smell a little farty
food,not_removed,and salt please say salt
food,not_removed,i think the point is you had to add ingredients
food,not_removed,theyre an appetizer on almost every menu in austin tx also that is not an appetizing picture is what they look like prepared with a little crispy fry
food,not_removed,gross nice try mom you eat the brussel sprouts
food,not_removed,whenever people on reddit mention hating brussels sprouts somebody always comments and says have you tried roasting them with a little bit of olive oil and i saw that so often i thought it was like a meme or an inside joke
food,not_removed,brussel sprouts have a bad rep i havent heard they are tasty as hell with salt and olive oil straight from the oven
food,not_removed,wait theres a way to make these little cabbage impersonators more palatable i dont hate them but i can hardly stomach more than at a time
food,not_removed,meh i dont see any crispy brown deliciousness from those sprouts being roasted in a degree oven also even a touch of parmesan cheese compliments the bitterness of this potentially tasty vegetable
food,not_removed,a lot of parents dont know how to cook brussel sprouts or they usually buy the froze kind which taste really nasty
food,not_removed,i love them i feel like a giant eating cabbage
food,not_removed,cook bacon first or simultaneously in a hot oven sautee sliced brussles in pan with shallot or oniongarlic salt pepper and butter let it sizzle for a good bit try to get em brown on both sides if you have the patience its worth it chop almonds walnuts etc and toss em in toward the end minutes till done balsamic vinegar right at the end let it simmer down then pull from heat grated parm on top then crumble on the bacon this is a full meal and its heavenly sometimes i add dried cranberries if im in the mood for some serious sweet along with my savory the dish is actually quite sweet already with the onions and balsamic goddamn its been too long since i made this going to the store tomorrow
food,not_removed,i roast mine with butter salt pepper a little bit of paprika and parmesan cheese so went from meh to make these all of the time
food,not_removed,i love brussels sprouts i have a couple of favourites steam until nearly done prefer them with a little bit of a bite not completely soft then fry them in a little olive oil with chopped hazelnuts and then finish with a bit of freshly squeezed orange juice season to taste this is especially good at christmas steam as before then fry them with a little olive oil and finish with a dash of pomegranate molasses season to taste steam as above then fry with a little smoked baconpancetta and season to taste favourite vegetable
food,not_removed,they healthy and rest doesnt matter
food,not_removed,theyre like tiny little cabbages
food,not_removed,favourite veg so tasty
food,not_removed,the first time i saw them i thought they were baby cabbages this was a couple months ago i am
food,not_removed,they got a bad rep i fuckin love em
food,not_removed,i love mine roasted with a mix of honey and hot sauce so very good
food,not_removed,hell i get a bad rap because i have loved brussel sprouts since i was little everyone thinks im wierd for it
food,not_removed,i hated them as a kid but love them now happy to eat them just steamed but if im feeling decadent then with butter and bacon as i think some people have mentioned what i cant stand though is when people miss the s off the end of brussels theyre named after the city of brussels theres no such thing as brussel my supermarket does this constantly my other pet peeve is when the s is missed off biceps im blocked from posting on the bodybuildingcom fb page because i corrected them once
food,not_removed,wow til its not my fault these taste like shit to me
food,not_removed,cut them in half and saute them with chopped bacon start the bacon first and garlic when they are tender drizzle a little honey on them and cook a little while longer to glaze them so damn good
food,not_removed,the problem with brussel sprouts and any veggie is poor preparation giving a kid a boiled slimy and bitter sprout probably scars them for life and even when i was growing up in the cartoons really said bad stuff about those delicious nuggets of awesome i didnt eat one until i was in my late and have regretted that these werent introduced to me sooner
food,not_removed,cooked mini farts this is what they are to me and why i despise them
food,not_removed,probably because they taste like garbage
food,not_removed,i think method of cooking has something to do with it as well my mom would sautee them in water so basically boiled them to a mushy bitter mess it wasnt until i started working in a restaurant that i had them other ways its hard for people to appreciate the taste of something if you dont know how to prepare it
food,not_removed,they look like budgies heads and taste like sick
food,not_removed,probably because like cabbage they smell like someone farted and taste how i imagine a fart would taste
food,not_removed,i was once told by a chef with enough butter and garlic you can make a dog turd taste good with enough olive oil garlic and chili flakes apparently you can make a brussel sprout taste good
food,not_removed,well for me the reason why i hate them is because when i first tried them i stabbed it with the fork in disgust and then it squirted its juices into my eye so i ate the son of a bitch but even though the sweet revenge tasted so good the brussel sprout still tasted like poo
food,not_removed,thats really not saying much if you put olive oil seasoned salt and italian seasonings on cardboard itd taste good
food,not_removed,ooh ooh i know this one because theyre fucking awful
food,not_removed,because theres a notinsignificant i think around iirc portion of the population that has a mutation of certain taste receptors causing the sprouts to taste somewhat metallic bitter and unappealing im one of them
food,not_removed,the stench of death
food,not_removed,they taste like ass no matter what you put on them
food,not_removed,every single time i have ever tried them they tasted like a mouth full of sea water brussel sprouts are literally the only thing i will not eat to me they are bitter far past black coffee guiness dark chocolate etc
food,not_removed,add a little fresh grated parmesan and thats how we do it
food,not_removed,i think their tasty i dont get it sometimes you get a bitter one but if you sautee them or roast them why their just magnificent
food,not_removed,steam them for about min then put them in a bowl with some olive oil and seasoning steak seasoning and some grated parmesan cheese throw them on the grill on high and char the outside serve with drizzled velveta or with some mac and cheese got my son to eat them because i call them man sprouts versus the just steamed version plus you can steam them outside on the grill and keep the smell down in the house
food,not_removed,i mean they do stink a little but i love brussel sprouts i love to roast them in the oven with sea salt lemon pepper and bacon fat and then fry up some bacon and crumple it over them after they get out of the oven so effing good
food,not_removed,the other week i had fried sprouts with a streak and red wine jus was sensational really complemented the steak
food,not_removed,the old girl wraps them in bacon and bakes them they go pretty good then
food,not_removed,i dont know man some childhood stigmas are hard to break love me some sprouts
food,not_removed,i think its to do with childrens taste buds being different children naturally prefer sweet foods rather than savor and as they grow they develop to enjoy more savory and bitter foods
food,not_removed,slather them in butter and wrap them in tin foil and cook them on a grill until the outside toastscrisps a little its insane
food,not_removed,fry em in beef fat and butter with garlic and shallots
food,not_removed,i was the weird ass kid who liked them of course my mom burned them a bit with some butter and spices still love them
food,not_removed,i dunno i think they are awesome easily in my top five veg along with swede broccoli cabbage and i am undecided not sure actually on cabbage now cabbage water that stuff is the shit
food,not_removed,i like to boil them in beef broth and butter them up in a skillet with garlic
food,not_removed,i dont like them just plain boiled maybe its a bit strange but i do like them raw i learned to not drink some drinks right after eating them raw tho
food,not_removed,i eat brussels sprouts when served because im not complicated when it comes to eating but i cant appreciate those little fuckers no matter how they are prepared just too bitter and too green of a taste
food,not_removed,steel skillet on high heat add a big pat of butter at the last second and then throw them in preferably open side down bacon helps but imho all you need is a good char
food,not_removed,i just sauté them after boiling
food,not_removed,they give me insane gas its literally smells like death
food,not_removed,roasted brussels sprouts with honey and pecorino is pretty good too
food,not_removed,i love them i normally grill them with a little olive oil salt and pepper the char gives them a great taste
food,not_removed,theyre also good shredded raw for slaw
food,not_removed,this them in mustard and bake with a bit of garlic youll wet yourself
food,not_removed,cartoons lied to us
food,not_removed,roasted with bacon and five spice
food,not_removed,its because theyre usually usually boiled instead of just roasted and whatnot boiled brussels sprouts taste fucking awful even salt or hot sauce wont kill that incredible bitterness
food,not_removed,salt pepper olive oil and balsamic vinegar mix place on grill or under broiler over cook them a bit to get a crunchy outside
food,not_removed,no idea love those boil a little and then pan fry with butter and some veggie mix like carrot green peas corn and such
food,not_removed,i tend to not like brussel sprouts because they just dont taste of anything to me its just like eating soft plastic
food,not_removed,cayenne pepper and bacon do the trick
food,not_removed,for me it was because the only way i ever had them as a kid was boiled the first time i roasted a brussel sprout i was in shockit tastes so good or raw as a coleslaw for that matter
food,not_removed,i dont know about in the us but certainly in the uk they used to have a significantly more sulphurous flavour which many people did not enjoy this compounded with having them forced on you at a young age meant that people had very polarised opinions of them it also doesnt help their rep when you are regularly given sprouts that could be drunk through a straw i do remember seeing on one of the where does your food come from television shows on the bbc that over the years that they have selectively bred sweeter less sulphurous tasting sprouts so some of the poor rep may just be a hang up from the past
food,not_removed,bacon butter and brusselsprouts in a panamazing

food,not_removed,i pan fry them in coconut oil my young cousins love them i am too afraid to tell them what they are called
food,not_removed,boiled brussel sprouts are nasty grilled roasted etc are good the hate for tgem like a lot of veggies is from badly cooked food
food,not_removed,everytime i get to eat it i think mh that smells pretty good i might like it this time then the first or sprouts are delicious and savory but after that i just cant stand the taste anymore its pretty weird and always like this i guess the dose makes the poison p

food,not_removed,drizzle of olive oil and a little salt pop them in the oven amazing
food,not_removed,my favorite vegetable just like that
food,not_removed,brussel sprouts are awesome my kids and i love them
food,not_removed,chili flakes garlic and olive oil will literally make anything taste amazing though
food,not_removed,i think these might be my favorite vegetables i usually cook them in olive oil until theyre crispy with sea salt fresh cracked pepper and maybe a little curry powder
food,not_removed,i think youve answered your own question youve basically disguised the flavour with two other strong flavours garlic chilli
food,not_removed,i personally try to avoid them because ive found many sprouts with critters in them shudder
food,not_removed,halved in a skillet with garlic and coconut oil will change your life
food,not_removed,why do food pics always have an oc tag who really cares lol
food,not_removed,they are supposed to be harvested after the first frost that makes them sweeter but often they are harvested too soon so they are bitter people have different tolerance levels for bitter tastes
food,not_removed,because they make you have disgusting and strong smelling farts
food,not_removed,went on a food tour once that had them lightly grilled then sprinkled with parmesan not sure if anything else was added at any point or not but they were great never had a desire to eat them before that
food,not_removed,brussel sprout slaw is where its at finely sliced in a mandalin then mixed with home made coleslaw dressing delicious
food,not_removed,because of the jackass in my office who microwaves them every afternoon and it smells like death
food,not_removed,that is the most disgusting vegetable on earth just cant imagine having that near my mouth ew
food,not_removed,looks delicious how many hours do you boil them for
food,not_removed,ive yet to find a brussel sprouts recipe i like
food,not_removed,try brussel sprouts with bacon bits thank me later
food,not_removed,a little bacon doesnt hurt either
food,not_removed,toss em in some balsamic vinegar and youll wonder where they disappeared p
food,not_removed,might have to do with the fact they need olive oil garlic and chili flakes to taste good yes i like them that way too it just seems like a lot of additions necessary compared to say a parsnip which ill happily just use a few drops of oil on and roast
food,not_removed,i think they were ruined by cartoons for me seems to be brusselsprouts and spinach that were always referred to as the most repulsive meals
food,not_removed,try sriracha vs chili flakes
food,not_removed,cause they smell like farts and attract a million flies every time i cook them albeit they are my favorite
food,not_removed,sliced sauteed with finely chopped shallots and chopped bacon bitsheaven
food,not_removed,still nope
food,not_removed,we use to grow brussel sprouts in our garden every year and my father wouldnt let us harvest them until a certain number of frosts had passed so we always got to eat them right around thanksgiving he always explained to me that it made them less bitter anyone else ever heard of this
food,not_removed,it made me sad when a local pizza place stopped offering brussel sprouts as an ingredient
food,not_removed,fried bacon onions brussels in bacon grease omnomnom
food,not_removed,because they taste like lottle rotten balls of cabbage
food,not_removed,i like brussel sprouts im picky thought i like them only when they are steamed to oblivion same with most veggies they have to be super soft then ya throw on some bacon and butter and garlic powder or pesto
food,not_removed,theyre awful when treated wrong ie in that oldtimey way many people used to treat vegetables decades ago where theyre just boiled until mushy and grey
food,not_removed,all they need is a little mustard and omnomnom
food,not_removed,i think frozen brussel sprouts may at least be part of the reason i had only eaten fresh ones before and often wondered where that reputation came from but i had frozen ones for the first time last week and they were just unsalvageably bitter cooked them in olive oil and garlic but the extreme bitterness overpowered everything normally i even love bitter greens but this was too much for me never had the problem with fresh brussel sprouts so i dont think i am in that genetically effected group unless that gene can just activate itself later in life
food,not_removed,lies you can beat that brussels sprouts in bacon grease with bacon
food,not_removed,i find them delicious especially pan fried to be a little more brown than in the picture savory
food,not_removed,i love them think they are amazing but the wreak havoc on my gut painful gas that feels like a battle where no one survives and smells like the aftermath of that battle after being exposed to the summer sun for a month bleh
food,not_removed,i blame the morons eating them raw particularly the sushi crowd but also those terrible party platters that are always festering with disease i have seen nicer road kill that takes less kitchen hackery to cook up
food,not_removed,my theory is its because most people only make them for thanksgiving when there are multiple other side dishes and a big bird to worry about cooking and in the shuffle the brussel sprouts usually wind up overcooked
food,not_removed,brussel sprouts are amazing
food,not_removed,dipped in sriracha mayo delicious
food,not_removed,pro tip theyre actually called brussels sprouts learned that like months ago been saying it wrong my whole life
food,not_removed,i only recently learned they are brussels sprouts not brussel i am too old to just be finding this out
food,not_removed,most people tend to overcook them which results in an icky taste if you season them decently and cook them a bit shorter they will be fine if not a decent cheese or curry sauce is a life saver
food,not_removed,oh come on almost everything that isnt a sweet gets better with that even a piece of turf would taste betteri mean it wouldnt be good but it would definitely taste better
food,not_removed,traditionally overcooked to waterlogged bland mush thats what people remember similar to lamb which traditionally was actually closer to mutton and cooked to hell resulting in a gross strong tasting meat requiring copious amounts of mint sauce to kill the taste
food,not_removed,chilli flakes you say that sounds great
food,not_removed,with some bacon and mustard didnt eat sprouts before now i like them
food,not_removed,to bring out the sweetness in these cauliflower etc simply roast them at a high heat and get them a bit caramelized toss in evo sp and your chili flakes then roast on foil lined sheet at about for perhaps minutes just keep an eye on them oh um bacon fat instead of evo and then tossed with chopped bacon after is never a bad idea add the chili flakes and a light splash of cider vinegar to those
food,not_removed,the midget of the cabbage world
food,not_removed,my dad boils or steam them and then puts melted butter all over them and its good with the salty huttery taste and bit of sour bitter taste you get from the middle
food,not_removed,fry them in some butter and olive oil turn it down and add a little bit of brown sugar
food,not_removed,brussels
food,not_removed,a largeish pan on medium heat slice two strips of bacon render out a little fat well before the bacon is crispy add in a little bit of olive oil and get that warm add quartered or halved brussel sprouts to the pan season with salt and pepper continue to turn this combination for minutes on medium heat if the pan looks a little dry add some more olive oil back they will be done when they are fork tender the key is a low and slow process to help break down the sprouts
food,not_removed,i always assumed it was because there are two ways to cook brussel sprouts the right way and the wrong way and i think that goes for a lot of vegetables when made correctly theyre delicious but when theyre overcooked sauced spiced etc theyll taste nasty had the same problem with zucchini for a while until a friend made it and it was delicious
food,not_removed,cut them in half season them and pan fry them in olive oil flat side down until the bottoms carmalize you will thank me
food,not_removed,to me they taste like mini cabbages and its awesome
food,not_removed,i smoked some brussel sprouts on the grill last week and they were amazing just a little olive oil salt and pepper took the smoke flavor really well
food,not_removed,roasted brussels with garlic and olive oil now with red pepper flakes are highly prized by all my diners kids and adult alike
food,not_removed,olive oil garlic pine nuts and parmesan cheese for me yum
food,not_removed,a lot of people just boil them whole in which case they arent very tasty but slice them and cook in a pan seasoning delicious
food,not_removed,i wanted to make brussel sprouts for thanksgiving dinner one year my mom said no they looked like turtle heads to her and freaked her out
food,not_removed,i hated them growing up because my mom and grandmother couldnt cook worth a shit apparently now i like them and my kids like them
food,not_removed,hated them my whole life due to an aunt forcing me to eat them as a child fell in love with them a year ago due to my girlfriend roasting them and adding an amazing reduction on top
food,not_removed,garlic and olive oil helps but i cant help thinking of the time i tasted ear wax as a kid they taste like that every time
food,not_removed,drool
food,not_removed,they smell like burning decaying food that was extinguished using animal urine
food,not_removed,they reek of sulphur
food,not_removed,when brussel sprouts are over cooked they release a chemical very similar to sulfur this is why many people say they dont like brussel sprouts
food,not_removed,that looks great have you tried frying up pancetta and adding it to the sprouts
food,not_removed,because brussels is bankrupting europe through the eu
food,not_removed,brussel sprouts are full of evil when you eat them that evil is released in the form of a noxious gas that torments the eater and suffocates the people around the eater if you eat brussel sprouts there is a high chance you will also have no friends or girlfriend and be prone to social bouts of i have to leave now
food,not_removed,they smell awful are bitter and taste of cabbage for starters
food,not_removed,most moms microwaved frozen brussel sprouts which is why a lot of us hated them until we grew up and made them right like in this picture
food,not_removed,they have an unappealing smell and a bitter finish to the palate if however you dress them up with garlic chili butter etc you can largely overcome the smell and taste to make them sort of edible but not my favourite
food,not_removed,they make your house smell like dead farts
food,not_removed,i hated them as a child but now i absolutely love them maybe my gene that ruined the taste has since been thankfully methylated i certainly wont complain
food,not_removed,they are often overcooked which does not help
food,not_removed,who gives them a bad rep add some bacon to brussle sproutsamazing
food,not_removed,omg this is my guilty pleasure
food,not_removed,cut sprouts in half melt butter in pan add garlic brown garlic add sprouts face down cover on low minutes should be nice and browned on one side add one more pad of butter toss in pan salt pepper done not super healthy but super tasty
food,not_removed,because they are poisin
food,not_removed,they dont have one anymore thankfully someone learned if you just cover them in bacon and maple syrup theyre delicious and the profit margin oh god the profit margin
food,not_removed,i think a big problem is that people just dont cook them right my mom used to serve them boiled and theyre fucking horrible that way but sauteed or roasted with a few addins theyre great
food,not_removed,the only brussel sprouts i had that ive ever liked were cooked at a crayfish boil with the corn and carrots all the crayfish seasoning got into the layers of leaves and made them yummy
food,not_removed,brussels sprouts ipecac whats the difference thats what they do to me just the smell gets me gagging
food,not_removed,because it smells like ass
food,not_removed,try cutting them in half so each half has part of the stem add salt and pepper next in a skillet add butter and olive oil or bacon fat and olive oil and heat until very hot add finely chopped garlic and place cut brussels sprouts face down sear until caramelized on the face toss sprouts in pan place lid over skillet remove from heat and let rest minutes serve and enjoy
food,not_removed,boiled brussels with salt and pepper i can have a day
food,not_removed,btw supertaster here and i still love bitter we dont all have the same tastes
food,not_removed,i only ate the frozen ones steamed as a kid but despite the bitterness of the stems i actually enjoyed them for the novelty because it was like eating tiny whole cabbages recently ive learned how awesome they can be when roasted
food,not_removed,i made them for thanksgiving a few years ago cut them in half lay out on a baking sheet brush w oil then cover with greated parmesan and pepper roast at for about minutes sooooo good
food,not_removed,they smell like shit
food,not_removed,love brussel sprouts sometimes i sprinkle hot sauce on them is that weird haha i even eat em along side my tacos
food,not_removed,ya need to stop youre sick
food,not_removed,i think its the smell that gets most people my mom cooked some brussel sprouts like this recently and the whole house smelled like shit for hours
food,not_removed,they go great with a nice steak with chimichuri sauce
food,not_removed,growing up i was made to believe because of cartoons that they were evil as a year old i cant think of a veggie i find more delicious than well sauteed brussels sprouts
food,not_removed,i love brussel sprouts so much i used to despise them until i cookedbaked them myself baking them makes them so freaking delicious
food,not_removed,i love them but they make me toot something fierce
food,not_removed,if it smells bad it cant taste good
food,not_removed,my mother never made them my wife has started recently and i love them
food,not_removed,and some garlic aioli
food,not_removed,because most people cannot spell them correctly
food,not_removed,these look delicious i have a friend who makes them with raw honey broiled until honey is caramelized served with sriracha cream dipping sauce my god its amazing
food,not_removed,they are also really good if you chop up some bacon and throw that in with them smother them with butter then bake them until they start getting crispy on the outside yummy
food,not_removed,because moms often just steam or boil them with hardly any salt making a mushy gross mess sautee them up with some bacon and man oh man
food,not_removed,one of the best parts of going to a buffet sprouts and then head over to the breakfast part and cover them in bacon
food,not_removed,even better with bacon bits
food,not_removed,fry up some bacon add cut up brussel sprouts add salt and pepper cook till golden brown and delicious finish with blue cheese and balsamic vinegar
food,not_removed,bad rep its only been the latest trend at every hipster restaurant ive been to
food,not_removed,add some garlic aioli
food,not_removed,because people often overcook them and people mostly only eat them at christmas dinner with the family when youre not allowed to fart personally i like them theyre like mini cabbages
food,not_removed,usually people boil the crap out of brussels sprouts so its not surprising most dont like them i love them roasted with salt pepper garlic powder paprika and a little dry mustard
food,not_removed,my favorite way is halved mixed with olive oil onions and pine nuts bake at for minutes then broil to finish for minutes for that sweet charring
food,not_removed,we were grilling the other night put brussels sprouts in an aluminum foil bag with some chopped onions olive oil garlic parsley flakes sea salt and a splash of soy sauce and threw them on the hottest part of the grill when they came off they tasted almost nutty mmmmmmm
food,not_removed,i love brussels sprouts they make me feel like im a giant eating full heads of cabbage in one bite i prefer to boil them shortly to soften them put them on skewers and grill them with some garlic pepper lightly seasoning them edit and its brussels sprouts not brussel sprouts
food,not_removed,my number pregnancy craving has been roasted brussels sprouts roasted in the oven with a little olive oil seasoned salt and italian seasonings i could eat it all day every day
food,not_removed,this is the only veggies ill eat cook it in the same frying pain with bacon add saltpepperlittle sugar and its perfect
food,not_removed,i prefer them cooked in water and a little salt with potatoes and schnitzel favourite regular meal of my childhood
food,not_removed,i tried brussel sprouts for the first time in my life a few months ago and was pleasantly surprised to find they were yummy i guess it depends on how theyre grown cooked etc and it definitely makes much more sense now that i know some people are just genetically predisposed to find it super bitter but it was a little puzzling at first why so many people on the internet seem to hate it
food,not_removed,brussels sprouts only have a bad reputation among children
food,not_removed,im going with people have no clue how to cook them cook them right and they are amazing over cook the living shit out of them and they are bitter as hell my ex inlaws used to boil them the entire time they were prepping a steak minutes to get them out salt pepper then minutes searing minutes resting and they were horrible i started making them similar to yours just evoo garlic salt and pepper for a few minutes jsut enough to get a little char fork tender but not falling apart now i cant get enough of them
food,not_removed,brussel sprouts are my faaaaaavorite
food,not_removed,i like them mashed
food,not_removed,totally agree roasted brussel sprouts are awesome
food,not_removed,thats how prepare mine every time i usually do brussel sprouts garlic caramelized onion shallot some sort of pepper serrano jalapeño thai chili etc broccoli and eggs
food,not_removed,put some bacon on a pan cook around for minutes cut some sprouts and toss them with a small amount of olive oil and add salt pepper take bacon out put sprouts on top cook for another minutes
food,not_removed,this has been part of my dinner every day for the past week im just a poor grad student and a bag of sprouts is like
food,not_removed,there is actually a genetic disposition to brussel sprouts tasting bitter to some people i believe its a recessive trait though i dont recall offhand i learned about this in my college anthropology class we were given these little strips of paper and told to push them against our tongue to see if we tasted anything if we didnt taste anything it meant that brussel sprouts taste bitter to youwhile if you could taste something it means they wont taste bitter to you and youll be more inclined to enjoy the veggie i may have that backwards but thats the idea it actually just comes down to genetics
food,not_removed,i freakin love brussel sprouts
food,not_removed,brussells sprouts i love them we saute them in bacon drippings with onions and garlic
food,not_removed,its the aftertaste its too disgusting
food,not_removed,totally agree brussel sprouts are a woefully underrated vegetableside i only discovered them myself in the past year or two they were just never on the menu before that love them though
food,not_removed,brussels sprouts ftfy
food,not_removed,i think it is because of the way they were prepared when we were growing up boiledsteamed whole with maybe some salt disgusting shave or quarter and roast those fuckers
food,not_removed,never had one they smell awful to me when cooking
food,not_removed,average person wont season them properly
food,not_removed,i have never eaten them does it taste like cabbage because it looks like mini cabbage
food,not_removed,my experience with brussels sprouts basically mirrors kitchenapprentices although my mom wasnt a bad cook at all and several other posters as well i suspect the boiled sprouts i had as a kid were so absolutely awful i was shocked the first time i saw them on a restaurant show apparently they taste way better prepared properly but ive never been anywhere i could try them
food,not_removed,those look pretty raw
food,not_removed,try cutting up a red onion and cooking with a strip or two of bacon on top crumble the bacon when done and top with a little balsamic mmmm a
food,not_removed,i fry up some bacon and garlic cloves remove and then cut the sprouts in half and fry them in the bacon fat then put the bacon and garlic back in salt and pepper you wont ever do it any other way again httpimgurcomavomxf
food,not_removed,we clean and cut our brussel sprouts in half then cover a cookie sheet with aluminum foil and spray with olive oil using a misto put brussel sprouts in a bowl with a little more olive oil a pinch of salt and toss then place in boiler till the outside is browned delicious never understood why they were boiled grose
food,not_removed,tiny cabbages rock
food,not_removed,i use a super hot castiron saute very quick its one of my favorite foods
food,not_removed,braise them in duck fat delicious
food,not_removed,brussels sprouts ftfy
food,not_removed,halved sprouts handful or two of diced pancetta or bacon drizzle of olive oil salt pepper combine on sheet pan roast for min at stir once half way
food,not_removed,my favorite is to coat them with olive oil salt garlic smoked paprika and colmans mustard powder grill or roast until crispy yum
food,not_removed,pour some extra balsamic vinegar and honey personal favorite
food,not_removed,the saddest part about them is how now that every restaurant seems to have charred or broiled brussels all my chefs say is how over played they are
food,not_removed,the best is pan fried with bacon and brown sugar
food,not_removed,my two favorite ways to prepare brussels sprouts split them lengthwise and fry them in olive until they get some colour toss them in a dressing made of equal parts honey limejuice and sriracha method two is pretty simple put the brussels sprouts in a put pour in a few cm of water bit of salt cover and steam the sprouts on a mediumhigh heat until they are soft add butter
food,not_removed,theyre pretty tasty sauteed with salt pepper and some italian herb the little leaflets if cooked enough will turn into little crispy flakes
food,not_removed,yea you can beat it fry them son bitches in bacon grease extra points if you fry lardons leave them in the pan toss brussels in lardons grease the stove top finish in the oven mmmmmm
food,not_removed,i love brussel sprouts stoked to see a post dedicated to them
food,not_removed,hmmmm theyve been my favorite veggie as long as i can remember along with asparagus
food,not_removed,as a chef i can honestly say fuck this thread sorry ive worked a little in boston but mostly california and i can say its gotten to the point where people will complain if theyre not o the menu fried brussels dressed in something interesting are as played out as beet salads and creme brulee im sick of having to buy cases and cases at a time when there are so many better vegetables out there no one bothers to try
food,not_removed,roast them with a little olive oil salt and pepper degrees for minutes or so delicious
food,not_removed,my mom pan sears them with a little oil seasoning and pancetta delish
food,not_removed,im normally not crazy about bacon but brussels sprouts with bacon is heaven
food,not_removed,dude a fried shoe can beat brussel sprouts some things are just not meant to be eaten
food,not_removed,olive oil garlic butter lemon zest sp just start to brown but still have a bite to them so delicious
food,not_removed,the frozen veggie era killed vegetables for a lot of people i hated spinach until i tried it fresh for the first time
food,not_removed,roast them till the outer leaves are blackened and crispy toss with a mix of bourbon and maple syrup add bacon as a garnish if someone turns that down they should be shot on sight as they are an alien invader or commie spy
food,not_removed,could be that they taste like shit
food,not_removed,because it tastes like poison to a big number of people
food,not_removed,they taste so bad
food,not_removed,cos they taste of what ass smells like
food,not_removed,shut up mum i am not eating them get off reddit i know what youre doing
food,not_removed,pop some bacon in there and weve got a deal
food,not_removed,i love them with bacon and fried potatoes
food,not_removed,unless bacon is involved you did it wrong
food,not_removed,pan fry in a bit of butter toss in wee bit of garlic salt done
food,not_removed,its more of a projectile food for me
food,not_removed,bad gas
food,not_removed,who wants to eat troll babies
food,not_removed,much like how a lot of people hate broccoli because they feel that their parents force fed it to them i hated vegetables when i was a kid because of the reason above but now as an adult i love them my girlfriend had the opposite effect to this day we are both in out she refuses to eat cauliflowers and brussel sprouts
food,not_removed,besides the bitterness b sprouts are pretty unusual they dont resemble anything else in a typical us grocery and they have unique flavor and texture many people sre inclined to be critical if something they dont unconsciously compare to other things and so first impressions become unfavorable particularly youngsters i absolutely love these sprouts but i wasnt a fan in ny first years even eating them fresh from the family farm in some of the best soil you can find some people dont feel the need or desire to ever form a more developed palate
food,not_removed,because your grandma overcooked them
food,not_removed,they tastesmell like rancid farts on the way in then they ferment and grow until they escape again as a sustained fetid chorus of airburning rancid farts on the way out whats to like even if you could play a tune with your farting arse theres gonna be no audience edit to say if youre brazen enough sprouts can be used to clear a queue at a crowded bar need some balls sprouts and arse to pull that move off though
food,not_removed,cuz ther shit
food,not_removed,thank you for that i have never broiled anything before though do i just set the oven to broil and then toss em in when its ready
food,not_removed,i am belgian and all my childhood i had to eat brussels sprouts that were boiled for minutes then simered with garlic on gentle fire for hour the outcome was an horrible dark green stinky mash but i loved it back then now i steam them for less than minutes and eat them plain no seasoning at all not even salt
food,not_removed,as with all brassica plants broccoli cauliflower brussels sprouts cabbage etc they essentially turn into a chemical weapon when overcooked especially with lots of water around theyre all relatives of the mustard plant the best way to cook them imo is dry high heat sauteing grilling roasting and broiling all do great things for them
food,not_removed,yup this its like cooking broad beans in their skins and serving them with the skins on seriously wrong and gross
food,not_removed,i halve them baste them lightly in balsamic and cracked pepper then bake them in the oven i hate brussels and i hate balsamic but when done like this its the most delicious vegetable ever
food,not_removed,damn thats exactly what i do too absolutely the best
food,not_removed,my parents would buy the bag of frozen brussels and then boil the heck out of those so it would end up being just a pile of mushy leaves i didnt even recognise fresh brussel sprouts the first time i saw them
food,not_removed,but not related to the same thing i have for cilantro love brusselsprouts hate cilantro
food,not_removed,they literally taste like broccoli to me i cant taste any bitterness at all its weird to imagine there are people out there that perceive them differently
food,not_removed,that is really nice to hear ive been made to feel like a child who wont eat his broccoli for disliking them or its like my palate just isnt sophisticated enough to appreciate these horrid bitter devilballs sitting next to my steak and damn near ruining it also they smell fucking horrible and whats worse is that if i dont know brussels sprouts are being cooked i can never immediately identify the odor its just this decaying organic stench of unknown origin
food,not_removed,they taste like old broccoli leaves soaked in battery fluid or rancid medicine to me
food,not_removed,would this explain why i hate arugula
food,not_removed,children are also naturally deterred from bitter foods so its possible people are force feeding to them as children and they never want to eat them again
food,not_removed,oh god thats why i always have hated them they are sooo bitter and have such a weird taste no amount of butter garlic or anything can mask it
food,not_removed,same here heres a bit from a recent study penn state people who possessed variants of the taste receptor gene —including the variant which is present in about of the population—were much more sensitive to bitter flavors in this case they showed an aversion to hoppier beers but has also been linked to distaste for bitter veggies too
food,not_removed,you can cook the bitter taste outi used to hate brussel sproutsthey were bitter and the texture was offi learned how to cook them and now i prefer to eat them over other veggies blanche the sprouts after you cut them in halfflash freeze them just to stop them from cooking after the blanchehave some partially cooked chopped bacon and some shallots salt and pepper and butter or olive oilbrown those brussels cut side down in the pan with all the other ingredients and you have a bitter free brussel sprout dish that is heavenly
food,not_removed,when i first bite into one i can kind of see how somebody might enjoy them but milliseconds later this intense horrible bitterness overwhelms everything else and lingers ruining the rest of my meal the closest comparison i can make for someone who isnt a supertaster is if youve ever had extremely old broccoli that was picked too early and then kept in the fridge too long eat the very most bottom part of the stem keep that junk away from me
food,not_removed,correct answer its a shame because they are delicious
food,not_removed,yup genetic similar to this httpwwwwebmdcomfoodrecipesfeatureswhypeesmellsfunnyeatasparagus
food,not_removed,i have a similar issue many herbs as well as most peppers taste like dirt to me literally theres dirt herbs and dirt with bite peppers i wish i could change it considering i live in texas and my wife is mexican but try as i might i just cant choke them down
food,not_removed,i still find them bitter although overwhelmingly so so i usually cook them with something sweet to offset it
food,not_removed,well til
food,not_removed,the bitterness goes away if you let them on the plant until the first frost but you always have to eat them with mustard superdelicious match
food,not_removed,i thought this was only for coriander where it tastes soapy to some people til
food,not_removed,oh god this is a thing now i can finally get people off my back because my distaste for them is backed by science
food,not_removed,to me cilantro tastes like soap is this me
food,not_removed,they taste like the cedar they put in cigar tubes cause i tasted that once or twice my brother and i both had genetic testing done we both have the allele associated with bitter but i dont think he notices it or its not bitter to him we both have aversion to cilantro coriander too but it affects him more than me
food,not_removed,came here to say this im physically unable to even chew them without being nauseous its really bad
food,not_removed,this is what i tell people all the time brussel sprouts are one of the most bitter things ive ever tasted still people tell me oh they just didnt make them the right way even though i know no matter what they do to those brussel sprouts they will be disgusting ill still try them their way and each time i say the same thing out of all the brussel sprouts ive eaten these are the least offensive tasting but they still taste inediblly bitter to me makes them feel good that they made the best brussel sprouts ive tasted and i dont have to eat another bite to someone that doesnt understand how it can taste so bad its like this brussel sprout hits my tongue i can taste olive oil garlic salt pepper and then i chew and all of that is gone replaced with overwhelming bitterness where no other flavor can survive
food,not_removed,ooh a scentific reason for why brussel sprouts taste awful i shall inform my mom when she tries to put them on my plate
food,not_removed,the chemical in question is very similar to ptc phenylthiocarbamide which as you correctly say only tastes bitter if you have a specific gene apparently of the global population poses the mutation to the gene which allows them not to taste the bitterness its the unmutated gene possessed by the other that makes it taste bitter apparently the mutation is considered a health benefit as people are more likely to enjoy the taste of sprouts and could potentially eat them more i guess this an example of evolution in practice
food,not_removed,they taste super bitter to me but i keep trying them because people say they are great
food,not_removed,i remember frozen ones having much more bitter taste to them bitterness is associated with our mind as poison and it keeps us from eating too much of something that can make us sick or kill us children are more sensitive to bitterness and women are as well when compared to men
food,not_removed,fuck it may explains why i hate all things bitter like brussels olives and turnips
food,not_removed,is there an explanation for my wife who normally loves brussel sprouts and eats them by the pound literally eats them every day but occasionally finds them disgusting at restaurants she ordered a dish the other day that had brussel sprouts and found them bitter and gross but she otherwise loves them when she prepares them herself just steamed with some salt is there something about preparation that affects the bitterness
food,not_removed,the palate shifts with age or lifestyle changes though and do we know if there arent epigenetic factors i once hated greens i quit eating excess sugar for a while i now love greens i cant eat nearly the amount of sugar now whether genetic disposition or not whether epigenetic or not i would bet that almost everyone who doesnt like sprouts would change their tune if they changed their dietary course
food,not_removed,some of us are triple blessed with the brussel sprout coriander and asparagus genes
food,not_removed,my fil claimed he was predisposed to it then i cooked those crunchy with some butter lemon juice and some salt he gobbled it up and asked for seconds turns out he grew up in britain where the only way he knew his brussel sprouts as grey blobs that were boiled to death
food,not_removed,vile weed
food,not_removed,thats weird because i dont like bitter anything but looove brussels sprouts
food,not_removed,is it the same gene as the one that does it to grapefruit i havent had brussels sprouts since i was a little kid but i know i cant stand grapefruit so if its the same i just wont even bother
food,not_removed,this makes sense thank you like how some people think cilantro tastes like soap
food,not_removed,i have that with cilantro but love brussel sprouts
food,not_removed,i actually like that bitterness toss some butter and garlic on them in the pan and they turn out great
food,not_removed,i didnt even know there was a gene for this i just assumed brusselsprouts were supposed to be little pockets of fart
food,not_removed,never knew such a thing existed i normally eat these plain if i get to them before my wife butters these up same with broccoli but i dont know if thats bitter or not
food,not_removed,i think asparagus is the same way
food,not_removed,ahh so now i can get people off my back about not eating the properly cooked ones ive tried numerous times with many different cooking styles and flavors but theyve always come out extremely bitter i can stand a little bitterness but these are always too bitter not very pleasant to eat unfortunately
food,not_removed,might as well add some bacon
food,not_removed,i love mines burnt with garlic and olive oil its like bs chips
food,not_removed,and good balsamic vinegar
food,not_removed,or in the oven it is a very tasty charred veggie i love throwing them at the bottom of a roast as well
food,not_removed,my dad burns them with bacon walnuts and dried cranberries they are always the first thing finished at thanksgiving or christmas
food,not_removed,try using leeks in lieu of onions i made the change and havent went back
food,not_removed,i love to burn mine in a trashcan p
food,not_removed,next time try adding a little bit of soy sauce when you toss them in olive oil you may want to cut out the salt you can always add it after but still use pepper its amazing i usually cut mine in half and roast them cut side down for about min then turn them all over and continue roasting until they a have that nice char on them
food,not_removed,celery is crucial with onion and carrot in french cooking for a lot of things
food,not_removed,celery really is the most boring vegetable there is celery is at best tolerable when included in stews salads and other complex dishes but i have yet to see anyone figure out a way of presenting celery on its own that makes it worthwhile its bland stringy and almost flavorless really cant stand it
food,not_removed,ooh nah i love celery perfect with dip almond butter salsa and you can eat more of the dipwhatever because celery takes up so little stomach space
food,not_removed,dip it in ranch everything tastes better with ranch
food,not_removed,celery and cheese whiz
food,not_removed,no ants on a log
food,not_removed,i love celery and peas green beans brussel sprouts broccoli spinach i was that weird kid who ate their veggies
food,not_removed,celery is dope
food,not_removed,celery is a great complimentary food raw it adds crunchiness and juicyness to food salad peanut butter etc with stuff like wild rice and chicken it serves as a mild spice
food,not_removed,ill never touch raw celery if i can help it but its an essential component of many cooking holy trinities like mirepoix and when cooked properly it does contribute a good amount of flavor also good mixed with other veggies underneath a roast
food,not_removed,everyone is amazed at my hatred for celery everything about it is awful to me the smell is what i dislike most cant even be in the kitchen when its being cut
food,not_removed,its full of soluble and insoluble fiber
food,not_removed,steamed or boiled they might be gross but ever since i discovered that roasting vegetables is handsdown the tastiest option i see no reason to prepare them that way
food,not_removed,yep i think that a lot of vegetables that people dont like as kids but rediscover as adults have a bad rep because a lot of parentsschool cafeterias just cant cook them properly
food,not_removed,ive had them all kinds of different ways and i simply dont like their taste like salmon it doesnt matter what you do to it the underlying flavor is still salmon edit there is a costco salad where they are sliced super thin and add texture
food,not_removed,doesnt matter how you cook them its genetic no matter what they taste like death to me
food,not_removed,or maybe some people just think they taste like ass
food,not_removed,it has to have been a rhetorical question right everyone has had grandmas grey brussel sprouts right
food,not_removed,for real ive had so many in the past where i took a bite thought this is pretty good and then minutes later i was still chewing that bite and it didnt taste so good cooked properly theyre so tender and delicious
food,not_removed,as a kid they were over boiled and disgusting as an adult roast with olive oil delicious
food,not_removed,i grew up hating spinach brussels sprouts and numerous other veggies because they were always just boiled boiled sprouts of course theyre disgusting no wonder i hated that crap
food,not_removed,thats exactly what it is i was a semi picky eater as a child because my mom would make all sorts of random dishes for dinner shes an amazing cook however and as a kid some things dont look like they should be eaten and have a peculiar taste as i got older i became less picky and less picky but still never ate anything from the squash family specifically eggplant but now i love it and of course brusselsprouts nowadays i am the opposite of picky but literally the only food i wont eat is brusselsprouts even though everyone says my moms are the best she friessautees them with oil and bacon and whatever voodoo magic she does
food,not_removed,parents also boiled them to hell back in the day boiled to hell cruciferous veggies are garbage roasted or sauteed they are bomb
food,not_removed,came here to comment thisreally went alllll out on those chili flakes op
food,not_removed,god other peoples spice tolerance makes me hate being white sometimes ill go get thai food and order something at an and theyll look at me like i know not what i ask theyll bring me a white person which is like a thai and i just have to deal with it i want the heat damn it
food,not_removed,only if overcooked
food,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing goes for cooking broccoli too and im pretty sure thats another cliche veg that kids hate
food,not_removed,brussel sprout farts are the worst
food,not_removed,parmesan smells like vomit and that doesnt stop it from being delicious
food,not_removed,adobo
food,not_removed,roasting makes veggies sweeter one of my favorites is chinese long beans with olive oil and garlic or roasted elephant garlic spread on bread like butter
food,not_removed,because it is a food where the way you prepare it makes an incredibly huge difference in taste i cant stand them steamed or boiled but fresh and roasted theyre really tasty the trick is to caramelize the heck out of them they should be brown when leaving the ovenpan oil or butter assist with this adding a little extra sweetness doesnt hurt either i put a pinch of sugar in the oil before basting
food,not_removed,some people have a gene that makes them taste like shit if you have that gene then theyll taste bad no matter what you do them
food,not_removed,yep and canned veggies are bad too there is a big list if vegetables i didnt like till i bought fresh or even frozen
food,not_removed,if you like sweet with the savory try mixing some whole grain mustard or whatever mustard you have dijon is also good and a bit of maple syrup together then tossing the carmelized brussels with it for the last minute or so of cooking add in bacon heavenly
food,not_removed,me too theres an actual physiological reason these things are so freaking repulsive to me nice
food,not_removed,i feel your pain my mom would prepare them this way as well
food,not_removed,why their just magnificent
food,not_removed,because they taste like disgusting and strong smelling farts ftfy
food,not_removed,that should be an immediate on the stop no questions asked reason for firing someone right there bastard
food,not_removed,as someone who normally doesnt give a shit about bacon i agree brussels sprouts with bacon are great
food,not_removed,beware that there is no such thing as a cook timer when you are broiling you either stare and watch them until they appear done or they will be burnt at least in my experience
food,not_removed,just regular bake them on for or until nicely golden brown
food,not_removed,or throw them in an iron skillet with chopped bacon and the aforementioned salt and pepper and olive oil fantastic
food,not_removed,friend youre in for a treat as long as you pay attention and dont burn the shit out of whatever it is you put under there i use the broiler to cook some vegetables fish and chicken tenders and to melt or brown cheese on top of pasta dishes and everything else
food,not_removed,i would blanch them first just boil for a minutes then shock in ice water this really negates most of the bitter taste for the genetically disposed then slice them in half pat dry and place on a sheet try drizzle with olive oil and a good salt a good flaky sea salt like fleur de sol then place into a preheated oven about down from the top turn on broil and watch you are looking for a light char shake the pan and let tho other sides get a little color
food,not_removed,oh man your veggie life is about to improve so much broil or roast us the same thing place veggie on foil lined cookie sheet toss with olive oil salt pepper garlic cook minutes and flip or toss ive done cauliflower brussel sprouts cabbage carrots potatoes pretty much anything
food,not_removed,you want to cut them in half so they form a semicircle then baste them you can toss them in plastic bag with the oil and salt and just shake the hell out of it then arrange them on a cookie sheet with the flat side facing up move the over rack so that its in the highest position available put the sprouts in then set the over to broil youll have to experiment with the timing they should have some browning a little bit of blackening at the very edges should be roughly minutes or so if you want to play it safer then leave the rack in the center position preheat the oven to ° and roast them for about minutes
food,not_removed,same here i like them like i like my steaks boiled in urine and served wrapped in cellophane
food,not_removed,so is the bitter flavor natural in these im confused now because the bitterness is what i like about them if not everyone likes the bitterness i must be weird eh
food,not_removed,the level of bitterness is also dependent upon how they were grown a lot of the bitterness goes away if the sprouts are subjected to a strong frost before theyre harvested they are winter vegetables after all sadly most commercial brussels sprouts in the us are grown in california and never get to experience the type of frost necessary for them to really bring out their sweet and nutty flavors
food,not_removed,welli think im in the same boat as you ive always covered them in whatever i could to try pass them down
food,not_removed,does this affect your enjoyment of beer
food,not_removed,ahh but have you ever tried deep fried brussel sprouts with a spicy dipping sauce there is a beer garden around my way that makes them like that very tasty
food,not_removed,thats fine ill eat the brussel sprouts you can have all the olives
food,not_removed,so would it affect all greens or just brussel sprouts because other than this i absolutely love vegetables especially the green ones
food,not_removed,i used to despise the taste and texture of brussel sprouts all my life until i quit smoking last year i went to my sisters for thanksgiving and mom being mom she put three on my plate me being me i dutifully eat whats on my plate i went back for seconds and thirds i swear their jaws dropped im
food,not_removed,i like greens too but brussel sprouts taste like poison to me
food,not_removed,really i thought it had more to do with the thunderfarts you make after eating too much of them
food,not_removed,im envious of people who like cilantro its like they taste something completely different than me and i guess they probably are ive heard it described as fresh tasting or slightly peppery i dont taste any of those things all i taste is the flavor of rusty pennies just this nauseating metallic tang i used to just think eh people like different things and cilantro just isnt for me but now that i know that its a genetic thing i just feel like im just missing out
food,not_removed,this happens to me as well interesting isnt it i love greens broccolisproutskaleasparagus but cilantro has that unpleasant soapy taste to me interesting that theres a difference in the taste reaction food to food i wish i could love cilantro in pico etc but no matter how many times i try it its unpleasant
food,not_removed,i find this really interesting because i am the exact opposite love cilantro hate brussel sprouts i wonder if the genetic disposition you have to like one means you will not like the other anyone out there who likes both
food,not_removed,same here to me cilantro smellstastes a lot like the unpleasant fluid secreted by stink bugs when you bother them and this foul taste is so pervasive and penetrating that just a little bit of cilantro can easily ruin the entire meal you cant really mask it brussel sprouts and broccoli i find pretty tasty
food,not_removed,broccoli are one of my favorite vegetables but i cant stand brussel sprouts they taste way too bitter
food,not_removed,pretty sure the smell comes from a kind of organic compound that contains sulfur which is released during cooking
food,not_removed,i fucking hate this one im trying to eat my salad but then i bit one leaf and boom its so overwhelming that it makes the salad taste completely bitter
food,not_removed,oh god i hate arugula too so bitter and nasty
food,not_removed,i would say yes i cant eat arugula brussel sprouts broccoli etc for most of my life i didnt eat any greens because the bitterness is so overwhelming to me ive finally been able to somewhat acquire a taste for asparagus and green beans by sheer force of will and i eat a lot of power greeens like kale and spinach and chard in my smooties
food,not_removed,i like sprouts hate and i mean hate arugula it tastes not just bitter but also skunky to me blergh
food,not_removed,look if i have to completely disassemble char freeze smother and fry a vegetable not only is it not worth my time its simply not even the same food any more brussel sprouts are disgusting and apparently the only way to make them not disgusting is to overwhelm the bitterness with other flavors so no thank you ill stick to asparagus
food,not_removed,its generic you cant cook the horrid taste out for some people unless you some how removed all the oil from the sprouts
food,not_removed,this brewpub near me makes brussels sprouts with maple candied bacon on it oh god its so good
food,not_removed,this is the ticket right here
food,not_removed,and hazelnuts
food,not_removed,definitely add bacon and some balsamic reduction
food,not_removed,correct answer
food,not_removed,yes to this
food,not_removed,always
food,not_removed,came here to say this
food,not_removed,shallots and bacon plz
food,not_removed,if you blanche them and cut them in half first then youve nailed it
food,not_removed,thats true of all food put it on doughnuts glaze the stuff bacons an arrogant food
food,not_removed,those are some bullshit chips i agree ias i love sprouts too
food,not_removed,i cant believe i never thought of that awesome idea
food,not_removed,if you cover the pan tightly in aluminum foil for the first min of roasting you get a little steaming action which i find delicious
food,not_removed,but i have yet to see anyone figure out a way of presenting celery on its own that makes it worthwhile i give you
food,not_removed,i love celery even just plain so crunchy and it tastes so fresh and grassy almost like some good olive oils
food,not_removed,celery and hummus next
food,not_removed,stir fried with garlic and some mushroom seasoning delicious
food,not_removed,celery salt is nice though
food,not_removed,celery has this mild bitterness that b i like combine with the crunch and bursting with liquid i like it a lot boring yeah not for everyone
food,not_removed,i only ever eat celery with hot wings to me they go hand in hand i dont eat any other vegetable with wings
food,not_removed,celery is an excellent vehicle for shovelling hummus into ones mouth
food,not_removed,but i have yet to see anyone figure out a way of presenting celery on its own that makes it worthwhile as a vehicle for eating dip
food,not_removed,the leaves are great better than parsley which is useless outside of tabbouleh
food,not_removed,considering what celery adds to a dip you might as well just use a spoon all your flavor and taste is coming from the dip the celery is just a means of conveying it from the bowl to your mouth
food,not_removed,celery and raisins no no and no
food,not_removed,you should try deep fried brussels sprouts greatest food on this planet
food,not_removed,i usually steam them and think theyre delicious
food,not_removed,roasting is good but it does require added fatcalories compared to steaming i dont always want the added calories depending on how my macros are set for that day
food,not_removed,most people that didnt like them as a kid only had them because they were just bumped in a pan and boiled to fuck there used to be a middle aged dj in the uk cant remember name who used to make a joke around october that it was time to start cooking the sprouts for christmas i hated them my whole life until i had them one christmas at my mother in laws house steamed then fried with butter and bacon lardons now they are one of my favourite veg
food,not_removed,and that they grew up on canned veggies just reheated in microwave
food,not_removed,cafeterias ruin every vegetable i dont know why they even bother with brussel sprouts when they cant even get canned corn right dont even try
food,not_removed,i also despise salmon there are dozens of us dozens
food,not_removed,are you my girlfriend
food,not_removed,exactly roasting them with bacon and almonds just means you get hints of decent flavor behind the taste of brussel sprouts
food,not_removed,try tossing them in honey and siracha to your desired spicysweet level then cooking then in a lightly oiled pan until browned
food,not_removed,yea its not a matter of cooking them right im genetically predisposed to disliking the taste my fiance loves them i do them for him but no amount of roasting with garlic and bacon or tossing in butter makes them taste less bitter and awful to me
food,not_removed,try them before you regret not taking the chance to our parents are only with us for so long
food,not_removed,this used to drive my dad crazy he was a green beret and spent several years living incountry in vietnam laos and cambodia and eating native food then after the war he worked for the cia in the sudan where his cover was a foreman with chevron which says a lot about geopolitics dont it there he had a crew full of indians and got used to eating real authentic curries by the time he came back he had a fireproof tongue but as a white man restaurants constantly assumed he didnt know what he was talking about when he said make it hotter it was rough on me though as i have a typical white persons palate and find the white person too much give me one star and im sweating it
food,not_removed,ay que riiicoo
food,not_removed,theyre also a food that tastes like shit to people who have a certain gene no amount of roasting in olive oil can make shit taste good
food,not_removed,i think their tasty
food,not_removed,both is possible somehow usually because you blinked
food,not_removed,my oven has no window so this is difficult for me
food,not_removed,definitely more forgiving than a broiling
food,not_removed,holy shit you just changed the game
food,not_removed,exactly what my mom does hell her cooking skills make me enjoy almost anything
food,not_removed,no what theyre saying is they have a gene that makes them taste differently imagine if you took that bitter taste you like and multiplied it by
food,not_removed,well dont get me wrong everything can become an acquired taste beer for example and having the gene doesnt mean you will be averse to it its just if you didnt have the gene chances are you would have nothing against this particular sweet vegetable
food,not_removed,found the canadian
food,not_removed,i would like to point out there is also a gene that makes certain people really like bitter then im addition to that is it may be an acquired taste for others as well
food,not_removed,it doesnt matter what you do it will always taste like poison if you have the gene
food,not_removed,i think its brussels sprouts and broccoli
food,not_removed,i will say that i love cilantro but sometimes it tastes way different from bunch to bunch i will buy a bunch every week at my local coop and sometimes it is super vibrant and fresh and delicious and other times it has more of that metallic taste you are describing so i feel like there is some variation in flavor i usually like it even when i get a bad bunch but i could definitely see other people hating it when its like that
food,not_removed,its very effervescent and refreshing not really spicy more a flavor boost if anything i get a slightly cooling sensation
food,not_removed,yeah cilantro is one of the best flavors in the world
food,not_removed,thats a common one i forget the percentage of population but its pretty high
food,not_removed,how dare you disrespect the prince of guacamole like that just kidding i feel the same way about trufflestruffle oil
food,not_removed,if im not mistaken the soapy taste in cilantro is apparently a genetic thing too
food,not_removed,i dont generally feel like its soapy unless you use too much it can get reaaaaally overbearing if you overuse it but then again im sure that if youre genetically predisposed to not like it which i dont believe i am that taste is amplified and you can taste it in much lower quantities
food,not_removed,yes i love both my guess is that the two are not related
food,not_removed,damn you guys are missing out
food,not_removed,come ride the green rocket
food,not_removed,blanching and shocking are really just done to preserve the color its a common trick that works with pretty much all green vegetables but if you arent super picky about presentation you can just skip that part and go straight to frying them or even easier just toss them in oilfat and roast them
food,not_removed,and marijuana
food,not_removed,lol i thought about that after i typed it i refuse to edit but i should have reddit before the save
food,not_removed,whole head cauliflower roasted in the oven in fantastic cook it at with olive oil and some sea salt cook for minutes with foil then pull it off and cook for another minutes or until soft poke the damn thing with a knife to the core to check if its fully cooked
food,not_removed,why not just use a lid
food,not_removed,banjo kazooie confirmed
food,not_removed,looks disgusting tbh
food,not_removed,thats greatif youre a four year old
food,not_removed,i also love food that tastes like grass
food,not_removed,celery is what i snack on when im trying to be mindful of my weight quick rinse under the tap then sprinkled with a little salt while still wet beautiful
food,not_removed,come join us rcelery
food,not_removed,dat crunch tho
food,not_removed,i would but deep frying is such an enormous pain in the ass that i never bother with it maybe at the state fair
food,not_removed,we pan fry them with salt pepper a few sliced pieces of onion and maybe half a clove of minced garlic now im gonna have to try tossing them with a bit of soy sauce instead of the salt and pepper
food,not_removed,prep is definitely the key liver is the same way there are only so many ways it can be done right hint include bacon and lots of burnt onions but many ways to screw it up moose liver is awesome though its harder to screw up moose liver
food,not_removed,i would have thought i had the gene because i despised them avoided them like the plague for years turns out i never tried them broiled to a crisp
food,not_removed,i hear on reddit their real particular about grammar theyll downvote you on their for using it wrong
food,not_removed,schrödingers broiler
food,not_removed,broiling puts off so much heat so quickly that you can leave the oven cracked nothing you cook at a hi broil will take long enough to worry about heat loss
food,not_removed,yeah i dont think broiling is a good idea at all there is no way the inside would heat through before the outside burnt up roasted is the way to go for sure
food,not_removed,what did i miss the comment was deleted for some reason
food,not_removed,it did for me i discovered broiling embarrassingly late in life but i do it all the time now
food,not_removed,think of super tasters like color most people see just fine but with the super taster gene in regards to color food like this is like having saturation maxed its overwhelming and its the only thing we can taste and its outright revolting because when youre a super taster you learn that bitter doesnt just go away after you swallow the food it lingers in your mouth for several minutes a lot of foods have bitter components too tomatoes which taste fine when theyre overloaded with sugar and salt like sauces and ketchup coffee and beer the former can be overloaded with sugar and cream to negate its bitterness or just be cold brewed instead cabbage is basically a giant brussels sprout the only thing worse than being a super taster is having the gene that makes coriandercilantro taste like fucking soap
food,not_removed,broccoli tastes fine to me but brussels are revolting
food,not_removed,how dare you disrespect the king of pasta additives like that haha ya it sucks
food,not_removed,ya im certain its genetic my sisters have the same thing i wont pull it off if its in small enough quantities as it isnt too overbearing but if its full leaves etc ill need to pull it off or that soap taste will dominate everything
food,not_removed,thanks for responding and lucky you wish i could enjoy the taste of brussel sprouts they sound so appealing in this thread
food,not_removed,nutty goodness i tells ya
food,not_removed,i think i could pretty much survive on roasted veggies i need to make them more often i wish i could have a grill where i live sometimes its just too hot to put the oven on even with ac
food,not_removed,i am on to you
food,not_removed,i like to do that except with sriracha instead of water as my salt glue
food,not_removed,ops comment led me down a rabbit hole of knowledge and now i know more about my oven than ever before they explained why the oven door has a stop that holds it about inches open it is designed to hold itself open for broiling this is good for two reasons it prevents steam from building up inside the oven this keeps it dry and hot so your food will get a nice crust on it keeping the door ajar will also help regulate the temperature it keeps the inside of the oven from getting too hot and just baking your food intead of broiling it typically this advice is for electric ovens only since ive read doing this with a gas oven will cause a lot of smoke but ymmv check your owners manual and see what the manufacturer has to say
food,not_removed,woo both yay x on a side note the reason cilantro tastes like soap is that our saliva has an enzyme which breaks a component of the cilantro down into formaldehyde
food,not_removed,do fresh coriander leaves and the ground up seeds tastes very differently i like the seeds as a spice but everything with lemongrass tastes like soap to me maybe the dishes i tried with lemongrass all also had fresh coriandercilantro
food,not_removed,cabbage and brussels sprouts taste the same i hate both but i think they taste very different cabbage smells like garbage
food,not_removed,if you havent give roasted a try or deep fried im not a fan of boiled but roasted or fried are awesome i guess if you have the generic trait it wont help but if you merely havent had good brussels it will
food,not_removed,same here ive been lazy about it but i really should start making some sort of roasted veg with every meal it should help my dad bod bachelor physique
food,not_removed,can you give a reputable source for that claim yes it is an aldehyde but formaldehyde i dont think so and cannot find any sources claiming that specifically many short chained aldehydes smell putrid btw you can crush cilantro to enzymatically reduce the soapy tasteodor though personally i still cant stand it though thats probably environmental more than it is genetic for me
food,not_removed,the taste is very different also different again are the roots of the fresh corriander some recipes call for corriander roots and they work beautifully in the dish personally im not that keen on fresh corriander i dont get the soap taste like a lot of pwople do i just dont like it that much if i only use a very small amount it suits me a lot better
food,not_removed,can i snackasaurus on this
food,not_removed,id eat it all to myself even if my next trip to the bathroom would leave me with a brontosaurass
food,not_removed,no need for sympathy the pie would be worth it and besides in the aftermath its always nice to squeeze a megalodoff as long as there isnt an exstinktion event
food,not_removed,even though dinsaurs no longer rule the earth this one would rule my girth on a less punny note though what kind of pie is that im curious about what topping you used to make the dino are those vegetables on a meat pie i am so hungry i could eat a brachiosaurus
food,not_removed,thats looking very delicious and tasty
food,not_removed,that looking very tasty
food,not_removed,carbonara has four ingredients guanciale eggs black pepper and pecorino romano there i see peas bacon something leafy and eggs the only ingredient in common with carbonara is the presence of eggs is a carbonara just any pasta with eggs
food,not_removed,dang you guys are brutal
food,not_removed,that looks delish
food,not_removed,interested in the sauce
food,not_removed,house made
food,not_removed,totally agree with you on principle although i make mine with a combination of pecorino and parmigiano and parsley is an acceptable variation but peas and spinach or whatever that is is way too far let alone cream
food,not_removed,maybe its a regional thing but ive always considered peas to be a standard ingredient in a traditional carbonara
food,not_removed,the sauce in carbonara is just egg cheese and enough starchy pasta water to thin it out some
food,not_removed,this image looks like a commercial kitchen soyeah
food,not_removed,no cream just eggs and cheese and starchy water the green leaves are basil
food,not_removed,its not a standard ingredient they are added sometimes in the us they also add cream garlic and parsley
food,not_removed,yea i guess i was referring to a us carbonara not the classicoriginal recipe traditional was definitely the wrong choice of words i meant more standard around where im from because at least where i live its expected that a carb would include peas cream garlic and often either shrimp or chicken in the us i think a lot of people think of carbonara as basically an alfredo with a bunch of extra stuff in it you are correct though about what a traditional carbonara is i chose my words poorly
food,not_removed,haha that is amazing
food,not_removed,good stuff good thing you took pics to remember what you did after all that whiskey haha

food,not_removed,not to sound like an ass or anything i dont mean this mean spirited or anything learn to read a cook book practice and experiment if you want to learn how to create a food product by looking at it you have to know basic caulinary arts i can look at that and know how to cook it if there are any ingredients pertaining to sauces then that would come in handy but more or less i can create that from the picture learning to cook is a great advantage to have over yourself and others i highly recommend that you take up some classes or have a friend teach you basics and go from there i started cooking at an early age and it is second nature to me now but you start somewhere i suggest you start at the somewhere
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,you sound like an ass
food,not_removed,are you really bragging that you can look at a picture of a hamburger and then cook a hamburger wow you must be so talented in the kitchen

food,not_removed,hes likely just fucking with you because of your opening line
food,not_removed,god damn kids all kids on the earth should be killed
food,not_removed,dude i was kidding you said not to sound like an ass but going off your advice about learning things at a young agei learned sarcasm at a young age and you should try too this is a post about a cheeseburgerand now youre here talking about killing kids
food,not_removed,haha well said that really hurts my feelings lol you are clearly very jealous that you didnt eat this cheeseburger hello is this jelly school

food,not_removed,how do you get the beef like that
food,not_removed,damn that looks good
food,not_removed,nicely done i love your presentation skills did you use korean seaweed
food,not_removed,i sort of have a recipe on my blog wwwnichijounet but basically when you make the beef bourguignon you sear and brown cubes of chuck roast then you simmer the beef in beef stock and wine for hours until it is fall apart tender
food,not_removed,thanks it was one my favorite ramens that i have made
food,not_removed,thanks i used japanese seasoned seaweed but it is essentially the same as korean seaweed i have a brand that i like it is expensive but theyre relatively large flat and extra crispy
food,not_removed,thanks a lot i love beef roast that falls apart

food,not_removed,maple street
food,not_removed,sweet jesus this gave me a boner
food,not_removed,it looks okay i guess
food,not_removed,what are biscuits exactly are they a type of pastry
food,not_removed,is an american biscuit like a bun how does this work it looks like a british scone
food,not_removed,i will definitely look ugly eating this but i wouldnt care
food,not_removed,kinda looks like shit it may be super delicious but the presentation is absolute garbage
food,not_removed,eww
food,not_removed,that aint no biscuit thats a scone
food,not_removed,looks like a lot of sodium
food,not_removed,wew the taste must be heavy

food,not_removed,i will always order the reggie deluxe when i go to pine state its just soooo good add some advark hot sauce and im in heaven
food,not_removed,saw the picture recognized pine state right away did a search to see i wasnt the first i might need to head there for lunch now
food,not_removed,i recognized this delicious sandwich instantly even remembered the plate and last time i had one was a year ago i need to get back to portland
food,not_removed,youre damn right im in from out of town and they blew the notion that the south knows how to do biscuits out of the water
food,not_removed,haha came here to ask the same thing some sandwiches are worth fighting the traffic for
food,not_removed,ugh i travel miles for maple street they are fantastic
food,not_removed,i love maple street
food,not_removed,maple streets the best i thought it might have been from there but maple streets gravy is way chunkier im hoping they keep moving south down the state
food,not_removed,thats not too far from me seriously considering the trip
food,not_removed,they just opened up in gainesville fl too
food,not_removed,i definitely came
food,not_removed,my thoughts exactly need to take a trip to denver just to go back there
food,not_removed,we have three of them now
food,not_removed,yeah im with you on this one
food,not_removed,aka the reggie deluxe
food,not_removed,this is definitely a kfj knife and fork job
food,not_removed,they are great biscuits not just perfectly good
food,not_removed,pine state biscuits portland or
food,not_removed,thats exactly what i was thinking boy does that sound good
food,not_removed,i wish they had some decent stuff
food,not_removed,httpwwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesaltonbrownsconesrecipehtml httpwwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesaltonbrownsouthernbiscuitsrecipehtml almost biscuits not cookies are simpler and better
food,not_removed,and by okay i mean god damn delicious
food,not_removed,its like a flaky and buttery bread baked individually like a scone
food,not_removed,its not like a scone much at all or at least what i as an american know a scone to be biscuits are light and flaky at least when theyre done right made with a lot of butter
food,not_removed,yeah biscuits in america are a type of bread similar to a soda bread but not sweet typically buttery and flaky and usually about the size of a small bunroll
food,not_removed,ignore the others they are round scones made with very soft flour not sweetened or seasoned usually
food,not_removed,i ordered a biscuit and gravy not a steak what do you expect
food,not_removed,funny thats what your so said about me
food,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikibiscuit
food,not_removed,my yr old grandmother ate like this regularly
food,not_removed,american cuisine is like saying euro cuisine which has quite the range of optionsend rant
food,not_removed,not sure if troll or idiot
food,not_removed,reggie deluxe is life
food,not_removed,get a plan b just drove past the alberta one people standing in line outside its summer in portland fucking tourists
food,not_removed,imma eat one in your honor d
food,not_removed,owners are from north carolina
food,not_removed,for the users who are confused this op is commenting that he really enjoyed the biscuits and believes that the south does indeed make a fine biscuit better than he has ever seen anywhere else
food,not_removed,if you are still in town give muscadine a shot amazing biscuits and gravy they also have beignets
food,not_removed,screen door you need to go to screen door
food,not_removed,this looks like a nightmare for a knife and fork i think you just accept the mess and go for it
food,not_removed,scones look nice but every one ive ever tried were like a hockey puck if youve never had a real biscuit then you are missing light flaky goodness
food,not_removed,scone without the egg or sugar but baked individually are you crazy no they puff up in a pan together and then are pulled apart leaving their soft fluffy insides exposed
food,not_removed,the basic dough is more or less the same used for scones
food,not_removed,yeah scones are hard like a hockey puck
food,not_removed,is sharp cheddar the same thing as extra mature cheddar
food,not_removed,much more like scones than soda bread
food,not_removed,i dont know biscuit and gravy is not common in my country and i have no idea what it is just doesnt look appealing
food,not_removed,jokes on you i dont have an so
food,not_removed,in england thats a scone and we created them so pipe down
food,not_removed,perhaps but based on the photos posted on this subreddit i get the impression that as a nation you mainly subsist on a diet of burgers and melted cheese
food,not_removed,if you wanna go to pine state on alberta for lunch you must arrive before after its a shit show
food,not_removed,i assume you grew up here because someone who chose to move here and is therefore part of the problem really has no place to criticize
food,not_removed,i dont know man it has north in the name you havent made a great case for yourself
food,not_removed,raise up
food,not_removed,it looks a little like the big nasty at the hominy grill
food,not_removed,thanks for clarifying i was getting really triggered there for a moment
food,not_removed,have you ever had good biscuits and gravy with fried chicken and gravy not trying to be an ass im genuinely curious good biscuits and gravy especially with good fried chicken is really hard to beat when youve had a long day
food,not_removed,what country are you from so we can talk shit about your cuisine
food,not_removed,ive had a couple of these beasts you have to be strategic but knife and fork gets the job done
food,not_removed,i agree completely part of it comes from the fact that scones rise alone and are hardened by the heat biscuits arise together fostering that light warm soft flakey goodness
food,not_removed,right i was trying to compare it to something british but i guess their scones are made the same as ours just not sweet
food,not_removed,wikipedia says that uk cheddar is rated mild medium mature extra mature vintage in the us we go mild medium sharp extrasharp i have no idea if thats a comparison
food,not_removed,then ur mem said it
food,not_removed,english scones are pretty different than american biscuits tho
food,not_removed,happens with every culture nobodys posting their boring packed lunch unless you head over to rmealprepsunday
food,not_removed,dont hassle me im local
food,not_removed,cmon ive been here long enough squatter rights
food,not_removed,its still tobacco and heat in nc just like sc source live around the state line in sc
food,not_removed,take ya shirt off twist it round ya head spin it like a helicopter
food,not_removed,yep i was thinking hominy grill in chuck town too
food,not_removed,sounds like your scale is missing the vintage equivilent though ive never seen vintage in uk supermarkets i went to the cheddar caves many years ago but i was too young to be paying attention to the expensive cheese my mum was buying at the time p i must try this vintage cheddar d
food,not_removed,i agree about not posting boring food but my point was that north americans seem to post lots of pics of arteryclogging burgers more so perhaps than redditors from regions where fast food is less of an art form
food,not_removed,i swear denver and to an only slightly lesser extent the rest of the state are like this so much so that coors makes a beer called colorado native
food,not_removed,yeah maybe after or years complaints about the subsequent migrants can be justified
food,not_removed,hey we also have a shitload of corn chicken cotton and wheat in all seriousness nc whether is one of the best for farming in general we get heat but usually not over and thats only in the dead center of summer you can grow just about anything here hell my dad had corn tomatoes peaches pairs plums black berries peacans and apples growing in his yard damn near wildthey were planted by someone but we dont know who and they came back every year
food,not_removed,hot north carolina hahahahahaha sincerely alabama
food,not_removed,who am i
food,not_removed,yeah we tend to post our guilty pleasure foods here a lot i have noticed
food,not_removed,certainly true i actually had something a lot like this for breakfast last week but i basically skipped lunch since i was so full
food,not_removed,think of it like a full english breakfast when someone posts one i dont assume thats what people eat every morning before they go to work i assume they have it maybe once a month on a weekend and probably skip lunch too
food,not_removed,who put you in charge of this shit born and raised here i say you can start bitching as soon as you cross the city limits whatta you gonna do about it
food,not_removed,hell yeah i have mulberry cobbler for free multiple times a year currently growing tomato sunflower chickens and some corn in my back yard
food,not_removed,i live in sc near the border its humid as hell but we dont get the kinda heat that columbia and farther south get just not as much unless you count heat index
food,not_removed,peteyyy pabbbb muthaaafuckaaaa
food,not_removed,hold on this is breakfast
food,not_removed,im gonna bitch about it
food,not_removed,to be fair we did have wild chickens in our back hard though they may have been the neighbors fuck it they tasted good either way
food,not_removed,well the english breakfast was just an example but this sandwich at this particular place is most often eaten as brunch which is to say the meal you eat around eleven in place of both breakfast and lunch often after youve woken up late with a hangover i dont know anyone who eats something like this more than once a month
food,not_removed,i love you
food,not_removed,ahhhh looks yummy
food,not_removed,it was yummy ive been grilling more boneless beef chuck ribs recently very tender quality cut of meat for a good price
food,not_removed,how do you grill it
food,not_removed,marinated over night with salt pepper garlic onion powder and worcestershire sauce grilled over charcoal minutes each side delicious
food,not_removed,add a bit oil to it and it should do the magic
food,not_removed,whats ipa sauce like it sounds interesting i dont have a palate that typically draws towards the bitter complexities of ipa a sauce however sounds good i am imagining it is pretty sweet maybe some floral hints yummy
food,not_removed,the hops come through on the tail end i sautéed some garlic and onions then deglazed with harpoon ipa and used about equal parts of carolina style and regular barbecue but its sweet tangy with a nice spice to it
food,not_removed,hold the offal
food,not_removed,at sapp coffee shop on hollywood blvd
food,not_removed,best noodles in la not a noodle in sight looks delicious though
food,not_removed,try the jade noodle special then go to and try the jade noodle there argue and lose friends over which is superior then have the crab curry at and stop arguing because your face is on fire
food,not_removed,theyre in there under all of the ingredients looks like thin rice noodles which is why theyre difficult to see
food,not_removed,yeah im sure they are in there just thought it was kinda funny that i couldnt see them but it does look really tasty
food,not_removed,never knew quinoa looked like baby bugs
food,not_removed,oh god cant unpicture that now
food,not_removed,ew 😳
food,not_removed,twoallbeefpattiesspecialsaucelettucecheesepickelsonionsonasesameseedbun
food,not_removed,is that two patties
food,not_removed,no sesame seeds here am disappoint
food,not_removed,i cheated and made two separate burgers four patties is just too much
food,not_removed,what a bright idea
food,not_removed,this has nothing to do with orangeade in a light bulb but it reminded me of one of my favorite radio commercials from the the commercial was for orangina the tag line for the commercial delivered in very cultured british accent was something like orangina in bottles that look like oranges and cans that look likecans i cracked up every time i heard it
food,not_removed,thats pretty funky
food,not_removed,what if you need to put it down
food,not_removed,i like you and your pun game
food,not_removed,you drink it pretty quick its degrees plus in seoul
food,not_removed,i thought so it looks pretty small i just like the mental image of someone needing both hands to do whatever but struggling to put down their drink
food,not_removed,this is the before im sure the after includes a massive slab of beef
food,not_removed,is this food for ants d looks delish
food,not_removed,uhoh the plate is waiting for something 👏

food,not_removed,that looksflavorless
food,not_removed,the veggies were all cooked and hot it was delish
food,not_removed,it wasnt it was amazing there was garlic and onion
food,not_removed,recipe is needed
food,not_removed,so you put a dutch oven in a grill seems kinda strange idk
food,not_removed,lbs chicken breast or whatever cut you prefer eggs beaten cups all purpose flour seasoned with salt pepper seasoned salt put whatever you want in there gallon canola oil for frying bbq sauce used homemade used extra brown sugar for optimum caramelization we used one dutch oven for the deep frying then placed them in another dutch oven over mediumlow heat layering the bbq sauce and fried chicken fingers like a bbq chicken lasagna candify for or so minutes let me know if you want more detail
food,not_removed,do you know what a dutch oven is i want to know why you think this is strange
food,not_removed,thank you so much ima try it tomorrow ill let you know how it ends up
food,not_removed,you said its all done on the grill but you dont mention using a grill here lol
food,not_removed,i thought it was just a big ceramic pot i usually put mine in the oven or on the stove though whats the benefit of using the grill wouldnt the dutch oven be closed and not get any of the searsmoke from the grill anyways
food,not_removed,id love to know how it goes
food,not_removed,at what point is it necessary to mention the grill do you need guidance on how to set a grill to medium low heat or a reminder to fire up the grill before you can start
food,not_removed,the benefit is mostly for the frying its insanely messy and the cleanup is far easier when done outside and no you are not getting any sear from the grill the meat never directly touches the grill i just love cooking food over an open flame and i find it more easy to regulate temperature and not all dutch ovens are ceramic they have some specifically for open flame check out lodge
food,not_removed,that looks great but i am concerned does that only work with an electric oven
food,not_removed,you could use propane p
food,not_removed,hello uthedz thank you for your submission unfortunately your submission has been removed for the following reasons please make sure the title of your submission simply describes the food itself please save additional details including context about how where or why the food was made for the comments section instead if you resubmitted this to rfood with a different title it would be allowed thanks
food,not_removed,it makes me hungry
food,not_removed,check out big and littles i personally think their po boys are better
food,not_removed,that bread looks awfully soft for a poboy imo but ive been spoiled by living in nola
food,not_removed,that looks good but it looks more like a potato poboy ive eaten a lot of shrimp poboys from a lot of different places and the shrimp is pretty much always overflowing
food,not_removed,loved these until last year when i developed an allergy all of a sudden puked my guts out for a couple of hours great going down though
food,not_removed,will have to check it out im always a fan of mustards last stand bonus points for the pun and the food
food,not_removed,next time im in chicago ill have to try this
food,not_removed,thats what i was thinkingfrom the texas coastchicagos too far from the ocean to catch my attention with a shrimp po boy shrimp n stuff galveston island
food,not_removed,there was plenty of shrimp as well along the bottom
food,not_removed,i cant believe this is home made recipe please
food,not_removed,there had better be a tall glass of milk somewhere nearby
food,not_removed,too ethnicy for me
food,not_removed,as an european this is very strange to me is it an american thing to always combine something sweet with something savoury
food,not_removed,needs a cheddar cheese stick and a glass of milk
food,not_removed,have you tried putting chips inside the sandwich its pretty good and adds a nice crunch dunno if it works with peanut butter and jelly though just tried it with sandwiches like turkey lettuce etc
food,not_removed,simple comfort food its nice to see that some people can get pleasure off of what was once just a bagged lunch
food,not_removed,i hope this was a lazy day meal because otherwise this is shit yes this is gordon ramsay
food,not_removed,i dont know if we all enjoy it but i would say alot of americans enjoy savory and sweet together if you ever have the opportunity i reccomend dipping a french fry in a milk shake
food,not_removed,it works with pb and j dat crunch and salt is amazing
food,not_removed,why dont you use caps properly english much
food,not_removed,sounds quite exotic the farthest ive gone has been salted caramel
food,not_removed,try some swedish candy some of their stuff is so salty its crazy
food,not_removed,i live in indiana i go to this local chinese grocery so often the lady knows me and reserves the freshest seafood for me i made this all by myself
food,not_removed,what part of the world are you from is this store bought or out of the ocean
food,not_removed,you should control your parents cholesterol after this wonderful seafood meal
food,not_removed,this looks amazing
food,not_removed,this was just lunch dinner had lobster shrimp crab oysters and fish didnt have a picture of it though
food,not_removed,seriously wow are you coastline india because thats a ton of seafood where i live that would be a ton of money
food,not_removed,nope i am in midwest usa landlocked but i know the right place and people to buy the freshest seafood
food,not_removed,this looks like something to die for
food,not_removed,how exactly does one go about making this i have all the necessary ingredients i think please let me know id love to make this tomorrow night
food,not_removed,i bought a bag of potato i had bacon potato hash for dinner for the past days
food,not_removed,looks like youd add potato first then carrots then mushrooms then i assume bacon im gonna make the assumption that there is onions add those the eggs look poached not sure but add those sprinkle liberally with saltpepper parsley and what is either paprika chili powder or cayenne powder
food,not_removed,looks awesome if you added a little chorizo it would be an oral fiesta
food,not_removed,looks delicious
food,not_removed,noice try it with steamed corn tortillas though and youll never go back
food,not_removed,needs jalapeño or some type of salsa
food,not_removed,this is so nostalgic probably not a great everyday breakfast but reminds me of my nanas cooking when i was a kid
food,not_removed,salsa or even some cholula would really do this dish some good
food,not_removed,i do like corn tortillas didnt have any maybe this is a dumb question how do you steam them
food,not_removed,this was my very late dinner d
food,not_removed,send some my way
food,not_removed,do you eat the soup and then just start eating the raw meat
food,not_removed,is that off of rainbow and warm springs
food,not_removed,meat looks a little lean for ideal shabu shabu more marblingmmmmm
food,not_removed,you dip the meat in the soup and then eat it
food,not_removed,man ive been using bread for that like a chump
food,not_removed,you get something similar to that with vietnamese beef pho when its served traditionally in restaurants they place thing slices of filet minon on top of the noodles and then pour the broth into the bowl gently so it passes across the meat and cooks it its really good anyone know what this dish is called
food,not_removed,my gf got on this diet a few weeks ago its been super expensive and she hasnt lost any weight at all

food,not_removed,zucchini has no place in a taco you are a monster pretty picture though
food,not_removed,these arent tacos these are hard shells stuffed with a bunch of junk
food,not_removed,i wouldve went for jalapeno instead
food,not_removed,still no place in a taco not quite as monstrous though
food,not_removed,cold watermelon is a summertime favorite for me
food,not_removed,ive heard of grilling pineapple but watermelon is this really a thing first iv heard of it id like to try a slice
food,not_removed,id give it a go you should try some grilled fresh pineapple spears super yum
food,not_removed,nope grilled watermelon sucks wasnt a fan shit gets a gooey nope
food,not_removed,the savory take with some feta a couple folks mentioned is nice but for a grill dessert top the grilled watermelon with a little bit of syrup made with honey lime and mint
food,not_removed,while it may be good im a big fan of just cutting it open and eating it no salt either thanks that ruins it for me
food,not_removed,thats looking very delicious
food,not_removed,watermelon with lime squeezed over it is the best try it everyone always gives me a weird look when i suggest that then they thank me for showing them the light when they try it
food,not_removed,isnt grilling watermelon defeating the purpose of it being hydrating and cold by drying it out and cooking it
food,not_removed,this is excellent a little olive oil fresh ground black pepper feta cheese crumbles and basil leaves and youre ready to go great summertime treat
food,not_removed,as a black man i can honestly say i had no idea this was a thing
food,not_removed,its not often you see the same amount of comments as upvotes
food,not_removed,youre fucking high
food,not_removed,find pickled watermelon rind wrap it in bacon grill it youre welcome
food,not_removed,jeez the closemindedness in the comments is ridiculous
food,not_removed,bbq sauce on there
food,not_removed,me too only grilled a fourth of it
food,not_removed,cold watermelon on a hot day bliss
food,not_removed,its really good with mint and feta cheese on top
food,not_removed,its a thing for me brushing it with oil helps to sear it then as it cooks the sugars basically caramelize it ends up being juicier than a normal melon different texture though so be prepared for that lol
food,not_removed,ill grill just about anything lol
food,not_removed,put some brownsugar and cinnamon on the pineapple first tastes amazing
food,not_removed,suit yourself its not for everyone
food,not_removed,hated it and why on earth would you do that to a watermelon its already perfect
food,not_removed,omg that sounds amazing
food,not_removed,i dont salt it when its fresh just when its grilled
food,not_removed,definitely gunna try that
food,not_removed,if you can find it in your grocery store tajin sprinkled on watermelon is freaking amazing
food,not_removed,its definitely not dry almost more moist the sugar basically carmelizes
food,not_removed,i reply to a lot of them
food,not_removed,but im not supposed to listen to you
food,not_removed,im intrigued
food,not_removed,you seem like a pleasant person to hangout with
food,not_removed,no just brushed with oil
food,not_removed,you god damned patriot
food,not_removed,ohhh never tried that i usually just brush with oil grill and then maybe salt it
food,not_removed,just made a note to try this thanks for posting
food,not_removed,what type of oil works best
food,not_removed,i was going to say it looks good but draining the water making it less crunch cant be good things
food,not_removed,you wont regret it if you enjoy it try lime on papaya too plain papaya is gross to me but add that lime and bam deliciousness also peel and slice a cucumber squeeze lime over it and add a bit of salt same with apples lime and salt
food,not_removed,yup thats the way to do it too
food,not_removed,country stores usually have it and farmers markets specialty or fancy stores may have it
food,not_removed,you are correct in your inference and i am not right now deleted edit added on you inference ughhhmoves along whistling to myself
food,not_removed,runexpectedpatriotism
food,not_removed,cant go wrong there either
food,not_removed,no problem
food,not_removed,i use olive oil
food,not_removed,op better reply but id use olive oil or even better those fancy oils what come with fruits inside for flavor they look like those fancy liquor bottles with a pear inside or an apple mango infused olive oil is bomb
food,not_removed,actually its just as if not more juicy when its fresh the sugars caramelize and make it yummy not as much crunch though however you dont go into it expecting a normal watermelon
food,not_removed,you must just keep a bag of limes around lol
food,not_removed,i use olive
food,not_removed,my instant thought was olive oil too but it can sometimes get a little gross on a grill or any high direct heat due to its low smoke point
food,not_removed,haha yeah the mexican side of my family always ate this way and i remember thinking to myself how awesome lime makes everything taste definitely a mexican thing if you end up finding some mexican inspired chips for example they will always have some with lime flavoring that reminds me buy some pork rinds i prefer the spicy ones you guessed it squeeze some lime on those suckers just dont let them sit too long they get soggy
food,not_removed,i have noticed that and i got a bag of limes today lol
food,not_removed,enjoy my friend
food,not_removed,that looks so good

food,not_removed,so what are those things that look like meat nuggets
food,not_removed,so vegetarian
food,not_removed,probably seitan nuggets fried and tossed in sauce and sesame seeds

food,not_removed,how can it be vegetarian its just vegetables and nonmeat food items
food,not_removed,til seitan exists and now im hungry

food,not_removed,as a greek i approve looks tasty
food,not_removed,i worked with what i had so its not completely authentic im my own worst critic and i ended up eating half of this in a sitting id like to share i used recipe for the crust no phyllo but it was flaky nonetheless filling which is pretty adjustable ounce tub of fresh spinach wilted and squeezed of excess liquid clove minced garlic cup crumbled feta cup grated parmesan a mixture of eggs cup heavy cream tbs lemon juice and tbs cornstarch prebake bottom crust if youd like it flaky and crispier i prefer a chewier moist bottom instructions preheat oven to roll out half of the chilled dough and lay into inch pie dish mix all filling ingredients and spread into dish roll second half of dough and line the top lightly pinching sides slit cross in the center so it can breathe egg wash if youd like bake for minutes i didnt find the need to foil the rim but you may need it depending on your oven best to let it chill for a few minutes before digging in
food,not_removed,ah that actually means a lot thanks
food,not_removed,fyi if you can make spanakopita you can also make tiropita which is similar to spanakopita but without spinach and filled with different cheeses i highly recommend it its another delicious but not as popular greek dish
food,not_removed,bookmarkedthanks any other savory pie variations i should know about
food,not_removed,those are the main ones now you can graduate to more complicated dishes like and this is making me hungry and im not willing to make greek food at
food,not_removed,httpsimgurcomgallerygubdh another angle before i plated everything the pork chops were cooked to degrees internal temperature according to my thermoworks
food,not_removed,how do you make it

food,not_removed,that looks delicious regarding your imgur comment if someone freaks out at you for baking delicious food thats their problem not yours
food,not_removed,what makes a taco not authentically mexican
food,not_removed,this is about right they are soft tacos the tortillas are always corn if that sounds bad to you remember these are not cold dry sandpapery storebought corn tortillas these were freshly pressed at the tortillería feet away or made by the taqueros mom they are hot steaming moist and ready to fall apart in your mouth there is never lettuce tomato or shredded cheese rarely there may be sour cream available at a taquería or public market but its not common okay there may be a salad of lettuce and tomato that comes on the side of the plate but thats not part of the taco now is it stop putting it on the taco there usually isnt cheese at all if there was cheese it would be called something different more on that later the meat is what makes the taco and it is never hamburger you have dozens of meats to choose from most taquerías have at least five or six any given day generally the toppings are just cilantro and finely diced white onion sometimes you might also be offered radish slices half an onion grilled to the point of browning or a whole pepper prepared on the grill or fried in oil you are offered unlimited slices of fresh limes theyre heaped in bowls all over the place you squeeze these over your tacos like the amazing slices of heavenly existence that they are so imagine strips of fresh grilled steak spritzed in lime juice on a taco like the one above or pork meat with a tangy marinade spitroasted and shaved off paper thin seconds before it falls on your taco or ground spanish sausage or well ill spare you the point isnt just that its amazing its that its a totally different meal than anglo tacos
food,not_removed,flour tortilla and cheddar cheese
food,not_removed,sweet jesus thanks for the comprehensive answer i feel like ive hardly had any authentic mexican tacos in my life and im going to be needing themnow
food,not_removed,yes please get yourself an authentic mexican taco i was born and bred in texas and i love me a good inauthentic ground beef tex mex taco with cheddar cheese and heaps of sour cream but nothing compares to a freshly prepped plate of from a local taqueria

food,not_removed,yummy pasta
food,not_removed,looks awesome my only nitpick is the stems on the strawberries maybe if they were cut off and the pointy end sticking out
food,not_removed,woah wtfits amazing even though i agree the stems should be taken out
food,not_removed,i know ill get downvoted for this and im sure the cake is delicious but his looks like something from rpopping or that one where people are afraid of little groups of holes together

food,not_removed,wow thats a nice work of art 🤗
food,not_removed,i would never want to cut it it looks great
food,not_removed,stems making this cake looks cool although maybe fresh strawberries with green not yelow stems would look more favorably in my score board that the best cake i seen so far send it to xxxxxxxxxxxx
food,not_removed,i love this my ocd however is saying that all the strawberry stems should be pointing the same way
food,not_removed,that is grotesque it looks like some sickening fungus or undersea polyp growing on a surface i love it

food,not_removed,i kind of did it by feel the goose pie had leeks onions a carrot celery garlic and mushrooms and fresh parsley and chives as well as thyme and basil with a goose broth and the goose meat was chopped super fine the pie crust was a basic pastry dough the fries were thin slices off the jack olantern which i then dipped in egg and then a seasoned flour and breadcrumb mixture and deep fried in veg oil at for like minutes

food,not_removed,did your daughter want sushi and you knew she probably wouldnt like the real thing and you came up with this alternative instead
food,not_removed,theres a small chain sushi place here in ohio that makes pbj sushi with rice its so delicious

food,not_removed,i love this
food,not_removed,sushi style is what i think we should be calling things like this its cool and all but lets not call everything in a roll sushi
food,not_removed,needs soy sauce and wasabi
food,not_removed,is the rice on the inside i thought sushi was classified by the presence of vinegared rice its really cute though i used to have ridiculous standards for my pbjs so my dad had to get creative
food,not_removed,but you enjoy the finger things in life
food,not_removed,i found success with pbj because it is just a spread and rolled easily i am curious to see it with ham and cheese
food,not_removed,she loves sushi and pbj so i thought id combine them
food,not_removed,fusian is the name nice fast casual sushi place
food,not_removed,thanks but im a mom
food,not_removed,i think its white bread
food,not_removed,youre missing the point
food,not_removed,use cream cheese instead
food,not_removed,oh even with nutella it would be amazing maybe with american cheese and thin ham it will be easier to roll i will try once i can buy those items
food,not_removed,username checks out
food,not_removed,try cream cheese and strawberry jelly its so good
food,not_removed,im thinking nutella with banana and strawberry ill slice the banana in long thin strips to resemble the cucumber and strawberry to resemble ahi
food,not_removed,it should be okay then eating an animal that is eating plant protein
food,not_removed,so i made this braised bottom round risotto trying to come close to the i dont know why but the risotto at coopers hawk is so much richer than mine they include white truffle oil which i dont have and have never cooked with can white truffle oil make a huge difference i know how to make risotto i just dont know why my risotto isnt as rich as theirs i believe it has something to do with the beef sauce mine doesnt have the rich beefy flavor theirs does and i dont know why i reduced mine pretty far my beef sauce seems more runny if that makes any sense where as their sauce is a little bit thicker not super thick but not watery like mine for those wondering here is the short version of what i did cut up a bottom round roast as it was a cheap but big piece of beef into decent sized chunks pan seared them with a little bit of oil and deglazed with chianti put all the beef into a crock pot with chianti and beef stock with some butter and minced garlic and cooked that for hours once all the beef was nice and tender i strained it all out and reduced the beef stock in a big pan i then made my risotto as i have many times before minced onion cooked in pan until translucent add garlic add rice add white wine start stirring in hot chicken stock until the rice is cooked
food,not_removed,there is only one way to start a risotto never olive oil o butter so tired of great chefs going around teaching fake recipes einstein said you cannot teach what you do not know study history and you will know your recipes
food,not_removed,try adding some demi glacé to your sauce you need the gelatin content to get that really rich consistency you could try making it at home but it is not a home kitchen friendly httpwwwescoffieronlinecomhowtomakedemiglace alternatively buy a high quality one to beef up your sauce or add beef base and some powdered gelatin if you want to do it on a budget
food,not_removed,use beef stock instead of chicken stock also toast your rice before you add the stock to it pound of butter to every three cups of rice medhigh heat for minutes nothing but butter and rice in your pan keep it moving constantly so nothing burns its a chore but it will starve the rice and cause it to really soak up all that stock and also helps with that creamy consistency at this point you can store your rizzo in something airtight for about five days to finish bring it back up to temp with anything you want to add to the dish meatsveggieswhateva and add some heavy cream and a bit or a lot of a cheese of your choice
food,not_removed,great work here is what i would try get some beef bones preferably from the same cut and make the stock use that instead of chicken stock it will work a lot more harmoniously stock is simple and you can freeze them for everything in the future i would cook the stock by boil heaps bones in lots of water for a few hours its really that simple you could also experiment with flavours brown the bones first add half an onion add a bay leaf give it a go you can cook the stock down to increase intensity so you can have more flavour in the same liquid you can do this with chicken and pork as well regarding truffle oil it wont increase richness it will enhance aroma drizzling some extra virgin olive oil on risotto is good as well by contrasting flavours you can emphasis the base flavour experiment and let your taste buds tell you what to do
food,not_removed,seems like a weird combo
food,not_removed,for best results serve with rice with rice
food,not_removed,cooking is what i do when i have a bad day too hope you feel better
food,not_removed,is the fig incorporated into the dish besides as a garnish while plated beautifully the fig seems random if its just uses as a garnish
food,not_removed,cooking is my hobby it always makes me feel better too best wishes looks delicious
food,not_removed,do you eat just the inside of those green figs
food,not_removed,sorry you had a terrible day
food,not_removed,my gf loved it something about cooking for friends and family puts me at ease i think my bad day is over thanks
food,not_removed,if i was cooking a course prix fixe menu with figs as the theme i might have done this but since i was just making food for me and my gf and i wanted leftovers to be used for other dishes i didnt do this i did exactly what youre talking about httpimgurcomakeknu with citrus the funny thing is i got criticized for doing it silly internet the fig was more than garnish it was delicious and went well with the rest of the dish kinda like how jelly goes well on bread with peanut butter without having to incorporate jelly into the other components
food,not_removed,thanks it came out great and my day got better
food,not_removed,i eat everything but the stem
food,not_removed,thanks im feeling great now new day

food,not_removed,stuffed with what op
food,not_removed,i worked at a grocery store and was bringing home on sale steak for dinner nights a week so i wanted to try something new at the time its good for an occasional thing not everyday though
food,not_removed,listed in comments
food,not_removed,gonna have to agree with homeboy up there steak isnt a flavor vessel protein like chicken or pork and im not sure you can get the stuffing cooked without overcooking the steak ie past mid rare 😃
food,not_removed,dont get me wrong this isnt my go to i prefer a nice medium rare steak with nothing but some salt and pepper but i would rather try and get creative every now and then instead of having the same thing over and over again
food,not_removed,wasnt hating on it just putting in my two cents in my opinion its important to learn fundamentals before getting creative because that provides understanding in flavor profiling and ingredient knowledge you dont have to do the saltpepper pan seared steak but you can also start to learn more about cooking by taking on new recipes involving steak steak diane beef wellington begin learning red wine reductions and port demis things like again not trying to lecture or condescend but a stuffed steak that isnt a rolled flank or roast might turn eyebrows
food,not_removed,yeah i know you arent hating on it just trying to justify i guess i do love a good red wine reduction goes great with some shallots and mushrooms havent tried the wellington or diane though ill make those my next ventures
food,not_removed,very colorful nice photo
food,not_removed,how did you manage to cook it perfectly without browning at all
food,not_removed,you had me at wood
food,not_removed,thank you
food,not_removed,low and slow is the way to go keep it on medium low usually setting on most ovens and use butter
food,not_removed,no tomatoes just three different colors of pepper ham is wrapped up inside
food,not_removed,assuming you got this from caseys corner i would guesstimate we always get the dining plan so im not sure if a drink is included in the regular meal im going to assume no if the drink it included i would change my guess to
food,not_removed,theme park food is not very good just expensive
food,not_removed,regular drinks each foot long chilicheese hot dog w fries foot long mac cheese hot dog w fries total before tax
food,not_removed,ill guess
food,not_removed,xd that was my first thought ill say however im very impressed with the quantity
food,not_removed,plus drinks so plus tax
food,not_removed,thats exactly what i was wondering disney is sooo expensive im guessing around bucks for that
food,not_removed,ill answer tomorrow to allow more guesses
food,not_removed,my guess was anybody know how disney justifies charging like this for their food
food,not_removed,you cant get food anywhere else unless you leave the park so they basically just rob you blind for hotdogs worth and frozen fries
food,not_removed,nice how did you make the broth
food,not_removed,roll up pork belly tie off braise in soy sake mirin garlic shallot ginger until super tender cool slice once cooled to get cool rolly look carefully reheat in braising liquid bam braising liquid here also turns into delicious fried rice sauce with a little corn starch
food,not_removed,how do these all look so good
food,not_removed,looks amazing how did you prepare the pork belly ive never seen it in a swirl like that before
food,not_removed,can we have an actual breakdown of the recipe please
food,not_removed,best mr noodle ive ever seen
food,not_removed,your picture made me go get ramen for lunch today lol
food,not_removed,this look so yummy this would be nice for lunch right now
food,not_removed,i always make broth by putting tomato soup in a pot and heating it up
food,not_removed,thats just hot tomato soup
food,not_removed,so the base is tomato soup
food,not_removed,lol we got a live troll here
food,not_removed,ooooh that looks so good recipe
food,not_removed,ingredients eggs cups white sugar cup vegetable oil tsp vanilla extract cups apples peeled and diced cups allpurpose flour tsp salt tsp baking powder cup of brown sugar mixed with cinnamon it varies person to person as to what flavor you want to stand out the most instructions preheat oven to grease the loaf pan beat eggs sugar vegetable oil adn vanilla extract in a mixing bowl mix flour salt and baking powder in a separate bowl and mix it in with the first mixture use half of the mixture to coat the bottom of the loaf pan then use half of the brown sugar mixture to add a layer in between add half of the diced apples spread evenly use the rest of the baking mixture to cover the apples completely add the rest of the brown sugar mixture to cover the baking mixture use the rest of the apples on top making sure that all air pockets and holes have been sealed bake for minutes letting it cool for once it is out of the oven we bake apple bread orange cranberry bread and banana bread throughout the week and the apple is by far the most flavorpacked option of the bunch enjoy
food,not_removed,so tired of this nobody that makes one ever says if its good or not
food,not_removed,looks good but that slice of tomato looks thicker than the burger itself lol
food,not_removed,httpsimgurcomacczlq it was definitely good the homemade salsa gave the whole thing a very fresh taste although it had almost no spice to it
food,not_removed,where is everyone pulling these bobs burgers recipes from is there a cook book specific for bobs burgers am i missing out ☹️
food,not_removed,i love bobs burgers but the idea of a cookbook for burger toppings is stupid how uncreated do you need to be to not come up with your own ideas for toppings honest question does it even have recipes for the burger patty itself or just give you a list of toppings to put on a burger
food,not_removed,i assumed that people were reconstructing these from the show then i found out that theres a cook book still fun but disappointing at the same time
food,not_removed,i cooked the baby you can chive my car burger for new years eve dinner and it was positively delicious
food,not_removed,sorry should have mentioned it was awesome the poblano salsa verde that the recipe had me make was spicy yet sweet thanks to the tomatillos it required no other condiments other than the salsa suuuuper good and i highly recommend it for a person who usually eats their burger plain and dry to see if it surprises them when they like it
food,not_removed,yeah that slice is rather thick
food,not_removed,with rice
food,not_removed,its literally in the picture right behind the burger
food,not_removed,yes it called the bobs burgers burger book
food,not_removed,its at barnes noble and worth every penny considering the creator and writers of the show made the book alongside two professional chefs and the youtube kid who inspired the whole thing
food,not_removed,the cookbook was inspired after a youtubepersonstarted making the burgers on his own when the creators of the show found out they hired two professional chefs to meet up with the kid and work out the kinks in his recipes then they made the cookbook the introduction in the front explains it alland in that wonderful loren bouchard sense of humor so dont be disappointed
food,not_removed,i cant wait to do that one my brother in law who got me the book for xmas hates pickles but im hoping my tiny wheels will inspire him to change his mind about them
food,not_removed,yeahthe book said thick sliced tomato and i guess i got a little carried away with my cutting my wife and brother in law ended up taking theirs off and cutting it in half haha
food,not_removed,yes but is it a book dedicated to bobs burgers
food,not_removed,thanks for your sane answer
food,not_removed,im pretty sure the picture and font imply that
food,not_removed,ha no problem good ol internet
food,not_removed,is your ice cream on fire
food,not_removed,lol yeah it came out flaming
food,not_removed,that looks horribly dry
food,not_removed,all about trial and error dude keep trying if this wasnt what you hoped for
food,not_removed,dude min at
food,not_removed,what an oddly butchered piece of meat the butcher removed half of the eye of the ribeye
food,not_removed,what a sin to torture the beautiful ribeye like that please visit rsousvide to see pictures how steak should be cooked
food,not_removed,actually this one was made with sous vide i probably broiled it for a little too long after also this side looks a little over cooked but the other side looked better
food,not_removed,good for you looks fantastic
food,not_removed,you get a muffin tin cook bacon to about halfway doneness wrap it into each cup crack an egg into there i sprinkled diced chives and garlic on top put the tin in a preheated degree oven min for runny for well done find your preference in between let em sit for a few minutes and they should slide right out i put some yellow bird hot sauce on top afterwards
food,not_removed,thank ya
food,not_removed,hell yea id go thick cut for this also this was my first attempt if you find a good time for it to be in the oven and come out kind of medium ish lemme know i will mess around with the recipe a bit
food,not_removed,could of used a few more chips
food,not_removed,could have
food,not_removed,how many drinks did you have before you posted this
food,not_removed,i was once too
food,not_removed,funny that nothing about outback steakhouse or its food is australian just like fosters beer just a scam
food,not_removed,this is what an adult with the palate of a child orders when dining out

food,not_removed,oh my god i just realized this said store cookies not stoner cookies both apply
food,not_removed,can confirm deffenetly stoner cookies edit i thought you said stoner
food,not_removed,cup tbs sugar cup butter eggs cup milk cup flour tsp baking powder tsp baking soda tsp lemon juice tsp nutmeg or all spice tsp salt preheat oven to cream the butter and sugar add eggs and milk add dry ingredients i ended up using more flour but am not quite sure how much additional i put in while kneading and rolling out remove dough its gonna be sticky flour your working surface knead in enough flour to make dough workable roll out to about thick or thinner whatever you prefer cut whatever shapes you want bake for minutes frosting cups powdered sugar tbs honey corn syrup or maple syrup tbs milk tsp lemon juice mix and spread onto cookies
food,not_removed,i should have been more cleardefinitely delicious especially if you like cookies that arent super sweet
food,not_removed,cup tbs sugar cup butter eggs cup milk cup flour tsp baking powder tsp baking soda tsp lemon juice tsp nutmeg or all spice tsp salt preheat oven to cream the butter and sugar add eggs and milk add dry ingredients i ended up using more flour but am not quite sure how much additional i put in while kneading and rolling out remove dough its gonna be sticky flour your working surface knead in enough flour to make dough workable roll out to about thick or thinner whatever you prefer cut whatever shapes you want bake for minutes frosting cups powdered sugar tbs honey corn syrup or maple syrup tbs milk tsp lemon juice mix and spread onto cookies

food,not_removed,all those knife strokes
food,not_removed,this potatoes seem sooo delicious😍
food,not_removed,looks delicious you should use parchment paper next time instead of aluminum foil the cheese wont stick to it and it makes everything easier
food,not_removed,op thanks for posting this looks delicious can you share the recipe and most importantly how in the world did you get those perfect thin slices thanks
food,not_removed,never saw potatoes with red skin

food,not_removed,its so delicious imgur refuses to load and share the goodness
food,not_removed,yum
food,not_removed,whatd you just say i have a cheesy baked potato dreet
food,not_removed,but there are turnips in it
food,not_removed,hi guys the link below is the recipe i mostly followed used a mexican cheese blend instead of parm httpscrummylanecomminigarlicparmesanhasselbackpotatoes i will definitely try this recipe again but with bacon and sour cream to make a mini loaded potato
food,not_removed,can you include ingredients used and oven temptime thanks
food,not_removed,id love that if i wasnt one of those people where cheese and other milk products totally fucked up my face stop teasing
food,not_removed,you didnt peel the potatoes
food,not_removed,it looks like a group of people came on your potatoes and then sprinkled on some herbs
food,not_removed,wow we have a mafaking gordon ramsay here chop potatoes and sprinkle i with cheese yeaaaaah just put more cheese on it no offence dude but this is mediocre at best
food,not_removed,i am chinese i dont like cheese
food,not_removed,she must be really au gratin
food,not_removed,god i laughed so loud at this comment all the way to the belly thank you
food,not_removed,priorities
food,not_removed,nice color
food,not_removed,i am honored lol
food,not_removed,wrap them around bacon orwrap bacon around them ororstuff bacon in between the splits
food,not_removed,thats the sexiest thing i have seen today and my house has mirrors
food,not_removed,sane idea also what if we before wrapping in bacon or adding the cheese but after cooking them to soften dip them in jalapeño juice yes from canned jalapeños🙄 then add topping and pop under the broiler 👍🏼
food,not_removed,that would be the ultimate heart disease meal
food,not_removed,oh you sexy bastard
food,not_removed,that would defeat the purpose of slitting them
food,not_removed,now i dont do the bacon part which sounds amazing btw but when i make these i put slices of garlic between the potato slices
food,not_removed,guys cookbook chapter add bacon to absolutely everything
food,not_removed,do mean wrap bacon around them
food,not_removed,you want to wrap the potatoes around the bacon wrap them around the bacon around the bacon
food,not_removed,not everything needs to have bacon l
food,not_removed,do hasselback potatoes really have cheese on it i havent had it for a really long time so i might be wrong though
food,not_removed,i never knew what this dish was called i just started doing it because i was disgusted at how much potato got thrown away after baking it traditionally in aluminum foil i actually enjoy eating the skin it just isnt practical when that is all there is left
food,not_removed,hasselback stop you disgust me with your ignorance
food,not_removed,unless these have been covered and cooked id say those potatoes are still hard
food,not_removed,i would blow that wait what
food,not_removed,plant potahtoes wait for harvest season harvest potahtoes wash potahtoes cut them of the way through fetch pan oil pan place potahtoes in pan sprinkle with herbs and grate cheese over them place pan inside preheated oven at ° c and bake for minutes i guess
food,not_removed,probably boiled for minutes then blanched slit and then lightly covered in some oil and seasoned tossed into the oven for only minutes considering how light they are taken out had cheese poured on them then back into the oven for a few minutes until the cheese is melted idk i dont have a recipe or anything im just spit balling
food,not_removed,wtf is that sub all abooot i couldnt make heads or tails of it
food,not_removed,bacon would be better
food,not_removed,ill up vote bacon every day
food,not_removed,needs more jpeg i am a bot
food,not_removed,oh wow thanks for the tip d
food,not_removed,they are baby potatoes
food,not_removed,bacon 🥓
food,not_removed,hard cheese is good to go
food,not_removed,if you can direct me to these cheesejizzers of which you speak id go gay for that
food,not_removed,im surprised youre the only one who has mentioned this
food,not_removed,he never said it didnt still look delicious so closed minded
food,not_removed,no offence dude but no offence ok
food,not_removed,im sure this sub is a parody just look at the top comments sexy bacon sexy etc about half of the top posts here are very simple junk food
food,not_removed,wow we have a mafaking gordon ramsay here chop potatoes and sprinkle i with cheese yeaaaaah just put more cheese on it no offence dude but this is mediocre at best wow who lit the fuse on your tampon
food,not_removed,love the fact that anyone that expresses their opinion gets downvoted to shits this is gotta be the most cancerous subreddit anyone ever ate wedges now put cheese on that let it cool down and now you have a dry gooey paste of potatoes and cheesy enjoy
food,not_removed,im american i dont like year old eggs
food,not_removed,what would you do instead
food,not_removed,go take a nap then you will feel better
food,not_removed,no her picture was cheesier than this
food,not_removed,no stuff them between bacon or stuff them in bacon sliced bacon is for bitches get a slab and stuff it with this shit
food,not_removed,both
food,not_removed,we all arent sane d
food,not_removed,that was kinda smooth
food,not_removed,whoah next level shit what else you do this too have you done this before
food,not_removed,worth it
food,not_removed,dude you cant say stuff like that in this sub
food,not_removed,wrong
food,not_removed,fakenews
food,not_removed,i n c o r r e c t
food,not_removed,ಠಠ
food,not_removed,actually theyre called hasselback because they were a favourite of david hasselhoffs who would rub them on his back before eating them to ensure an even tan
food,not_removed,i mean we call chicken salad with apples in it waldorf after a specific hotel that made the dish they made something good enough to copy around the world so it gets named after them
food,not_removed,so if it isnt cooked in that particular restaurant it cant use that name
food,not_removed,y
food,not_removed,these are elizabeth hasselbeck potatoes
food,not_removed,ok
food,not_removed,i bet the fucker didnt see that wave of downvotes coming his way amirite guys
food,not_removed,what do you mean
food,not_removed,digest ftfy
food,not_removed,youre hard wink wink scratches neckbeard adjusts fedora
food,not_removed,arent we all
food,not_removed,yeah am i the only one seeing a money shot of the potatoes
food,not_removed,so many reasons this should be the top rated comment of the day smartassery folksy word play clear directions no dicks gettimg stuck anywhere and downplay of potato genius ish i guess
food,not_removed,just cut the raw potato not all the way to the bottom season it and bake it the slits open up about halfway through so you can brush some melted butter in there
food,not_removed,im with you dude what the holy hell is going on there
food,not_removed,random but why the last line there are you really a bot genuinely asking
food,not_removed,is hasselbackspotatis are you blindstyre
food,not_removed,i swear im one of those just give me a call
food,not_removed,right votes
food,not_removed,yeah haters
food,not_removed,this is gotta be the most cancerous subreddit and yet youre still here
food,not_removed,it is delicious but it need bean sauce and rice mix directly eatchinnese can not accept also
food,not_removed,he mustve been baked
food,not_removed,is this why you get up in the morning this alone is this is your sole purpose
food,not_removed,wat
food,not_removed,yes i am crazy for bacon
food,not_removed,actually ive never made the original style or the modified with other cheese or bacon style took some cooking classes years ago and the chef had me practice tournee style on sweet potatoes yeah i was confused too then i had to find a recipe to use them went hasslebackesq style but with clarified butter nutmeg roasted garlic parmesan cheese panko bread crumb salt and fresh cracked pepper just picked up a bag of yukon golds me thinks its time to try garlic jalapeño bacon variety from above
food,not_removed,huh you learn sun tan new everyday
food,not_removed,which is absolutely fine if youre making a chicken salad with apples then call it waldorf if thats what its called however if you were to make a chicken salad with another fruit and perhaps or other ingredients in it then its not a waldorf anymore which is my point edit a word
food,not_removed,no you misunderstood what im saying is that if you arent making hasselback potatoes dont call it hasselback i mention the resturant to put emphasis on that its a specific dish prepared in a specific way not a overarching technique of slicing potatoes that you can slap on everything as some sort of label thats it
food,not_removed,wrong hasselback potatoes are also supposed to have breadcrumbs and almond chips on them however what we see on the pic is still not hasselback potaotes
food,not_removed,well he who isnt joshua did not make any fucking sense
food,not_removed,no check for your friends here in the comments
food,not_removed,thank you very much kind lady who may or may not be in london uk
food,not_removed,i mean i couldnt find any consistency with it it was like looking at a very smooth and bumpy road
food,not_removed,true ma dude
food,not_removed,look at the post history its either a bot or a very dedicated human with an incomprehensible amount of free time
food,not_removed,ive seen this shit on main page
food,not_removed,or smashed
food,not_removed,what did it say
food,not_removed,bacon i think
food,not_removed,youre a gift for us gluttons
food,not_removed,good point
food,not_removed,what are the core ingredients of a hasselbeck potato out of curiosity then i assume it goes beyond just ridges and cheese
food,not_removed,im confused by all the doot doots im a bot etc stuff especially when they pull a specific line and quote it and then do it makes me think this particular instance is a dedicated human
food,not_removed,ive seen this shit on main page k
food,not_removed,taters
food,not_removed,undertaker dude
food,not_removed,bacon i know

food,not_removed,jazz has become my all time favorite apple i love an apple thats always crunchy and never soft or pasty the crisp is key for me and the jazz has the perfect balance of a little bit of sour with a medium level of sweet cut it up with cinnamon and its a perfect dessert
food,not_removed,could you please contribute some tasting notes for each ive never had the pleasure of being acquainted with any of these varieties
food,not_removed,envy is epic too
food,not_removed,love spaetzle
food,not_removed,spaetzel is so good i dont think to make it often enough thanks for the inspiration
food,not_removed,i read spaetzel in an abruptly angry german voice
food,not_removed,massive upvote for the spaetzle
food,not_removed,i do too
food,not_removed,cold or hot smoked and what type of wood
food,not_removed,brining is amazing for producing the most moist chicken especially when you are putting flavor into it with a sauce
food,not_removed,hot smoked in the oven with a metal pan indirect heat a mix of hickory and oak chips
food,not_removed,agreed
food,not_removed,how did the monkfish pate taste did it smell
food,not_removed,so overall it was good it was definitely a challenging morsel to eat and one was plenty the monkfish pate had some texture to it it was not as creamy as i was expecting if i remember correctly the closest flavor profile of the monkfish pate might be lobster or crab tomalley it had a strong flavor but with all the other competing flavors especially the salty roe and the creamy sauce it was like having a true taste of the sea id order it again but only eat oneone is enough
food,not_removed,mashed potatoes baked mac and cheese roll with butter in the middle and contra fried steak this is how you cook in the south and fuck calories
food,not_removed,want to share
food,not_removed,and the rest of it please
food,not_removed,that is awesome great job
food,not_removed,this time its honey mustard sautéed chicken ham chunks shiitake mushrooms orange bell pepper diced up tomato and red onion covered with spinach mild cheddar and mozzarella sauce is private selection rosé cant wait to dig into this one
food,not_removed,this looks good only because im stoned just sayin
food,not_removed,rfood while stoned is dangerous business
food,not_removed,down vote for not posting the recipe
food,not_removed,looks a bit like a fetus bet it tastes lovely though
food,not_removed,they look amazing😍
food,not_removed,these look so good would happily gorge myself on these all day long recipe
food,not_removed,would eat
food,not_removed,this is one of the specials from a restaurant i ran a couple years ago its pork belly rillette on crostinis with a little slaw made from micro greens that i grew at the restaurant also a few cherry tomatoes and radish
food,not_removed,looks wonderful
food,not_removed,oh i read the name of the dish wrongi thought you were playing a dangerous game of guess which piece was undercooked
food,not_removed,haha whats spatzel
food,not_removed,hahamy form of spelling spaetzle because my form makes more sense 😉
food,not_removed,sorry we are being over run with spam channels from youtube and only allow certified official cooking channels channels of celebrity chefs or otherwise previously approved channels no offense but we had to draw the line thanks for your content and we look forward to more

food,not_removed,i like them
food,not_removed,leeks have much gentler flavour than na onion for the same volume leeks are a lovely vegetable for soup stir fry garnishes just about everything but theyre much more subtle than an onion

food,not_removed,all guacamole is vegan unless its made wrong
food,not_removed,cutting those tomatoes like a noob was waiting for an accident
food,not_removed,vegan is a buzzword i guess
food,not_removed,my thought exactly when is guacamole not vegan 😐😐 i guess if some jabroni adds bacon
food,not_removed,tortilla chips are always vegan unless they have some sort of flavouring on it very simple ingredients and fried in peanut or vegetable oil i have never seen them fried in tallow or anything other than a vegetable oil
food,not_removed,this sub seems to downvote to hell anything that says vegan in the title may not be the best word to use
food,not_removed,or dried salt fish yech guacamole is sacred although it has variations
food,not_removed,ahh pizza rolls no matter how many times you burn your tongue you will still try eating one right out of the microwave

food,not_removed,omg ive never had okonomiyaki but its definitely on my list
food,not_removed,i ate this the other day in kyoto japan my japanese friend said it was the best hes ever had we just found the place down some back alley and we just walked in and gave it a try
food,not_removed,do you remember where the restaurant was or its name im heading their soon
food,not_removed,vegan huh
food,not_removed,isnt that all meat
food,not_removed,vegetarians do not eat meat fish or poultry vegans in addition to being vegetarian do not use other animal products and byproducts such as eggs dairy products honey leather fur silk wool cosmetics and soaps derived from animal products
food,not_removed,tbh guys this meal was delicious and i didnt post to start a big vegan debate
food,not_removed,im forever so disappointed in average human intelligence when i see so many if youre vegan why would you eat fake meat or if youre vegan why not just eat veggies comments for posts like this we can eat literally anything we want thats not actually made from animal products we are allowed to admit we like meatlike things and enjoyed the taste of meat and dairy i eat both fully real vegan meals lol and fake meat when i want to some fake meat tastes good some not so much just like other food i dont mean this as a general remark on anyone who eats meat but when someone seriously cant grasp this concept i just think theyre kind of a bonehead edit i forgot to say this looks great btw op i wish there was asian food like this but with all fake meats in my city
food,not_removed,made from soy protein
food,not_removed,its mock meat guys
food,not_removed,im pretty sure the op means ducktm chickentm and squidtm that duck and chicken look like not those things look at the texturecolor on the top slice of duck doesnt actually look like duck breast to me i suspect theyre tvp it always amazes me the lengths that vegansvegetarians go to in order to pretend that their food isnt veganvegetarian as if calling tvp something else makes it taste like something other than shit
food,not_removed,am i missing something
food,not_removed,do they drive menthol cars as well
food,not_removed,if a vegan goes downtown are they still within their dietary limitations
food,not_removed,meat tastes good lets face it i just dont like to exploit animals for my own gain
food,not_removed,why pretend to eat meat
food,not_removed,i love your user name gyoza are my fave
food,not_removed,why eat veggies or eat meat whats the point of eating veggies dressed up as meat
food,not_removed,til that there is such a thing as textured vegetable protein
food,not_removed,to not finance the animal cruelty thats rampant in the industry while still enjoying food that you might like at least thats one reason
food,not_removed,thank you me too
food,not_removed,i never understood it myself
food,not_removed,that doesnt explain why youre eating meat analogs i get the protest aspect but why use plant based protein to simulate meat why not just make vegetarian dishes without the extra work of trying to make it look like cooked animal products
food,not_removed,why thats thats genius
food,not_removed,the yorkshire puddings look good but the chicken looks a little bland did you season it at all
food,not_removed,mmm green chile which reminds me its almost hatch chile season
food,not_removed,please mail now yum
food,not_removed,as a new mexican living in oregon you have my undying jealousy
food,not_removed,isnt that an enchilada
food,not_removed,also id like to know what that plate is in the upper right corner looks like carne asada fajitas except not on a skillet
food,not_removed,cruces native here im sorry bud but andales is miles from being the best new mexican food id say a green chili cheeseburger from blakes lotta burger is a far more suitable candidate then the whitewashed version of new mexican food that andales makes
food,not_removed,the consistency of that sauce tells me this isnt the best nm food in the world so much cream cheese is a travesty centralnorthern nm rep
food,not_removed,yas
food,not_removed,i still have like bags in my freezer i need to finish before the harvest gets here
food,not_removed,if only i was in las cruces to mail it to you we used to eat here once a week
food,not_removed,i dont know why youre getting downvotes for simply asking a question maybe someone who knows more about mexican food than i do can go into more detail but in my understanding an enchilada is made with corn tortillas and then baked with the sauce whereas a burrito in this case a smothered burrito is a giant flour tortilla stuffed with meat and rice and sometimes beans whatsup httpsfreebirdscom and not baked the sauce on the outside is optional but who wouldnt want it smothered in green chile sauce youll never see a single platesized enchilada and if you do tell me where i can find one
food,not_removed,no enchilada but they have amazing enchiladas at this restaurant they use the green chile cheese sauce in their enchiladas which make it more special typical enchiladas have a green chile cause that doesnt have cheese
food,not_removed,it is tacos a very traditional mexican style of tacos they cook the meet in a disco and its so flavorful and juice if i wasnt obsessed with the burrito is get the taco plate for sure
food,not_removed,southern new mexico does it better i highly disagree haha the cheese sauce is the most magical thing in the world
food,not_removed,i didnt buy enough last year we went through it in a month its been a long year to wait
food,not_removed,this burrito has brisket thats been stewed with potatoes and green chile its so good and a new mexican style burrito
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,oh my i wish you had posted this yesterday morning i went to the store yesterday afternoon and so all this weeks meals are planned which means i now i have to wait until next week to make this
food,not_removed,haha wish i could tell you what the cheese sauce is its a guarded recipe it has like types of cheese and i cant pin down which
food,not_removed,why
food,not_removed,see pics above also this is the alton brown method or what i like to call early man discovering meat on coals if fu amazing method
food,not_removed,going full paleo
food,not_removed,😳what are you doing step away from those bottles sir
food,not_removed,ah yes the ancient art of screwing up topshelf scotch by adding well anything really up next how to make your dinner at a michelinrated restaurant better by adding grocery store ketchup
food,not_removed,and somewhere the earth rumbles as the ancient prophecy has been fulfilled
food,not_removed,fucked up twice adding coke all that ice
food,not_removed,even i cant do the ketchup thing but like my lowly coke reaching above its station that would be heinz ketchups most delicious day even if thomas keller is silently sobbing to himself in the kitchen
food,not_removed,that looks incredibly good its impressive that the chocolate isnt running all over the plate and gushing out of the pie
food,not_removed,her husband probably licked it 😂 mine does that all the time
food,not_removed,nice roll
food,not_removed,these soft pretzels were a bit time consuming but completely worth the effort we topped most with salt with cinnamon and sugar and one with mexican seasoning oregano mixgarlic herb mix best pretzels ever recipe httpwwwfoodnetworkcomrecipesaltonbrownhomemadesoftpretzelsrecipe
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,can someone explain this to me
food,not_removed,and you need like lobster crackers to open these the outside is funny and the inside is firm and dense the almonds are white on the inside since theyre raw and unroasted also why you cant eat the skin because its thick and membraney when its raw
food,not_removed,the actual almond is inside that green stuff called the hull
food,not_removed,xd ive never even stopped to think about it

food,not_removed,those tomatoes are so lightly grilled that they look raw
food,not_removed,looks delicious but no significant protein content why not add some tempeh
food,not_removed,i did used almond milk cashews garlic shallot nutritional yeast oregano with salt and pepper to taste
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,thanks as for the recipe i am terrible at writing things down i am trying to get better as i know keeping everything in my mind isnt helpful
food,not_removed,thanks so much
food,not_removed,yup that is the way i like them just grill the bottom for a few minutes so it warms the tomato enough just so you can eat them whole without the fear of burning your mouth
food,not_removed,i have allergies to animal proteins soy and gluten so have been finding creative ways to try and get more protein into meals here i have cashews and almond milk in the crema and then the sliced avocado
food,not_removed,yes it is
food,not_removed,how do you know someone eats meat dont worry theyll tell you
food,not_removed,and how do you make your cashew alfredo crema
food,not_removed,i am terrible at writing recipes down however i am trying to get better at it so apologies for not having exact measurements i used two cloves of garlic one shallot two cups of cashews soaked about cup of almond milk handful of nutritional yeast and oregano add water or more almond milk to attain proper texture salt and pepper to taste
food,not_removed,store bought alfredo sauce contain butter and cream which are both dairy products unfortunately

food,not_removed,jjamja
food,not_removed,two of my fave things
food,not_removed,sooooo good anytime im given the option of either of those i want both
food,not_removed,its called jjanmpong its a korean dish for all things korean cooking check out maangchi she simplifies all of the korean dishes that i can think of in both recipe and video form httpwwwmaangchicomrecipejjamppong its a pretty complicated dish with a lot of ingredients if youre looking to buy it you can buy precooked version online or in your korean supermarket or if you want to go to a restaurant you want to look for a koreanchinese restaurant or a korean restaurant that specializes in jjangpong
food,not_removed,tomatoes with garlic red onion fresh chilli and balsamic vinegar on sesame bagel with cream cheese and cheddar topped with fresh coriander and lemon
food,not_removed,we were working with frozen sausage from the deep freeze thawed easily with room temperature water and a little care par cook the potatoes in boiling water for about minutes and drain steam the sprouts for about minutes as well flatten them with a broad knife so that the leaves spread out toss the potatoes and sprouts with the clarified butter and cooked shallot add the thawed sausage and cook until the sausage is done about minutes at depending on your oven it was pretty delicious
food,not_removed,oh man thats the dinner of champions right there add some eggs and youve got breakfast of champs in the morning
food,not_removed,yummy looks great ladyeve
food,not_removed,i have definitely made eggs with venison sausage heres my set upslice up your venison sausage and sear it put it in a small casserole dish with sauteed onions garlic mushrooms tomatoes and peppers seasoned well with salt and pepper bake it for ten minutes at f top with two eggs and bake until the whites are set and the yolks are part way done but still runny you have yourself a full breakfast right there i would say add cheese but i dont cook with cheese because my husband cant eat itthat said this is still amazing without it
food,not_removed,hey thanks were trying to work through the last of our venison as we prepare for this years hunting season
food,not_removed,gahhd lucky man now if only i could get my hands on some real venison id be in business i will definitely be trying this recipe someday
food,not_removed,i only have a few brats left from last year myself cant wait to fill the freezer
food,not_removed,were in bow hunting season right now where we live nothing from this morning unfortunately but im guessing well get something next week we still have a few pounds of ground from last season so worst case scenario i can look forward to making more chili or meatloaf
food,not_removed,ive always loved chicagostyle deep dish pizza its one of my musthave meals every time i visit the city in cooks illustrated featured an article exploring different techniques for creating the incredible crunchy soft and flaky crust that separates superb pizza in this style from the rest i tried it one time when we received the issue and fell in love it was probably the very best that id ever had but it takes hours to make so i havent made it since tonight i decided to ring in the new year with this fabulous food i treated my family to the dish and while we introduced our kids to one of our favorite flickslabyrinth the dough required two rises between the first and second you roll it out flat and spread softened butter before rolling and folding the dough for the second rise in the fridge this step helps create the buttery layers that give the crust that magical texture while the dough is rising i sauteed some onions herbs and garlic before adding crushed tomatoes and reducing them for about minutes to thicken the sauce once its all prepped you add oil to the pan spread the dough like a pie add a few cups of shredded mozzarella cheese topped by the sauce finally i added some sweet italian sausage that i had precooked and a thin layer of freshly grated parmesan reggiano it was totally worth the effort
food,not_removed,the bottom has a thick bread is that what you were trying to do i learned to build chicago pies backwards cheese first raw sausage and last sauce if im adding pepperoni ill put that on last just for looks
food,not_removed,its yummy
food,not_removed,yeah unfortunately the dough was a bit too warm when i spread the butter to create the layers so when i rolled it up for the second rise it mostly blended and wasnt as flaky as i prefer this was cheese first then sauce followed by the sausage
food,not_removed,it looks very light for an espresso are you sure there isnt milk or cream in there
food,not_removed,made my coffee shops look like shit
food,not_removed,for that to be a shot that would have to be a mini marshmallow looks like a short mocha cappucino probably total
food,not_removed,im not really sure what im looking at here is that a marshmallow on a biscuit
food,not_removed,an espresso that actually deserves to be
food,not_removed,guys its a fun drink calm down
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,location
food,not_removed,i wish everyone would take this much pride in what they do beautiful
food,not_removed,what does this run you
food,not_removed,it looks great and yummy but thats not an espresso espresso is just black coffee and thats not black coffee at all
food,not_removed,drooling
food,not_removed,where i need this in my life
food,not_removed,thats a beautiful presentation
food,not_removed,wow
food,not_removed,get ready to get up and walk off those calories
food,not_removed,thats not coffee
food,not_removed,how do you consume this do you take a bite out of the cracker and marshmallow then sip the coffee over the chocolate lip do you dip the cracker or is the scale deceptive and you can fit the cracker and marshmallow entirely in your mouth before drinking it looks pretty i just dont understand how to use it properly
food,not_removed,thats not an espresso is it
food,not_removed,fucking hell that looks amazing i need this in my life
food,not_removed,that aint an espresso they can call it that but its not
food,not_removed,beautiful how can you bear to eat it
food,not_removed,normally im leary about smores flavored stuff but that looks delicious sometimes they just overdo it that looks like the perfect amount of everything
food,not_removed,yumm😍
food,not_removed,damn looks dank onyx is dope always wanted to try it thats definitely a cortado though
food,not_removed,god i want to fuck that
food,not_removed,sooo actual coffee d looks like so much yum
food,not_removed,this is why americans are fat
food,not_removed,nobody needs that hipster shit
food,not_removed,why am i hard
food,not_removed,looks more like a cortado
food,not_removed,as an italian im amazed by his use of the word espresso for that its more close to an ice cream than to a coffee lol
food,not_removed,yep thats a cappuccino shot with tons of sugar on the side i like the less is more rule when it comes to coffee
food,not_removed,even if an espresso should be drunk in less the seconds when brewing ends decorating takes time maybe decoration it prior might be an option but its really not necessary
food,not_removed,right fuck
food,not_removed,right it looks amazing
food,not_removed,youre killin me smalls
food,not_removed,i dont know why youre getting down voted youre english do you know what a smore is
food,not_removed,it definitely deserves to be but im not sure this is looks more like with a option
food,not_removed,not sure if thats cheap or expensive where you are
food,not_removed,onyx coffee lab in bentonville arkansas
food,not_removed,espresso is a method of brewing coffee this is espresso with some other stuff adding other stuff doesnt make it not espresso
food,not_removed,make sure you wear a condom
food,not_removed,its not even an espresso shot anymore
food,not_removed,and prolly thinks bud iceis the nectar of the gods lol
food,not_removed,or as we call them in australia a piccolo latte
food,not_removed,this is the correct answer
food,not_removed,as someone who has had coffee all over the world italians have terrible coffee shots fired
food,not_removed,as an italian im trying to understand how you see a hot liquid in a shot glass as an ice cream which is traditionally a frozen solid and truly question anything you have to say from here on out
food,not_removed,a cappuccino shot isnt a thing a shot of espresso is a shot of espresso you make that into a cappuccino by adding a load of steamed milk and a couple of cm of foam on top if you added different measures of milk youd have a latte or a cortado or a flat white or a macchiato or you could add water and have a long black americano etc you could make any of those drinks again using a ristretto style espresso shot
food,not_removed,how do you know heshe is english
food,not_removed,what does the contraction on smores mean
food,not_removed,ahh yeah i hit up onyx in fayetteville nearly every day
food,not_removed,i thought i recognized that drink
food,not_removed,thank you looks yummy
food,not_removed,oh my gosh i expected it to be made in like california or something not my hometown
food,not_removed,omg what im totally going there next week never thought bentonville would come up
food,not_removed,i came here expecting to see it was from some big city because nothings ever from arkansas but for once im pleasantly surprised
food,not_removed,how much was it
food,not_removed,is that inside a walmart
food,not_removed,espresso is a method of brewing coffee this is espresso with some other stuff adding other stuff doesnt make it not espresso to the italians espresso is coffee not beverage the espresso machine was originally invented to make good coffee not espresso coffee the beans for espresso coffee have been specially roasted and blended longer to produce a unique effect the espresso method of brewing cofee is the ultimate method of extraction heres a good article with examples httpjonsguideorgbesthomeespressomachinereviews
food,not_removed,i am sorry but i dont agree espresso is for sure a method of brewing coffee but an espresso is black coffee brewed that way if you add milk then it is not an espresso it can be café cortado or espresso with milk following your logic tea with milk is also tea but if i order tea i expect tea alone not tea with milk so if i order an espresso i expect a small cup with black coffee brewed in an espresso machine
food,not_removed,i just dont care what could result from that interlude its worth it
food,not_removed,since when do hipsters drink bud ice wtf
food,not_removed,true my boss arguably the best barista in the world mr alex macintyre spent the last week in sicily saying the coffee is way better than rome personally i just got back from melbourne only found a handful of places were the experience was truly what i was expecting other than that i want to head back to berlin for overall high standards across the board
food,not_removed,the chances to drink a bad coffee in it are very very high at least here you pay max euro for a bad coffee so you will be a little less disappointed
food,not_removed,im a huge fan of espresso so i enjoyed all of it i gotta say like of people mixing sugar into their shot grossed me out i tried it once and its not good
food,not_removed,triggered
food,not_removed,what an espresso usually contains coffee what this espresso contains coffee maybe milkcream biscuit chocolate nuts a thing on top i dont know what it is what an ice cream with coffee and cream can contain all the above but the coffeecream is frozen instead of hot do you understand it now
food,not_removed,some shit just looks tasty man leave people alone
food,not_removed,called a cracker a biscuit
food,not_removed,how do you know youre canadian
food,not_removed,called the cookie a biscuit
food,not_removed,its a smore because you always want some more is what i was always told
food,not_removed,so you love giving away your money
food,not_removed,yes if you order espresso you will get espresso if you order a smores espresso you will get a shot of espresso with smores shit im not sure i understand what your point is its still made with espresso saying that for instance an americano is not espresso is perhaps technically correct because its not only espressobut to deny vehemently that its not espresso is alienating since youre clearly attaching a value to the things people add to their drinks
food,not_removed,the fuck is bud ice
food,not_removed,melbourne is very dark roast usually which isnt for everyone sydney has some of the best ive had in the world though very cool that alex macintyre is your boss though ive been meaning to pay a visit but i live a couple of hours away and angels a bit off my normal grid
food,not_removed,coffee in sicily was great but the food is different class
food,not_removed,this is exactly how id expect someone to introduce their boss if their boss was the best barista in the world id also expect them to capitalize the b in barista
food,not_removed,its never about the money its about reaching my caffeine limit for the day at least they used practically burnt beans so they are very low in caffeine
food,not_removed,its horrible isnt it i dont think sugar mixes well with coffee
food,not_removed,aint a cracker a methhead

food,not_removed,that joke was ok years ago now that the obesity epidemic is worldwide it doesnt really make sense
food,not_removed,i was being facetious by the way guys its okay calm down
food,not_removed,well seeds were doing some amazing stuff but its just not really that forgiving so its hard to get a decent brew during a rush unified theory on king st was the only place that was super consistent partly cause the barista was a god among men did some extraordinary cold brew as for macintyres im in on weekdays of this week so come say hi

food,not_removed,im trying to remember if that was a pepper or okra i believe it was a mild green pepper
food,not_removed,considering what
food,not_removed,this was a little while ago but if you mean the northsouth korea conflict everything was fine it was actually during a time when north korea made a threat on south korea i was a bit concerned coming there but my korean friends told me not to worry and that pyongyang made threats like that all the time so in a nutshell i felt safe
food,not_removed,oh i meant the protests and want of resignation of their president for dirty manipulation of power and whatnot
food,not_removed,ahh that has been a huge deal in korean politics lately fortunately i left before the protests began so i didnt experience any of that firsthand

food,not_removed,green egg ham irl
food,not_removed,i recently got into grilling and today i tried my hand at pork steaks a st louis classic i used some generic cajun rub then slathered them with a carolina bourbon mustard sauce
food,not_removed,do you remember what you cooked these to internal temp have never tried pork steaks but these look like they would be really good
food,not_removed,under rated comment of the thread
food,not_removed,whats so special about this big green egg ive seen it a lot lately
food,not_removed,its a cult its a fantastic grill but its also a cult
food,not_removed,yeah pretty much sums it up its a fancy weber grill its made of ceramic though so it retains heat better its actually my dads he smokes briskest and pork butts in it but i grill on it
food,not_removed,would you recommend it for someone buying a grill
food,not_removed,just so people know its not a more expensive weber grill meaning its not like some company took a metal kettle and threw their name on and raised the price tenfold for no reason its expensive yes but a completely different technology and material its worth the price in my opinion and i have a weber kettle as well and love it
food,not_removed,its a really versatile cooking system but they are really expensive i think i mentioned it earlier that its my dads im only so i would not be spending on a grill if it were my decision but if youre looking to drop that kinda cash then by all means
food,not_removed,was not disappointed
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,does that taste as good as it looks
food,not_removed,simple and elegant

food,not_removed,every time i post something someone has something negative to say im about to just quit posting
food,not_removed,welcome to the internet
food,not_removed,i get that but still it takes the same amount of effort to say that looks good as it does to say something shitty for no reason
food,not_removed,people just cant help it people are the worst
food,not_removed,well i agree you get more flies with honey than vinegar they might just be giving an honest opinion it just might not be a positive opinion
food,not_removed,but which one makes you a better cook
food,not_removed,holy crap where did you eat this
food,not_removed,sorry for the last response a restaurant called pizzicletta in flagstaff az
food,not_removed,seems like a lot but thats a healthy salad if eaten for meals
food,not_removed,fat kid salad this is a fit persons dream salad id much rather have the protein and avocado than a bowl of lettuce and vegetables
food,not_removed,those shrimp look so perfectly cooked to me though salads still mean veggies topped with protein cheese and a healthy heap of fries also bacon bits and what the hell croutons too
food,not_removed,no carbs looks healthy to me
food,not_removed,avocado
food,not_removed,omg must have looks pretty healthy to me
food,not_removed,haha i wasnt going for healthy i was shooting for delicious but yeah i could only crush about half of it
food,not_removed,haha well sweet im sorta in shape myself and this definitely seemed like a fat kid salad to me i guess there isnt bacon or anything though haha
food,not_removed,i dont often eat salads so this is what i made haha but thank you the shrimp were perfect too good call
food,not_removed,blackend shrimp and boneless skinless thighs
food,not_removed,thats funny i was looking at it and thinking that i could probably only stomach half of it
food,not_removed,healthy fat and protein loaded salad
food,not_removed,plate for one
food,not_removed,soy ginger dressing is amazing
food,not_removed,it really is
food,not_removed,what kind of cream is that
food,not_removed,its really sexy
food,not_removed,whipped cream save the sugar
food,not_removed,where did you get this and why is that tomato off to the side dont get me wrong it looks delicious but also like someones interpretation of a poboy
food,not_removed,there were about tomatoes across the top and they were overpowering the shrimp which was glazed and cooked perfectly it was definitely a unique poboy but still one of the best i have ever had and i got it at safe harbor restaurant in ponte vedra beach florida we drive the bot right up and sat down
food,not_removed,good looking photo though i was always taught not to cook any kind of tomatobased sauce in a cast iron skillet as the acidity will ruin the metal
food,not_removed,what was the point of the basil
food,not_removed,the metal is not exposed in any way whatsoever because there is a carbon coating to any cast iron ware
food,not_removed,out of times it opens a time warp
food,not_removed,i would´ve added it post oven
food,not_removed,to add flavor
food,not_removed,not sure roasting one basil leaf in the middle of a few chicken parms imparts any notable flavor or aroma
food,not_removed,i hope you post a pic of the roast
food,not_removed,wow hours thats dedication i have trouble deciding what to have for dinner tonight is that the magic number is it better than doing it over night noticeably
food,not_removed,as promised httpimgurcomaldbao
food,not_removed,i will
food,not_removed,actually it isnt hard at allcooking sous vide you cant overcook food and cooking a chuck roast at for hours will give you a normally tough roast as tender as a ribeye you should check it out
food,not_removed,isnt that pretty dangerous or am i missing something not trying to be a smartass i use a sous vide all the time at work and i guess since most of the roast has never been exposed to air its cool is below the hot hold minimum for my area and hours seems like a while to be there
food,not_removed,it takes minutes at to kill any bugs in beef keep it sealed youre fine will give you medium rare
food,not_removed,ah never thought about it that way
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,how to get fired blatant healthcode violations
food,not_removed,this looks super good just looking at it makes me drool
food,not_removed,looking soooo good i want some too
food,not_removed,looks delicious my mouth is literally watering looking at the picture
food,not_removed,this is looking really delicious can you share the recipe also how to cook this delicious food
food,not_removed,blade or flat iron steak sprinkle fresh cracked black pepper salt garlic powder and natural sugar all over steak you can apply these to your taste i personally dont put a lot of sugar shouldnt be detectable when eating again thats a preference of mine set out on counter until its room temperature and you can see it sweat i let it sit on counter for minutes regardless push back far away from puppy if leaving unattended steak doneness is up to the eater i do medium heat flip flip flip flip rest it for about minutes the mango pico tomato onion garlic clove not bulb jalapeno seeded or not unseeded will be warmspicy mango about ounces of small cubed sharp cheddar cheese cup cilantro salt to your taste chop everything up and throw all in bowl except mango stir it up and reserve of mixture add mango to remaining mixture and stirmix in note pico is always better the next day queso heat up block of velveeta cheese shot of milk and add pico without mango add more milk to thin and less to keep thick fries they are frozen premade fries baked follow instructions on package plate it all up however you see fit this is also good with fresh tortillas to make tacos its not a bad thing if queso falls on the meat
food,not_removed,sure pretty bad at typing but will give it a shot ill get it done thing in the morning
food,not_removed,i appreciate your hard work i am glad you shared the recipe
food,not_removed,shit this makes me wanna go in and out right now
food,not_removed,hickory and lamb sound like an awesome combo did you do anything special to the lamb prior to grilling or smoking
food,not_removed,well apparently hickory and lamb doesnt really go together but it was all i had no i just popped it straight onto the barbeque with the smoke box and let it cook on the lowest temperature for about
food,not_removed,that looks so fucking good always gotta have sausage in the gravy well done

food,not_removed,i dont like the idea of putting feta in pumpkin soup
food,not_removed,sugar pie pumpkin green onion tsp allspice tsp nutmeg dash of cinnamon can coconut milk cup chicken broth cup chopped onion garlic cloves salt and pepper feta to taste cut top off pumpkin and cut in half scoop out seeds and pith and set aside brush inside of pumpkin with olive oil and put open side down on a baking sheet and bake in oven on for mins when done scoop out pumpkin from skin and put all of it in a blender in a pot brown onion and garlic until transparent add chicken broth coco milk cooked garlic and onion spices and sp to blender blend on high for minutes or until smooth once blended return to pot on stove simmer for a few minutes for seeds remove seeds from pith and wash dry with towel toss seeds with a little bit of olive oil and spread out on baking sheet and sprinkle with salt bake on for mins serve soup sprinkled with roasted pumpkin seeds a little sprinkle of cracked pepper green onion and feta if youd like to taste pairs well with an oktoberfest beer
food,not_removed,lol sorry just posted it
food,not_removed,yes the husband and i thought it tasted like fall in the same way gingerbread tastes like christmas
food,not_removed,tastes like basic
food,not_removed,yes thats super close we didnt see that one but looked a few to get an idea of what we wanted the curry powder in that sounds like an amazing idea
food,not_removed,yep just a regular yeast bread brushed with a rosemary and kosher salt whole egg wash
food,not_removed,na you can eat them whole really good when toasted
food,not_removed,yeah you can eat them whole just like that you can put spices salt or sugar when you toast them in the oven too

food,not_removed,this isnt by chance from the codfather is it
food,not_removed,uk here i live mins from a chippy so i have one of these every other week so filling
food,not_removed,did you use your hands or did you use knife and forkthis is important
food,not_removed,so are mushy peas just regular peas that are mashed like potatoes or is something else added
food,not_removed,omg
food,not_removed,is that the codfather sc
food,not_removed,whale and chips with a side of mushy peas
food,not_removed,now i want some lightly fried fish filets
food,not_removed,im gonna go out on a limb and just say more tartar sauce please
food,not_removed,i want that now
food,not_removed,im pretty sure they just battered the knife
food,not_removed,standard british snack that
food,not_removed,i ate the largest and best fillet in my life as well but it was in the most unlikely of places benigembla spain small hole in the wall bar in a very small village in the mountains there and they have the best fish and chips why i have no freaking idea but its full on british mushy peas and all and the size of the fillet was at least long freaking huge and delicious
food,not_removed,very good
food,not_removed,golden brown this looks amazing
food,not_removed,yum except for the peasi know its some wierd ass tradition in the uk but theyre gross imho but the fish the chips om nom nom
food,not_removed,i work in a chip shop so id love to know the sizeweight of the fish and where in the uk you got that fish also if you dont mind my asking how much did it cost
food,not_removed,and i thought this was in nz for their love of fush and chups 🤙🏽
food,not_removed,that looks fucking amazing
food,not_removed,beauty
food,not_removed,fish looks like parrot
food,not_removed,amy recommendations for so cal best ive found is olde ship in santa ana of all places but they have a loud band on fridays
food,not_removed,theres a place near me called armstrongs in manchester uk that fry large cods in one giant batter so you have a triple cod its pure artwork
food,not_removed,fuckin right
food,not_removed,yum
food,not_removed,i have a week vacation in april and im seriously considering a road trip from oklahoma to have that same meal the weird thing is im kind of more enticed by the peas than the fish
food,not_removed,one of my favourite meals to have as a treat looks delicious
food,not_removed,mmm thats a lotta fish
food,not_removed,thats just a normal fish from a chippy in yorkshire the special would be twice as big this sized portion of chips would also be considered an insult
food,not_removed,rock out with your cod out
food,not_removed,fucking beautiful
food,not_removed,all i can say is welcome to britain
food,not_removed,we live round the corner from the second best chippy in england in lincoln called mr chippy its fucking ace also recommend harry ramsbottoms in skegness
food,not_removed,that looks yummy last night i had a very sad dinner of fish sticks and peas so this makes me jelly too
food,not_removed,that looks incredible im on a diet and im going to be dreaming about that tonight
food,not_removed,as a murican i can vouch for fish and chips mushy peas are another story mushy peas are what happens when a dude needs to run a snake plague out of ireland not good and happens every so many decades
food,not_removed,i read this entire thread in a british accent
food,not_removed,fuck yo mushy peas
food,not_removed,is baby food a normal side these days edit i guess you guys take your mashed peas seriously
food,not_removed,it was so tasty
food,not_removed,that would require at least twice as much tartar sauce
food,not_removed,that does look really tasty but they really rip you off there the price of fish and chips in most parts of central london is ludicrous
food,not_removed,the little dab of sauce is cute
food,not_removed,ive got to eat that the next time im down in london where was it as long as it wasnt a tourist place
food,not_removed,i think ive been there
food,not_removed,this is correct this is easily smaller than a regular haddock from my local chippy
food,not_removed,dont downvote this guy hes only saying the truth
food,not_removed,looks like i finally have a reason to go to england
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,yes
food,not_removed,thats exactly what i was wondering
food,not_removed,also pricing would be nice
food,not_removed,its this the famous fish and chips if so man it looks delicious
food,not_removed,every other week why not every other day
food,not_removed,fish and chips should be eaten with your hands from paper or with a knife and fork if plated
food,not_removed,ayeverybody
food,not_removed,proper mushy peas are made from dried marrowfat peas soaked in bicarbonate of sodabaking soda overnight then rinsed in fresh water and simmered with some saltsugar until they turn into a mushy gloopy mess some people also add a bit of mint my opinion is that the best way to eat them is with copious amounts of vinegar most people in the uk just buy them from fish and chip shopsrestaurants as an accompaniment to fish and chips or buy tinned mushy peas from supermarkets for home cooked meals they also go well in my opinion as an accompaniment to savoury pies
food,not_removed,mushy peas in general are an abomination
food,not_removed,came here to say exactly this moaar sawss
food,not_removed,i love them especially with mint sauce
food,not_removed,id feel like i was eating baby food
food,not_removed,they look a very odd colour for proper mushy peas
food,not_removed,thank goodness im not the only one never liked peas the thought of mushy peas just turned my appetite off the fish looks amazing though
food,not_removed,it was in the us and it was
food,not_removed,this is a chippy in north charleston sc the owner adam randall is originally from macclesfield england the vulkan ksudach is the ship that catches all of their north atlantic cod they can locate this vessel in live time anywhere in the world more to your point the filets are to ounces each during the holiday season he offers the sea monster which is ounces fish and chips are usd someone mentioned it and yes they do have legit dinaclass curry base for the sauce sarsons is the only vinegar they serve as well as fresh made gravy for the peas and fish the codfather is zagat rated and listed by eater as one of the restaurants you need to eat at in south carolina its off the beaten path in an area that normally is not visited by charleston tourist this is a good thing because locals like me are able to eat whenever i feel like it and it keeps the prices low not bad for a place that has only been opened a little less than a year
food,not_removed,this was in the usa
food,not_removed,im not entirely sure if you are being sectarian or not
food,not_removed,so it was fish and chips
food,not_removed,yeah wtf is with that small smear of tartar sauce
food,not_removed,the chips are tragic as well theres like five what the fuck and that better not be an attempt at tartare sauce i see up there
food,not_removed,i thought it looked familiar
food,not_removed,it was for fish and chips
food,not_removed,yes but theres usually more chips than that
food,not_removed,i think my waistline and wallet would appreciate it more if i didnt
food,not_removed,a chip fork is acceptable if you have a pool of vinegar at the bottom of your traypaper
food,not_removed,thanks ive always wondered that sounds like a great idea to add them to a savory pie
food,not_removed,and they make the best fish chip accompaniment obviously if your going chips only then you need curry sauce
food,not_removed,sorry tinned mushy peas are an abomination to man
food,not_removed,i was thinking cream butter and cheese everything tastes better with cheese in it
food,not_removed,i was at a cider festival in bambury and they were serving deep fried balls of mushy peas heaven
food,not_removed,with lots of malt vinegar for me yum
food,not_removed,i mean its like mashed potatoes just with peas
food,not_removed,they are a very dark green not sure if it is just the picture they also dont seem to be nearly lumpy enough for what i would expect they almost look as though they have had a spin in a food processor
food,not_removed,where for cods sake did you get it
food,not_removed,holy cow ounces that must be an uncut fillet and thats such a low price as well were based in the uk and an extra large ounce fish with chips and a small tub of fresh mushy peas is £ if im ever in that area of the us ill certainly pop by because damn am i interested
food,not_removed,this is a pic of fried flounder fish n chips usually use cod or pollock or some cousin there in source parents own a seafood joint
food,not_removed,fried fish fillet my child gawd cawnt you read the caption what dreary education you must have been given the jesuits i presume
food,not_removed,and this is merica wtf is fish and chips
food,not_removed,dump the peas right on the chips vinegar malt and salt
food,not_removed,thats an amazing price
food,not_removed,wood or plastic mind you i quite enjoy the vinegarpaper mush on my fingers from time to time
food,not_removed,chinese or indian
food,not_removed,httpswwwbritishcornershopcoukbatchelorschipshopmushypeas are a divine food only one of my local chippys makes them better
food,not_removed,that sounds pretty interesting
food,not_removed,i personally am of the view that there is only one brand of mushy peas that is acceptable where i work in scotland the canteen attempts them weekly the results are akin to overcooked marrow fat peas in slime ive had something similar to those in the picture from a chippy and theyre more like a warm pea mousse
food,not_removed,not op but its from a place called the codfather in charleston sc
food,not_removed,pollock its cod or haddock anything else is wrong
food,not_removed,im texan
food,not_removed,i find the wood ones fuckin dangerous splinters for days but they are traditional my local has plastic ones
food,not_removed,damnit thats no closer to me than a salt battery in nyc there has got to be something closer to arizona
food,not_removed,missed the opportunity for the plaice pun
food,not_removed,you sir are correct
food,not_removed,pollock tastes just like cod imo and cod is being overfished like crazy
food,not_removed,sometimes if ive used a wooden chip fork ive kind of licked the wood by this i mean being sensory aware of both the physical presence of said fork but its texture and worse of all taste youre slathering through a paper wrap or a pvc box of fat vinegar and salt pooled spodge of potatoey goodness near the bottom of the bagbox and you taste the wood of the chip fork i have no words for what it is doing to my pallette as i type
food,not_removed,our chippies here in halfax do both chinese chip shop and indian chip shop curry sauces
food,not_removed,mexico is closer
food,not_removed,theres another codfather food truck in los angeles no idea if theyre connected which i guess is closer but probably still not helpful
food,not_removed,as a canadian transplant this is not what i would enjoy as fish and chips its maybe a better than anywhere else around here but not up to scratch so dont feel too bad
food,not_removed,as far as i remember they are pretty much undistinguishable its been a while it is a good idea to reduce cod use i agree all i meant is traditionally it should be cod or haddock or skate in scotland if i remember right but those guys are weird
food,not_removed,but being half british this looks good
food,not_removed,yum never tried this but i want to lol
food,not_removed,pretty sure that fatty chashu is begging to be slurped up like a noodle and not chewed but swished
food,not_removed,a simple dish done well is just as gourmet as a complicated dish imho how about seafood broth with crab filled wontons
food,not_removed,bake it like a french onion soup with a layer of cheese ontop i mean its a soup dish if you add to much to take away from the asparagus and the cream base youre just making a stew filling presentation and accesories to the soup itself may be a priority how about super tiny croissiants that act like a chowder biscuit edit and serve it in a small boot or cowboy hat something with some impact
food,not_removed,the best way to make a soup fancy is to purée it and then run it through a fine mesh sieve its a lot of work but it gives it a perfectly smooth texture that is much more luxurious than a lumpy puréed soup
food,not_removed,asparagus avocado and roast garlic gazpacho with a spring herb and tomato crouton roast and cool garlic cloves skin on use this dish to toast the croutes blanch asparagus blitz asparagus with avocado coriander and mint leaves and vege stock season well use a little lime juice to balance it pass and chill cut your bread into whatever shape you like blanch and peel a tomato blitz with parsley and basil and some evoo brush bread and bake in garlic dish with residual oil til golden seasoning well to serve take tsp of pouring cream and streak across the surface of the soup crouton on the side this would probably taste alright and look ok in a dark bowl
food,not_removed,those look amazing
food,not_removed,if anyone was interested in seeing the cake httpsimgurcomatwzzg
food,not_removed,theyre super tasty we she decided that we should have these as before birthday birthday cupcakes and make chocolate cupcakes with rainbow frosting tomorrow who am i to argue lol
food,not_removed,shes a smart kid
food,not_removed,definitely
food,not_removed,i need details
food,not_removed,more info please cant really tell whats what lol
food,not_removed,wow looks like a dessert
food,not_removed,hi its from a restaurant called mousso in montreal its a sea urchin mousse on a squid ink pie crust topped with edible flowers and gorria peppers
food,not_removed,hi i described the pie in more details in the comment above its from le mousso in montreal
food,not_removed,it does everything at this restaurant even the savory dishes are very well presented i wish i could afford to go eat there more often
food,not_removed,is there uni in the sauce as well sounds pretty decadent
food,not_removed,what it contains
food,not_removed,yes lots of uni in the sauce
food,not_removed,its almost like an alfredo cream butter and lots of uni
food,not_removed,pan on stove medium heat then put a few drops of water next to the slice and cover the pan let it steam for a couple mins
food,not_removed,microwave but put a cup of water in too
food,not_removed,best pizza reference
food,not_removed,add water to it or wet a paper towel and kind of wrap the crust
food,not_removed,toaster oven
food,not_removed,i dont know if this is common but it seems to surprise a lot of people i know but when i have leftover pizza i put it in a resealable bag and that does wonders in my opinion other than leaving it in the pizza box afterwards i put it in the microwave with a small glass bowl of water and the water steams up the air i guess
food,not_removed,microwave
food,not_removed,put it in the microwave
food,not_removed,i watched a video on youtube about the perfect way to reheat pizza on the channel tastemade dont want to explain it wrong so go there
food,not_removed,ya this is the way in my experience it actually makes the crust a little crispier than when it was fresh but in a good way not like shitty and rock hard just watch it and when the cheese starts melting and bubbling its good to go
food,not_removed,botmoderator says i have to say where i found the source this was made at home and i took the picture
food,not_removed,that unmelted cheese on your eggs makes me uncomfortable
food,not_removed,agreed i put the cheese on right before i took the picture though
food,not_removed,and twinkies love you too
food,not_removed,httpgiphycomgifstwinkiestallahasseedmzodtylutuhm
food,not_removed,yup
food,not_removed,i remember the great twinkie shortage of or whenever that was a pack of two twinkies was going for dollars at the local liquor store
food,not_removed,no twinkies are nasty crap sponge and horrible fake cream

food,not_removed,neither would i a prisoner does not deserve luxuries such as this
food,not_removed,its not a luxury an eclair is a luxury no one wants a trailer trash grease muffin
food,not_removed,we let you back in so you could do this comment about your opinion on a twinkie come onego be a redditor and add value to discussions

food,not_removed,it wasnt so much an argument as it was jesting sir
food,not_removed,guys guys guuuuys whaaat is a twinky
food,not_removed,no one said it was an argumentbut it absolutely did not add value like i told you when we reinstated your accountwe monitor comments especially ones that are reported
food,not_removed,looks at image provide by the op shakes head kids these days
food,not_removed,well they are gross so it added that but you can purge the convo if you want
food,not_removed,great dont like the food downvote and move on want to comment and add value to the discussion do that i thinks twinkies add a sustainable value they were defunct as a company came back as a stronger company and are a global brand and they suck as potential member of a diet but their social value far outweighs their food deficiencies
food,not_removed,sono value added by you either huh thanks
food,not_removed,dude no problem im glad i could help hmu next time you want this new thing i discover its called a twinky you might have heard of it apparently some of us wont feed them to prisoners of war
food,not_removed,did you look at the image and the spelling it takes a while for comprehension
food,not_removed,hello i am thy girlfriend and would like to share the recipe that was shared with me it was given to me by a customer who was so happy with my customer service given were not allowed to accept monetary tips she told me that sharing this recipe with me means she really likes me given im new to reddit and sharing is caring i really do feel this dish captured the love that exists between our merging families we were given a bagful of mangos from my boyfriends familys backyardmangotree in kendall likewise my sister brought me a bagful of mangos from a tree in hialeah who actually belongs to our neighbor but we never minded that practically half that tree has overgrown into are yard space to make matters even more interesting theres nothing like an indianmangochutney made using spices from india i did however purchase the nigella seeds off amazon i did quadruple this recipe and it still came out amazing let me know if you have any questions with this condiment the possibilities are endless
food,not_removed,fred meyer grocerry store has an amazing ham im gonna get as a surprise for new years eve it was great when i sampled it
food,not_removed,christmas dinner is ham and cheesy potatoes and a cherry jello concoction with red hots added and celery and walnuts in it sounds icky but its a family tradition and its kinda tasty new years eve dinner is usually steaks on the grill crab legs twice baked potatoes and a veggie new years day dinner is always some kind of pork this year i think well do pulled pork
food,not_removed,our christmas dinners are mostly like a potluck everyone bringsmakes something this year im in charge of desert so im thinking of some sort of trifle but with mascarpone and berries im not sure yet most of my family arent big on large amounts of chocolate a chocolate sauce is about as much as we get im just happy my sister and brother inlaw are in charge of the main courses theyre both chefs and big eaters none of that lamb chop garbage
food,not_removed,looking for ideas default here is probably french or cuban steak au poivre and fries would probably be my choice
food,not_removed,exactly i want to do something else besides the pork i have told
food,not_removed,as someone with an iodine allergy this looks like it would be worth death
food,not_removed,can ya explain this a bit like where and what maybe cost etc

food,not_removed,cool you broke imgur
food,not_removed,whats it stuffed with
food,not_removed,no you stuff it
food,not_removed,my mom gave me a zucchini from her garden the other day i will have to try making this this week thx op
food,not_removed,i think rgardening would appreciate this there are so many armbabysized zucchinicukes recently
food,not_removed,thats not what i expected from the title but i guess this is rfood oh well i guess i can do that on my own
food,not_removed,this zucchini was the size of a forearm and so this is only a quarter of it i browned a pound of ground beef with garlic c diced onion c of the chopped zucchini innards salt pepper and oregano then i turned the heat off and added half a jar of spaghetti sauce and half a cup of bread crumbs scooped into the zucchini and cooked at f for about minutes then add shredded mozzarella and some chopped basil and broil for minutes turned out awesome
food,not_removed,i will then
food,not_removed,sounds amazing did you buy it or grow it and yeah basil especially fresh tastes good on almost everything
food,not_removed,fine i hope you enjoy it
food,not_removed,both the zucchini and the basil were grown in my garden my second year of gardening and first year ive had food to eat thanks
food,not_removed,id love to grow things but unfortunately i rent so i cant any tips on successful gardening especially basil i bought a plant and it died
food,not_removed,hm i dont know that it was anything i did i found the sunniest spot i have which still only gets hours of sun a day and kept it well watered but since i live in seattle that part was easy do you think it had too much sun or not enough
food,not_removed,i think i read that basil should get that amount of sun daily i guess if its still alive youre doing it right i bought one when it was pretty cloudy maybe now that the sun is out i should give it another go
food,not_removed,yes just expect that it will be done with in about two months
food,not_removed,looks delicious
food,not_removed,im not a big soup fan but that looks amazing
food,not_removed,thanks for the most part i followed this recipe httpwwwgimmesomeovencomslowcookerchickentortillasouprecipe its a pretty solid recipes on its own but the ingredient that made the soup more creamy than watery was definitely adding some masa harina towards the end i used low sodium chicken broth and waited till the end to add additional salt but really wasnt necessary finding the dried pasilla peppers makes a difference too come to think of it you really dont need the chipotle peppers i just added some in because i had some leftover and like a spicier soup
food,not_removed,beautiful
food,not_removed,i absolutely hate large peices of meat on my pizza it needs to be diced up when you cant get your chompers cleanly through the thick meat and it pulls away and brings all the cheese and then the sauce burns your lip and chin diced meats on pizza only pro tip i have made and ate hundreds of pizza
food,not_removed,its at a small italian restaurant in brisbane qld australia haha hope you live nearby
food,not_removed,that last sentence makes you my hero doin the lords work bless you
food,not_removed,pizza has it all
food,not_removed,what dough recipe did you use looks great i would love to try making this
food,not_removed,i used bread flour to all purpose flour plus hot water and a tsp of canola oil the bread flour makes the dough softer and easier to stretch to form the dumplings
food,not_removed,its mainly chicken stock with some ginger and onion i added some bacon for extra flavour
food,not_removed,one of the best bowls of ramen ive had for those interested i came across this gem at food cache cafe in mammoth lakes ca
food,not_removed,is it hit enough for the egg to cook if so does it take long
food,not_removed,hows the snow my goodness over feet in january yes
food,not_removed,ive only done it myself with instant ramen if i add a raw egg i prefer to do so while the water is boiling and i let it cook for a few minutes until cooked thru in this bowl even though the egg was just very lightly cooked it was still so delicious i think the point here was letting the yoke flavor enhance the broth
food,not_removed,hat reduction looks so good and complicated and the plating with the veggies is perfect yum
food,not_removed,i love meat the rib eye looks delicious but theres like veggies and onion rings as a consumer is be so let down if this was in front of me as a redditor my mouth is literally watering and my brain is wondering if that rib eye is as juicy as it looks
food,not_removed,meh
food,not_removed,there are actually a lot more veggies than it looks like in the picture theyre just all under that steak and that ribeye was as good as b it looks
food,not_removed,i kind of agree this is a dish that a new owner insisted we run so i made it happen nothing really special other than the sauce which was fucking amazing it was blonde veal stock reduction with white burgundy and herbs i loved it
food,not_removed,good job op
food,not_removed,im drowning in my own pool of saliva
food,not_removed,nah forget that guy man looks great
food,not_removed,what makes it buddhist
food,not_removed,where is this
food,not_removed,looks beautiful i wish we had something like this in my country
food,not_removed,i dont see tongs for a lot of the food there are people just grabbing the food
food,not_removed,ah okay that makes sense
food,not_removed,theres a small buddhist temple near my previous workplace that serves up vegetarian buffet meals like these and its cooked by volunteers it used to be free but people sort of abused it packing out or taking more than they could eat so they charged like a small fee lt everyone is welcomed and you see muslims dropping by to eat as well
food,not_removed,taizhong taiwan
food,not_removed,you get tongs when you come in and use the same pair to grab all the food
food,not_removed,is that the place with the big rig bowl of rigatoni love that place
food,not_removed,side question does anyone know how they make their marinara
food,not_removed,yup
food,not_removed,ive heard it starts with crushed tomatoes 😜
food,not_removed,impressive i love quinoa but it always gives me absolutely weapons grade gas
food,not_removed,hah sorry that made me chortle a little xd
food,not_removed,my favorite quiche is bacon and broccoli cant go wrong with quiche
food,not_removed,margins are razor thin so if you have poor controls or the sales just arent coming you can have a rough couple of months
food,not_removed,can you par fry to cook through freeze then fry to order
food,not_removed,raskculinary may be a better spot for this question
food,not_removed,oh that looks lovely recipe
food,not_removed,no thanks
food,not_removed,that looks awesome did you check out the new beer garden
food,not_removed,that looks amazing i havent had a bad meal at pcm yet
food,not_removed,its like the meat version of a cinnamon roll
food,not_removed,that looks like danish rullepølse
food,not_removed,is it licorice meat its sounds like licorice meat
food,not_removed,fantastic it looks amazing anyone have a video on how this is made or a recipe instructions
food,not_removed,i dunno how to pronounce most of that but it looks good
food,not_removed,please please recipe instructions for a newb
food,not_removed,god why did i read that as placenta
food,not_removed,aka american styled sushi
food,not_removed,this looks excellent next time you should dry it too
food,not_removed,if you made this rcharcuterie would love to see it
food,not_removed,drool
food,not_removed,these comments are garbage that looks awesome you got a recipe for that
food,not_removed,looks yummy get in mah belly
food,not_removed,it looks great op ignore the silly comments its great how youre trying new spicesflavors instead of only making bacon if you could show us how its done so we dont poison ourselves we would appreciate it
food,not_removed,crimes against bacon this could have been cured with smoke and maple to make it delicious but no instead you put black licorice stuff on uncooked bacon you are a monster
food,not_removed,ew
food,not_removed,enjoy heart disease
food,not_removed,youre almost eating pure fat disgusting
food,not_removed,yup gotta love some roll sausage
food,not_removed,it is actually thier version although the danish version uses cracked pepper allspice and is done in a rectangular form then poached so its cooked while this is cured via a dry rub
food,not_removed,panchetta one of the finest italian cured meats
food,not_removed,anise rhymes with stannis dont let anybody tell you it rhymes with denise
food,not_removed,i feel you bro
food,not_removed,came here to say this
food,not_removed,ive posted a few times over there a great resource
food,not_removed,thanks i cook for my palate so if people dont like star anise then they can leave it out if they make it the recipe is in my charcuterie book basically a pinch of pink curing salt along with spices i adjusted to my tastes it hung for months at and in my homemade curing chamber httpimgurcomzcrpwcj
food,not_removed,agreed beautiful as it is tastes like licorice pass
food,not_removed,gotta agree what is it with italians and black licorice flavor yeah this pork sausage needs more fennel seeds oh these thin cookies yeah needs anise this beautiful piece of cured pork more black licorice flavor
food,not_removed,im sad that anyone who doesnt like the look of this thigh sized hunk of fat seems to get downvoted to hell it actually disgusts me to imagine someone enjoying eating all that fat it has a gross texture and nasty flavour imo
food,not_removed,great thanks link to the book you should have done a diy curing chamber post as well
food,not_removed,thanks for the support i expected more people to agree with me about black licorice family dinner we had pork and fennel last night karmas a bitch the above actually looks good but the post was joke
food,not_removed,post another picture of the final result
food,not_removed,recipe
food,not_removed,genuinely curious but at what point does it stop being cured pork belly and become bacon i thought the curing was what separated it
food,not_removed,aaahh thanks
food,not_removed,first post ever so please me gentle with me after seeing all the delicious food here i thought id share a personal recipe yes the spaghetti is purple and yes there is chicken somewhere in that sauce the pasta itself was boiled in a red winewater mix to give it the interesting color and a lovely taste that compliments the sauce the sauce was made from fresh tomatoes mushrooms peppers garlic and some seasonings which i then added some heavy cream and grappa to before cooking several chicken breasts in the sauce whole thing came out amazing and the chicken was so tender it peeled apart just from looking at it
food,not_removed,you should be careful in boiling something using wine ethanol when heated turn into methanol a toxic substance though the potency is small the alcohol content of wine can be enough i suggest you dillute it with more water
food,not_removed,ethanol when heated turn into methanol where did you get that idea
food,not_removed,not true boiling wine is perfectly safe
food,not_removed,whos looking at the plate lol
food,not_removed,whats the point of a coffee rub first im hearing of it
food,not_removed,beautifully done
food,not_removed,looks so good question though whats with the coffee rub never heard of it before intriguing
food,not_removed,delicious looking ribeye
food,not_removed,looks so good plating looks fine to me
food,not_removed,just adds a smokey flavor to it its basically another spice adds a really nice flavor im surprised youve never heard of it try it sometime
food,not_removed,just adds a smokey flavor to it its basically another spice adds a really nice flavor im surprised youve never heard of it try it sometime
food,not_removed,lmfao nice reply times mate but okay i fucking devour stake normally im the salt and pepper guy with a buttergarlic pasting but coffee does sound really extravagant cheerio
food,not_removed,my bad haha i dont get notifications for comments for some reason
food,not_removed,elevated to teasing heights
food,not_removed,just photoed now on my menu for tomorrow nights dinner
food,not_removed,our all product is totally made by hand with the absolute highest standards and buy gluten free cake bars online at very affordable cost in nyc
food,not_removed,also as someone who worked in a kitchen with people fresh out of culinary school dont assume you are king shit because you have a piece of paper you will have to slog through the hours just like the people who are already there dont get upset because the guy who cooked in that kitchen years longer than you without a degree was promoted to saucier before you ive seen it happen before and yeah be ready to meet some right pricks but as it was said know some dirty jokes be ready to curse like a sailor and its always front of house against back of house even if you guys drink together be friends with the dish washers because they will be your life line if you need clean pans or dishes during a rush they are more willing to put you ahead in the cleaning order
food,not_removed,that you will make approximately zero dollars work long hours late nights holidays and generally not be treated very well my suggestion to you is to not rack up debt attending culinary school because you will never pay it off with the amount of money you will be making for the first years minimum
food,not_removed,have you worked in kitchens before
food,not_removed,the different kinds of knife one uses in the kitchen and the technique to cut them in different ways
food,not_removed,yes sharpen your knives while staring down the scared cook in the corner curled up in the fetal position while you mumble something about how he shouldnt have burned the omelet in his try and he shouldnt feel too much pain if your knife is sharp enough bully your fellow students throw plates of food at the walls and occasionally other cooks learn to incorporate the fword in oh about every other word you use hek youll make a great chef
food,not_removed,boh just gets bent out of shape that foh makes so much more money than them its not our fault that we made sound economic decisions regarding which path to chose regarding a career in hospitality

food,not_removed,not really sure but ive worked in a couple of kitchens mostly prep and have had friends that have gone on to culinary school just make sure you get yourself some comfy nonslip shoes and get ready for some shitty hours your coworkers will probably always be some crazy cunts but thats the best part learn some dirty jokes itll get you far lots of late days and then late nights drinking have fun you might want to ask raskculinary if you want to know from more industry people

food,not_removed,those potatoes look nice and buttery
food,not_removed,looks good i always like to rough up my potatoes with a fork so they go extra crispy what was in the base
food,not_removed,they were i didnt have any experience making them but someone here taught me a killer method they were surprisingly delicious and easy to make
food,not_removed,thanks its a basic cottage pie base minced beef onions carrots and garlic a bit of tomato purée and a small glass of red wine that is reduced before you let it simmer in beef stock some worcestershire sauce and rosemary i loved the flavour that all those minced vegetables gave the meat with a bit o black pepper to give it a little heat it was pretty great good idea on the potatoes btw i wish they were more crispy than the way they came out ill try that the next time
food,not_removed,its unique its like a very fragrant mushroom like very fragrant and that aroma is very appetizing at least thats what i can say about it
food,not_removed,pretty generous with truffle shavings in the us im guessing

food,not_removed,well its not that expensive bought it for around usd including appetizer buffet cold meats salad cured salmon primi set of mini dishes and a dessert
food,not_removed,thousand dollars
food,not_removed,its a very nice flavour and its very hard to find once out of the ground it doesnt last long before it goes bad like a week or two so the price is pretty high where i live the price is like € for one and its very seasonal to get it north of sweden

food,not_removed,recipe
food,not_removed,it looks really delicious i really want to eat it
food,not_removed,try soaking them first till you can wrap a noodle around your finger then adding to your sauce base and cooking till done they dont take long to cook this way so do it at the end for me boiling makes them stick together and break apart too much
food,not_removed,thanks i dont cook a lot but every sunday i try to make a decent meal i think i know what im trying this weekend
food,not_removed,mondays seem to be the only day i can get there and they are closed monday i miss them at cuttys in brookline
food,not_removed,over medium egg feta cheese pimenton aioli and gremolata on a salt bagel
food,not_removed,id say its worth it though
food,not_removed,im in watertown so boston area is feasible ah rosenfelds yes theres one on needham street in newton cant remember the name but thats prob next on my list
food,not_removed,no im really missing out here
food,not_removed,the bagel place needham street
food,not_removed,i think its next to chipotle heading towards
food,not_removed,and to think i passed rosenfelds
food,not_removed,and monday is a day when you can really use a bagel the line at open on friday was crazy i havent dared to go on a weekend yet
food,not_removed,definitely a lot of good bagels right now around boston check out rover bagels in salem
food,not_removed,have you been to cafe fresh bagel theyre in needham framingham and dedham ill have to look up that place in newton
food,not_removed,ohhh ill check that out i was just by there on saturday and didnt see it
food,not_removed,got any other suggestions while im all about a road trip for food my newborn is not cambridge yes salem no
food,not_removed,so i took a trip the bagel place not worth the trip bagelsaurus has the kind of bagels that have sort of a crispy crust with the bubbles these bagels are softer akin to a dunks bagel which i might have preferred ugh with an abundance of cornmeal on the bottom i got a bakers dozen not realizing this bc im having company this wknd i also had them make me a toasted spinach cheddar with bacon horseradish cc not toasted and i took one bite and was completely turned off it was truly terrible smelled funny bacon was soggy yuck came home tried a siracha cheddar with some tuna toasted mildly better but nothing im interested in replicating im wishing i would have just gone to bagelsaurus
food,not_removed,rosenfelds in newton centre is also really good and a little closer ive also heard good things about levand at the public market at haymarket there are also a few popups better bagels and exodus not sure if they go to cambridge
food,not_removed,oh thats disappointing but thank you for suffering so i dont have to i went to rosenfelds over the weekend and their potato bagel is heaven its like a supersized latke
food,not_removed,looks nice
food,not_removed,my girlfriend asked me if i minded having gnocchi two days in a row today no i did not mind i love it so much looks delicious
food,not_removed,looks tasty but was it soupy at all
food,not_removed,hmm sea food chowder sign me up
food,not_removed,it does look chowdery delicious im sure
food,not_removed,this looks like my ideal dessert
food,not_removed,that looks good if i made it id probably add an extra slice of cheese just because i love the fuck out of cheese i double it on everything i buy could you share your recipe what kind of cheese that doesnt look like the standard shitty processed cheese also how did you make the special sauce what kind of lettuce did you dice your own onions i really want to make this this summer well done
food,not_removed,whered you get the middle bun
food,not_removed,how did you make the patties the exact shape and thickness as the restaurant patties that is the part that i personally always have issues with can you post a pic of your uncooked patty
food,not_removed,sell the photo to mcdonalds for their advertising thats the first appetizing big mac ive seen in a long time
food,not_removed,in france they call it le big mac
food,not_removed,that looks so much better than the real thing
food,not_removed,exquisite
food,not_removed,looks good
food,not_removed,can you share your recipe of the sauce you made
food,not_removed,nailed it i always found it the toughest burger to mimic due to the sauce
food,not_removed,i appreciate the technical correctness slice of cheese on the bottom story
food,not_removed,my latest big mack move no onions no middle bun delish
food,not_removed,ha i didnt know that ok let me rephrase then when you make one for me please add an extra slice
food,not_removed,and then you died
food,not_removed,so i know youre recreating the actual mac but i hope you added that always missing piece of cheese before eating
food,not_removed,it aint a big mac if it cant last a decade without getting moldy
food,not_removed,what did you use for the middle bun
food,not_removed,thats a work of art
food,not_removed,one of my best burger decisions was to not use processed cheese and just cut my own
food,not_removed,props to you for understanding the perfect patty size too many times i see patties that are too large these patties op they are special patties thank you
food,not_removed,look what my local deli did for me oz each they thought it was an odd request but it saves me the hassle of weighing each portion myself
food,not_removed,through some more cheese man
food,not_removed,literally the only thing anyone could critique about this beautiful burger is the missing slice of cheese well done my friend how did it taste amazing im sure
food,not_removed,if you want to get the sauce right then you take fry sauceketchupmayonnaise and add pickle juice
food,not_removed,only thing that irks me about this is the cheese under the patty gotta put that shit on top so it melts
food,not_removed,who puts cheese underneath the burger whatre you an animal
food,not_removed,but why
food,not_removed,since the reply i typed out wont show up for anyone else no matter what i try see here httpiimgurcomoiwjemspng
food,not_removed,i used the lower half of another bun heel and sliced a thin sliver off the bottom of it when i make these i buy a second package of hamburger buns to use the heels for the middle bun then i use the leftover crowns for something else such as tuna salad sandwiches
food,not_removed,i use a diameter lid from a jar of planters peanuts i put a piece of saran wrap over the lid and then press in oz or oz if making quarter pounders of ground chuck i lift up on the saran wrap to remove the patty from the lid i dont have any pictures of uncooked oz hamburger patties but i do have some pictures of some oz patties i made i was using wax paper at the time i took the pictures but ive come to prefer saran wrap for the job httpiimgurcomgxjvkhejpg
food,not_removed,heres a screenshot of my reply httpiimgurcomoiwjemspng
food,not_removed,i just typed out a lengthy reply to the other person who asked about the recipe but it seems like its only showing up for me if i check this thread with another browser that isnt logged into reddit it doesnt show up ive had this happen a few times now and always in posts where i mentioned the name of the company which makes the real big macs which is bizarre ill try to post it again with some redactions edit it still isnt showing up for anyone but me maybe i cant mention name brands how are you supposed to discuss food without mentioning name brands ill try again with some more redactions edit i give up even after more redactions it still didnt work i also tried editing the recipe into this post and that didnt work either what is wrong with this subreddit
food,not_removed,yeah i think it might be a common misconception that big macs have two slices of cheese at least among people who dont eat them on a regular basis about years ago when i was visiting my older brother in az we were at mcdonalds and i decided to order a big mac because i hadnt had one in a long time when i got it i thought they forgot the second slice of cheese until i looked at the picture on their menu even then i thought it might have been a recent change until i looked online at old tv commercials and print ads and sure enough theyve always had just one slice of cheese
food,not_removed,i used the lower half of another bun heel and sliced a thin sliver off the bottom of it when i make these i buy a second package of hamburger buns to use the heels for the middle bun then i use the leftover crowns for something else such as tuna salad sandwiches
food,not_removed,a big mac only has one slice of cheese though the recently introduced grand mac variant has two slices of cheese along with larger patties
food,not_removed,thanks it did indeed taste amazing by the way big macs have always had only one slice of cheese
food,not_removed,the real mac sauce doesnt have any tomatoes or tomatobased products in it at all heres the ingredients list published by mcdonalds big mac® sauce contains wheateggsoymustard soybean oil relish prepared mustard water frozen egg yolk vinegar onion powder salt mustard flour xanthan gum potassium sorbate spices garlic powder hydrolyzed plant protein colour calcium disodium edta
food,not_removed,thats where the cheese goes on one of these it melts during qing
food,not_removed,mcdonalds does when they make big macs so i do too when i make a copy of a big mac
food,not_removed,why what
food,not_removed,now you can buy mac sauce at the grocery store in canada anyway edit that sounded sarcastic i just meant its a great time to be alive as we no longer have to fumble with online recipes to get that authentic taste
food,not_removed,huh didnt know that about the onions there i always get the poor mans big mac mcdouble with mac sauce added some restaurants even let you add lettuce for free then all your missing is the middle bun and sesame seeds which doesnt bother me at all
food,not_removed,im sorry but this is hilarious op was expecting some kinda great kitchen technique im sure and you respond with the planters peanuts lid lord thats amazing
food,not_removed,they called it grande big mac in portugal its a battle with words asking menu grande grande big mac
food,not_removed,could the relish in that list not be tomatobased
food,not_removed,big macs are meh dont get me wrong its my go to at mcdonalds but if im making a burger id probably go for something else
food,not_removed,wow thats awesome i hadnt heard that it looks like its only in canada though i hope they decide to sell it in the us too i have several cousins who live in canada so i could have them send me some or bring some along when they come back to maine on holidays
food,not_removed,if i remember right the recipe for big mac sauce is on the mcdonalds website edit here ya go
food,not_removed,what what grocery store sells this
food,not_removed,it is sweet pickle relish according to the executive chef for mcdonalds dan coudreaut i dont know of any sweet pickle relish that has tomatoes in it
food,not_removed,big macs are meh i disagree dont get me wrong its my go to at mcdonalds i hardly ever buy them they arent filling enough for the price they are fundamentally a mcdouble with one extra slice of bread and the mcdouble is on the dollar menu at least it was last time i was at mcdonalds a couplefew years ago i usually get a double quarter pounder with cheese but if im making a burger id probably go for something else me too except when im in the mood for a big mac
food,not_removed,the presidents choice stuff or is there another mac sauce for sale here that i dont know about
food,not_removed,the closest ive found to an official recipe is from a video in which the executive chef for mcdonalds dan coudreaut showed how to make a homemade version of the mac sauce edit the video you linked to in your edit is the one but it isnt very helpful because he didnt specify any measurements also you could tell from the ingredients he used that it was just a rough approximation anyway for example he didnt use any hydrolyzed vegetable protein which is in the published ingredients list of actual mac sauce and provides a savoryumami taste plus it is not as if you can buy hvp at your local grocery store anyway it is normally only sold in bulk quantities to food manufacturers so mcdonalds plan to sell actual mac sauce in grocery stores is great news albeit tempered somewhat by them only planning to sell it in canada at this time
food,not_removed,i havent seen it yet but i imagine all the big names
food,not_removed,i order a double cheese burger without ketchup or mustard and have big mac sauce in it hits the spot and is about £ cheaper
food,not_removed,according to the article i read it hasnt been released yet and there is no exact release date just later this spring they are also planning to sell the mcchicken and filetofish sauces do a web search for mac sauce at the grocery store i tried to link to the article in my previous post but it didnt show up
food,not_removed,alot of the ingredients that are in the official sauce are mainly for ambient storage the basics are what he shows and will give the desired flavour
food,not_removed,my mac hack is a big mac with an egg instead of a second patty
food,not_removed,oh awesome weird that we get it here in canada before the us does its usually the other way around
food,not_removed,as i said he didnt use hvp which is an ingredient that gives a savorymeatyumami flavor and even if he had have used hvp it is not like the average joe can buy it anyway but the biggest problem is that he didnt give any measurements a couple years ago i tried making some by estimating the measurements based on what can be seen in the video and i even got a consensus of estimates from other people in a thread i started ½ cup of mayonnaise tablespoons of relish tablespoon of mustard teaspoon each of vinegar paprika garlic powder and onion powder and it tasted horrible the other online recipes ive tried even though they arent accurate at least taste good that one would probably taste good too if hed provided measurements
food,not_removed,i did some experimenting with the ingredients if you mix cup of mayonnaise with tablespoons of sweet pickle relish and teaspoon each of prepared yellow mustard and white wine vinegar that alone is pretty good if you add the remaining three ingredients from his video do so sparingly ie no more than teaspoon each
food,not_removed,mcdonalds canada seems to be cooler than mcdonalds usa in general for example according to the article i read about the mac sauce being sold in canadian grocery stores mcdonalds canada also recently announced the allday availability of their breakfast menu plus mcdonalds canada publishes insidertype videos answering frequently asked questions from the internet and showing how things are done there
food,not_removed,the tartar sauce is their own recipe and doesnt taste like any offtheshelf brand of tartar sauce that ive ever tried the mcchicken stuff is indeed just mayonnaise but again its their own recipe personally id buy the filetofish tartar sauce but i wouldnt bother with the mcchicken mayonnaise because it isnt a very good mayonnaise recipe in my opinion i like hellmanns mayonnaise the best
food,not_removed,my favorite part about the mcchicken is the mayo its perfect for that sandwich
food,not_removed,i like the mayonnaise burger king uses on their chicken sandwich better in fact i like their chicken sandwich better all around that reminds me of when i was a kid in the early about years old i had a chicken sandwich at burger king for the first time and loved it the next time we went i wanted to make sure i got the same thing so i told the lady i wanted lettuce and mayonnaise on it she was confused and started looking around for the mayonnaise and lettuce options on her cash register hmm would mayonnaise be under sauce she asked herself she messed around with the cash register for probably minutes before the manager came out and told her that chicken sandwiches come with mayonnaise and lettuce by default and to stop pressing all those buttons
food,not_removed,i agree i prefer the bk one also the bread is also better and the bread crumbs have so much more flavor i also grew up to that sandwich i was around when we moved houses and for like days we had no kitchen and at those bk chicken sandwiches best memories of food ever thats why i still order them also their burgers are amazing compared to mcdonalds i like big macs but a whopper with onion rings is heaven no question burger king is the king for a reason we can mention wendys but thats not the point now although back in they had a killer chicken cordon bleu they tried to bring it back but it wasnt even close
food,not_removed,we used to go to wendys a lot when i was a kid i can still remember those tables with the vintage newspaper ads from what appeared to be the printed all over them then one time mom bit into a raw hamburger patty which infuriated her after giving every employee a piece of her mind she said were never coming back here again she meant it too i didnt end up going to wendys again until the early when i could drive myself there
food,not_removed,that chilli tho
food,not_removed,smoked pheasant is my favorite but this looks amazing
food,not_removed,i want
food,not_removed,interesting how was it might have to try this with spaghetti and meatballs on an italian roll i like to separate the sauce from the roll with cheese to prevent sog
food,not_removed,does it taste good
food,not_removed,so just a meatball sub with extra starch
food,not_removed,and i will have the number thats a party platter it serves people i know what im about son
food,not_removed,it looks like a river of sausage funneling through a canyon of cheese and crackers
food,not_removed,way to put shit on a plate in kind of an organized fashiongood job
food,not_removed,omg so much delicious food
food,not_removed,but did you smith the metal sheet its on did you live in italy and grow those grapes did you raise the cows to slaughter did you grow the tomatoes that go in those sauces not home made you poser
food,not_removed,where are the assholes that say these arent homemade because you didnt bake the crackers or breads grow the fruits cure the meats culture the cheeses but isnt sure on the sauces fuck those people this looks amaaaaaaazing how many people did you make this for
food,not_removed,lol so many haters on here look my girlfriend arranged this platter for a baby shower and she was proud of it im sure the ladies at the shower were damn happy to eat it too if it bothers you so much that i cant be oddly specific with the bracketing in the title and you want to vent it out here fine i honestly dont care what you have to say for the rest of you being pleasant thanks
food,not_removed,thats alot of food how many are you thats going to eat it
food,not_removed,very nice may i suggest some type of dried fruit cherries or perhaps apricots
food,not_removed,who knew charcuterie was such a lightning rod topic who thought you could go wrong with meat and cheese
food,not_removed,id gladly spend my months worth of cheat days on that
food,not_removed,i want this
food,not_removed,that looks really great you killed it
food,not_removed,reddit loves charcuterie boards
food,not_removed,wow that is a beautiful board so many delicious options
food,not_removed,omg its like heaven
food,not_removed,lovely appetizers
food,not_removed,so why didnt you just invite everyone on rfood
food,not_removed,how do you pronounce charcuterie
food,not_removed,may i ask what did you use for dips and with what did you pair the dip with
food,not_removed,lol i can even play dont look back in anger
food,not_removed,holy shit im on the way and i will bring my guitar to serenade you
food,not_removed,my mouth just came
food,not_removed,deleted
food,not_removed,say i arranged a platter of food you didnt make any of this
food,not_removed,adding mixed nuts is a great idea i make charcuterie platters for all my parties but never added nuts totally using that idea
food,not_removed,just how exactly is this homemade you went to a deli and ordered some sliced deli meat and cheese then brought them home and laid them out on a plate so i can do a take out from a restaurant bring it home then put that in a plate and call it homemade too what a joke
food,not_removed,what is reddits big fucking obsession over these charcuterie boards its just meat and cheese and crackers big fucking deal
food,not_removed,im hungry now
food,not_removed,exactly lol this is all american crap
food,not_removed,you took care of that
food,not_removed,yeah way to throw a bunch of crap on a plate
food,not_removed,fuckem you rock
food,not_removed,charcuterie baking sheet by the looks of it
food,not_removed,sharkooterree at least thats how i say it but im not an expert
food,not_removed,i think the pink was salmon spread dont remember the dark one my gf put it together so ill have to ask her
food,not_removed,can you play wonderwall
food,not_removed,yellow cheese hmm
food,not_removed,you sure
food,not_removed,honestly i just dont understand charcuterie boards why do i want my grapes getting all warm under some wilting crackers all night i dont want my nuts getting cheese sweat all over them either who wants to just eat cheese and rando cured meats anyways i just dont get it
food,not_removed,cheeses and cured meats work well as the centrepieces of a cold meal there should also be a range of crackers andor a breadboard so you can cut bread when needed and some fruits and leaves to go with if your experience of charcuterie boards has been of warm grapes sweaty cheese and wilting crackers then its no wonder you dont understand the appeal but it really truly doesnt have to be like that if a cheese and charcuterie display is properly designed it will enhance the visual appeal of the products without compromising them so crackers wont be with wet things temperature control will be sufficient etc is an example of a wellput together charcuterie display
food,not_removed,i see what you mean thanks for the comparison i think i would like samples of really good meats or really good cheese as part of a appetizer party array but the boards that just look like the artful arrangements of possible sandwiches always leaves me wishing someone would have just made an actual sandwich lol
food,not_removed,not bad woulda gone with calrose rice myself but im assuming this is in the mainland so good on you for making a loco moco
food,not_removed,yeah had it about years ago when i was staying in kona and just had a craving for it
food,not_removed,definitely use the calrose for a loco moco jasmine is good for everything else though
food,not_removed,try to do this make scrambled eggs the slow way eggs beaten with a fork add cold real butter cut into small dice use low heat stir keep it creamy not rubbery eat discover eggs again
food,not_removed,lots of black pepper tobasco sauce eat them in the form of quiche you will love eggs then have them scrambled with sausage crumbles cheese and salsa wrapped in a flour tortilla
food,not_removed,deviled eggs
food,not_removed,dill goes really well with eggs
food,not_removed,mix in veggies cheese etc of choice to scrambled eggs
food,not_removed,well what are you into eggs can be incorporated into a whole lot of other things that make them even better a couple of things off the top of my head shakshuka is a great dish that incorporates eggs which doesnt really highlight eggs as the most prominent flavor i love indian food and i make several variations of taj egg curry at random depending on my mood eggs benedict is another eggs are prominent but the sauce and the ham balance them out well
food,not_removed,mix in cheese when you scramble them then top with salsa
food,not_removed,dump one into your ramen noodles itll add good flavor and protein without all the eggy flavor and texture that you might currently be averse to
food,not_removed,i eventually realized that what i didnt like about eggs was the sulfur taste of cooked yolks so honestly sunnyside up with salt and pepper doesnt even seem to eggs like me this is contrary to what others are saying but maybe consider what it is about eggs you dont like my only other suggestion is banana pancakes brilliant use of eggs imho
food,not_removed,egg shells are incredibly permeable that being said u can submerge your raw eggs in shell into whatever you want your eggs to taste like so if its the taste sulfurwhich i dont get as one of the others commented in this stream then this eliminates that problem try this if u dig a little spice and arent the worlds best cook get yourself some store bought enchiladachili sauce and take a few eggs and submerge them wait a few days and you end up with chili flavored eggs i like to take liquid smoke and some ash from my smoker and make a paste that i cover the eggs in making them taste like smoked eggs
food,not_removed,you know when you have two friends that you just know would be perfect together as a couple that the incompleteness of their souls would be made whole again if they would just find solace through the long slow embrace of being in each others presence thats how i feel about scrambled eggs and sriracha
food,not_removed,cook eggs sunnyside up with salt pepper chilli flakes and smoked paprika cook until whites are opaque but yolk still runny put onto piece of toast and splash worcestershire sauce
food,not_removed,put them in a cake
food,not_removed,eggs chorizo and cheddar in a burrito its easy and awesome
food,not_removed,i generally dislike eggs by themselves they need to be with something before i eat them but creamy scrambled eggs oh my god its a totally different experience magically i love them
food,not_removed,oh yes i put dill in my egg salad and deviled eggs so good

food,not_removed,omg this is so beautiful
food,not_removed,nice colors on that cake
food,not_removed,they indeed were exceptionally large berries
food,not_removed,thanks so much
food,not_removed,grill them put them in oil garlic basalmic vinegar and let them soak for a bit a bit of fresh mint is always good or basilic here you go
food,not_removed,regift it the more random the person the better like on the subway or people just walking past
food,not_removed,eggplant parmesan slice the eggplant into thin steaks and salt them leave them for hour to sweat you will see water beading up on them you want them dry so they fry up crispy after an hour use a towel to dry them and then you can fry them in oil breaded or unbreaded or you can bake them in the oven drizzled in olive oil salt and pepper once they are all fried arrange them in a baking tray so that they cover the bottom in one layer add cheese and tomatoe sauce add another layer of eggplant then cheese and tomatoe sauce do this as many times as you can cover it in cheese and a sprinkle of breadcrumbs and bake it you want to end up with something like a lasagna layers if youd like to make your own sauce my recipe for an easy tomatoe sauce is in a pan heat olive oil garlic and onions you cant have too much garlic and onions until they begin to look clear not burned add can of tomatoe paste cook this in the pan for about minutes on lowmedium heat heat unlocks the sweetness of the tomatoe add salt pepper dried basil thyme and oregano to taste a pinch of sugar too to cut the acidity add one can of peeled tomatoes crush the tomatoes with your hands its funand can of water and let that simmer for about an hour with bay leaves on low heat stirring frequently feel free to add browned ground beef or sliced cooked sausage as well if youd like some meat this is a simple sauce and you can add much more if youd like mushrooms celery italian parsely parmesan etc but it obviously gets more expensive as you add more but this is my simple sauce that i always make if im doing a quick pasta i never buy the store bought stuff but im also italian and i would bring shame on my whole family if i did

food,not_removed,my favorite way is chinese stuffed eggplant you see this in dim sum use any mixture of pork shrimp or fish paste that you want you can cut the eggplant or but make sure you use cornstarchit acts as an adhesive miso glazed eggplant if you have a grill grill it eggplant tempura eggplant with garlic sauce minced meat you dont necessarily have to fry it you can steam the eggplant if you want
food,not_removed,this looks very simple and prob delish am going to do this in the next couple of days httpchocolateandzucchinicomrecipesvegetablesgrainsdoenjangglazedeggplantrecipe
food,not_removed,sautéed with oil over rice add some chili paste serve with nori
food,not_removed,i have given away about of the eggplant good idea to spread the love
food,not_removed,op said no oven though so perhaps with a bit of tweaking you could layer this into a heavy pot and cook on the stovetop or make it smaller and use a toaster oven if thats available
food,not_removed,oh no oven that changes things a bit but not if you get the right equipment ill bet you could make this work in like a slow cooker but it wouldnt be crispy you could always flash fry them melt some cheese and sauce over that and put it on some french or just good bread
food,not_removed,its my first time posting so be gentle
food,not_removed,til marshmallow fluff is paleo
food,not_removed,so what is the waffle itself if no processed flour my sister triathalon nut eats paleo so i would venture to guess congealed bacon fat
food,not_removed,not a historian but im pretty sure waffles didnt exist in the paleolithic era
food,not_removed,you dont talk about paled if its your first time s nah just playing that looks amazing
food,not_removed,cinnamon
food,not_removed,little did we know it was a million year old recipe
food,not_removed,not store bought just egg whites honey and vanilla
food,not_removed,almond flour and eggs mainly
food,not_removed,paleo diet not paleolithic era
food,not_removed,while i dont think paleo means what op thinks it means this does looks tasty
food,not_removed,op clarify that the fluff is not really made out of marshmallow your waffles otherwise appear to be up to paleo snuff
food,not_removed,cool i was looking for almond flour for pie crust recipes thanks to rpaleo for sources may order some coconut flour too not paleo but i think it is good to mix the diet up lots of glueten free friends at work who share treats to
food,not_removed,which is where the basis for the paleo diet came from
food,not_removed,paleo as in the paleo diet not as in paleolithic era
food,not_removed,op is clearly clueless
food,not_removed,i like it because i dont feel guilty eating stuff made with it its a lot of protein
food,not_removed,but adapted of course i follow the scd diet but they just happen to be paleo
food,not_removed,i love that place was this from the oktoberfest
food,not_removed,me too this is not from oktoberfest i stopped in on my way back to connecticut in may i also bought a cinnamon and sugar pretzel to go they are so good
food,not_removed,what are better boys
food,not_removed,heh heh i know thats why we all eventually resign ourselves to using good quality canned tomatoes
food,not_removed,did you puree those tomatoes yourself do you like to struggle
food,not_removed,tomato cultivar
food,not_removed,blanched the tomatoes then i put them in a food processor then i put it in a food mill to get out all the seeds tldr yes
food,not_removed,i love making my own pasta sauce sometimes noodles if i feel like doing it all day but ive never tried to use fresh tomatoes
food,not_removed,unfortunately i cant use tomatoes from my garden yet because they are not ready i had to use grocery store tomatoes but the sauce will still taste pretty good there is no real recipe i go by the italian method by a pinch of this and a pinch of that and let the ingredients cook into the sauce as it thickens the only really bad part is waiting all day over hours for the sauce to cook down but its the best way to ensure good tasting sauce

food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,in house pressed special
food,not_removed,looks good other than the flacid bacon that really needs a good crisping up to be on a burger

food,not_removed,i gotta say that looks like my idea of burger perfection
food,not_removed,its around lunch time and i am hungry seeing this just made me drool a bit
food,not_removed,now thats a burger no bullshit has all the ingredients you need and it looks amazing

food,not_removed,american cheddar sounds absolutely disgusting i imagine its like the fake plastic cheese slices you get individually wrapped
food,not_removed,you know what i saw this and thought this looks like its worth a drive of its within miles imma go nope fuckin australia
food,not_removed,why would australia have cheddar imported from america
food,not_removed,is in house pressed patties really a big deal in australia any restaurant worth their salt in the us is making their own burger patties from fresh ground beef
food,not_removed,thats like on the other side of the world the suburbs must be a big place
food,not_removed,looks like i am planning a vacation to melbourne now
food,not_removed,this restaurant is minutes from the melbourne cbd would hardly says its in the suburbs
food,not_removed,meh i like them as long as they are on the lighter fluffier side
food,not_removed,thank you i always say that brioche is an inferior bread for sandwich making its far too fragile for any hearty filling it should only be used for butter or a simple spread
food,not_removed,unless you like butter
food,not_removed,no way it looks perfect
food,not_removed,vefetables i like that
food,not_removed,the suburbs
food,not_removed,in the bacon
food,not_removed,if you do a createyourtaste burger from maccas here it always has a stick in it i always get a ciabatta bun with grilled chicken pineapple lettuce shaved parmesan bacon garlic aoli and tomato sauce stands about the same height as a big mac stick in the top
food,not_removed,or it is cheddar from america
food,not_removed,well american cheese is what you are thinking of it is neither cheese nor cheddar so yes disgusting unless you are in a sadistic self hating mood american cheddar however can mean any number of cheddar cheeses made in the america of which there are a tremendous variety but most likely with it simply being described as american it is probably some mild and unremarkable cheddar that is only somewhat distinguishable from american cheese in the fact that it is actually cheese
food,not_removed,yeah it is i was at a subway in the caribbean once and a girl from indiana asked if they had uhmairuhcan chaaiiiise sandwhich artist was baffled i was baffled then she pointed to what we call electric cheese or just fake cheese in canada
food,not_removed,its delicious we have plenty of other imported food not sure why cheese should be the exception

food,not_removed,but you could import cheddar from anywhere so why not england
food,not_removed,i agree on that haha
food,not_removed,did you then proceed to drop it all over the floor
food,not_removed,it looks like the eye of sauron
food,not_removed,i dont know what either of those terms mean
food,not_removed,i work as a sous chef and we only use these much easier than using normal garlic we peel and mix about pounds of it and pour oil over it to keep it from spoiling
food,not_removed,where did you find this i must have it please
food,not_removed,ive wanted to try elephant garlic for a while now is it as potent as smaller garlic varieties
food,not_removed,elephant garlic has a couple of big cloves like solo garlic has only one much bigger clove like in ops picture it actually looks a little like an onion from the outside
food,not_removed,how do you prevent botulism
food,not_removed,roasting elephant garlic is delicious its great to spread on bread yum give it a try
food,not_removed,elephant garlic is more mild and not quite the same its a bit more oniony than regular garlic not so much that you cant substitute them but enough that you might notice the difference definitely easier to deal with though
food,not_removed,is there a difference in taste
food,not_removed,we keep it refrigerated at around and use it within days or else its thrown away
food,not_removed,is it potent like normal varieties
food,not_removed,i havent personally had either but ive heard that theyre milder and less pungent than normal garlic and easier to eat raw
food,not_removed,less strong flavor imo
food,not_removed,raw like plain or in some sort of dish im very interested i might have to get some and experiment
food,not_removed,raw like uncooked ordinary garlic is usually pretty unpalatable without being cooked but elephant and solo garlic are supposed to have a soft enough flavor you could use them without any cooking i dont know why you would but i guess they wouldnt be bad in a salad or something
food,not_removed,i meant uncooked lol i dont like garlic enough to eat it plain or raw but ive seen someone eat an onion like an apple
food,not_removed,raw garlic is used in a lot of dishes

food,not_removed,duck confit cooked in its own fat not to be semantic here but thats what confit means a protein typically duck cooked in its own fat con with fit fat duck confit cooked in its own fat is just needlessly repetitive
food,not_removed,yeah baby yeah
food,not_removed,except for the beak and the feathers one hopes
food,not_removed,nice i have been on a confit kick temp time
food,not_removed,room temp duck and fat
food,not_removed,and dont use oil if u dont have to use the fat of whatever animal u r cooking confit means to literally cook in its own fat u can buy rendered fat at almost any descent grocery or at the butcher just make sure the legs are skin side down and completely submerged i the fat the fat needs to b liquid so heat it accordingly and once it starts to get cloudy it is cool enough to pour over the legs and begin cooking make sure that u cure it enough before u cook it i use i cup salt to cups suvee or that ratio at least then a bunch of thyme maybe cloves of garlic a big handful of black peppercorns and a big hand full of caraway seeds after u coat one side with that mixture go ahead and really press it into the meat flip the legs over and repeat when they see finished curing which should take days depending if u weight then down or not clean the meat off the meat should feel void of moisture almost it wont have much play in it and it will b allot firmer and a bit smaller then before u cured it the cure is pulling the bullshit out of he meat as well as flavoring it with water then pay them completely dry before putting them skin side down in ur cooking vessel at this point u add fresh spices and herbs same as the curing mixture but without the salt and sugar wrap super tight with foil over parchment or plastic wrapwhich will not melt so long as it is entirely covered by the top tin foil wrap then place in the oven and follow the earlier time and temp i gave u
food,not_removed,auger not suvee im the worst tyler in the work and have big numb chef fingers so its bad sometimes
food,not_removed,your face is repetitive but you dont see me being semantic about it
food,not_removed,i know u didnt ask me but doesnt look like u got a response confit duck should cook at fahrenheit for hours its done when u pick up a leg and the meat separates in easily without any force from the bone i like to let my duck come down in temp in the fat them ill pull the duck pass the confit liquid and then resubmerge the legs in the cooking fat i store them completely covered in fatas token them from spoiling for minimum days before i serve it
food,not_removed,hes actually got a really good point your face is repetitive and i think we can all agree that no one sees him being semantic about it so
food,not_removed,oh cool yeah i experimented with chicken and anything over hours made it horribly dry all the temperatures that were given were i think that was the problem at hours was incredible dont get me wrong but i want to try this do you start with room temperature oil or do you heat it to i am always conflicted with that too
food,not_removed,i can see why some might think it looks dry but its sort of refreshing to see an alfredo thats not soup
food,not_removed,theres quite a bit of garlic salt and other seasonings on this so it was far from bland af
food,not_removed,needs more cow bell
food,not_removed,although it looks dry it does contain a ton of parmasean cheese so you have that for flavor if you add some sesame salad dressing that would be delish
food,not_removed,the teeth on the claws look like actual teeth im kinda freaking out right now to be honest
food,not_removed,are those snail shells on the left there
food,not_removed,but that plate looks great i wouldnt order and pay for that but id pick at yours
food,not_removed,why
food,not_removed,those shrimp are cooked
food,not_removed,cooked food is no more calorific than raw food but it takes fewer calories to process and digest from studies with patients using intestinal collection bags cooking appears to increase the absorption of food in the stomach and small intestine from to when compared to raw and cooking is fun and texture is a big deal in the culinary world and its safer i can keep going but its fun to get attention i guess
food,not_removed,nah they raw as hell you see those eyes they dont take nothin from nobody
food,not_removed,they look tasty sorry for my ignorance but how do you do them is there a specific machine
food,not_removed,so puffy how many folds did you do
food,not_removed,those look delicious
food,not_removed,they also bake better from frozen or well refrigerated it creates better steam and flaky layers
food,not_removed,i used the recipe from the bourke street bakery cookbook which is a cookbook from a bakery in sydney australia it took me two days the first to make the culture which i left overnight and then the second to fold the dough and actually bake the croissants
food,not_removed,folds with the butter takes about unfortunately i did it in a hot environment so the dough was breaking easily but hey they still worked out best to do it in an air conditioned environment
food,not_removed,would you be kind enough to give us the recipe or at least the ingredients they look so yummi i want to try to make them they will for sure be much better than my local belgian bakery says the miserable relocated french girl in desperate need of good pastry
food,not_removed,they look great breaking and all ive made croissants once in a baking class but ive been afraid to try it at home for myself because my kitchen tends to heat up quickly one day
food,not_removed,homemade ones are better cause all the little mistakes you make really make the croissants taste better cause either was all your hard work
food,not_removed,and smuggled a breadstick through customs props to his dedication and not a smear in sight
food,not_removed,i once had a flat mate who had a flat and then was late at the flat
food,not_removed,are these considered contraband i am guessing it only adds to the flavor
food,not_removed,and its just a regular meal source im french edit except the wine is missing
food,not_removed,we live in the uk i think that we can move it in europe for now but i have no idea
food,not_removed,i know its normal in france and
food,not_removed,thats some good stuff i made it at homee from time to time i usually add lentils though
food,not_removed,that looks good whats the recipe
food,not_removed,basically whatever your favorite veggies are all chopped up in quantities you prefer i used celery carrot and onion light on the carrot side for me cook them all together in chicken broth with some chopped up bacon not a ton also i like to add extra bullion for flavor once veggies are cooked almost to completion add chucks of cooked smoked turkey i use smoked turkey legs and a bundle of fresh sage leaves and some dill seems weird but i often put dill in my soups everything is eyeballed just be sure to keep tasting your broth for flavor edit bacon
food,not_removed,that is very interesting i might a simplified version one day thanks very much

food,not_removed,it was delicious
food,not_removed,it was its a crust recipe ive been using for awhile just played with it a bit
food,not_removed,it was there is sauce in one of the middle layers but not as much as a traditional pizza might have
food,not_removed,yep
food,not_removed,it is four layers of dough rolled very thin with one layer each of cheese sauce and green peppers once i had the layers put together i trimmed it to the tree shape for the branches i made cuts about every inch leaving the center intact i twisted each branch upwards once or twice more cheese and diced peppers on top and bake
food,not_removed,very cool
food,not_removed,served over rice
food,not_removed,nice
food,not_removed,looks pretty good but looks like it might be a little dry in some sections needs more chocolate
food,not_removed,i agree definitely needed more chocolate or a thicker sauce
food,not_removed,looks pretty good to me
food,not_removed,recipie i also added cup of fresh mushrooms of garlic powder of crushed red pepper flakes extra salt exta basil and a little extra tomato paste i also used fresh diced tomatoes instead of canned and sorry for the potato quality picture
food,not_removed,haha thanks i just didnt think it looked good through the potato quality picture this stuff definitely made my house smell great

food,not_removed,if anything you have to be careful with the little grooves from cutting on plastic cutting boards those truly harbor bacteria wooden cutting boards are just fine as are plastic care for them properly replace them when they are worn httpswwwfsisusdagovwpsportalfsistopicsfoodsafetyeducationgetanswersfoodsafetyfactsheetssafefoodhandlingcuttingboardsandfoodsafety

food,not_removed,wood is fine most wood is naturally antibacterial wood is the best for the blade of the knife scratches nicks and dings in plastic cutting boards are truly petri dishes and its nearly impossible to clean the microscopic scratches in the plastic boards

food,not_removed,holy shitballs i need this
food,not_removed,sorry didnt explain we cooked it in a thick salt crust that almost resembles an igloo when it was finished you remove the crust but the meat has mild saltiness and fantastic tenderness

food,not_removed,yes god i love alton brown
food,not_removed,i love sous vide especially on steak this looks delicious
food,not_removed,how do you like cooking sous vide compared to pan frying i want to try it but just love basting my steaks in rosemary butter too much lol
food,not_removed,well they arent mutually exclusivei sear in cast iron with butter and baste this steak is very fatty and needs a long cook in the sous vide first if you want to serve rare

food,not_removed,i approve this

food,not_removed,this is how you make them first you batter then deep fry them for minutes serve with mustard
food,not_removed,ohhhhh lord these with some honey mustard and ranch just go ahead and give me my last meal
food,not_removed,homemade nugs are the best what was your sauce situation
food,not_removed,gnarly
food,not_removed,hours start t finish with clean up is goodthese others probably have someone following behind them cleaning up their mess as they go
food,not_removed,did you have a stepbystep book you used or a specific website did you take any step by step pictures also how would you rate it out of being any good restaurants chicken nugget so no fast food restaurants
food,not_removed,they look great side note why is there a trend of hiding recipes
food,not_removed,calling them nuggs makes them sound very unpleasant
food,not_removed,reminds me of chick fil a nuggets
food,not_removed,are you going to do the nugg challenge
food,not_removed,nice one could you give a recipe please
food,not_removed,they some dank nugz
food,not_removed,hours did you cook them each individually
food,not_removed,why the fuck is this front page of reddit
food,not_removed,from the thumbnail i thought it was a pile of puppies
food,not_removed,how is this even a trending hot topic its breaded chicken wtf
food,not_removed,wow
food,not_removed,two hours but you couldnt be arsed with another half a second to call them nuggets
food,not_removed,dude this should never have taken you two hours if your worried about them being undercooked finish them off in the oven for min you wont lose any crunchiness either
food,not_removed,hardwork paid off，now wheres my barbecue sauce
food,not_removed,hours thats probably why mcdonalds is still alive lol
food,not_removed,it doesnt look all that good
food,not_removed,hours were you high
food,not_removed,cut chicken up bread it fry hours
food,not_removed,chicky chicky nug yall
food,not_removed,they taste so much better
food,not_removed,they like slug shape better
food,not_removed,prepping the chicken then coating it all then frying it all in batches of or then cleaning up im still an amateur at frying food especially chicken because im so nervous it will be undercooked
food,not_removed,i clicked this hoping someone already asked that question thank you ☺
food,not_removed,because this is probably the first attempt of stepping out from the i can cook spaghetti zone
food,not_removed,it seems like you know what youre talking about so would you add any seasoning to the flour and breadcrumbs my nephew asked me to help him make homemade chicken nuggets and i wasnt sure if you add seasoning or just coat plain
food,not_removed,because its a really long time to make nuggets usually takes me about so i have no idea what someone would be doing for hours edit well last time i comment in this sub dont think you guys downvoted me enough
food,not_removed,meta
food,not_removed,its what the cool kids say it means nuggets
food,not_removed,yeah i thought i was on rtrees for a second all this stokedness about nuggs
food,not_removed,thank you
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,if youre familiar with the southeastern barbecue chain i used sonnys sweet bbq sauce
food,not_removed,chicken prep batter em up fry em all in batches of or and then cleaning all that time adds up and i think it was well worth the wait
food,not_removed,this would take about minutes including prep and clean up
food,not_removed,how about nuggies
food,not_removed,this is a food subreddit im guessing it is on your front page because you are subscribed to rfood
food,not_removed,came here to say this also
food,not_removed,rmisleadingthumbnails
food,not_removed,or fry once until lightly colored take out and let cool down meanwhile start next batch after the first batch is cooled a bit dump them back in the fryer for a couple more minutes this way they stay crunchier for longer you can also add potato flour to the flour mix which makes for extra crispy nuggets
food,not_removed,ok well you can go bigger than at a time and a quicker way if youre not using a batter or anything is to put your dredge wash coating in three separate big tupperware containers with lids throw in your chicken pop on the lid and shake vigorously saves a lot of time
food,not_removed,if the bubbles sound any faster than a normal rain then its too hot if the bubbles sound like just a sprinkle its too cool
food,not_removed,i find meat really difficult to fry aswell i always end up overcooking or undercooking itso difficult to strike a balance
food,not_removed,tip let the breading on the outside tell you when its done fry it golden brown or just a little darker and you should be good every time
food,not_removed,i added some salt pepper garlic powder and paprika to the flour and some parmesan cheese to the breadcrumbs i would recommend at least using salt and pepper instead of totally plain
food,not_removed,i add seasonings to the flour a lot of salt and some pepper if people like it and some garlic powder for good measure edit to say the coating method is typically seasoned flour first which some people expect egg first then beaten egg then breadcrumbs
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,also used in the ever popular httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermnuggs
food,not_removed,care to share some haha
food,not_removed,what was the chicken prep did you bone the chicken its hard to tell from the finished product i usually use chicken breasts which are easily cut into chunks having a station set up is great way to save time as is using a good breading procedure station simple as setting up your bowl of cut up chicken flour egg and breadcrumbs in order right next to the fryer if possible if not possible transfer to a plate then to the fryer do not work more than one batch ahead things get soggy and start sticking to the plate procedure one hand wet one hand dry wet hand picks up chicken and drops into flour dry hand turns chicken gripping already coated areas as much as possible dry hand transfers dredged chicken to egg wash wet hand turns and transfers to breadcrumbs dry hand turns and transfers to oil takes some concentration and practice but the mess reduction is worth it skip the tupperware unless you like the idea of tracking down all those bits of chicken juice and crud youll fling all over your kitchen
food,not_removed,ive read people using corn starch as well ive never tried it tho
food,not_removed,yeah ill probably try more than next time and i used that trick for the flour ill have to do the eggs and breadcrumbs the same way next time thanks for the advice
food,not_removed,does this works well with the breacrumbs as well i always have to feeling that they dont stick that well to the egg and that shaking them would destroy the all thing great tip nonetheless
food,not_removed,so like rain in california lol
food,not_removed,depends how old your oil is will have a big affect on color when it floats its done
food,not_removed,thank you so much ill use it this weekend
food,not_removed,the flour holds the egg on which holds the breadcrumbs on i can say from personal experience that the breading will be around the chicken rather than on it if you skip the flour step
food,not_removed,thank you so much
food,not_removed,did you bone the chicken this is why it took him hours
food,not_removed,good tip there re wet and dry hand whenever i breadcumb a lot of stuff i end up with a mixture of floureggbreadcrumbs in a ball on the end of each finger they are actually quite nice deep fried though
food,not_removed,procedure one hand wet one hand dry cant stress this enough massively reduces cleaning and you end up with more usable mix since its not caked all over fingers
food,not_removed,ill do you one better brine your chicken for hours ahead of time its the secret to my chicken and everyone believes its gotta be something more complicated
food,not_removed,i dont know if anyone has mentioned it yet but instead if normal breadcrumbs use panko next time they come out waaaaay better
food,not_removed,thyme leaves in the bread crumbs mmmm yum salt and pepper in both the flour and bread crumbs and use panko bread crumbs theyre nicer
food,not_removed,jesus
food,not_removed,ive always imagined thats how hushpuppies began at a fishfry
food,not_removed,i think chick fil a uses pickle juice but what do you use to brine your chicken
food,not_removed,yes brine but be careful not to oversalt brining aids osmosis and hydrates the proteins over more or more water goes into the interstitial spaces in the meat over salting changes the osmotic balance and will reduce the amount of water going in to the chicken really over salt and you will draw moisture out of the meat
food,not_removed,isnt hours really long for a brine i thought a being was supposed to be closer to or the meat gets too salty
food,not_removed,i really prefer dry brines over wet ones to me the chicken just comes out watery and with a weird texture brined chicken breast has little flavor on its own as is i dont like watering that flavor down even more
food,not_removed,i cook mine in a sous vide for an hour after coating the chicken with paprika chili powder cayenne pepper garlic salt onion salt and black pepper then i mix the same spices into the panko then i brown it in a skillet with some oil and serve edit did i say something wrong
food,not_removed,the story we get in the south about hushpuppies is they started making them out of left over cornmeal from the fish the throw at the dogs to shut them up while you fried the fish dont know if its true or not but thats what they say
food,not_removed,nothing beats buttermilk the most tender chicken you will eat do it overnight
food,not_removed,kosher salt and accent for basic chicken that plus orange juice bay leaves onion powder peppercorns for more complicated dishes
food,not_removed,i cut up the chicken and soak them in buttermilk overnight no buttermilk where im at so i just use milkvinegar it really does make a difference compared to no briningmarinading
food,not_removed,butter milk hot sauce paprika dill peppercorns and coriander seeds
food,not_removed,next time definitely add pickle juice in with your eggmilk combo it adds a whole new world of flavor looks good and dont stop cooking im now and i can cook better than most restaurants i go to so i just cook at home a lot plus the ladies love it lol
food,not_removed,it depends on what youre brining ill dry brine a turkey for hours eye of round for hours before roasting it to get a tender but cheap roast beef i have had to brine it for hours stuff happened unable to roast it the day i had planned and holy cow was the texture fantastic tiny chicken pieces like this not more than hours its also not a salty thing but rather a texture
food,not_removed,you do know that salt is a flavor enhancer right the chicken flavor comes from intramuscular fat and this will not leach away in brine or buttermilk
food,not_removed,plenty of people dislike sous vide i am not one of them
food,not_removed,what kind of accent do you use i try to do irish but i sound like a leprechaun
food,not_removed,ok two people said accent i thought it was a typo the first time what are we talking about here
food,not_removed,a little cream of tartar will do in a pinch
food,not_removed,milkvinegar what ratio and what kind of vinegar thanks
food,not_removed,marinading in pickle juice is great
food,not_removed,really have they tried it personally i love being able to cook my meat to a precise temp before searing it its fairly similar to a reverse sear or salmon with the lemon and orange worked into the meat so well youd think the fish was born with the flavor
food,not_removed,accent is a common brand name for powdered msg in the us
food,not_removed,great comment made my lunch hour
food,not_removed,msg
food,not_removed,curious about that together with milk and what are the ratios
food,not_removed,c milk and tbsp distilled white vinegar is what i use at least when im doing biscuits i did the same thing for pancakes the other day and they got a pretty wicked rise to them when they cooked
food,not_removed,dope i preordered a sous vide cooker like two years ago thats the end of the story
food,not_removed,the immersion circulator has the added bonus of requiring the purchase of a vacuum sealer which is great on its own even save quite a bit of food waste
food,not_removed,lol thought you were telling them to message you
food,not_removed,then why did they say accent couldnt an accent be anything that accentuates the dish
food,not_removed,if you ask me thats a great story i bet theres some steak or something in there too
food,not_removed,i dont use a vacuum sealer you can just use a zip lock bag if you open just the corner you can submerge the rest of the bag and the water pressure will push all of the air out i find with some things like hamburgers a vacuum sealer squishes them more than id like
food,not_removed,accent™
food,not_removed,its a brand name
food,not_removed,dont mind me just jumping on the bandwagon also accent is a brand of msg
food,not_removed,accent is a brand of msg seasoning
food,not_removed,msg is pretty unpopular in parts of the world many attribute it to bad science that scared people which is actually backed up by calling it something different and no one complaining
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,brand name
food,not_removed,accent is a specific brand of seasoning its probably easier to find at a lot of grocery stores than straight msg
food,not_removed,has anyone said that its a brand name
food,not_removed,accent is a brand name msg is sold under in the us since people are scared of msg
food,not_removed,accent is a brand of msg
food,not_removed,accent is the brand
food,not_removed,msg is commonly referred to as flavor accent i read it as such but youre not wrong
food,not_removed,accent is the name brand

food,not_removed,would not eat i dont eat anything halal because its just cruel and disgusting
food,not_removed,you must prefer the caged animals loaded up on antibiotics and hormones instead i suppose
food,not_removed,i do do you actually think animals that are slaughtered halal are not on antibiotics and shit because they are and then they get their throats cut and bleed out often times while they are conscious check some youtube or liveleak footage maybe then you know what youre talking about
food,not_removed,i guess what makes the dough italian is that it includes egg and olive oil along with whatever sprinkles of whatever you want even though it rose so much the dough was firm and chewy with a thick crust
food,not_removed,can you tell me where and how to buy sushi grade fish my local grocers dont sell the fish because of food safety reasons
food,not_removed,i never had sushi before but that looks awesome

food,not_removed,a train wreck id gladly be a part of
food,not_removed,it kinda looks as if it was preeaten and returned to the oven
food,not_removed,that looks really delicious now im hungry btw pollo would be asado because pollo is male so pollo asado and carne asada
food,not_removed,i thought it was pollo asado could be wrong though
food,not_removed,thats alotta asada

food,not_removed,assuming this was taken in japan salmon is very uncommon in sushisashimi restaurants httpswwwquoracomwhyissalmonsushisashimipopulareverywhereexceptjapan of course more modern style restaurants will serve it if you ask
food,not_removed,really im japanese but i never heard that fact salmon is pretty popular in japan
food,not_removed,this was the reason that was given to me during my visit i visited three sushi places in japan and no one would serve salmon to me one in ginza tokyo one in naha okinawa and one in kawasaki kanagawa theyre pretty popular touristy areas too maybe its a bullshit excuse they give to foreigners who they dont like i dunno what to tell you lmao
food,not_removed,im japanese too and i eat it a lot never heard of it being unsafe
food,not_removed,oh damn
food,not_removed,recipe
food,not_removed,chicken pot pie my favorite things
food,not_removed,chickens
food,not_removed,please may i have a recipe
food,not_removed,very nice my sister in law and mom are gluten free
food,not_removed,howwwww please
food,not_removed,sure i used for the filling replacing the flour with gluten free flour obviously i used a brand called but you could really just use something cheap like rice flour i also replaced the parsley with some fresh thyme and rosemary i used for the crust as far as gluten free goes its actually really flaky and awesome though id still be eating gluten if i could lol
food,not_removed,lamb chops are meat lollipops
food,not_removed,thats a very basic addition to this thread

food,not_removed,so instead of fries as a side you had them throw fries on top of the burger why
food,not_removed,culvers has one of the best burgers ive ever had top it off with some cheese curds and a mountain dew ugh of course being a utahn i dip all of it in fry sauce
food,not_removed,they have great burgers but five guys has them beat by far
food,not_removed,if guys can beat them then i can beat them if i can beat them then its not worth an upvote leaving now
food,not_removed,freddies steak burgers takes the cake though👌🏻
food,not_removed,what have you ever had five guys theres five guys and culvers near me and i do enjoy culvers but no fast food chain on the east coast can beat five guys
food,not_removed,if were talking fast food alright theyre pretty good but i got a place called burger works that beats em and is just about as fast i havent really done a speed comparison but it feels about the same on time i am a little prejudiced because of a time i was soo hungry and ordered a burger with all the stuff for pickup then a fucking hurricane came and the power went out and i never got my burger im still in therapy for it burgerbandonment issues yes spell check i invented burgerbandonment
food,not_removed,i need a burger
food,not_removed,jumpin on the burgerbandonment bandwagon i see
food,not_removed,this gives me anxiety why would you casually teeter your plate like this 😓
food,not_removed,what is it
food,not_removed,life on the edge makes the food taste all that much better
food,not_removed,hope you enjoy my fun swap for mapo tofu but substituting ground pork for spicy italian sausage the seasoning with the italian sausage adds another dimension of flavor its the perfect stew for cold weather not to mention super nourishing and healthy
food,not_removed,not every dish needs to be posted online
food,not_removed,ok this is super very unhealthy but it was so good so i made the dough last night for quesadillas but i didnt use all of it so today i rolled out a few more tortillas and cooked them then i cooked the burgers just as i would cheeseburgers but i cooked them in lard for flavor while that was going i cooked some retried beans in bacon fat for flavor honestly this wasnt my fav brand of beans they needed something then i coated the outside of the tortillas in mayonnaise put the burger in it topped the burger with chipotle sour cream i whipped together a chipotle pepper i cooked with the burger salsa i made fresh last night and the beans i wrapped it up and pan fried it then plunged it in hot oil to deep fry and voila really bad for you but so so good
food,not_removed,very rarely like very very rarely i also didnt have much else in my house and decided to get creative but im from the south so fried foods lard bacon grease is something i grew up knowing everyone needs to have bacon grease i their freezer it adds so much goodness to so many things from eggs to collards to black eyed peas and much more in moderation with a little exercise you can eat this and not be obese it is really good but definitely not something to make often

food,not_removed,those flavors sound wonderful 🤤
food,not_removed,wow ive had tons of bao its one of my favorite special snacks but i never knew they had flavors like these hmmm i wonder if theyll beat the good ol pork bao
food,not_removed,you mean power dumplings

food,not_removed,the pink one was porkshrimp yellow was crab light purple was fish green was veggies i think leekspinach gray was porkblack sesame and the regular one was just pork i liked them all except the fishcrab wasnt used to those flavors
food,not_removed,im always in the mood for xlb even the frozen ones from ranch
food,not_removed,city of industry ca i wish singapore
food,not_removed,ooo never had those
food,not_removed,good ol pork bao is extremely difficult if not impossible to beat though i have to say those pan fried dumplings are a pretty close
food,not_removed,i had them in shanghai they were 👌🏻 xbl thats a new term love it
food,not_removed,ah jealous that sounds awesome
food,not_removed,actually the term soup dumpling is more of a misnomer dumplings by definition are dumped into liquid and cooked these are steamed hence why theyre baos
food,not_removed,have you been
food,not_removed,unfortunately no i would love to in the future as i love the idea of the street markets where you can just grab food on the side of the road
food,not_removed,where exactly is this cut from i guess ive just never seen a tomohawk cut
food,not_removed,beautiful cut of meat
food,not_removed,i believe its a ribeye httpgreatbritishmeatcomrecipesandtipsmiscellanywhatistomahawksteakhtml sorry for the sloppiness im on mobile
food,not_removed,not even the best shitty food in ireland most decent chippers are better than supermacs
food,not_removed,taco fries made me think of taco rice from okinawa id hit that
food,not_removed,would get drunk and eat here
food,not_removed,they look so delicious you made me hungry at midnight shame on you delicious shame q
food,not_removed,recipe here
food,not_removed,pretty simple meal for myself just browned a pound of ground beef then added a jar of classico roasted garlic spaghetti sauce plenty of leftovers and served with a and premade garlic bread from safeway
food,not_removed,this is surely a pisstake
food,not_removed,needs more peas i know this because i can still see some shrimp showing other than that es todo un éxito
food,not_removed,why
food,not_removed,because i see no rice which traditionally is an important component of paella peas are not a traditional paella ingredient im not sure what those brown discs of mysterymeat are but im pretty sure they dont belong in a paella
food,not_removed,the rice is at the bottom so it can absorb broth i just put in the veggies i had the brown discs are chorizo which chorizo with shrimp or chicken is a pretty popular form of paella but im guessing that your the type of person who thinks that if it isnt traditional its wrong
food,not_removed,my grandpa was in the navy and he had stories about this too
food,not_removed,yes was my favorite breakfast during basic years ago
food,not_removed,from what i understand yes yes they do and i am glad that shit is good
food,not_removed,nice thanks for your service
food,not_removed,beautiful if only it were horizontal
food,not_removed,could be the spices or the colour balances of the photo but those prawns look a little undercooked to me
food,not_removed,well fyi no use eating a salad if you gonna use that much dressing
food,not_removed,wrong fat is fine when you dont do carbs
food,not_removed,personally i couldnt stomach it with that much dressing either but most people who eat salads do so because they like salad not just because its often a conventionally healthier option
food,not_removed,veggies are carbs
food,not_removed,carbs from fiber dont matter only the ones that convert to sugar are the problem
food,not_removed,here is the recipe
food,not_removed,heres the pork loin slathered in sauerkraut roasted with potatoes
food,not_removed,thats fucking gross
food,not_removed,dont ever cook anything ever again please or if you do leave it off of here
food,not_removed,agreed

food,not_removed,you can add truffles to just about anything and it would taste amazing except for cabbage lets eradicate cabbage
food,not_removed,did you use real truffles or the oil which brand in particular if you used the oil
food,not_removed,ferment some in a grapefruit pickling mix and put it on fish youll be in heaven
food,not_removed,but but what about after i need to see how well those lines held up i need it
food,not_removed,the closest one in the corner is imperfect it cant be unseen
food,not_removed,they held gorgeously actually i made another post where the baked product is in the background but if you zoom you can see how well they held up it helps to give them a quick shot in the freezer beforehand to firm up the butter
food,not_removed,you should see the other side looks like a desecrated new york skyline
food,not_removed,but wheres the picture
food,not_removed,here
food,not_removed,do you have a recipe that you would be willing to share
food,not_removed,i used this recipe but cut the flour to cups for the chocolate batch use cups of flour and cup of cocoa powder
food,not_removed,i had beef cheeks on my last cruiseamazing
food,not_removed,charcoaled to a crisp
food,not_removed,wish i could find some ive been smoking chuck roasts as opposed to brisket i prefer them makes for great tacos the next day as well
food,not_removed,yeah im gonna need a slice
food,not_removed,based off the recipe from the back of the bakers chocolate box recipe but i swirled in a bit of some raspberry jam seedless and made a homemade whipped cream to dollop on the side furthermore the original recipe used the unsweetened chocolate with sugar but i blend a mix of the bittersweet and semisweet without added sugar and it comes out so freaking good the graham cracker crust was easy to lots of butter
food,not_removed,yeah im gonna need a whole torte edit e
food,not_removed,yes
food,not_removed,so much yes
food,not_removed,this makes me angry that im only allowed to downvote once
food,not_removed,this was very unsatisfying
food,not_removed,why
food,not_removed,ingredients salt large eggs and large yolks room temperature ounce about packed cup grated pecorino romano plus additional for serving ounce about packed cup grated parmesan coarsely ground black pepper tablespoon olive oil ½ ounces of slab guanciale see recipe pancetta or bacon sliced into pieces about inch thick by inch square ounces spaghetti about box preparation place a large pot of lightly salted water no more than tablespoon salt over high heat and bring to a boil fill a large bowl with hot water and set aside in a mixing bowl whisk together the eggs yolks and pecorino and parmesan season with a pinch of salt and generous black pepper set the water to boil meanwhile heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat add the pork and sauté until the fat just renders on the edge of crispness but not hard remove from heat and set aside add pasta to the water and boil until a bit firmer than al dente just before pasta is ready reheat guanciale in skillet if needed reserve cup of pasta water then drain pasta and add to the skillet over low heat stir for a minute or so empty serving bowl of hot water dry it and add hot pasta mixture stir in cheese mixture adding some reserved pasta water if needed for creaminess serve immediately dressing it with a bit of additional grated pecorino and pepper
food,not_removed,the idea of putting in the same plate shrimps and carbonara and focaccia is so notitalian we usually have a big plate full of carbonara and then a big plate full of shrimps or other things this is not a critique just a note on different customs around the world plus i dont like when different kind of foods touch each other but thats is probably me
food,not_removed,think about how minor that is you do have these two things but just not on the same plate its like how italians talk about how spaghetti and meatballs arent italian because you would eat those two things separately if youd rather call it italianamerican and it implies less pretension i guess thats the way to go
food,not_removed,this was my first time ever making and even trying carbonara so plating was the least of my worries and hate me but a bite of shrimp and pasta together was delicious i am so notitalian if you cant tell
food,not_removed,im sure it is delicious they look good here some restaurants also make a sort of seafood carbonara with fish and shrimps instead of bacon so it is really not a strange meeting that happening in your mouth
food,not_removed,reminds me of the only time i had real chinese food a little honolulu mom and pop chinese restaurant looked pretty humble outside but it was sooooo good i was always told while there the best food was always found in the places that werent advertised as in places that had the loyalty of the community and not tourists also i was told look for places that served plate lunches i was never disappointed in what i found following that advice
food,not_removed,actual chinese food is so good
food,not_removed,is that a whole chicken in there i mean duck
food,not_removed,this is a real delicacy every time i go to a big city like nyc its savory slightly sweet well seasoned a bit fatty and simply delicious i could eat it everyday
food,not_removed,for those that havent tried go look for an authentic chinese restaurant in your area none of that overly sweet deep fried chicken and pork nonsense if they offer sweet and sour pork they probably dont offer real authentic chinese food those places would probably only serve largely diced stir fry masquerading as real chinese food
food,not_removed,pretty sure thats duck
food,not_removed,sweet and sour pork is a traditional dish and is consumed frequently in china especially in the northeast region i do agree that is not prepared or served traditionally at most chinese restaurants in america though
food,not_removed,sweet and sour pork is quite common i went on a trip round china and it was often served in the many restaurantscantines be they in the city or the more rural areas fell in love with chinese cuisine on that trip not quite sure what youre talking about
food,not_removed,recipe op please we need it
food,not_removed,looks delicious but you should try shredding a block of mozzarella instead of pre shredded it melts in the oven better and stays stringy there are additives in shredded cheese to keep it from sticking to itself in the package
food,not_removed,i need dem calories
food,not_removed,wheres the steak
food,not_removed,recipe
food,not_removed,more cheese please
food,not_removed,hnnnnnnghhhh
food,not_removed,wtf is chili sauce you mean chili
food,not_removed,lay out a bag of steak fries season with paprika rosemary salt and pepper and a small sprinkle of parmesan put the tray in the oven and whilst they begin to cook fry up bacon and onion together chop bacon and set aside with onion take out chips flip and season again top with bacon onion and your cheese i used cheddar and parmesan leave in the oven untill cheese is melted drizzle with some chilli sauce and enjoy
food,not_removed,i didnt have any mozerella at home at the time buy i will keep this in mind

food,not_removed,yeah i suppose in australia if you ask for chilli you will likely get fresh chilli instead of the sauce

food,not_removed,what kind of ham and what kind of cheese
food,not_removed,how did you concoct such amazingness
food,not_removed,haha thank you im falling back in love with my waffle iron
food,not_removed,mind blown who needs a stupid george foreman or panini maker when you can have waffle sandwiches
food,not_removed,seriously ive been trying to waffle iron so many things now ive done funfetti cake waffles which were pretty good the waffle iron brownies i couldnt get right it made great brownie brittle though
food,not_removed,applegate uncured black forest ham and brie
food,not_removed,i had the waffle iron out from making funfetti cake waffles earlier in the day and inspiration just struck it really is quite tasty the bread gets nice and buttery toasty

food,not_removed,pass the honey honey
food,not_removed,youre telling me
food,not_removed,a lot of people dont even consider it a pizza because theyre new york thin crust purists but this is personally the best pizza you can eat in my opinion youre supposed to eat it down to the crusts and then put honey on them for desert
food,not_removed,im in trinidad can you come bring mesome
food,not_removed,neat never heard of this style of pizza before but it sounds delicious
food,not_removed,im in boulder bud and its already gone sorry lol i guess you gotta shell out for a beau jos pizza if you want a mountain pie tonight lol
food,not_removed,crunchy on the outside fluffy on the inside thicker crusts its the bomb you should check it out it is delicious haha
food,not_removed,all we have here is pizza hut a family owned pizzeria that uses brick oven called bella lunas thats it rest tastes like shit not even a dominos smh i usually go to safeway for digorno
food,not_removed,i shouldve known better than to assume trinidad had a beau jos lol
food,not_removed,my safeway has raw dough its near the deli take a look or ask itll turn out nice
food,not_removed,raw dough is so good when you take confectioners sugar a little flour and a pinch of cinnamon what i like to do is take the raw dough out at night and put it in a large mixing bowl in a large clump ball i then cover it with two layers of paper towels and let it sit overnight in the morning it has risen i make handmade pies and fry them in canola oil in a frying pan ive also injected moozerella cheese into them surprisingly tasty with sugar and cinnamon its just so good mix a cup of milk with ovaltine etc i got the idea from my mom every sunday we would rat deep fried dough with lunch meat no sugar tho on dough

food,not_removed,that salmon looks strangely like chicken
food,not_removed,i totally have the same plates as you
food,not_removed,how the hell do i keep my asparagus from going all chewy seriously its either crunchy undercooked or assless chaps leather tough
food,not_removed,i love your plates 😍
food,not_removed,salmon mustard honey im not sure i buy those flavour combos
food,not_removed,and by seared you mean grilled
food,not_removed,i dont what to be rude but the salmon looks burned
food,not_removed,and now im hungry
food,not_removed,hungry again even i just finished my meal
food,not_removed,thanks for the post will definitely try how sweet was it
food,not_removed,its am and now i want salmon
food,not_removed,i need this for friday no meat lent
food,not_removed,looks very tasty
food,not_removed,interesting ill have to try this honey harissa is my go to for salmon
food,not_removed,that aint no alaskan salmon
food,not_removed,thank you
food,not_removed,recipe please looks delicious
food,not_removed,i wish i had another photo of it looking more like salmon it does look exactly like chicken in this photo
food,not_removed,they make everything look so much fancier haha
food,not_removed,so whered you get those plates
food,not_removed,blanch it
food,not_removed,not sure what youre doing with it but all i do is put it in a dish with some butter and put it in the oven for min roasted asparagus is the best
food,not_removed,upvote for your toughness description
food,not_removed,you have to discard the stem towards the end its more woody there its different for each asparagi but usually need to remove inches there is a trick if you bend it at the edge itll snap in half at the right spot or just hack the ends off
food,not_removed,grill it
food,not_removed,its actually a pretty classic combination
food,not_removed,not super sweet i loooove sweet flavors with salmon but we only had just enough honey to hit the amount for the recipe if i was making again id probably add a bit more
food,not_removed,sure thing marinade for about a pound of salmon honey tbsp dijon mustard tbsp soy sauce tsp apple cider vinegar tbsp cooking oil tbsp paprika tsp salt and pepper whatever makes your heart happy we only marinaded it for about an hour which is probably a sin but we were starving with a days marination it would probably next level stuff considering how flavorful it was in an hour we grilled it preheated to with a cooler section on one side sear it on each side for about three minutes with the grill closed then move it to the cooler side and cook it to your desired doneness asparagus was good old fashioned oil salt and pepper roasted for eightish minutes
food,not_removed,honey mustard and salmon
food,not_removed,i believe op but it really does look like chicken
food,not_removed,haha i think the mustard gave it a poultry tint not that it looks any less delicious
food,not_removed,ops house
food,not_removed,i got mine at wal mart
food,not_removed,yeah i got the whole set from walmart a couple years ago
food,not_removed,bop it
food,not_removed,actually its a bad idea to marinate salmon and other fish for two long overnight would probably result in overly mushy salmon an hour was about right
food,not_removed,how was it
food,not_removed,we have those plates as well
food,not_removed,pull it
food,not_removed,til the recipe suggested up to a day thanks for the info now i can feel a bit better about rushing it
food,not_removed,its bad to marinade fish for too long in an acidic marinade lemon or other acids will degrade the proteins making it mushy this one doesnt look too acidic and it looks like it turned out fine
food,not_removed,it was excellent the salmon came out great and i loved the searing the asparagus was a bit chewy and might have been worth a little more attention before the grilling the flavors were great just not the most flattering thing to gnaw on at the dinner table
food,not_removed,ah ok i thought the soy sauce and apple cider vinegar would have an effect but fair enough
food,not_removed,if it was bathing in them youre right it definitely would but thats per pound on this recipe
food,not_removed,cats and pizza its what makes the world go round
food,not_removed,when it comes to pizza people will do anything
food,not_removed,i decided to make peanut butter truffles for valentines day they are filled with homemade peanut butter ganache and caramel sauce and chopped up sees candy peanut brittle they are rather large and taste amazing i love my skull candy molds and really wanted to find a way to use them on for valentines day so i used chocolate to glue large candy heart sprinkles for that love struck look they guy i have a crush on makes me feel so sprung i feel like the walking dead sometimes so i thought these be perfect
food,not_removed,lovely excellent truffles
food,not_removed,better coffee maybe i love panera but their coffee is like weak tea
food,not_removed,all chefs hate you you medium lover
food,not_removed,looks great just needed about more minutes
food,not_removed,pulled it out at degrees i prefer my steak about rare plus d it was absolutely perfectly moist and tender after sitting for minutes after pulling it out
food,not_removed,i always get down voted for saying i like mine medium just barely a slight pink in the very centre
food,not_removed,that thing is perfect looks delicious
food,not_removed,medium is the perfect inbetween
food,not_removed,cast iron potatoes sound tough
food,not_removed,casual cut with scissors to see if cooked right are the signs of an amateur steak cooker d
food,not_removed,is this floridan style looks very delicious
food,not_removed,they came out really good actually i mixed them in smoked paprika kosher salt and olive oil then i cooked them in peanut oil on the cast iron in my grill
food,not_removed,i am an amateur but this cut was actually made about minutes after resting the steaks my fiance is picky so i always have to cut in and say which one looks good to you
food,not_removed,ive learned i hope a lot from rsteak
food,not_removed,you didnt mention your own culture so its hard to say id do a traditional breakfast in your own culture maybe have something with a nod to what theyre used to so theyre not thrown completely make them feel comfortable breakfast is wake up food its not a time to be daring id pull back and make something you know tried and true if you were making dinner and had the advantage of alcohol to get them in the mood to try stuff then id say go with innovative my advice go with something solid you already know will be good your so already loves you they just want to be comfortable with you
food,not_removed,india madagascar indonesia and australia are closest to being on the opposite side of the world from mexico so id try something from one of those places edit honestly i think ukareemabduljabbq has the right idea
food,not_removed,eggs benedict chicken and waffles or crepes with cream and fruit filling are the first three meals that pop into my head
food,not_removed,italian baked beans israeli shakshuka or however you spell it british sandwiches french toast pancakes egg cups omelette there is so much good breakfast just make something that you actually like and are confident in pulling off it needs to be good not special or exotic
food,not_removed,that would sound like a great idea but unfortunately i have taste buds
food,not_removed,do you enjoy mayonnaise
food,not_removed,rsexypizza
food,not_removed,i think i would have a hard time actually consuming animal blood
food,not_removed,is this bun bo hue with pork instead of beef
food,not_removed,it is difficult to overcome when you dont grow up eating it its a staple ingredient in lots of vietnamese soup dishes so ive always enjoyed it
food,not_removed,its not bun bo hue its bun nuoc leo its a sweet broth with no spice but i added a ton of chili paste to my taste
food,not_removed,bun bo hue is garnished with crab stick or pork if theres beef its southern style not real hue style
food,not_removed,its blood source from hue
food,not_removed,thats not the problem
food,not_removed,doesnt bo mean beef in vietnamese
food,not_removed,you right
food,not_removed,the broth is made from cow bones not necessarily the meat on top
food,not_removed,it kinda becomes floating little meat sponges it gains a bit of texture but something more like a pate
food,not_removed,tbh i never seen bun bo hue with tomato in it before if theres tomato in a vietnamese noodle dish it is usually a tomato based broth
food,not_removed,doesnt the pork blood have a tough jelly like consistency rather than a pate
food,not_removed,yea same here lol maybe its a mixture of bun rieu and bun bo hue
food,not_removed,yes i think tough jelly is a great description kind of like jello made out of blood lol ive never had pork blood where it tasted like pate that texture describes pork liver better
food,not_removed,toasted sourdough yum
food,not_removed,i just got out of the gym and this looks delicious right now

food,not_removed,whenever i go with my gf i get all three best way to go
food,not_removed,the burgers at burger lobster are pretty great head to lukes on and for a better lobster roll though
food,not_removed,amazing matchnever seen this beforewanna have a try
food,not_removed,i went there thinking surely they had more on the menu than just burgers or lobster rolls i was in the mood for a salad i left there is no other items on the menu other than burgers and lobster rolls
food,not_removed,so like a dollar difference is a issue
food,not_removed,super good
food,not_removed,my wife works nearby and took me there a few times it was great still havent tried the burger though
food,not_removed,and broadwayish
food,not_removed,i see salad in the picture
food,not_removed,you can get whole lobsters too
food,not_removed,more like dollars difference
food,not_removed,pound is currently as a shorthand just divide by and add the result to the original number so pounds is approx bucks
food,not_removed,the uk does not use the euro
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,i read it as euro my bad
food,not_removed,the symbols look so similar my bad
food,not_removed,the symbols look too similar i was confused with the euro my bad

food,not_removed,what is sous vide
food,not_removed,nice job
food,not_removed,temp and time also did you reverse sear looks awesome lovely color on that meat
food,not_removed,oh no i think you just said the emperor has no clothes
food,not_removed,i tried making a sous vide burger once never again mushy texture and raw blood taste even after searing
food,not_removed,thats talking about store bought ground beef which definitely has a higher risk in general but im guessing that if someone has time to build a jacuzzi for their burger they also ground the meat them self if you grind your own meat theres no reason you cant eat it completely raw ive had beef tartare and beef carpaccio plenty of times and never gotten sick its a lot safer then eating the shredded lettuce at chipotle

food,not_removed,pizzas ima sell them shits future
food,not_removed,whats your brand where can i buy them this looks delicious
food,not_removed,it looks pretty legit but i honestly cant imagine youll be able to compete on price very well i mean a good pizza at a pizzeria can be for a medium size but the pizzas in stores like freschetta are half that price not to mention costco pizza but costco has craaaazy prices i guess it depends on how you source your ingredients i mean for instance if you grow your own tomatoes thats a lot cheaper than buying them which is cheaper still than buying sauce premade for instance
food,not_removed,amaze
food,not_removed,fsho yo
food,not_removed,the best frozen pizza i know here in sweden are dollars really crispysoft chewy thick crust nice amount of mozarella pesto and really sweet cherry tomatoes and honestly this pizza is not just good for being frozen pizza its good for being pizza imo and people that has never tried it and get a piece are all like wow is this really frozen pizza ive never really seen anything here being cheaper or can even compete in prices with usa what other frozen pizzas do you have that are good quality for frozen pizza but ok prices

food,not_removed,usd how large is it a normal medium pizza here is inches in diameter and you can get a decent frozen medium pizza for also i wouldnt generally describe good pizza as soft
food,not_removed,seattle nyc anywhere in the united states i cant even get a large pizza for at dominos nevermind a real pizzeria which isnt even a fair comparison since a large at dominos is but a large at a pizzeria is usually
food,not_removed,amazedoughballs
food,not_removed,perfect name 😂
food,not_removed,queso
food,not_removed,i believe because cows are inseminated to keep producing milk or something lol
food,not_removed,this comment coming from the guy who thinks my views on life are fucked up what a hypocrite you are
food,not_removed,im talking about this one
food,not_removed,i dont know how many inches the focus on our pizzas here is weight and it weighs lbs or ounces and is about calories
food,not_removed,you can get that anywhere in new york state outside the city maybe bucks at most if they have no specials and then pretty much every other pizzeriareal pizzeria not chain crap a large pizza can be had for bucks one local italian place near me makes inchyes fucking inches pizzas and sells them whole or by the slice slices can be had for like dollars and some odd cents
food,not_removed,which is impossible frozen pizza will never be good
food,not_removed,i didnt even realize xd
food,not_removed,what the hell kind of mini pizza is that a inch frozen pizza here the one i tend to get anyway is calories and ounces thats on the small side as well a real pizza is at least inches
food,not_removed,well enjoy it because literally anywhere ive ever been including pa wa ny fl or ca its at least for a large pizza usually closer to maybe even again you cant even usually get a large pizza for at a fast food chain
food,not_removed,haha a normal meal calories is still almost half of a normal sized male daily intake its a nice normal meal for me atleast and im not small and work out several times a week the biggest one i know we have here in sweden is grams and is funnily enough both called a big one and branded as american pan pizza and that is about calories but our portions are smaller and im pretty sure our population is smaller too so ive seen tvshows like diners driveins dives etc and the portions are considerably larger overall same at mcdonalds for example
food,not_removed,well you typically share a pizza or save some for later or something most people dont eat a whole pizza i mean thatd be like eating an entire pie or an entire cake normal serving is probably slices maybe up to for dinner or something thats only half a pizza medium sized are usually cut into instead of so slices are similar in size
food,not_removed,okay yeah we dont share p pizzas in restaurants are usually size maybe kidssize too in some places and dont come sliced either
food,not_removed,d
food,not_removed,we have pizza hut though they have small medium and large pizzas and they have slices but its not that popular here we dont have many pizza chains i can think of on the top of my head and they are not widespread at all its just a shit ton of local shops everywhere interesting with different pizza cultures we often order pizza together in sweden pizzas in go but everyone always order their own and we eat together like a normal dinner either slices them ourselves or with fork and knife and the most popular pizza in sweden is with kebab and garlic sauce and often a hot sauce i just took a random kebabpizza from internet i like mine with sallad and tomato on it too
food,not_removed,pizza hut serves cardboard with ketchup and plastic on top of course its not popular
food,not_removed,i dont have any experience of pizza outside of sweden basically ive not visited places that are known for pizza but i really like pizza hut here they have nice crusts chewy crusts and good amount of toppings with nice cheese and not bad sauce like ketchup i like their buffés with different pizzas each day its just that swedes like their own style of pizza restaurants more
food,not_removed,ate this the other day at kaffi krus in selfoss iceland it was definitely more food than i expected but it was pretty amazing although difficult to finish since my girlfriend refused to help me eat it

food,not_removed,always makes me laugh living in mass when people go nuts over lobster rolls and go to tourist places to get them and pay a small fortune for it lol
food,not_removed,the idea of a roll is to fill one up when there is a marginal amount of lobster in this case a roll isnt needed it adds nothing to the taste of the lobster in fact take away the fries and ketchup and just leave the drawn butter besides even if it were on a roll the pieces are way too big to be on a roll
food,not_removed,this looks amazing but the price seems a bit ridic
food,not_removed,driving up to maine and they have these shacks along the road best dish in the world you have to try both the buttered roll and the mayo version too
food,not_removed,no fillerminus the fries
food,not_removed,only at the right places in va is waaaay too much
food,not_removed,filler is what makes it a lobster roll youre literally ruining lobster by putting in a hotdog bun and eating it with fries
food,not_removed,looks ok

food,not_removed,oh yes you need to take a trip to maine dollar lobstah rolls so yummy
food,not_removed,fuck i live in the dirty nasty south we get ours for per pound at a farmers market and per pound from publix
food,not_removed,im a boston native who moved to the seattle area several years ago currently up in everett while theres tons of great seafood around i have yet to find a lobster roll anywhere any ideas
food,not_removed,our live lobsters are at a pound depending on where you go if you know a lobster guy and can get to him before he sells to the markets a pound
food,not_removed,i get mine for a pound cooked for me too this is in maine of course
food,not_removed,dude spot prawns and dungeness is all you need when youre in the pnw spot prawns have a short season so get em while you can

food,not_removed,you may want to check uwajimaya or whatever its called the seafood companies that operate out of seattle which are clients of the place i work at dont catch lobster and are entirely oriented towards national distribution and frozen products mostly because they are catching massive amounts of alaskan cod and pollack in what are basically massive floating fishstick factories
food,not_removed,right now its near our house and we are about minutes from some lobstermen on the coast of maine we honeymooned in seattle a few years back and in the market they advertised previously frozen maine lobster tails for they were caught in canada that made us laugh

food,not_removed,quahog thats a real thing
food,not_removed,yes feeling the same as you right now when my wife works with international visitors they comment on how great the food is here im proud of the positive nb vibes in this thread since it has such a bad rep
food,not_removed,how are you actually supposed to eat lobster rolls seems like a weird choice to pair a very expensive seafood with literally the worst kind of bread
food,not_removed,i hate sandwiches at new york delis too much fuckin meat on the sandwich its like a cow with a cracker on either side walk in order a pastrami sandwich alright anything else yeah a loaf of bread and some other people mitch hedberg
food,not_removed,i think you eat some of the lobster off the top first cuz there is butter on the side i dont think ive ever buttered lobster on a roll is there even mayo on that
food,not_removed,totally with you if shits falling out of the rolls its just too much like an over filled burrito i got this number for in halifax which works to be about usd good size and mayo ratio
food,not_removed,i kind of agree with you i eat about half of the meat before i can actually make into an actual roll im a drawn butter fan with just a dollop of mayo
food,not_removed,you telling me that if someone made you a nice italian sub and then put just a bit of extra salami on the side just because that you wouldnt appreciate that with this sandwich thing id keep all the lobster that fits on there and eat the other piece or two by itself its always nice to have leftovers boyo
food,not_removed,try going to a lobster buffet where you can have as many lobsters as you want after about im full
food,not_removed,and charge twice as much am i rite
food,not_removed,too much lobster is something youd only ever hear in massachusetts
food,not_removed,i agree but i think similar to some over flowing clam rolls you eat off the top with a fork or fingers until the roll is manageable ive had clam rolls where you cant see the bun when the plate comes so its basically a plate of fried clams and then a clam roll at the end lol
food,not_removed,as a guy who recently ate a pound lobster roll no there is never too much lobster
food,not_removed,cant you just eat some of the lobster while dipping it in butter then eat the lobster roll problem solved and im assuming that was the intention
food,not_removed,too fuck that give me my goddamn reds eats nobleboro me
food,not_removed,protip remove any extra unwanted lobster and place to the side
food,not_removed,omg i was just binge watching gordon ramsays kitchen nightmares and he had a similar plate and said the exact same thing lol
food,not_removed,seriously waiter theres too much of this expensive lobster on my plate and not enough of the free dinner rolls as filler
food,not_removed,all i want is max lobster the other shits a bonus besides once you eat enough of it you can finish it roll style
food,not_removed,i dont understand that critique at all
food,not_removed,yup thought the exact same thing

food,not_removed,thats not crazy at all most of us in maine eat them that way also we will put a little less meat in them but also sell them a lot cheaper they eat easy and taste better that way i just saw a for deal at my favorite place
food,not_removed,because thats how youre supposed to make them
food,not_removed,i said elsewhere but i find frozen langoustine to be an acceptable substitute super convenient similar taste both are lobster quarter of the price
food,not_removed,yes we eat french fries on the side of essentially any sandwich
food,not_removed,plan on smoking that lobster
food,not_removed,new bedford whalers tavern
food,not_removed,youre telling me thats expensive that looks like of shellfish to me
food,not_removed,it works thats why why layer lobster meat on a bun with more going on lobster is star plus thats the way its done if you make it at home you can make it any way you like traditional lobster rolls are lobster mayo dash of celery on a buttered hot dog roll
food,not_removed,its more like lawbstah
food,not_removed,thanks for the pic and the name of the restaurant i made a note of the restaurant name and location with pic of course on my cell so next time im in the area i will certainly make it a priority a stop for one of those one of the best looking lobster rolls ive seen in a long time again thanks for the extremely appetizing post cheers

food,not_removed,please read the side bar your comment is removed
food,not_removed,thats not the idea of a lobster roll maybe that was the idea when it was created but its a dish of its own now and people eat lobster rolls because they want to eat lobster rolls not because they dont have enough lobster to fill them up
food,not_removed,its just under a pound of shucked lobsterits the best deal around here
food,not_removed,love the new england buttered roll i prefer light mayo and melted butter
food,not_removed,according to who
food,not_removed,it means theres nothing in there to make it seem like theres more lobster than there actually is

food,not_removed,all the meat is in the tail and claws dont be shy and crack those fuckers open in the headbody is some green stuff which is the tamale which we always take home and cook with pepperonions and eat with rice but its good on the table too
food,not_removed,what pappalegz said also if you want to have a lobster picnic or something most grocery stores that sell live lobsters will steam them for you for free this can be ridiculously cheap compared to a restaurant last time i did it i got x chicken lobsters for around during an inseason lobster glut so ymmv
food,not_removed,all day thinking about mayo on a lobster roll actually makes me wince a little
food,not_removed,what where i live in boston and have never seen these kinds of prices

food,not_removed,i dont get it
food,not_removed,i laughed and told him i was from boston then he recommended a nice frozen tilapia filet
food,not_removed,having moved from long island to chicago this is how i feel when i go to any oyster bars around here where they rave about the fresh flown in oysters from long island
food,not_removed,ask for suggestion laugh at suggestion
food,not_removed,funny i was just in boston weeks ago my server was telling me how i just had to try their tillamook cheeseburger i live in portland
food,not_removed,we have great seafood but ive never had bbq as good as i have had in memphis charlotte or austin i spoil myself twice a summer and order bbq from memphis
food,not_removed,its so funny to me to see and hear these stories and realize how much we coastal new englanders take for granted they cooked it on the spot haha priceless bought lobsters last weekend and cooked them at home i think it cost a total of bucks at the local grocery store steamers and little necks clams are equally cheap and make for some great summer clam boils with friends
food,not_removed,i wonder if that just has to do with local market prices with how common seafood is in seattle there is only so much they can get away with charging for lobster when other seafood is so cheap
food,not_removed,wegmans in south eastern pa has live lobsters for like
food,not_removed,live lobsters were just in pittsburgh last week youre looking in the wrong places or live in pennsyltucky
food,not_removed,i live in antarctica where the price of lobster is newborn baby per pound
food,not_removed,i find frozen langoustine is an acceptable substitute both are lobster
food,not_removed,yield from a lobster is about so at a pound youd be paying about to get of meat
food,not_removed,about of the weight of a live lobster is in the shell
food,not_removed,this is true i meal prep with salmon and my cousin in california thought i was living the life haha
food,not_removed,not nice 😢
food,not_removed,offpeak sometimes like in mainenh york me here
food,not_removed,things are cheaper at the source you dont say next youre gonna tell me that cocaine is cheaper in brazil and pineapples are cheaper in hawaii
food,not_removed,a pound lobster is about oz of meat though just to even up the comparison
food,not_removed,well thats better than we usually do
food,not_removed,you can get way way better deals than this in nova scotia
food,not_removed,eh
food,not_removed,absolutely quahogs are shellfish the small ones littlenecks cherrystones are steamed and eaten the larger ones are steamed chopped and mixed with breading spices and portuguese sausage such as linguica or chourico lots of places locally make their own stuffed quahogs and there is a larger local commercial manufacturer whaler seafood
food,not_removed,my husbands family on his mothers side shits all over the fact that we live here its like okay my rent is cheap as hell my building is safe and clean i live five minutes from the ocean and only about hour away from boston im less than ten minutes from a kick ass zoo for my daughter not to mention the park there is fantastic etc etc yeah it has its issues but if you mind your business you probably arent going to get fucked with just like southie was when i was growing up i like it here
food,not_removed,typically you put a more sane amount of meat per bun and new england are not the best bread out there but much better than most other hot dog buns ive seen when making these at home its usually the day after cooking lobster basically wed boil lobster for dinner eat it with butter etc then at the end of the evening everyhing that was leftover would be cleaned out of the shells and put in the fridge next day you make lobster rolls with the leftovers keeping it chilled and adding a little mayo pretty much a decent way to eat the leftover lobster meat still pretty good but not quite as good as fresh cooked with a bowl of butter to dip it in
food,not_removed,used to work in a seafood restaurant on cape cod the meat used for lobster rolls is generally from lobsters that are about to die theres not a large window for cooking lobster after it does so its a way to recoup the cost as lobster meat will last longer after cooked but you cant serve them in shell unless they were fresh usually you put it on a new england style bun which is marginally fancier
food,not_removed,agreed if i were ever to order one of those i would eat the lobster separate from the roll anyway or if its really that good with the roll eat some off the top with butter first im not going to complain about too much lobster
food,not_removed,and slathering it in mayonnaise dungeness crab melts are fairly rare in washington but these lobster roll things are everywhere in new england theres just better things to do with the meat
food,not_removed,lobster was originally a poor mans food fed to commercial dock laborers by their employers who didnt want to pay for better seafood for them eating it on a cheap bun is the classic way
food,not_removed,the bread is slathered in butter its not about the crappy bread its about the butter perfect match
food,not_removed,everything i go to the bell in hand tavern in boston i get the lobster mac and cheese next time i am getting the lobster grilled cheese it may seem weird eating lobster with cheap food like mac and cheese but it delicious in central ma i go to ronnies to get a quarter pound lobster roll and fried scallops such a good meal
food,not_removed,they gave me too much food im infuriated like wtf
food,not_removed,depends if they made a stupidly large sub that no one could eat was way overweight on meat and charged you too much then yes i would not like that ditto if they said i could have a sub but it was and came with a free sub next to it what
food,not_removed,me is maine
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,not that they are better than you just closer to the source
food,not_removed,you forgot the part where you say and feed the leftovers to me
food,not_removed,iirc it was because the dude was advertising expensive maine lobsters but serving less expensive versions er maybe im mixing up episodes

food,not_removed,thanks mate ill see you on the other side
food,not_removed,heyy is your username a reference to tunk lake
food,not_removed,nah theyre two different styles i like both tbh trick with the drawn butter variety is to butter it once when tossing the lobster and then again when serving it
food,not_removed,its oz the meat from a lobster sometimes i can get them in new jersey for
food,not_removed,i was thinking of jim gaffigans sarcastic accent
food,not_removed,probably but it is warmer waters so that equals different seafood
food,not_removed,like the people wouldnt stand for it run em outta town
food,not_removed,nice
food,not_removed,according to ugotgoing
food,not_removed,what do people add to do this crab stick
food,not_removed,and by your filler explanation lettuce romaine lettuce at that which is a cheap filler what is wrong with mayo if it makes it delicious personally i like to cook my lobster in butter in butter and use fresh peppery celery and tarty acidic shallots to balance the sandwich if you want pure lobster flavour get rid of the bread and crack it out of the shell yourself
food,not_removed,i love new beige
food,not_removed,funny im down near plymouth now in cape cod anything i should check out while im here sights and a good lunch spot i have to catch a plane in boston at so i dont have too long

food,not_removed,all i can comment on is the food i ate yesterday lobster roll and onion strings it was delicious for dinner i had a shrimp basket and it was awesome too ive eaten all over the us in the last years throughout the southeast and southwest mainly and that place is among the best ive ever had

food,not_removed,i was born there also i live close by mever been to the whalers tavern because i always end up at no probs or dsoups
food,not_removed,those places are very very far away from each other haha bobs is good i also really like the beach plum in portsmouth nh but if i were you id skip the lobster roll altogether and go for the real thing at chauncey creek in kittery byob outdoor on a river
food,not_removed,theres a place on cape elizabeth that is very dramatically perched on the edge of a cliff above the water its also near two lighthouses if youre in to that kind of thing i believe its actually just called the lobster shack its at two lights rd cape elizabeth me
food,not_removed,personal favorite is youngs lobster pound cool byob spot hang out with a pack and watch the boats come in or bring a rod and fish on the bridge
food,not_removed,hallowell seafood in hallowell

food,not_removed,i used to eat at the dock shack at round pond good times
food,not_removed,you may have to venture all the way out to watertown somerville or cambridge shaws market basket hannafords just check their fliers online market basket just had em for so did price chopper shaws too i think

food,not_removed,mud fish
food,not_removed,i second that motion i love new england seafood but make it a mission to find and enjoy good bbq when i travel to the south have had great bbq on recent trips to memphis and durham
food,not_removed,substitution effect funny thing is i live around new bedford where op was eating and the price of fresh seafood around here compared to seattle was there last year in june was peanuts so much cheaper here than there were spoiled over here
food,not_removed,wholeys in pittsburgh had them for last week theyre normally only

food,not_removed,going to york me in two weeks would love tips on a good place for a roll as well as fried seafood clams suggestions yelp isnt helping and looks like bouys closed
food,not_removed,brazil isnt a source of cocaine youre thinking of columbia ecuador and bolivia but the cocaine is still really good in brazil just dont buy it off the street from a shady dude outside a bar in ipanema its probably baking soda and youll probably wretch in the bathroom stall when youre drunkenly trying to party with a hot local then shell probably laugh at you for being an idiot tourist and then if youre lucky shell probably pull out some incredible stuff and the night will right itself and youll probably end up watching the sunrise with the hot local and a drunken eastern european business man who decided to buy the drinks all night this probably isnt first hand knowledge
food,not_removed,thats unnecessary pineapples are cheap everywhere
food,not_removed,pineapples are actually not cheaper in hawaii nothing is cheaper in hawaii lol born and raised on oahu
food,not_removed,alright chumps lets do this
food,not_removed,the gas money you spend to get up there thoughoyyyyyyy
food,not_removed,i assume you mean boiling multiple lobsters for dinner sorry ive never had regular access to it and what i do get seems pretty skimpy on the goods
food,not_removed,who the fuck would have leftover freshcooked lobster
food,not_removed,how do you know of theyre about to die my understanding is that they can essentially live forever in the wild sansserif predators though obviously being stored in a small tank is gonna stress them and reduce lifespan
food,not_removed,the bun i see in the picture is what ive always known as a new england style bun top split hot dog roll whats the type of bun youre talking about
food,not_removed,i dont know where you worked i used to make between to of lobster salad a night and that shit was cooked shucked and frozen right off the boat
food,not_removed,as a chef from massachusetts can confirm they overpaid but we just say paid people are pretty used to getting ripped off
food,not_removed,i would eat the lobster separate from the roll anyway plenty of new englanders do this eat some off the top with butter first the roll is usually toasted in butter ive never had a lobster roll and thought this could use more butter
food,not_removed,lobster isnt exactly a designer food in mainene when it gets as cheap as ground beef people tend to experiment with the leftovers turning leftover meat into a salad after a bakecookout isnt all too uncommon in ne nor is slapping it in a jj nissen hot dog bun and lobster is not safe from this tradition that said buying lobster at any restaurant in maine is immediately a tourist trap so youre correct there are much better things to be done with lobster than covering it mayonnaise and putting it in a cheap bun especially when youre paying premium prices
food,not_removed,my mother grew up the poor child of a lobsterman in the and they ate lobster all the time because they couldnt afford anything else she still loves it though whatever floats your boat i personally dont like it
food,not_removed,massachusetts and maine then
food,not_removed,which means absoloutely nothing about knowing how to prepare or eat it
food,not_removed,ah it would make sense if it was three types of lobster
food,not_removed,sounds like a mike myers bit
food,not_removed,but youll never know if its me or not
food,not_removed,true its like new england vs manhattan style chowder but my regionalistic pride demands that i pick a side
food,not_removed,new bedford is the largest commercial fishing port on the east coasteverywhere is seafood

food,not_removed,i really need to get over there
food,not_removed,and you got yourself and empty carrot and a belly full of lobster count me in
food,not_removed,thats what they tell meill stick to the giant lobster roll

food,not_removed,literally meta
food,not_removed,meet you there say
food,not_removed,no probs is okay i think its slightly overrated the chicken can use some more flavor destination is a really good placeduring the cold months new bedford burgers is an amazing little spot if you go to south end the edge has the best lobster mac and top shelf has the best shrimp mozambiqueall my taste buds opinions but so far no one has disagreed
food,not_removed,fact
food,not_removed,if you want to skip the line then do httpwwwraysseafoodrestaurantcom in rye instead only a few minutes further north and other then not also serving ice cream the lobster is just as good the take and bake frozen lobster pies are also insanely good
food,not_removed,theres also a food truck nearby called bite into maine parked in portland head light
food,not_removed,ahh hyannis brockton by the sea

food,not_removed,no way boston is great as is the northeast i will take our winters over earthquakes floods tornadoes hurricanes for the most part drought poor education shitty job markets and broke ass states most everywhere else long term i wouldnt worry about those winters either
food,not_removed,as someone who lived in boston you couldnt be further from the truth its a beautiful city with a lot to offer to people in all walks of life i cant wait to move back
food,not_removed,keeps all the lazy southernwesterners away
food,not_removed,i think this is more to do with you than the city itself great universities tons to do with sports culture food and activities a quick drive to the mountains in the winter and the beach in the summer something for everyone winters suck but lots of people like to ski and it makes the spring that much sweeter fuck the t though
food,not_removed,could have had better more fresh at that
food,not_removed,yeah cape cod is a day tripweekend vacation for someone in boston
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,it aint the kind of place to raise your kids
food,not_removed,harrys is alright bobs clam hut in kittery is good lobster cove foxs lobster housethe river landing great ice cream too
food,not_removed,i rate bobs top among those especially for clams or fried haddock foxs is right at nubble light house but that makes it super pay for the experience if you want less takeout options roberts in kittery bobs owns it too maybe even the york harbor inn portsmouth nh is a minute drive and has dozens of fantastic restaurants and neat shopping its our nearest city feel free to contact me here when youre in town ill tell you how to find the secret beaches
food,not_removed,how was the threesome and wasnt this an episode of showtimes brotherhood wait a minute i thought you were dead
food,not_removed,i notice youre oddly silent about cocaine pricing
food,not_removed,they werent when i was a kid theyre my favorite fruit and when i was a kid a can of pineapple juice was an occasional treat from my grandparents and a whole pineapple was an unnimagianal luxury
food,not_removed,crazy enough i get them way cheaper here in vegas growing up in hawaii fresh pineapples were expensive oh and my dad and his friends used to steal them from dole you used to be able just pull off the side of the road and pick one i think theres cameras and security now
food,not_removed,a whole pineapple is about in sweden is this cheap
food,not_removed,lol not in japan about last i saw
food,not_removed,right they would charge for the view if they could
food,not_removed,looooooobstaaaaaarrrrrr jeeeeeeeeeeeeenkinnns
food,not_removed,yeah usually a lobster dinner is one lobster per person for most people there will be leftovers
food,not_removed,leftover seafood gets cooked into stew or fried with rice
food,not_removed,if you see them making a will saying goodbye to their favourite rock crevices stuff like that
food,not_removed,did you just say sans serif
food,not_removed,i dont know if youre making a joke in which case sorry but its just sans sansserif is a type of font without serifs
food,not_removed,it was a smaller restaurant so this was a way of mitigating loss of usable product on the other hand it also meant that ours was never frozen and reasonably fresh i dont think we could have sold lbs of rolls it was just a different operation
food,not_removed,cant order lobster at a restaurant then what do you do
food,not_removed,plus you can eat a lobster roll with one hand and no mess
food,not_removed,maine used to be part of massachusetts
food,not_removed,they eat it a lot more than someone from texas they see how it is prepared sold and how to make it better just like someone from texas who eats and cooks brisket knowing how to smoke brisket better than someone from maine
food,not_removed,their is clearly lettuce filling that photograph when people add celery for example it is usually for regional purposes such as taste no one is trying to rip you off no filler is simply a dumb buzzterm like fully loaded
food,not_removed,what was it like back there in the i know most of ma was rough but i can only imagine the port towns being tough as hell
food,not_removed,the national and the locker no longer exist i still hear the amazing tales of the shit that went down in them
food,not_removed,pillory pub has a rocking chair club where you can sit in them drink and yell at passersby its wonderful food is ok tavern on the warf is great for buff chicken nachos mother annas is good for pizza and percys for breakfasti go to plymouth too much
food,not_removed,try and do it before all the tourists take over to look at the breathtaking plymouth rock
food,not_removed,rnocontext

food,not_removed,at least i have lobster
food,not_removed,ive never had anyone had leftovers when eating just one lobster a person hell usually we plan on two lobsters a person
food,not_removed,not if youre grateful for your fresh lobster
food,not_removed,maine here and spoiled my daughter has been a lobster meal eater since she was we are not rich we are very lucky i guess
food,not_removed,ive never had leftovers down here in texas we probably are getting smaller lobsters down here
food,not_removed,avenir on the orient express dial m for myriad
food,not_removed,thanks for correcting my autocorrect
food,not_removed,gotcha we would constantly run out
food,not_removed,buy it at a seafood place or grocer and cook it yourself of course if youre vacationing then you likely dont have the means to do so so ordering it at a restaurant is totally understandable
food,not_removed,stick your hand in the ocean grab a lobster and boil some waterthe way life should be
food,not_removed,if vacationing find a grocery storefish market that cooks seafood for you i did that and it didnt cost any extra took them back to where we were staying and only had to melt butter clean up shells afterward
food,not_removed,lobster is insanely easy to cook just grab some from the fish market or grocery store and pop them in some salted boiling water serve with melted butter done
food,not_removed,buy it at a grocery store most of them out east will also cook the lobster for you so you just take it home and eat it
food,not_removed,most locals buy them from the coops at the docks cheap and you support your lobstermen directly
food,not_removed,you know what im just going to say new england
food,not_removed,some people from texas know that because they have experience preparing smoked brisket simply living there does not give you those expertise coming from maine doesnt make you an expert on how to prepare a lobster roll preparing a lot of lobster rolls does
food,not_removed,i lived in lily white marion but went to school in dartmouth and most of my friends were from the south end it was broke down and effed upkind of like it has always been and i dont think that especially cruel to say its where we went on the weekend so it was fun
food,not_removed,i need to go to plymouth
food,not_removed,you mean that by stone
food,not_removed,are you going to be late
food,not_removed,opened up last year really good burgers i highly recommend checking it out

food,not_removed,but but the gays are there
food,not_removed,i would be shocked if one lobster a person was adequate at my familys lobster dinners lobsters is usual wont lie sometimes more if were feeling extra fancy hailing from ri
food,not_removed,depends on the lobster maine lobsters can weigh pounds but yeah for an average person id guess a would be filling
food,not_removed,eat a lobster roll and get back to me better yet dunk a piece of cold claw meat into into hot butter
food,not_removed,coastal maine lobster is cheap as hell great times in kennebunk
food,not_removed,or buy it fresh off the boats from the lobstermen
food,not_removed,are there no food trucks or food carts selling lobster rolls
food,not_removed,why stop there just boil the ocean all you can eat lobster
food,not_removed,good luck lobster fishing without a licence
food,not_removed,sorry but being from texas and knowing how to cook meats go hand in hand just like being from maine and knowing more about lobster prep and eating than you not being from there it may seem like generalizations but in the endbeing a local has more strengths when talking about local flavors it is a rarity to find someone from the ne who does not know about lobster just like it is a rarity to find someone from texas that does not know how to bbq i am actually surprised you do not know this are you from alabama
food,not_removed,i went there last season early in the day during fourth of the july weekend and drank angry balls from about to i yelled at a lot of passersby and the rocking chair got a lot of use
food,not_removed,im not going to be able to make it todaycan we reschedule
food,not_removed,dnb burgers is the one im thinking of same one
food,not_removed,true upstate ny is way worse
food,not_removed,more butter
food,not_removed,more betterer
food,not_removed,and so is great food great art and ridiculously gorgegous beaches downside is staying the night is mondo expensive i won a scholarship to the norman mailer fellowship that included board otherwise i never could have gone
food,not_removed,talking chicken lobsters with side saladcorn including digging out the all meat in the body and legs i can get through a whole one but leftovers were pretty common with my family family hailing from maine
food,not_removed,as someone from illinois i envy you i work with a guy from maine that would talk about how when in season it wasnt a bad deal and i am jealous because i love lobster
food,not_removed,one time i ate lobsters that was too much haha my whole family are lobstermen so they are easy to snag for me nt rich in any sense of the word
food,not_removed,when i was living in southie my roommates buddy worked on a lobster boat and once a month he would give us each a live lobster caught literally hours before as new englanders we all made damn sure to finish every last bit our roommate from jordan was the only one to not finish everything every time
food,not_removed,if its anything like it is here in crab country pretty much everyone who lives on the water has a few pots to put out during seasonand not a fucking license in sight
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,i need this
food,not_removed,yep
food,not_removed,more betterer fresher
food,not_removed,its always been too expensive for me to stay there but it is one of the most amazing places in mass
food,not_removed,my wife and i stayed at an airbnb there nice place about a mile from the commercial street super cheap and the guy was cultivating a pretty mean herb garden
food,not_removed,fat families and skinny families talking back and forth this is great
food,not_removed,oh im fine with just one however i cant speak for my apparently greedy family haha
food,not_removed,god dammit jordan
food,not_removed,its pretty tightly regulated here in maine
food,not_removed,its definitely not my entire family does this for a living my dad waited like years on a list to get a license
food,not_removed,well the references you gave are stupidly specific anyone who is trained in the culinary arts will know how to cook i am not referring to being simply born in texas and knowing how to cook bbq i am referring to being a texan and being around bbq it is a way of life down there just exactly like being from the ne eating lobster is a way of life it is rare to find the opposite of that that just simply does not mean it does not happen in the vast majority of findings it seems that you just want to argue have a great day edit if you continue to call users douchey and rednecks then you should read the side bar we do not allow that here we do allow users to offer opinions and constructive criticism but you are not the final judge on who gets to stay or who gets escorted out the mods are if you have a problem with that send them a modmail
food,not_removed,know what fuck it next day off im headed there
food,not_removed,i live in boston haha

food,not_removed,thanks for the recipe umchammerz first time making scallops and grits the flavors really came togetherplus a squeeze of citrus in the endmarone that was awesome edit i added sautéed mushrooms to the sauce described gives a bit more chunk and i also just love the taste of mushrooms in a wine sauce
food,not_removed,gordon ramsay would be appalled will give it to you friendlylike
food,not_removed,thanks for the tip the more brown bits are actually mushrooms that i added to the sauce after searing
food,not_removed,thats not food its fodder they actually sold these as a snack food in nz for a while about years ago they were a bit less dense than standard ramen noodles
food,not_removed,one full package has about of the recommended daily sodium intake its pretty bad
food,not_removed,so i should eat it with beef jerky and a tv dinner

food,not_removed,these look delicious
food,not_removed,yuuuum just made a batch of these and some cannabis banana bread with my boyfriend enjoy yourself
food,not_removed,i sense a vicious cycle thing
food,not_removed,recipe
food,not_removed,i never really got why it was relevant to state that something was an edible on a non ediblesrelated sub i dont know anyone who seeks out edibles for the taste differences they have over normal versions its just a hey look at me this is weed give me karma because its weed thats how it comes off to me anyway though judging by your account name youre probably just advertising your business edit i cant get over myself i have short legs
food,not_removed,wait fruity pebbles fleenstones
food,not_removed,so stoned bruh uhhhhhhhhhhhh
food,not_removed,haha blaze it lmao
food,not_removed,sir
food,not_removed,well its a little time consuming but here we go cup of coconut oil tsp lecithin either sunflower lecithin or soy lecithin both do equally amazing oz the green pour your green into an oven safe bowl so it doesnt shatter cover well with aluminum foil and place in an oven at for minutes pull your bowl out of the oven and uncover one cooled off melt the oil on a low setting mix the oil and lecithin into the dried green replace foil lid put your bowl back into the oven for minutes once done add another tsp of lecithin push down on the concoction to release the thc put the foil lid back on and place the bowl in the oven for a final minutes remove from oven place in freezer for two hours after hours carefully let that bowl warm up or else the rapid expansion will shatter the bowl once thawed cover the bowl with a pair of pantyhose and strain the liquid out of the solid from that point its simply a matter of adding the oil to a batch of brownie batter replace the oil given in the box recipe with your potent cannaoil for brownies i highly recommend duncan hines decadent triple fudge or duncan hines red velvet brownies you can replace the oil or butter in virtually any food recipe with the oil you made important do this with care start with half of a brownie and take another half roughly hours later it should be pretty powerful with some decent quality weed assuming you followed these directions leaving out and steps will lower the potentcy good luck and god speed
food,not_removed,probably to inspire others to recreate these thc fits the theme pretty well
food,not_removed,a couple of reasons incorporating the marijuana in whatever form can change the texture and flavour of the dish a bit as well as greatly modify how its made most of all fruity pebble bars sound like a great edible not so much by themselves same reason i wouldnt put weed in a meatball its not like the guy is sitting here trying to get people to get high or making a political statement get over yourself
food,not_removed,its an important part of the actual food as someone who doesnt care much for weed or fruity pebbles bars i would think just plain fruity pebbles bars are disgusting but throw in the weed and i can understand the thought process behind them
food,not_removed,if you grew maybe that stick would fall out of your ass
food,not_removed,lighten up
food,not_removed,ftw
food,not_removed,this is an excellent method for infusing coconut oil but i was hoping for a good coconut oil based krispies recipe anyone got a link
food,not_removed,yo
food,not_removed,recipe looks delicious
food,not_removed,i didnt really have a recipe i just threw some stuff together it was good but i will be changing a few things and will make another post with the modifications
food,not_removed,i love cheese but too much cheese is like not enough i dont think it would taste bad or anything but it would probably be better or as good without it imo
food,not_removed,looks good but im afraid they sold you brownie bites as cake lol
food,not_removed,bamboozled again
food,not_removed,oh daddy
food,not_removed,suddenly my hanger grows stronger qq

food,not_removed,chicago toasted barley tea included
food,not_removed,actually korean soups usually have a kombuanchovy based broth beef broth or chicken broth korean gochujang chili paste is added to the boiling soup about tbsp per servingpot to get it red hot and spicy its not chili paste to bring out more spice and heat gochugaru korean chili flakes are actually added on top of the gochujang and yes just slurping up all the soup broth is very healthy for you
food,not_removed,this was actually in san jose ca
food,not_removed,where in chicago this looks incredible
food,not_removed,those dont look particularly appetizing that said ill take a plate

food,not_removed,bacon looks pretty thick how did you cook it so well without burning the asparagus
food,not_removed,now that is a combination i would never believe could look that damn good
food,not_removed,my god this looks yummy
food,not_removed,if im going to eat veggies then they better be wrapped in bacon
food,not_removed,so how was it it looks incredibly good but i would have thought the asparagus would be too delicate to not be overcome by the smoke especially in the amount of time it would have taken to cook the bacon to what looks like perfection
food,not_removed,rketorecipes
food,not_removed,try it with prosciutto sooo good
food,not_removed,pretty much the only way ron swanson will eat veggies
food,not_removed,i did this with my wife the other day with pancetta bacon

food,not_removed,whens dinner
food,not_removed,i dont know how to feel about this
food,not_removed,kept the indirect heat under ° with a decent amount of hickory smoke
food,not_removed,more limp than id prefer but not bad when i saute asparagus on the stovetop i like to leave it a bit crunchy this was not crunchy still quite good tho
food,not_removed,you cooked your wife ew
food,not_removed,but you missed the bacon bacon makes this ok

food,not_removed,try using tomato puree or tomato pulp along with fresh cream
food,not_removed,start with half of one and taste it
food,not_removed,for me i would add only one avocado i think any more than one the balance of flavors would get muddled
food,not_removed,id ballpark add new avocados to the chipotle and still retain flavor
food,not_removed,yea but do you know him
food,not_removed,ucheesejeeze
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,is that an onion jam on top of the patty
food,not_removed,oh awesome that looks way more appealing than just the bun
food,not_removed,red onion relish
food,not_removed,it was the best thing id eaten all day of course i was starving but it deserves its praise
food,not_removed,yum even better
food,not_removed,im not overly fond of onions red or otherwise but i was pleasantly surprised at how much i enjoyed these onions they worked perfectly with the meat and chips stacked on the bun
food,not_removed,parm crusted wild alaskan king salmon that i caught with saffron risotto and brussels sprouts with white balsamic and pine nuts
food,not_removed,that doesnt look like sukiyaki sukiyaki is made with sweet dark soy sauce based sauce

food,not_removed,this is oddly sexual
food,not_removed,gesundheit on a serious note ive never had ceviche with corn how was it
food,not_removed,really good the sweetness of the roasted corn cuts some of the acid from the orange and lime juice and tempers the habanero a bit
food,not_removed,kens honey mustard dressing does the trick for me
food,not_removed,i think masterfoods
food,not_removed,how much did that costlooks nice

food,not_removed,they are called samosa they are generally filled with either potatoes or chick peas or both sometimes you will also find meat samosa at certain restaurants
food,not_removed,did the box say totinos on it
food,not_removed,made me think of some delicious chicken samosas yummy
food,not_removed,seems so crispy whats the filling inside it
food,not_removed,yes this is indian food
food,not_removed,looks like samosa
food,not_removed,i dont know exactly but it is somewhat named as samasa
food,not_removed,spanakopita that stuffs tasty

food,not_removed,my favorite type of soup
food,not_removed,what a dish
food,not_removed,nice dish
food,not_removed,it looks so yummy o
food,not_removed,peanut butter sandwich
food,not_removed,tuna salad tuna real mayonaise celeryonions some good bread mix spread eat
food,not_removed,id never heard of before but when i goodled them it seems like the run of the mill grocery store they seem to have a deli so you could always get something from there other than that youd have to get like a george foreman grill or something unless youd like a cold cut sandwich or something similar
food,not_removed,honestly thank you for reminding me of life simplicity
food,not_removed,writing this down thank you
food,not_removed,peanut butter sandwich is my all time favorite snack it defintely brings up nostalgia from childhood when my mom use to make them for me
food,not_removed,some people think the cheaper tuna in water is better because the fish are smaller than fancy albacore and therefore have had less time to absorb many toxins or mercury i dont know but it makes sense also make the same thing with pink salmon from alaska very good the red is more than double the price i use the juice for my dogs dry food instead of draining salmontuna juice it into sink and they love it
food,not_removed,amp it up by adding things like bacon or dill pickles or jelly or banana
food,not_removed,mouth watering
food,not_removed,i really like that you have both a pickle spear and some chips so you dont have to choose between one or the other
food,not_removed,sooo much stuff on that plate can barely see a sandwich im jealous
food,not_removed,for spending a memorable time with the beloved or spouse candle light dinner is the best option and it can be arranged at home or a table can be booked at a restaurant
food,not_removed,stunning
food,not_removed,ugh want
food,not_removed,unbelievable you made brussel sprouts look good
food,not_removed,oh yeah sweet balsamic and bacon on brussel sprouts is the best the smell in the house while that is simmering away needs to be a new candle scent
food,not_removed,this is that recipe that went all over facebook its seriously the best thing ive ever had in my mouth
food,not_removed,i really love brussels sprouts
food,not_removed,thats not what i heard
food,not_removed,why was it necessary to be that rude
food,not_removed,chally shit that looks amazing yum
food,not_removed,does that all get eaten or is it purely as decor
food,not_removed,ive never really liked squash i think i do now
food,not_removed,everything looks amazing
food,not_removed,looks amazing how did you make those potatoes
food,not_removed,haha something different
food,not_removed,just a baked potato then i put butter salt pepper on it then cheese then stuck it under the broiler
food,not_removed,i love cake
food,not_removed,that is the perfect plate of food right there my goodness
food,not_removed,whats better than portobello and avocado im drooling
food,not_removed,do you always eat in a pitch black room
food,not_removed,which phone makes photos that include at top battery level time etcetc
food,not_removed,my phone obviously
food,not_removed,o you didnt use arborio rice my italian eyes are burning
food,not_removed,sushi rice is a short grain rice just as arborio its not like as if its made out of something completely different its just rice and its sticky enough
food,not_removed,mmmmmm properly cooked asparagus is incredible
food,not_removed,bonus pictures homemade chocolate covered strawberries httpimgurcomvlsodqm httpimgurcomzciekfp
food,not_removed,looks like a fat turd
food,not_removed,how do you eat that fork and knife or hand id imagine everything would fall out in between
food,not_removed,hopdoddy
food,not_removed,i want to put that burger in my ass
food,not_removed,my favorite the barnyard massacre
food,not_removed,that looks awesome but i cant help but notice youve squandered your egg
food,not_removed,is that smoke bbq
food,not_removed,why an egg lately ive seen an egg on everything i guess that makes it gourmet
food,not_removed,my friend thats what those huge toothpicks are for just leave it in the burger when its served to you and eat around when you get to it move it to a further position
food,not_removed,oh yea fork and knife all the way theres no way it would keep its form
food,not_removed,not sure ive grown up with eggs on my burgers preference ive always enjoyed
food,not_removed,real maple syrup
food,not_removed,i dont know about perfect but when i use coconut milk my pancakes always turn out super thick and fluffy also honey butter
food,not_removed,the first pancake helps you figure out your heat setting throw out the first one every time if you have the right heat you should cook a pancake about seconds on the first side on the second bubbles on top and drying edges means its ready to flip
food,not_removed,pretty much the only thing i miss about the deep south
food,not_removed,i live in the north and we dont get these fresh love the tails but i havent built up the nerve to suck the heads
food,not_removed,heh you dont say
food,not_removed,recipe
food,not_removed,thank you for getting my ass out of bed to make this
food,not_removed,mm bbygurl
food,not_removed,dish me up a bowl of that please i need to learn how to cook that looks awesome
food,not_removed,we subbed out chives for cilantro and added the avocado right after we plated it strips of smoked bacon diced sweet potatoes diced about cups cup diced red onion red pepper diced teaspoon smoked paprika teaspoon sea salt eggs avocados sliced chives for garnish preheat oven to degrees to a large skillet add diced bacon cook until crispy about minutes stirring throughout remove the bacon and place on a paper towel lined plate add sweet potatoes to the skillet let cook for minutes until they start to brown next add in the red onion red pepper smoked paprika and salt stir to combine and saute for minutes until veggies start to get tender add the bacon back to the pan stir and place skillet in oven bake potato hash for minutes remove from oven create wells in the potato mixture and add an egg to each well place skillet back in the oven and cook until eggs are your desired doneness i cooked mine for minutes remove from oven add sliced avocado and diced chives serve
food,not_removed,thank you so much cant wait to try it out
food,not_removed,looks so good
food,not_removed,your fries look like overly packed side by side jenga
food,not_removed,this recipe has been floating around on facebook ive made it times now ive had to start doubling the batch because its so good
food,not_removed,so bright and colorful gorgeous
food,not_removed,did you travel to a restaurant and eat this or was this made at someones home
food,not_removed,it was as so amazing
food,not_removed,my step dad made it
food,not_removed,okay does he have a restaurant or was this made at someones home the reason i am asking is that the post has been removed for having the wrong tag if it was made assembled eaten or photographed at someones home it is if you traveled to a restaurant cafe food truck etc and someone made assembled cured etc this food then it is
food,not_removed,oh thats confusing considering i did eat it haha
food,not_removed,the wiki explains it all have you read it
food,not_removed,cant see it on mobile
food,not_removed,httpswwwredditcomrfoodwikiindex
food,not_removed,then allow me to apologize for the statement above would have enjoyed to see a fully finished product
food,not_removed,perhaps you arent clear on the definition but when you mention casserole baking is involved from the looks of your still unmelted cheese and unwilted lettuce this dish was not baked
food,not_removed,i have a pretty amazing smelling sopapilla cheesecake in the oven right now ill be sure to get a picture of that if it makes up for it
food,not_removed,it was indeed baked and then topped with cheese shredded lettuce olives sour cream and some avocado it was simply a layer of chips then some refried beans a filling ground turkey onion bell pepper taco and fajita seasoning some cheese then more chips then another layer of beans filling and cheese and finally some crumpled chips baked at for minutes in hindsight i would have grabbed a shot of the finished casserole but i was too busy eating
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,it was indeed as wonderful as it smelled httpsiimgurcomlfzpqnyjpg
food,not_removed,ah so the filling is hot but you need to warm up the beans cheese and salsa it should have salsa
food,not_removed,i know but my kids are super sensitive to spicy foods and im frequently too busy to remember to add my own my parents even made amazing salsa from their garden but good news i think ill be making some homemade enchiladas soon and they will be topped
food,not_removed,looks good anything done to the chicken rub marinade wise and how about that kale
food,not_removed,honey
food,not_removed,what do you mean by kelp cured
food,not_removed,salmon is life salmon is love mmm looks good
food,not_removed,holy shit looks great
food,not_removed,i bet that salmon is soft as butter seriously looks unbelievably delicious
food,not_removed,nice are you a chef
food,not_removed,nice nigiri and sashimi
food,not_removed,where did you get the salmon
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,nice username
food,not_removed,this is nigiri and sashimi
food,not_removed,thats a lot of salmon
food,not_removed,nice salmon roses
food,not_removed,thanks for this salmon is my favorite ima look at this and sigh all day
food,not_removed,looks nice and fresh
food,not_removed,i dont know who you are or where you live but im coming over
food,not_removed,well done can i have some you have lotsgimme some
food,not_removed,looks great love the arrangement
food,not_removed,looks like a great plate
food,not_removed,looks amazing holy shit can we get how you prepped that salmon
food,not_removed,that looks freaking delicious
food,not_removed,soo its basicly just a fish on a plate
food,not_removed,farm raised salmon crap wild salmon should be red and is better
food,not_removed,so its just bits of salmon on a plate i dont think thats sushi
food,not_removed,atlantic salmon isnt really salmon
food,not_removed,im guessing its kombujime where you sandwich raw fish between sheets of dry kombu giant kelp that have been moistened with sake the dry kelp draws out some moisture from the fish tightening its texture and infuses the fish with umami and a little bit of seaweed fragrance
food,not_removed,is it like banana leaf wrapping food maybe
food,not_removed,this is the correct answer dont know why youre being downvoted
food,not_removed,thats a lot of salmon i want to eat
food,not_removed,id like to share how i prepared it and cut it however i dont know how to upload multiple photos with explanations
food,not_removed,some salty people in this thread that cant afford real salmon
food,not_removed,sashimi put it on rice and it is sushi
food,not_removed,please elaborate
food,not_removed,that sounds fantastic i gotta look it up and try sometime
food,not_removed,because technically nigiri is a subcategory of sushi just like maki
food,not_removed,because its pointless pedantry a reddit specialty
food,not_removed,essentially the taste of wild pacific salmon is what most people think of when they imagine salmon and its the only kind any restaurant of note would use atlantic salmon has none of the characteristics of pacific salmon but happens to have the name salmon because theyre in the same family its like comparing beef to ox or moose to deer if a dish calls for salmon it invariably means pacific but due to farming and good marketing atlantic salmon is replacing it for the ignorant buyer while its not a perfect comparison imagine ordering rabbit and getting rat
food,not_removed,thats just not accurate there are several different species of salmon in the pacific all having slightly different characteristics but they are all still salmon atlantic salmon scottish salmon steelhead etc are all different varieties of salmon you can definitely argue that the quality of some varieties is superior to others but that doesnt mean that lesser quality examples arent real
food,not_removed,ive eaten and loved salmon all my life and ive never had pacific salmon maybe its the norm in your area but pacific salmon is not the standard for the rest of the world
food,not_removed,actually steelhead is sea going rainbow trout although they are more salmon like than regular trout
food,not_removed,go ahead eat expensive saltwater trout its no skin off my back
food,not_removed,ya not to mention when it comes to sushi farmed salmon is preferred due to the higher fat content
food,not_removed,if you get the chance definitely try it the other guy is being somewhat smug but the flavor is better
food,not_removed,its because its more expensive i live in an area with fresh pacific salmon in other countries it will always be much more expensive than other kinds i bet you think tiger prawns grown in shit ponds are fine dining
food,not_removed,like i said quality varies but its still salmon it is fun to watch you throw a fit about it though
food,not_removed,i find farmed salmon to taste superior due to higher fat content im also a fish farmer so i guess im biased as fuck
food,not_removed,this is hilarious high end sushi restaurants in japan import some of the most expensive varieties of fish from everywhere in the world i am not going to bother finding proof for you but id wager if they served farmed anything it would be an absolute scandal edit i think it still stands salmon sushi is not japanese and not popular there wild pacific salmon can contaij parasites so it was never used and atlantic salmon sushi was apparently invented and marketed by norwegian fish farms
food,not_removed,like i said i dont care its in the salmon family and so is trout its not salmon though as in when a recipe calls for fillet of salmon tastes like shit too but i guess not everyone can afford the real thing
food,not_removed,enjoy your trout
food,not_removed,eh they do serve european farmed salmon ive eaten norwegian farmed salmon sushi in asia
food,not_removed,alright then
food,not_removed,its not salmon though its the other way around its also salmon though
food,not_removed,youre just wrong also most sushi places even high end ones here in seattle where chinook and coho and sockeye are plentiful sell primarily atlantic salmon when the list something as just salmon when they serve chinook or coho they will call it out as that on the menu
food,not_removed,in asia like in china or korea i wouldnt eat sushi there at all if i were you
food,not_removed,i put salmon in quotes because when you read it on its own it means pacific salmon not your cheap trout
food,not_removed,look up why atlantic salmon is served as sushi its not japanese its norwegian
food,not_removed,i buy it here in thailand its about for whole salmon i typically cure it and dry it before eating it very delicious lots of thais love it we have a lot of japanese here too that love it we have norwegian salmon and norwegian trout salmon they call it looks like it has a bit less fat all the fish come flash frozen so all parasites have been killed they carefully and cleanly fillet them for you as per your preferences most thais prefer to eat it sashimi or sushi style
food,not_removed,atlantic salmon is caught on the east coast of the usa as well as in europe however most atlantic salmon thats served as sushi is farmed in the usa its not norwegian however interestingly now that the japanese are eating salmon sushi its almost all atlantic salmon from norway so you get to be wrong even when youre right httpwwwnortradecomsectorsarticlesnorwaysintroductionofsalmonsushitojapan
food,not_removed,the norwegian fish farmers introduced the idea of salmon as sushi why are you being deliberately obtuse
food,not_removed,the japanese introduced the idea of raw fish as sushi to the world they now revere fish from all over they love geoduck clam neck as great sushi which only comes from washington state for you to claim that atlantic salmon is a trout is just plain wrong it is not a trout it is in the same family as a trout all trouts are salmonids but no atlantic salmon is a trout since the japanese are now eating geoduck from the washington coast and atlantic salmon from norwey who are you to decide what is good eats youre wrong about taxonomy maybe you like a certain kind of food but it looks like the sushi lovers have decided that not everything is built for you
food,not_removed,yeah okay fine eat your inferior fish i already said thats fine
food,not_removed,whats your favorite sushi fish
food,not_removed,trout
food,not_removed,what kind of trout rainbow cutthroat brook german brown there are lots of other salmonids too that are not trout i like grayling and other chars there are lots of chars that arent salmon or trout food for thought ive had rainbow and cutthroat raw before depending on where they were caught they can taste muddy sometimes but sometimes just a squeeze of lemon and they are fine
food,not_removed,youre way too committed to something that is just quite obviously wrong theres no way that farmed atlantic salmon even touches wild pacific salmon in popularity among chefs or gourmands im over here enjoying some year single malt and youre telling me that its pretty much the same thing as your golden wedding theyre both whiskey right
food,not_removed,youre ignoring the reality of the sushi world because you dont like a single kind of fish you pretend that nobody thinks it is good that perhaps real sushi eaters dont eat it they eat it its sold in most topend sushi restaurants even super pricey ones it exists look into the void and the void looks into you swim into the atlantic never heard of golden wedding i like aged talisker myself but its expensive

food,not_removed,you should find a new girl
food,not_removed,is your girl a middle school lunch lady
food,not_removed,hmm coleslaw or gross looking salad
food,not_removed,deconstructed gnocchi
food,not_removed,deep fried gnocchi is my favorite give it a shot
food,not_removed,haha true but i was planning on freezing the leftovers so i didnt want to mix it all
food,not_removed,never tried it before ill have to give it a go one day
food,not_removed,im pretty sure that dudes trolling you i think you can look up a video of a guy deep frying gnocchi and they start to burst and pop in the hot oil splashing it everywhere be careful edit heres the sauce im referencing not as bad as i maybe made it sound but if they had still been in the oil and started doing that it would have been big trouble for sure
food,not_removed,haha omg wow i meant i would try it at a restaurant i would never try making though my nonna would probably call me a blasphemer
food,not_removed,i was literally just about to say that exact same thing
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,recipe from cooks illustrated website
food,not_removed,omg that looks amazing
food,not_removed,that looks amazing i never get the pastry just right
food,not_removed,try making one with grilled portabello or maiitake mushrooms its a real winner 😃
food,not_removed,that crust looks perfect im sure it tastes just as great
food,not_removed,interesting shaving cream
food,not_removed,so is galette the french word for pizza
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,hey thanks it was pretty tasty to eat
food,not_removed,this was the first time that ive made crust using vodka when i was rolling it out i was really worried because it seemed so tender and wet but it worked it beautifully i also sat in front of the oven for a while watching it like a hawk haha
food,not_removed,oooooh man that sounds delicious thanks for the tip
food,not_removed,it was super flaky and delicious
food,not_removed,galette is more of a french term describing flat round free form crusty cakes
food,not_removed,galettes are pastry while pizza is dough youll get more buttery and flakey texture with this while pizza you get crunchy outside and soft inside galettes can also have fruit fillings my favorite galette filling would have to be chevre kale and caramelized onions
food,not_removed,i would call this a quiche or tarte galette is usually used either for cakes like galette des rois or for very thin pancakes made with buckwheat flour with a nonsweet filling eggs ham cheese source am french
food,not_removed,wow i must try this
food,not_removed,right so pizza ill have to remember that next time im in a french bakery ever seen richard ronald searles drawing of the annual french welcome to italian wines festival edit oops
food,not_removed,your recipe sounds amazing ill have to make that some time
food,not_removed,thats what i was thinking but the recipe called it galette so i followed suit haha
food,not_removed,the chipping of the filling is the only tedious part the rest is a breeze
food,not_removed,no i havent ill have to look it up
food,not_removed,its a truck overturned on a highway with a bunch of broken crates and bottles smashed around it all set on fire searle was a rare wit and i miss his work btw oops its ronald searle my bad
food,not_removed,we moved into a new apartment recently and misplaced all of our silverware so weve been using plastic until we can afford real cutlery forgot to move the fork before snapping the pic
food,not_removed,ooh that would be good with sausage also
food,not_removed,i have a few pounds of i might try that tonight
food,not_removed,thanks for the recipe umchammerz first time making scallops and grits the flavors really came togetherplus a squeeze of citrus in the endmarone that was awesome
food,not_removed,doubledouble animal style with chopped chilies animal style fries and a neopolitan shake will be there for me on my death bed
food,not_removed,i wish i was american and fat and happy
food,not_removed,double double i want to go to there
food,not_removed,unpopular opinion maybe i just got back from san francisco to the east coast i had innout three times and i kept feeling underwhelmed i figured out my order double double no onion animal style is too much for me and the burger is pretty good but the fries were really awful like hard undercooked potato chunk awful maybe im spoiled by shake shack but can someone explain the appeal of innout i really really wanted to like it
food,not_removed,as someone who does not currently live anywhere near an innout i am insanely jealous
food,not_removed,you dont have to be american to be fat and happy
food,not_removed,same it looks so good sadly the closest one is miles away and would be a hour drive maybe one day
food,not_removed,i find in n outs fries to be rather weak on their own
food,not_removed,and you dont have to be happy to fat and american
food,not_removed,but america has the best worst food and i will be happier
food,not_removed,what no love for animal style
food,not_removed,i guess i didnt consider the nostalgia factor why did you have inn n out times if you didnt like it the first i really really wanted to like it first time was during dinner rush second time was third and best time was middle of the afternoon maybe that had some influence like i said the burger was pretty good but history doesnt explain the awful fries im sure some people like em like that but they were cardboard to me edit for the price i dont feel like i can complain but it definitely felt like i got what i paid for rather than when i go to shake shack i know that im eating a quality burger as opposed to mcdonalds etc
food,not_removed,gotta love that sauce
food,not_removed,all fast food oils are vegan
food,not_removed,ah got it i dont think that would change the texture though the taste i dont have a problem with
food,not_removed,fuck this dude

food,not_removed,thanks for posting the recipe
food,not_removed,so good is this japanese sweet
food,not_removed,looks really good but matcha is pretty expensive in germany do you have an ingredient a cheaper one whit which i could try the recipe first for example would it work with cocoa
food,not_removed,looks great but lets be real here white chocolate is not chocolate
food,not_removed,ive never cooked a gammon steak but what you have is something somewhere between ham and bacon ive cooked bacon in the oven plenty of timesyou can put more bacon on a baking sheet than you can in a frying pan if you wont grill it sure bake it in the oven
food,not_removed,what the fuck is a gammon steak
food,not_removed,its basically raw ham its pork leg but its not curedbrined as much as ham
food,not_removed,i have no idea never had a gammon steak before no idea how thick the steak is bacon in the oven is minutes at a gammon steak will probably take a little longer
food,not_removed,can i get the recipe please
food,not_removed,i thought this was beef jerky at first
food,not_removed,username is spot on mjohlds
food,not_removed,here you go cup blueberries c applesauce flaxegg or regular eggs i omitted all sugar but you could add c sugar here tsp vanilla cups oat flour tsp baking soda tsp salt preheat oven to fahrenheit oilbutter your loaf pan purée blueberries slowly mix together your blueberries applesauce egg or egg substitute sugar if youre adding it and vanilla in a separate bowl combine the dry ingredients add dry ingredients to wet until just mixed place in prepared loaf pan and bake for minutes enjoy

food,not_removed,that porchetta made thy mouth water
food,not_removed,i laughed when you wrote you boned out an entire lamb and dont know why everything looks super tasty
food,not_removed,if anyone is curious in ny we just call it strip steak
food,not_removed,dude youre an artist i worked as a butcher for a while and these are some of the cleanest cuts ive ever seen what know are you using how much time do you have to butcher a whole head i worked in a pretty fast paced mill so we didnt get to pay as much attention to detail
food,not_removed,do you have a good diagram for me to better understand cuts of meat im often not sure what im actually looking at at the grocery store
food,not_removed,jesus you are a master of meat great handiwork
food,not_removed,your tying skills are on point beautiful
food,not_removed,ummmfcrispy porchetta skin reminds me of christmas season and colombian lechona
food,not_removed,chuck eye poor mans ribeye or less at the local shop no one seems to buy it but me
food,not_removed,these are amazing thanks for sharing
food,not_removed,that beef made my mouth water beautifully marbled what breed is it
food,not_removed,these are amazing and im hungry again i wish i could find a place to get meat like this near me well done
food,not_removed,just spectacular youre excellent at your craft
food,not_removed,its beautiful especially the lamb noisette
food,not_removed,is it possible to cure the porchetta or would all the greenery go bad too quickly
food,not_removed,how did you cook the porchetta
food,not_removed,that work looks awesome all of it great but the boned out lamb is just on another level
food,not_removed,this is all so beautiful kudos
food,not_removed,im totally doing the lamb saddle roll lollipops are cool for appetizers but for a nice roast that looks killer
food,not_removed,seriously killer skill man nice work
food,not_removed,can you share your recipe method for the porchetta please im in love
food,not_removed,holy shit the marbling on that lamb is gorgeous wheres it from
food,not_removed,beautiful i wish i had a local butcher who practiced with such care and love for the craft as you id shop there in a heartbeat even the independents here mostly just breakdown larger shippedin shrinkwrapped portions
food,not_removed,til butchery porn looks amazing
food,not_removed,my father in law made porchetta once and i swear i had to stop eating or i would have barfedi could not stop eating it so moist and delicious he made it with toasted pine nuts and green pesto
food,not_removed,i have to ask about your contradictory userbamewhata the reasoning behind it
food,not_removed,i thought you rolled a pork joint in the first picture
food,not_removed,stop with the shit filters
food,not_removed,i love meat but reading about spine and rib removal sounded pretty gruesome
food,not_removed,thine mouth hath watered for realth
food,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvuhkjpbuablc
food,not_removed,you made me retroactively curious thank you for being so proactive
food,not_removed,in australia we call it a porterhouse
food,not_removed,i get more time than you would being in a small butcher shop for sure my times on breaking are round chuck drop loin sirloin then i take as long as i need to get things ready for the case
food,not_removed,check out a book by a guy named adam danforth ihe has two one is beef butchery and the other is game and birds while the finished products sometimes look not great he is incredibly detailed in every part of butchering an animal
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,no one seems to buy it but me shhh lets keep the secret cheap stakes to ourselves man
food,not_removed,red angus
food,not_removed,im no expert but i would cure before stuffing and rolling
food,not_removed,you can totally cure one you just need to add the herbs afterwards its mostly pork belly which when cured and smoked is bacon attached to the loin which is also often cured mainly in spain
food,not_removed,fennel bulbs oranges worth of zest a lemon of zest bu parsley a fat handful of minced garlic brunoise shallots tsp fennel pollen salt and pepper like a motherfucker
food,not_removed,i used to be vegan in college i woke up one day and realized that i hadnt eaten meat in about months so i decided to become vegan to see how i felt i liked it and kept on for a year years later after being a chef for a long time i found myself as a butcher who would have guessed
food,not_removed,fair enough lighting at work blows so i picked the ones that gave the photos the most contrast so you could more clearly see the differences in muscle groups
food,not_removed,not enough people understand that meat comes from actual animals that once lived and breathed there are a lot of unlovely things that are involved in putting a beautiful looking steak on your plate every piece of meat you consume means the end of a life its my experience that the more you learn about these things one of two things happen you either swear off meat or you really come to respect it personally im all for the latter
food,not_removed,thank you for this have been wanting to learn a lot more about butchering for some time
food,not_removed,my butcher says he gets cuts per carcass no wonder theyre difficult to get
food,not_removed,what about cooking times
food,not_removed,then you could see how i was confused being a plant based eater myself so you eat meat now what made you go back to that side of lifeor death rather
food,not_removed,respect this is the key word
food,not_removed,food companies have consolidated into megaconglomerates their method of production is the factory farm in which they cram as many animals into the smallest of spaces feed them the cheapest food corn and grow to slaughter size in the shortest amount of time thats the meat we get from most neighborhood stores theres a reason why this meat is cheap the animals grow at an accelerated rate in an unnatural environment with costs cut at every corner a butcher shop generally sources locally from smaller volume producers the cattle and pigs are generally pastured in open spaces are allowed to grow at a more natural slow pace and eat natural foods grasses etc the quality of meat is different in variety of ways nutrition flavor fat content hormones etc im sure the op httpswwwredditcomuserbeefvegan can chime in more accurately and in more detail than i can i completely agree with lofipioneers view on this topic its my experience that the more you learn about these things one of two things happen you either swear off meat or you really come to respect it personally im all for the latter i think the intention was to say swear off meat out of respect for life or consume meat with respect to the life that was taken im all for the latter as well
food,not_removed,working in high end professional kitchens i was handicapping myself by refusing main components of dishes how could i adjust flavor if i could only follow a recipe and not taste it to this day i eat meat pretty rarely myself maybe once to twice a month what i do eat comes from my shop which is very committed to sourcing only animals raised on pasture with no added hormones or antibiotics we also dont sell any animal that is not considered mature ie no veal piglet etc i go to the farms often and its heartening to see the people raising these animals care about their well being and dont see them only as profitloss i think by becoming a butcher and being able to use an entire animal in order to minimize what is wasted makes me enjoy what i do most these animals were born and raised as food they would not exist without that demand but that does not mean we as carnivores cant respect and value what we take thats a message i try to convey to my customers and the chefs i sell to as well
food,not_removed,well said gachong personally i love meat beautiful steaks ribs or brisket cooked low and slow to perfection the perfect fried chicken im also all for smaller portions we dont need ribeyes that sort of overconsumption is not only bad for us but its bad for the animals and the environment as well i advocate for small local producers find a really good butcher where you live get to know them well and shop with them exclusively you might pay more per weight with them but if youre only eating small portions a few times a week then itll be a wash when it comes to the expense oh yeah i feel the same about eggs too
food,not_removed,these animals were born and raised as food they would not exist without that demand but that does not mean we as carnivores cant respect and value what we take respectable and a great viewpoint im not veganvegetarian etc but i wish more vegansvegetarians saw it from this pov then again most of the vegans i meet are rich girls that have uni paid for by daddy
food,not_removed,that chicken had the period of its life
food,not_removed,you have to update with a pic when you crack it
food,not_removed,mmmmoorty you gotta put it in your butt you gotta put it in your butt for grandpa

food,not_removed,bbq where i am from in illinois we put the meat in the bbq sauce and then cook it for a bit then put it on a sandwich in tennessee where i live now they smoke the meat without bbq and then put the meat on a sandwich with very little bbq sauce and coleslaw on the sandwich
food,not_removed,mexican food when i lived in new mexico i wanted my chips queso and typical texmex what is this green or red sauce choice christmas are these sopapillas is this panchos pozole instead of rice wtf but then i became addicted
food,not_removed,steak in australia and steak in indonesia they even claimed the steak was australian i assure you it wasnt
food,not_removed,chicken tandoori it tastes differently in several cities in europe and it tastes differently in the indian cities i liked tandoori chicken in delhi and kozhikod but hated it in mysore the restaurants in a city frequently cook it all the same way its like one copies the other one and the taste is adjusted to the locals choice
food,not_removed,burger in usa vs burger in belgium i think the difference was horse anyway young stupid me should have ordered something different in the first place
food,not_removed,sushi is the prime example of this in one place it may be tolerable in another it may be a food fit for the gods while in the last it may taste like giving a yellowfin tuna a rim job shortly after deepthroating his bluefin cousin
food,not_removed,oh god yes for some reason it is difficult to impossible to get a good thin crust pizza west of new york
food,not_removed,i know im going to start an argument in here but are you a north carolina style bbq fan or a memphis style bbq fan and since im already starting a fight are you a brisket or pulled pork fan
food,not_removed,texan get pancho reference
food,not_removed,sushi is kind of the quintessential example for this probably because it relies so much on the quality of one ingredient even moreso arguably than other foods that have one major ingredient
food,not_removed,lol uh shrugs whats the difference i like it slightly sweet but not like sugar sweet pork never had brisket
food,not_removed,if you have to ask then never mind
food,not_removed,well i dont know
food,not_removed,very nice job i bet her piping bag hand is really sore

food,not_removed,my asian twist on swedish meatballs and gravy homemade bulgogi beef and pork meatballs with a miso cream gravy and a homemade steamed bao

food,not_removed,that looks amazing would you mind sharing the recipe my ancient computer wont load the comments on imgur so my apologies if you already shared it there
food,not_removed,thanks again i have some ground deer in my deep freezer that i need to use up asap this will be perfect for that
food,not_removed,mine was marinating for hours i coated them with the extra marinade that i reduced and let them sit in the sauce while finishing my baos i think ill skip that step next time i had people try it and no complaints everyone loved it especially the gravy the meatballs werent rolled tightly texture was soft and moist the taste was sweet and a hint of salt pepper garlic and onion
food,not_removed,ill share it when i come home from work
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,what is pork kidney like d
food,not_removed,by fish balls do you meanfish balls
food,not_removed,its like hot dog texture but a lot softer and its pretty flavorless so it takes the flavor of whatever you dress it with
food,not_removed,its just fish paste rolled into a ball
food,not_removed,nice
food,not_removed,apologies for the stupid question but is the green stuff herbs and the like or snail whatnot
food,not_removed,have always been curious to find out what they taste like is there anything comparable in taste this pic might be the first one ive seen in a while that made them look really appetizing
food,not_removed,is the snail chopped up and made into a stuffing or are they whole
food,not_removed,which restaurant was the rest of the good good
food,not_removed,it certainly is it certainly is
food,not_removed,theyre probably faster than most of nice
food,not_removed,herbs snail meat is greyish or brown
food,not_removed,the closest thing i think of is mussels but snails are more earthy and less salty they are usually served with lots of garlic and parsley butter with a splash of pastis this dressing is the main flavour and the snails provide a background flavour rather than being the predominant taste so people concerned about the taste shouldnt worry too much
food,not_removed,cooked mushrooms
food,not_removed,i believe whole and you scrape them out they remind me of oysters
food,not_removed,usually they are made whole with the green sauce you use a special fork like the one for lobster to get the snail out
food,not_removed,whole they are tiny and bite sized like size of peanut mms
food,not_removed,i imagine the good was very good nice is known for its good
food,not_removed,i cant remember the name of the place it was on the corner down from our little apartment we rented if i find it ill post it the restaurant itself was incredible one of the best ive been to the owners were warm and friendly
food,not_removed,thank you for answering
food,not_removed,yeah its a lot like the umami mushroom flavor with the texture of calamari in fact much like calamari it can be tender or rubbery depending on how its cooked
food,not_removed,that is really accurate
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,they are usually served with lots of garlic and parsley butter snails taste very earthy on their own they usually come with a some special utensils too a pair of reverse tweezers to pick up the shells and a narrow twopronged fork to fish out the snail itself
food,not_removed,first time i ever had snails i was at a french restaurant in mexico of all places they served it to me as you described except there was a small blue sterno flame in the middle of the plate i was only a kid and had no clue what to do plus there was a language barrier thankfully the very nice waiter showed me how to pick them up with the tweezer dealies hold it over the flame to melt and warm up the butter and pull it out with the little fork it was really good and a lot of fun
food,not_removed,apologies for the unsexy photo also apparently this tastes like pizza ymmv
food,not_removed,yumm kudos if that is spinach
food,not_removed,recipe this looks like it tastes amazing
food,not_removed,it is thats what of a bag looks like
food,not_removed,here you go i also added in black beans and extra heavy cream otherwise it tastes a bit too much like tomato
food,not_removed,atta boygirl
food,not_removed,thanks doesnt look too difficult either
food,not_removed,enjoy
food,not_removed,just tried it out so amazing and simple added some red pepper flakes to give it just the slightest kick
food,not_removed,its not a post without a photo and awesome on day mine tasted like penne vodka
food,not_removed,hello it is me your distant cousin when are we having that family dinner
food,not_removed,this was my second attempt at sushi and im having a blast doing it i experimented with different rolling techniques this time i made various rolls california rolls spicy crab spicy caterpillar vegetable rolls and i made one with candied bacon and smoked salmon not pictured which was very good i thought it would be more difficult than it is and its a very therapeutic process im excited to keep learning and trying new things
food,not_removed,what type of fish do you use im always unsure if i have to get sushi grade fish or if i can get fish from the fish counter
food,not_removed,is there a special technique to make the avocado stand on the rice or do you simply just slap one on it
food,not_removed,oh man that looks so lit
food,not_removed,thats it im going to sushi spott tomorrow
food,not_removed,everything looks so pretty and delicious it looks pretty delicious
food,not_removed,how did you make your sticky rice did you add suger and vinegar to the rice
food,not_removed,very pretty great job friend
food,not_removed,where are you getting the fish from
food,not_removed,you have inspired me im going to make it this week thanks you
food,not_removed,how much did it cost you to make this
food,not_removed,this is something ive been meaning to try what did you use for the spicy mayo
food,not_removed,pls come try your hobby in my kitchen omg pls thnx
food,not_removed,i live in the midwest and have the same concern until i learn more i used all stuff that is safe to use that you can get anywhere i did imitation crab canned lump crab meat and smoked salmon this can all be purchased at any grocery store and is safe for consumption the only other thing i have there is the fish roe which i found at a local asian market
food,not_removed,me too i used smoked salmon at home the other day you could try some cooked them chilled shrimp or like op some lump or imitation crab
food,not_removed,yeah that was a new attempt for me that i didnt quite get right because i ended up with some broken avocado pieces but the technique is to take an avocado half carefully remove the skin so that you have an entire half then you slice it very very thinly once youve done that you carefully fan out the avocado slices so that its the length of your roll then slide your knife underneath the avocado and carefully place it on top of the avocado then use your mat covered in saran wrap to press it onto the roll
food,not_removed,yup its a combination of vinegar sugar salt with a little lemon juice get it heated up until the sugar and salt have dissolved then let it cool and i just eyeballed it for how much to put in the rice the rice i just made in a pot at a ratio with nothing else added
food,not_removed,its really much easier than i thought it would be and the whole process is very therapeutic i love it
food,not_removed,well youre only seeing about maybe a third of what i actually made this was just the first tray i set out but overall it was about or so it fed people and i still had plenty of leftovers the most expensive bit was the lump crab meat which was and i bought a pound
food,not_removed,uni is kind of difficult for most home cooks to source
food,not_removed,i live in the midwest and havent yet ventured to try to find a good supplier of fish once ive improved and am comfortable doing this more ill definitely be branching out
food,not_removed,mayonnaise sriracha and nanami togarashi this mix was about a ratio measured by volume obviously not weight
food,not_removed,im lazy so i managed to find it in the asian isle of my local large supermarket it tried making it myself but it just didnt turn out well
food,not_removed,i used smoked salmon last week when i made some sushi at home for the same reason i live in west texas alton brown gives a good tutorial on buying fish if you have a good market nearby good eats wake up little sushi
food,not_removed,that one tray right there would cost probably to in my local supermarket sushi is delicious but expensive to buy
food,not_removed,ill check it out thanks for the advice
food,not_removed,recipe op

food,not_removed,had this cheesy one at an american diner called cowboy jacks in vietnam
food,not_removed,judging from your post history you live in vietnam please be aware that this is an abomination that youd never find in a restaurant anywhere in america and is not representative of american cuisine 😆
food,not_removed,thank you it was good mostly because of the cheese as therere only a few shrimps and small pieces of squid you can give it a try i also had seafood on a normal pizza from dominos its not bad
food,not_removed,oh thats good to know i searched for deep dish pizza and it is said to be chicago style
food,not_removed,oh yes chicago style deep dish pizza is definitely a thing its the seafood part that is a bit weird

food,not_removed,lawd
food,not_removed,its fucking raw gordon ramsay nah jk
food,not_removed,i have read seared as scared and i was like o edit i wanted to add a more surprising expression like
food,not_removed,i cook often but dont cook much fish i notice the middle is much more red than the edges here and i assume thats proper but how do you know when you get it just right
food,not_removed,that looks amazing rookie question can i do this with the fresh tuna steaks i buy at costco or am i going to kill myself edit thanks for all the input friends as i tend to err on the side of caution ill probably hold off on trying until i can get to a place that sells sushi grade tuna
food,not_removed,that is not a sear you mediumed that feash
food,not_removed,love the look hate the taste i just dont get tuna
food,not_removed,looks great i have a question about this because i try and do it at home myself i buy the bag of frozen tuna steaks i thaw them in the sink with cold water and cook them immediately sometimes in the same steak i will have a really super fishy piece but then the next bite is totally fine whats up with that
food,not_removed,thats how i imagine link eating it
food,not_removed,its raaaaaaw
food,not_removed,the recipe where is the recipe gib me da resipee
food,not_removed,my exs mother makes birthday dinners for her family and they can request anything they want one time her husband or one of her other kids asked for tuna steaks for dinner for some reason she had never made them before so she asked the guy in the seafood section of the grocery store what was the best way to make them he told her to only sear each side lightly like this picture she did it exactly how he described which i am pretty sure most knowledgeable cooks would agree with but everyone in the family freaked out when they saw the middle and refused to eat it i felt so bad for her i tried to help by saying that i had seen it this way on food network etc but no one would listen it was sad
food,not_removed,im going to make some seared tuna nachos tonight inspired by a restaurant called cruzan beach club on st thomas that i visited for my honeymoon would yall like a pic theyre delicious
food,not_removed,can i have your recipe and instructions on how to cook it like this i eat fish a lot but it never comes out looking like this
food,not_removed,absolutely beautiful i want some make me some
food,not_removed,the amount of people who dont know how to prepare andor eat tuna is too damn high
food,not_removed,normally tuna doesnt drive me wild by any means but this type is another ballgame altogether just a couple of drops of lemon and of a subtler soy sauce like tamary on the side sticky white rice with soy and koreanstyle chili oil with garlic oh boy
food,not_removed,i love tonno all brace i made it few weeks ago i live on the amalfi coast and here red tuna from cetara is very famous and good i made it with white sesame seeds
food,not_removed,eyes seared like tuna steaks
food,not_removed,id sprinkle my salt on that
food,not_removed,damn look at that color you nailed it perfectly cooked
food,not_removed,cooked to perfection
food,not_removed,superdelicious what kind of sauce do you normally do i have tried wasabi and soy both with and without capers mustard and white wine both with and without capers
food,not_removed,i hope that is yellowfin and not bluefin tuna op bluefin tuna is highly endangered but still somehow relative easily available be cautious of what you eat folks
food,not_removed,im literally waiting for the day where i pan sear the wrong fillet and die of a horrible foodborne illness or build up enough mercury in my system that i wind up in permanent psychosis either way worth it
food,not_removed,is it raw is it sposed to be that way
food,not_removed,not my cup of tea but it is very pretty
food,not_removed,looks nice but i probably wouldnt want to eat it i like meat cooked
food,not_removed,shouldnt it be more raw ie less seared
food,not_removed,way too hard on the sear should go for about secs a side in a ripping hot pan
food,not_removed,yes its raw people i dont understand how people in cant identify what this is this isnt the anymore where people only eat meat and potatoes
food,not_removed,this looks beautiful i think im gonna have to source some tuna steak for my own dinner now
food,not_removed,im not huge on fish but holy shit that looks good good work
food,not_removed,looks great glad to see some fish on this sub

food,not_removed,wait is the tuna homemade as well
food,not_removed,perfectly seared tuna steak
food,not_removed,oh yeah you just seared the shit out of that tuna yeaaahhhn
food,not_removed,this looks exactly like alton browns tuna from an episode of good eats i wonder if op used that as a guide
food,not_removed,i just had this for dinner last night and wish i would have it again tonight
food,not_removed,oh fuck i want this so much rn
food,not_removed,hot daaaaayum
food,not_removed,that look really delicious great looking marinade
food,not_removed,any one got good recipes for seared tuna really love it but never attempted to make it before
food,not_removed,ive never had moist steak tuna before
food,not_removed,this seared tuna looks so delicious i am salivating
food,not_removed,this looks so tastyeven though i do not eat too much fish
food,not_removed,is it weird that i trust restaurants to make this but when i eat it at home i sit and wait for the food poisoning to hit me
food,not_removed,oh that looks heavenly
food,not_removed,i somehow read scared tuna good morning everyone
food,not_removed,i have never dared to dream trying this at home but youve given me newfound confidence that such a feat is possible look at that red color wow
food,not_removed,looks great
food,not_removed,what makes fish so flakey compared to meat
food,not_removed,that looks very delicious
food,not_removed,big tuna
food,not_removed,what does seared mean
food,not_removed,id fuck it
food,not_removed,whenever i cook tuna some white glue things comes out which ive been told as tuna fat i guess i cant get rid of tuna fat but how did you cook it without that white glue
food,not_removed,i always find this disappointing for some reason raw ahi tuna is so fantastic that cooking any part of it and adding black pepper just kind of takes it down
food,not_removed,im a bit late to this but it looks tasty im jealous looks so good makes me hungry thinking about it
food,not_removed,cool how did you make it
food,not_removed,it looks really good but a little over seasoned i feel like i would use a little less rub i cant say for sure though since i dont get to taste it jealous either way
food,not_removed,tuna tataki fuck yea
food,not_removed,that looks amazing
food,not_removed,did you just watch that good eats marathon too great show
food,not_removed,ah where can i find the recipe
food,not_removed,yeah can i get that seared ahi well done
food,not_removed,looks alright i would have gone with colder fish in a way hotter pan for way less time
food,not_removed,and now i am hungry looks good
food,not_removed,that is cooked perfectly
food,not_removed,this looks good 🙃 but sad that im allergic to fish
food,not_removed,i believe this is zaatar mix crusted but op should be the one to confirms op why arent you responding to the people
food,not_removed,anyone have this and or other simple cooked tuna recipes im going to be living on a tuna fishing boat for a year and im going to need some variety thank you in advance
food,not_removed,where can i buy tuna like this the only tuna i can buy at the store is either precooked in a can or needs to be cooked all the way through unless you want to get sick i have no idea where i can get sushi grade tuna
food,not_removed,im not a sea fish person i live in the midwest we have catfish but is that cooked throughout or is raw in the middle the accepted way to eat tuna like that
food,not_removed,i dont get it how can you eat anything while its still red or pink on the inside no funny jokes ok
food,not_removed,it doesnt look cooked my mother ingrained this notion in my head
food,not_removed,that just looks raw to me i know most of the people will say i dont know meat but i just cant eat it when there is so much pink and red in the middle but hey if it tastes good to you and you know your shit then who am i to say anything
food,not_removed,omg u cant eat raw chicken r u dumb
food,not_removed,might as well eat the fish as soon as its taken out of the water that does look fantastic though
food,not_removed,fukushima surprise tuna nice
food,not_removed,bruh thats a rare slammin
food,not_removed,cut with the grain aaaaahhhhhhhh
food,not_removed,looks raw is it supposed to look like that
food,not_removed,do you serve an antiparasitic with that
food,not_removed,its raw in the middle who would eat that
food,not_removed,just go bite the fish right out of the ocean why dont ya
food,not_removed,i hate you
food,not_removed,maybe i dont know anything about cooking or fine dining but ill never understand how can you enjoy undercooked almost raw fishmeat ive had a medium rare steak at a good restaurant and i hated it
food,not_removed,looks like fish to me
food,not_removed,i know we eat sushi and all but is it safe to eat it like that with a rare center just curious
food,not_removed,i mean it looks delicious but doesnt fish contain mercury and other crap that they absorb from the ocean that isnt healthy for you httpsnutritionfactsorgvideowhichbrandoftunahasthemostmercury
food,not_removed,it looks fabulous and i absolutely love seafood but remember fukushima is still pouring into the ocean
food,not_removed,i love both tunasashimi and tunasteak but i really dislike the combination of raw and cooked tuna at the same time i think its the clash of texture and flavour my brain cant handle the juxtaposition of the cooked flavour and the raw texture and tells me somethings wrong and not to swallow it
food,not_removed,that fish is so raw its still looking for nemo gordon ramsay
food,not_removed,homemade food poisoning
food,not_removed,seared tuna is fucking gross
food,not_removed,its raaaaw no but i figure thats how youre supposed to cook it
food,not_removed,deleted
food,not_removed,but its red on the inside so is a rare burger but still it cant be that good to consume
food,not_removed,ffs needs more cooking
food,not_removed,this is why i hate this subreddit why submit a link post to a single picture of your food you know people are going to want the recipe and all kinds of other questions that could have been put in a text post with a link to the image the op has yet to answer any of these things i bet he didnt event make it one word karma
food,not_removed,the fish is so raw it swam off looking for its dad
food,not_removed,watch out for fish that has been close to japan it is radioactive
food,not_removed,something about all that raw meat is a turn off
food,not_removed,tapeworms
food,not_removed,dont eat that it is not coocked properly □ d
food,not_removed,itss fucking raw
food,not_removed,pin worm
food,not_removed,trying too hard
food,not_removed,i can see little bits of radiation looks delicious
food,not_removed,have fun with salmonella
food,not_removed,too raw
food,not_removed,i brushed the tuna with avocado oil then salt and liberally with black pepper and sesame seeds
food,not_removed,theres only one rub that uses that amount of white seed ive been using it quite often for a very very long time its called one out and you can get it everywhere its pretty salty but not too salty i like to get wild with it and just completely cover my meat until its no longer recognizable im like hey whos meat is this is this mine or is it someone elses junk theres so much seed on this thing i cant even tell somebody get me a tissue i remember this one time in college i used one out and theres was so much of it that quite a bit got stuck to my george foreman grill man did the flavor of those seeds stick to my grill and everything i cooked after that shared a similar flavor man i miss college so much one out was rubbed onto meat back in those days
food,not_removed,it looks like something the restaurant i used to work at did i think its everything spice like you find on everything bagels in other words sesame seeds poppy seeds onion garlic and salt
food,not_removed,try a ground up spice like fresh cumin allspice or my fave corriander seedsfennel seeds with a lil bit of oregano and salt p avoid any star anise unless you like black liquorice you could try dehydrated ginger and ground up lafire lime with maybe a lil fresh ginger in the pan sweating ginger goodness if you have time and patience and wanna do some technical stuff one way that cant be beaten is try just straight up just let her in eazy into the sesame oilwhhich is super pungent salt it and then dip in sesame dont forget the salt after you dip in in oil its like apples to oranges i work as a chef so give some of those a run if you wanna step ur rub game up
food,not_removed,ive used either freshly ground black pepper or sesame seeds for the coating based on a recipe from paywall i dip the fish into a sauce with soy sauce water chopped yellow bell pepper and ginger
food,not_removed,thats tataki style i think editnope
food,not_removed,its called zhatar
food,not_removed,looks like togarashi aka japanese spice
food,not_removed,have you tried just black pepper
food,not_removed,uopfeels ushockinglymilgram
food,not_removed,had to scroll down a lot to finally find this question above was all the ive never had this before people that live under a rock
food,not_removed,yer a glutton harry
food,not_removed,thats my secret cap
food,not_removed,what is it about seafood that we dont fully cook it quite often compared to other meats
food,not_removed,slightly overdone actually
food,not_removed,o
food,not_removed,xd me too lol i was like awh why is it scared
food,not_removed,its actually just raw in the middle you can eat sushi grade tuna steaks raw all op did was sear until a nice crust forms on the outside
food,not_removed,the edges are a bit too seared imo should be barely enough sear so that a crust forms but not enough to cook it that much it is a mostly raw dish
food,not_removed,the key is to start with a piece of tuna thats high enough grade to just eat raw that way if its underdone its still safe and raw tuna tastes great anyway the goal is to have a very thin line of sear to get that flavor involved but leave basically raw warm if anything very very high heat and very low time
food,not_removed,i ordered seared ahi tuna at pf changs one timewasnt very good and it gave me the worst food poisoning ive ever experienced i was on the floor rolling in pain with cold sweats and shivers never again
food,not_removed,i do this with tuna steaks from publix all the time just get to know the people working there and pick it up the day it comes in
food,not_removed,ive done it many times with costco tuna and im in omaha and it always turns out great
food,not_removed,make sure its sushi grade ie intended to be eaten raw if not listed the person at the counter should be able to tell you
food,not_removed,if youre careful you wont start a fire unless youre allergic you shouldnt have any ill effects from raw tuna as long as its fresh and not like in the managers clearance section i would cook that through
food,not_removed,needs to say its ahi or sushi grade and most stores sell poke but usually tuna thats meant for cooking is a lower grade and freshness
food,not_removed,i dont like tuna in general but seared tuna is one of the best dishes i ve eaten
food,not_removed,how dare you have your own opinion take all the downvotes just kidding i love tuna but i also love freedom of speech so have an upvote
food,not_removed,tuna is different when you are out at sea and pull blue fin tuna out of the water and an hour later are eating tuna fish sandwiches same sort of vitality taste thing like pulling produce from the vine and eating it the same day otherworldly stuff makes the rest of livin seem like eating cardboard
food,not_removed,you should board the earliest flight to japan and give it one last shot at the tsukiji market
food,not_removed,have you had a seared tuna steak if its overcooked it starts to taste like the canned stuff but if its just rare its fucking delicious
food,not_removed,you were one of those kids raised on spagrettios and mcnuggets arent you all of my friends who are inexplicably terrified of seafood or have a weird food texture issues had a terrible diet as kids keep trying new food being a picky eater is a sad way to live
food,not_removed,do you like other types of fish
food,not_removed,raw or cooked if you sear as much as op did it will taste a bit like canned tuna i personally prefer a much shorter sear raw tuna is tastier
food,not_removed,if you get the chance try a tuna tartar completely changed the way i feel about tuna
food,not_removed,i like raw tuna like you have in sushi but cooked tuna can go fuck itself
food,not_removed,yaah i dont get it and im the same way with salmon i dont dislike either i just dont think that they are worth the cost as ill eat canned tuna if im spending on higher price per pound foods its gonna be beef
food,not_removed,fishygoing off dont eat raw
food,not_removed,dont ever use frozen tuna from the grocery store for this they are ok for other recipes like making your own tuna salad but you should really go to a seafood market and buy sushi grade tuna for something like this the difference in flavor is huge
food,not_removed,i would suggest thawing your steaks overnight in the fridge and not water thawing them the texture is way better i dont know what to say about your fishy problem other than maybe the water is thawing it unevenly and the outside has time for bacteria to grow souring of flesh source work at a seafood shop
food,not_removed,if youre only option is frozen thaw it in the fridge for hrs if you dont want to wait you can sear it frozen just use little oil and cook it a tad longer
food,not_removed,the recipe is way less important than the source for the fish the correct question here is where did you get that beautiful meat
food,not_removed,this isnt a bad recipie for this httpkitchenconfidantecomsearedahitunatatakirecipe my way of doing it though is to sear it only briefly then transfer it to a plater that is covered with ice cubes and the ice cubes are covered in cling film then i place a another bag of ice cubes on top of the tuna it stops the tuna cooking without watering down the flavour
food,not_removed,well the good news is now im furious hungry
food,not_removed,came for this this needs to be taught at school
food,not_removed,yes if anything this is slightly overdone
food,not_removed,tuna is meant to be coocked raw it should be red in the middle and only have a slight sear on the outisde
food,not_removed,cooking destroys tuna if anything this is slightly overcooked i would still gladly eat it though
food,not_removed,yup that crust is also way to much the goal is to have a thin line cooked around the outside it takes seconds to minute to do the whole piece
food,not_removed,yep this when i sear tuna its percent pink with just a bare outline of gray
food,not_removed,amusinglymany people here are calling it overcooked tastes are subjective
food,not_removed,pro tip this is meat people have eaten fish for centuries you must live under a rock
food,not_removed,muscle structure is vastly different in fish land animals fight gravity and muscle structure is built to compensate fish contract muscles starting from head to tail to push against the water and move them forward the flake is due to this structure as well as the fat that separates the muscle segments best example salmon a very active fish with high fat content to compensate you can easily see the muscle segments with fat in between
food,not_removed,very hot very short
food,not_removed,yes anything but raw tuna is just a shame even though its still very good it looks awesome though
food,not_removed,noooo thats more of a rare to medium rare than a sear too much ruined tuna around the edges
food,not_removed,raw it has a completely different taste than cooked tuna i hate cooked tuna but seared ahi tuna or sushi is my favorite food
food,not_removed,you can eat it like that its like sashimi with cooked tuna around it
food,not_removed,tuna is safe to eat raw most meats are
food,not_removed,i think its zaatar or some mix with sesame seeds
food,not_removed,fish is just sea chicken
food,not_removed,not sure if you were joking but rare is the only way tuna steaks should be made cooking them all the way through is a waste may as well get canned tuna at that point
food,not_removed,not needed if it was frozen solid for days first
food,not_removed,thats how its supposed to be cooked
food,not_removed,i would this is actually much more welldone than how i usually eat my tuna
food,not_removed,true this is fish good job you deserve a gold star
food,not_removed,as long as the seller flashfroze the fish yes
food,not_removed,almost anything could be harmful for you better if not eating anything with that attitude
food,not_removed,do you actively avoid fish because of this only way youre really going to get mercury poisoning from fish is if you eat fresh tuna every single day for months
food,not_removed,deleted
food,not_removed,lolwut if anything its overdone
food,not_removed,scuse you ive had this before and its actually super delicious to be fair though everyone has preferences and tastes things a little differently according to what they like so
food,not_removed,gladly this is not very close to raw though
food,not_removed,its supposed to be
food,not_removed,cant you just eat your ramen noodles in silence
food,not_removed,itt people who dont know what seared tuna should look like ops is actually more done than what you would get in a restaurant
food,not_removed,what so you think your special or smt because you can put tuna on a hot pan for minute per side
food,not_removed,wait was this just a ploy to make a joke about rubbing one out or is this an actual rub bc ive been sold i need to rub one out on my meat stat
food,not_removed,damn what a rollercoaster
food,not_removed,id like to rub my meat with that
food,not_removed,no lie i expected mankind abd undertaker
food,not_removed,i appreciate everything you do here
food,not_removed,sounds similarly ubiquitous to montreal steak seasoning
food,not_removed,this is glorious
food,not_removed,idk how people could downvote such a masterpiece

food,not_removed,when i worked in the kitchen wed cut the sesame oil with veg oil like for this kind of use im not sure if your post gets across quite how pungent that stuff is its dangerous stuff for a novice cook

food,not_removed,but im just harry
food,not_removed,yer a hairy glutton
food,not_removed,some of it like tuna and salmon actually taste better raw than cooked at least to me
food,not_removed,lol xddddd
food,not_removed,the dislikes in your comment have me like
food,not_removed,ecks dee
food,not_removed,the usda doesnt protect the term sushi grade so any tuna can be marketed as sushi grade a dishonest fishmonger could sell tuna thats been frozen thawed and sat next to some other fish for days with a higher likelihood of containing parasites as premium all natural sushigrade tuna without breaking any rules but more than likely if you go to a fishmonger that respects their business not a supermarket chain when they label a fish sushigrade what they are trying to say is this is my best and freshest fish i would serve this to my family raw
food,not_removed,all fish sold in stores are sushi grade everything is flash frozen on the fishing boats the packaged for consumption in processing plants
food,not_removed,its my favorite dish so damn good
food,not_removed,ive never had real tuna like op made is it the same taste as the shreddedprocessed tuna you buy in cans
food,not_removed,ew this is the most reddit comment ive ever read
food,not_removed,koala
food,not_removed,cringe
food,not_removed,how do you prepare it
food,not_removed,eh youre going a bit overboard there yeah its better than canned tuna but come on its not that different from buying fresh actual tuna from market the constant hyperbole involved in everything reddit makes it hard to take anyone seriously
food,not_removed,there is always bacon ¯ツ¯
food,not_removed,youve had bad seared tuna
food,not_removed,i wouldnt describe seared tuna as fishy unless it was not a good quality piece of fish that being said searing doesnt do anything good for tuna imo any part thats cooked tastes worse so the sear has to be so light it isnt really worth searing at all i much prefer it just raw
food,not_removed,but to be clear basically all tuna is frozen first also sushigrade is a nonregulated term so relatively meaningless edit the above applies to the us only i dont know about elsewhere
food,not_removed,dont we freeze it first to avoid parasites like all sushi restaurants in the usa have to freeze it first by law
food,not_removed,you can buy sushi grade tuna at grocery stores i live in south dakota and id only buy frozen seafood its just fine if its been frozen on the boat which most seafood is these days
food,not_removed,is sushi grade tuna expensive and difficult to cook like in the picture
food,not_removed,they have ahigrade frozen tuna at winco you can eat that raw
food,not_removed,uh fish market the recipe is more important as its a extremely obvious where you buy this type of meat b doesnt matter where they bought it if you dont live in the area theres no dumb questions but this one is very close
food,not_removed,gtfo
food,not_removed,about how long do you let it sear on what temp
food,not_removed,same here i hate being that guy but not really this should be the top comment
food,not_removed,agreed i was curious as to whether anyone else thought so too
food,not_removed,yeah the cooked edges are a bit too thick
food,not_removed,everyone about every mest
food,not_removed,i feel like if youre only getting a grey cook on the outside youre missing the point of a sear
food,not_removed,well technically a perfectly cooked seared rare tuna should have less of a cooked outside because it started to cook the middle they certainly are subjective but i find it amusing how many people have never seen or heard of this before i guess i live in a bubble because of the restaurants i go to normally have something like this on the menu
food,not_removed,youre joking right
food,not_removed,i wouldnt call it ruined the feelingflavor of the cooked and uncooked tuna in your mouth besides just the flavor and texture from the outside seat itself is one of my favorite parts of tuna cooked this way i do agree though this is a little overcooked either way
food,not_removed,yup i like to put it in the freezer before i sear less risk of cooking it
food,not_removed,at least he wont get salmonella because its tuna
food,not_removed,from a man who has eaten hundreds of pounds of tuna directly from the can this offends me okay im good now
food,not_removed,im joking it does look delicious and i would gladly eat it
food,not_removed,really why
food,not_removed,tuna doesnt even have to be flash frozen
food,not_removed,youre making a straw man argument i mean theres definitely stuff thats more risky mercury contaminated and stuff thats less risky organic chicken salad lol
food,not_removed,thats a good point i dont know with what frequency one must eat fish to see significant changes in health due to mercury poisoning well i watched the video httpsnutritionfactsorgvideowhichbrandoftunahasthemostmercury and they said according to epa guidelines eating can of tuna more than every days would put you over the epa recommended limit on safe methylmercury exposure so wow thats crazy i guess im gonna wait on the sushi
food,not_removed,youre suppose to say yes chef so im telling op about his raw tuna and you are mimicking me from across the internet yeah so im telling op its raw so come here fck face touch it now you look at me and try taking a piss out of me now fuck face whats your fucking crack if you ever take the piss out of me on the internet again kiss your ass goodbye is that clear
food,not_removed,i went to the grocery store to see if they had any but everyone i asked just laughed at me even asked a few fellow shoppers same response never going back there they banned me for life
food,not_removed,rub one out
food,not_removed,now youve taken it too far this is rcooking not a lacrosse locker room you animal
food,not_removed,i thought that was funny i wouldve thought youd have been upvoted at least you and i enjoyed it
food,not_removed,imposter
food,not_removed,if there are trader joes in your area they just came out with an excellent one this year perfect amount of salt i think its called everything but the bagel
food,not_removed,you dont have to shit on more serioushelpful comments just because you made a joke elsewhere
food,not_removed,yer a wizard arry
food,not_removed,then tell me just harry have you ever wanted to eat something strange
food,not_removed,httpsiimgurcomcnzfhptjpg
food,not_removed,yeah i think rule number is knowtrust the person that sells you meat of any sort theres an awesome butcher and fishmonger in the same building that i visit they can both tell me where everything came from and when off the top of their heads
food,not_removed,not at all canned tuna is cooked and depending on the quality can have a fishy taste the grade of tuna that is served rare does not have the slightest fishy taste is smooth silky and the taste just cant be described ops is a little over seared there is usually more pink and the cooked parts have a different taste than raw though im sure its still delicious you have to try it yourself but it isnt anything like canned tuna
food,not_removed,not at all its much better
food,not_removed,lol no not similar to canned tuna at all its heaven and in my opinion its the highest quality meat out there id prefer it to a good steak everyday
food,not_removed,the tune you find canned or in tuna salads is almost always skipjack it can officially be named tuna but it is way more like mackeral and a lot less expensive
food,not_removed,thats like asking if a mediumrare ribeye steak tastes like a jack in the box taco meat no very different they use the lean muscly cuts of the cheapest tuna usually albacore for the processed stuff for the good tuna steaks its usually a fatty cut from a higher end tuna like bluefin
food,not_removed,dear god no you must go get some today and forget about that canned stuff
food,not_removed,if you cook it until its completely gray like the canned stuff its pretty close ops tuna is actually overcooked for me pink tuna is more like a super tender steak great texture great flavor not at all fishy very mild its the best fish to have at a sushi place of youre new to sushi although white tuna is my personal favorite its almost buttery you should definitely try some lots of semifancy places do a seared tuna appetizer order it rare
food,not_removed,nah i think processed tuna is disgusting but rawseared tuna is one of my favorite foods
food,not_removed,canned tuna salty fishy mushy tad bit disgusting non cooked tuna unique and somewhat sharp taste not fishy soft texture ive honestly never made the connection between the two before
food,not_removed,i cant stand tuna fish i love tuna steaks
food,not_removed,no its a completely different flavor
food,not_removed,absolutely not i cant go near canned tuna its too similar to my cats canned food the overcooked texture and tinny flavor come from a combination of the brine to keep it safe and a bit of leeching from the metal fresh tuna steaks seared have a deliciously light flavor if you dont like the idea of raw fish they cook through very quickly in the skillet so leave it a bit longer and youll still have a very delicious piece of fish cooked all the way through this sear for example just takes a minute to seconds per side in a hot enough pan
food,not_removed,lol are you serious
food,not_removed,yah canned tuna is actually way overcooked makes it taste fishy and yuck
food,not_removed,zephyr originally was looking at negative karma for their comment about not liking tuna i found it funny that people cant even state a noncontroversial opinion without getting downvoted
food,not_removed,epic cringe meme mahduuuude xd
food,not_removed,so many fish have been fished out when i was a kid you could catch lb red snapper go to the same area more like lb now yeah i quit fishing it is kind of effed up the whole eco thing this huuge ginormous changes in such a short period of time i dont even do cast net for shrimps and there are plenty of happy shrimps living in their salty salt water world i guess that just means i am confused and lazy got me thinking about shrimp now
food,not_removed,so you should get on that and try it before it disappears
food,not_removed,the cook on the small independent commercial fishing boat cooked it i do not want to make misinformation and tell you something errant
food,not_removed,if thats true than you are cooking it wrong raw tuna tastes nothing like cooked thorough tuna tuna is generally only good rare with the middle raw or nearly raw
food,not_removed,you are wrong to chop chop my experience and call it hyperbole also you are generalizing anyone everyone grow up and get a spine and see things clearly and do not combine people and generalize them stop using plural pronouns see individual things for what they are but come on its not that different from buying fresh actual tuna from market you are welcome to state your opinion market does not have one meaning in land locked areas far from sea a market is not the same as a market when the boats dock and bring in their catch to be sorted and sold the few places it is sorted and sold to the public instead of going to various commercial and corporate feeder streams like the fish i caught that went first to subzero blast freezer house and then to freezer house the size of a gymnasium to later be shipped off to make mcdonalds filetofish sandwiches you know what this conversation is pissing me off because i am the real deal and you insult my activities i suggest you build some car engines if you want to talk smack about cars
food,not_removed,eh youre going a bit overboard there how can you tell me i am going overboard if you have never been overboard much less at sea you think overboard is jumping into a swimming pool with a pool filter and chlorine treated water see while you are calling bs you do not realize that you are acting out a meme in your own right that of talking a bunch of backtalk smack about something you have never done but you are going to be an armchair commentator about it well go comment on making potato slices in a counter top oven im sure you have done that hard to take anyone seriously perhaps you are not a serious person
food,not_removed,most people dont use enough heat to actually sear it and they end up cooking it alton brown had a good eats recipe for seared tuna in which he used a charcoal chimney starter with a grate on top of it to sear a frying pan or a gas grill will not produce enough heat to properly sear it
food,not_removed,thats not necessarily true it totally depends where you get it grocery store tuna is often flash frozen first especially when you see that it comes from south africa or new zealand or wherever but particularly during the summer i can get never frozen tuna from my seafood market from within a few states from me ne usa it is definitely more pricey but if you want a cheap meal do not make black and blue tuna its like trying to get cheap good steaks you just cant do it the people who produce the good stuff know how good it is and charge appropriately
food,not_removed,i dunno i do a lot of tuna fishing and ill eat it as soon as it hits the deck maybe im taking risks but meh you only live once
food,not_removed,yeah fresh actually isnt best for sushi the best stuff they use a special technique to kill the fish and sever all its nerve connections at once by shoving a wire up its spinal cord then flash freeze it to kill any parasites
food,not_removed,expensive yes but it isnt difficult you just need a really really really hot cast iron all i do on my tuna when i sear it is heavily salt both sides with kosher salt then just before i put it on the pan i will put a bunch of fresh ground black pepper on both sides toss it in a pan with either a little bit of avocadograpeseed oil or no oil at all if you go for no oil which i recommend for the best sear do not touch it for at least it will not stick as long as your cast iron is well seasoned and you wait long enough for the sear to develop
food,not_removed,ahi is just the hawaiian word for yellowfin tuna it isnt a grade of tuna just a species
food,not_removed,respectfully where you get the raw fish is important in regards to how fresh it is parasites and all but definitely doesnt matter if you arent close though
food,not_removed,but seconds at
food,not_removed,try it with chicken
food,not_removed,mmm medium rare chicken
food,not_removed,i wouldnt say that about chicken
food,not_removed,no steak needs to be cooked through but still red unless its insanely high quality raw steak isnt any good the fat needs to render tuna should be raw because its super dry otherwise
food,not_removed,no considering no one who knows what theyre doing thinks steakporkchicken should be raw
food,not_removed,see my problem with that is i dont like a chilly center i actually let them hang outside the fridge in a vacuum sealed bag for like min then sear them super high
food,not_removed,i eat cannedpouch tuna a week its just that tuna steaks are about as expensive as canned so you really need to make sure you are getting your moneys worth when you make it
food,not_removed,yes you can pretty much any ahi steak you buy can be eaten rare or raw theyre really not meant to be cooked through and the important thing is that they have been frozen with consuming raw fish the big safety issue is freezing it to kill parasites and its nearly impossible to buy ahi that has not been previously frozen
food,not_removed,tuna reacts more to cooking like a steak would so if you cook it like you might another fish it will become dry and gross tuna is best served seared and extremely rare honestly this piece is a little overcooked
food,not_removed,that guy wrote a whole paragraph hoping someone would catch it
food,not_removed,awesome i will have to grab some of that
food,not_removed,grabbing this saturday at my local store
food,not_removed,listen here hagrid you fat oaf im not a fucking wizard
food,not_removed,httpiimgurcomioqdyingif
food,not_removed,yeah have to agree with this i just recently first tried raw tuna dipped in some sort of japanese sauce not sure which and it was delicious as fuck was quite surprised i liked it actually since i dont care all that much for fish regardless of the way it was prepared
food,not_removed,ill try it some day thanks
food,not_removed,the key is that they are rather different fish with only the nickname tuna in common canned white tuna is albacore light tuna is skipjack and the red flesh tuna you see on sushi menus and seared like in this post is sometimes bluefin or more commonly yellowfin ahi different fish different taste preparation and cost tuna is diverse and even occasionally misnamed ie super white
food,not_removed,silky taste this is why i cant stand seafood outside of tilapia and shrimp my taste buds hate the goddamn slimy motherfuckers
food,not_removed,first time i tried raw tuna it had the strongest fishy taste i had ever tried and i couldnt swallow it after some time though i tried it again at a better restaurant and it definitely had a better taste and i enjoyed it but i think it was still fishy
food,not_removed,if it were not for the cost the mercury and the environmental impact i could eat seared or raw tuna every day and probably not get sick of it i worked at a restaurant that had a delicious seared ahi salad that i would eat about once a week
food,not_removed,sometimes big eye too
food,not_removed,also less mercury if it isnt albacore
food,not_removed,albacore in the dry pack is the best
food,not_removed,i dont even know what kind of restaurants near me would sell it and i know damn well that i cant cook that myself
food,not_removed,yes
food,not_removed,sweet
food,not_removed,plenty of ecofriendly fish to catch i really miss fishing for sardines fresh grilled sardines are amazing the canned kind are miles from it
food,not_removed,i am the real deal lmao okay dude we get it you like eating fish
food,not_removed,isnt it illegal to not have it frozen to kill parasites
food,not_removed,yolo until you die of fish parasites
food,not_removed,looks like tuna is ok wild salmon wouldnt be though a except as specified in ¶ b of this section before service or sale in readytoeat form raw rawmarinated partially cooked or marinatedpartially cooked fish shall be frozen and stored at a temperature of °c °f or below for a minimum of hours days in a freezer frozen at °c °f or below until solid and stored at °c °f or below for a minimum of hours p or frozen at °c °f or below until solid and stored at °c °f or below for a minimum of hours p b paragraph a of this section does not apply to molluscan shellfish tuna of the species thunnus alalunga thunnus albacares yellowfin tuna thunnus atlanticus thunnus maccoyii bluefin tuna southern thunnus obesus bigeye tuna or thunnus thynnus bluefin tuna northern or aquacultured fish such as salmon that a if raised in open water are raised in netpens or b are raised in landbased operations such as ponds or tanks and c are fed formulated feed such as pellets that contains no live parasites infective to the aquacultured fish fish eggs that have been removed from the skein and rinsed

food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,or pork or store bought minced meat trichinosis and ecoli ftw seriously this rare everything thing has gotten way out of hand imo
food,not_removed,blue rare chicken nuggets mmm mmm
food,not_removed,be careful my marine biology professor did this and got mercury poisoning he went grey in his and almost lost his kidneys
food,not_removed,i thought you could only eat sushi grade tuna and salmon raw so youre saying i can go buy tuna steaks from walmart and eat them raw without getting sick
food,not_removed,interesting i usually wouldnt trust eating rare fish because of bacteria and the likes but good to know
food,not_removed,i didnt until you said that wow i need to go back to college
food,not_removed,deleted
food,not_removed,listen harry youre going to go to hogwarts and learn spells and shit and youre going to be fucking pleased about it
food,not_removed,was it salty in that case it might have been soy sauce since thats the most common one poorly prepared fish is awful which is why i dont eat fish that often but wellprepared fish is absolutely wonderful
food,not_removed,soy sauce is the basic common one basically tastes like salt and looks like dark tea ponzu is also common lighter brown than soy and has a lemony flavor maybe hoisin but i doubt it sort of like a japanese bbq sauce with a bitter flavor tuna is one of those fish that dont taste like fish its more like red meat not fishy at all if youre used to fish in the sense that most americans are tuna is a completely different experience
food,not_removed,tuna with eel sauce is amazing or spicy mayo
food,not_removed,because they are in constant movement all their lives there is no fat in tuna if you sear it and then move it to a covered pan at medium heat for a few minutes you will experience a most tender and moist taste seasonings optional but they mask a fine flavor
food,not_removed,was probably teriyaki sauce
food,not_removed,you might have been eating spoiled tuna tuna does not become fishy until it is cooked i think
food,not_removed,its mostly skipjack and yellowfin if its labeled light tuna or albacore if its labeled white tuna i dont think ive ever seen big eye tuna in a can
food,not_removed,it isnt difficult at all just get some nice tuna steaks and cook it in a frying pan until its closed most important part of cooking is being confident and of course trying new stuff
food,not_removed,japanese places i buy mine frozen at the grocery store
food,not_removed,freezing doesnt kill parasites from what i understand it just prevents them from growing
food,not_removed,nope fish are often sold with parasites in them you just have to check them in the same manner that youd check an apple or pear
food,not_removed,well i mean you still only live once
food,not_removed,so from my reading then yes the high end blue and yellowfin tuna will all be never frozen
food,not_removed,per side that is
food,not_removed,hey its me his kidneyss
food,not_removed,sushi grade is a myth you just dont want fish with parasites and cooking isnt the only way to kill potential parasites just go for what looks and smells fresh and seems to be high quality but make make sure it has been previously frozen it is the freezing that kills any parasites
food,not_removed,returns from heb disappointed none on hand
food,not_removed,i cant upvote this enough
food,not_removed,the fat is concentrated in the tuna belly the rest of the fish is quite lean if you compare it to a fish like salmon if youve ever had a piece of ootoro or chutoro japanese fattymedium fatty blue fin tuna you wouldnt say tuna is lean its like fish butter
food,not_removed,thats not entirely true they have higher fat content in the form of oil the larger they are generally
food,not_removed,i love teriyaki sauce
food,not_removed,yuk thankfully i didnt swallow it
food,not_removed,albacore yah i confused albacore with big eye for some reason
food,not_removed,closed im and i can barely cook a decent burger let alone tuna
food,not_removed,no thats bacteria freezing below a certain temperature denatures parasites and thats why some fish for raw consumption is frozen below
food,not_removed,seems to me youre trying to come up with some kind of flimsy argument against fish parasites
food,not_removed,hahaha of course thanks again
food,not_removed,yes but its not just freezing that kills the parasites its freezing it to degrees fahrenheit for a specific amount of time just throwing a parasite infested piece of fish in the freezer at home for a few days isnt going to kill much
food,not_removed,i miss heb
food,not_removed,like the picture sear the outside and leave the center red
food,not_removed,right thanks for correcting me
food,not_removed,and pretty much any previously frozen ahi is going to meet that requirement
food,not_removed,just keep in mind it has sides to sear and not just top and bottom cooked like a burger
food,not_removed,next time add the merlot and bacon to the risotto chop and cook the bacon drain and set aside add aromatics and mirepoix to pan with mushrooms and bacon drippings cook till onions are translucent simultaneously brown arborio rice in fat of choice butter bacon fat evoo till nice and toasty combine the two pots and add a cup melot and veal or chicken stock and stir till near evaporated then repeat it will soak up a lot of liquid so continue to do so until about minutes to a half hour or risotto is starting to become naturally creamy due to the released starch finish with cream a knob of butter at least a cup of fresh grated parm or to taste cup mascarpone peas asparagus chives optional
food,not_removed,also please ditch the pre grated cheese its truly awful and deglaze the pan you made your steak in with some of the wine and stock as well for a simple pan sauce to finish the steak mount it with a few pats of cold butter once its reduced and off the heat and youre good to go
food,not_removed,you definitely break it up or cut it up i always cut the bread into cubes
food,not_removed,just put a whole loaf in that is the best
food,not_removed,no worries i hope it turns out amazing
food,not_removed,i made this pizza with yummy mozzarella sage red onion bella mushrooms and prosciutto i even managed to do a little herb crust my stuft crust didnt work though can someone assist with this

food,not_removed,how did the meat turn out if you were to bake it again is there anything different you would do
food,not_removed,miss peruvian chicken used to get it from this joint that had some big imported brass oven the yellow aji sauce is addicting
food,not_removed,spice rub and green sauce recipe are from serious eats then i roasted it at f for mins then f for and mins chicken was kg raw
food,not_removed,the meat was a bit drier than what i would have preferred the breast specifically probably a shorter cooking time or a lower temperature unfortunately i dont have a meat thermometer expensive in my country philippines but from experience i knew the meat was cooked probably overcooked it even i cooked birds all were approx each it was my first time trying this recipe and i was happy with the result
food,not_removed,thanks
food,not_removed,brown rice and quinoa with garlic sauteed onions in smoked bbq juices and bits of grilled chicken yum
food,not_removed,that sounds fantastic a great way to use up leftovers from the bbq

food,not_removed,for the ones in montreal poutinefest is coming in montreal in june httpwwwlegrandpoutinefestcom
food,not_removed,fresh from the oven oatmeal craisin cookies a few years ago i was looking for a good oatmeal raisin cookie recipe and the recipe i found to suit my tastes the best was this one from the joy of baking website httpwwwjoyofbakingcomoatmealraisincookieshtml i personally find raisins to be too sweet in cookie dough that is already pretty sweet so i like to put in craisins dried cranberries because they are tart and i find that mixes extremely well with the already pretty sweet oatmeal cookie dough
food,not_removed,thats looking very tasty
food,not_removed,i always wanted to try them did you use a flavor infused craisin like the pomegranate ones maybe
food,not_removed,looks nice
food,not_removed,ouuu they look good my favourite cookies with a cranberry twist nice its always a shame when people put them down because it wasnt chocolate chip
food,not_removed,prunes also work very well d just chop em in half if theyre too big ive been making a huge number of these lately and ive tried several combinations of fruit whats worked the best are chopped green apple unsalted peanuts as you said to contrast the sweetness of the cookie dough prunes grated coconut pear ive also tried different extracts such as vanilla cinnamon rum but my gf has loved the almond extract
food,not_removed,thank you theyre pretty good
food,not_removed,no just regular ol craisins i dont see any reasons why you couldnt use the pomegranate ones or well anything for that matter
food,not_removed,but
food,not_removed,chocolate chip is good but oatmeal has its place

food,not_removed,oh my
food,not_removed,gross
food,not_removed,decent
food,not_removed,wat please explain
food,not_removed,stem is disproportionate and uncomfortable
food,not_removed,i dont buy it this is just another conspiracy whats on the dark side of that pepper
food,not_removed,i found the most manly of bell peppers
food,not_removed,it looks a little wimpy
food,not_removed,ive seen better
food,not_removed,why dont you marry it then
food,not_removed,yeah but that red one in the middle sucks but for real that does look good
food,not_removed,no filter d
food,not_removed,its to perfe t to get choped up
food,not_removed,hey baby how you doin
food,not_removed,oh man the things i would do to that pepper makes my mouth water just thinking about it
food,not_removed,well there is a knife to its back
food,not_removed,no its fucking not
food,not_removed,how dare you say that in front of the other unperfect pepper right next to this one
food,not_removed,you left your stove on
food,not_removed,this is just a wellendowed bell pepper
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,there appears to be a pot on the burner
food,not_removed,think about unreasonable standards youre giving vegetables with these out of proportion photoshops
food,not_removed,wow that looks amazing
food,not_removed,that looks stunning what recipe did you use
food,not_removed,oh my god that is so mouth watering seriously good job its looks really well made
food,not_removed,where did u find the tart mold im looking for one
food,not_removed,this look amazing good job
food,not_removed,yummy
food,not_removed,forgive me but what do these taste like i have always seen these at the bakery and they looking delicious but i have never purchased one
food,not_removed,this looks like it was straight out of the redwall series and absolutely delicious
food,not_removed,i dont suppose youd be willing to share a recipe for this fine looking dish my wife just started grad school and this looks like a tasty postfirstexam treat
food,not_removed,point for your tarte point for the accents thats nice to see them all
food,not_removed,looks great if youre looking for that bakery style shine to it for the future melt some apricot jam in a saucepan and brush that over the fruit it sets clear and is essentially a glaze
food,not_removed,whats the crust pate brisee
food,not_removed,cool i need to order one for work
food,not_removed,recipe
food,not_removed,i was commenting on the find them in the freezer isle comment
food,not_removed,this is beautiful what kind of crust did you use
food,not_removed,lol no i would make the tart shell from scratch
food,not_removed,pâtissièr is french for pastry chef not pastry
food,not_removed,thank you so much
food,not_removed,i considered adding a glaze but the strawberries were macerated and a bit jammy already so i ended up not glazing it thanks for the suggestion though
food,not_removed,i got mine from my local supermarket woolworths australia but ive seen these tart molds in lots of bargain shops and department stores if you have difficulty finding these then i guess maybe a specialty cake store or getting it online might be easier
food,not_removed,i usually see them in the freezer section next to the normal pie crusts
food,not_removed,i used a sugar cookie crust instead of a normal tart crust so the crust tasted like a basic sugar cookie its a bit buttery and melt in your mouth but not to the extent of a short bread cookie the filling is basically a french pastry cream and is also used to fill things like eclairs and profiteroles its basically a fancy vanilla custard and then macerating the strawberries make them a bit sweeter and jammy in consistency but still firm enough to hold its shape
food,not_removed,i used a combination of different recipes but i have typed them up in a comment higher up
food,not_removed,if youre looking for that bakery style shine to it for the future melt some apricot jam in a saucepan and brush that over the fruit it sets clear and is essentially a glaze do people like that glaze its one of the main reasons i loathe bakery style tarts it ends up looking completely fake
food,not_removed,not sure why you got down voted for a helpful suggestion i decided not to use a glaze since the macerated strawberries were already moist and jammy in consistency thank you for the suggestion though
food,not_removed,no its pate sucree sable
food,not_removed,the crust is actually made from a sugar cookie dough
food,not_removed,i have typed them up in a higher comment now
food,not_removed,i used a sugar cookie crust
food,not_removed,this tart shell was made from scratch
food,not_removed,and crème pâtissière is french for a sort of thickened custard
food,not_removed,rimsosmart
food,not_removed,thats probably the most perfect homemade tart crust ive ever seen great moves keep it up proud of you
food,not_removed,its down to preference really its a traditional style but its not necessary thats why i said if not really downvote worthy
food,not_removed,it looks amazing can you explain how you got the crust so picture perfect
food,not_removed,its down to preference really its a traditional style but its not necessary thats why i said if i realize its a traditional style and probably helps the tart keep longer but i was just curious if anyone actually preferred it that way not really downvote worthy i upvoted you and i have absolutely no idea why someone would downvote your post then again some people on reddit really do just downvote anything they disagree with and its incredibly annoying
food,not_removed,i was actually surprised it came out so perfectly myself there might have been a few factors i used a sugar cookie crust which i docked stabbed lots of little holes and blind baked with baking beans until the crust was golden in colour
food,not_removed,teach me how to make it ill use it as bait to the ladies or stock it up for halloween
food,not_removed,ditto on teach how
food,not_removed,poutine fail
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,i found richard simmons
food,not_removed,yummy richard simmons would approve
food,not_removed,mmmmmm mmm with a side of disco sweat
food,not_removed,with that broccli cheese cassarole in the background looks like you ordered to go from cheddars
food,not_removed,thatlooksbomb and healthy good one you may have inspired me
food,not_removed,looks delicious but i cant seem to shake off the thought of richard simmons disco sweat sauce
food,not_removed,its not a casserole and dont know what cheddars is
food,not_removed,thank you
food,not_removed,looks like broccoli rice cheese and maybe some type of crumble for crunch am i right and cheddars is a resteraunt in which u can order everysingle thing you have posted in this picture and it all looks exactly like this
food,not_removed,ahh ya got me
food,not_removed,looks amazing where did you get it
food,not_removed,its from penny ice creamery in california their ice cream is made inhouse and they blowtorch the marshmallows in front of you very cool spot httpthepennyicecreamerycom
food,not_removed,did they tell you that the cheesecake was in the pot because it would be awkward as hell if you just assumed the pot contained the cheesecake but was actually a pot of dirt to hold the parsley
food,not_removed,leave it to those chefs at applebees to be on the cutting edge also why is that person about to eat a cookie with a spoon
food,not_removed,yum is the pot also edible that sounds like a silly question
food,not_removed,all of those pregnant women craving dirt are like yaassssssss
food,not_removed,wait why
food,not_removed,yummy but why pink goo on the plate
food,not_removed,mentioned hipster and op didnt come back its ok op
food,not_removed,can we make our food any more hipster yes we can
food,not_removed,thats cool and all but im more interested in that deliciouslooking cookie in the background
food,not_removed,they told me the cheescake was in the pot
food,not_removed,my brother the one who ate it says its like a cake cookie so he ate with a spoon
food,not_removed,thank you for asking the question that made me click on this
food,not_removed,no it isnt sadly
food,not_removed,that is the ice cream
food,not_removed,says the polish guy posting in old school cool about his ancestors poser
food,not_removed,hipster my mom often made something similar for my brother and i when we were little over years ago it was chocolate pudding with gummi worms and crushed up oreos on top
food,not_removed,then what is on top of it i imagine the cheesecake would be ruined by having regular soil or fertilizer on top
food,not_removed,its actually a real plant pot
food,not_removed,well that wedding picture was not forced putting food into a plant pot is
food,not_removed,die she serve it in a plant pot too
food,not_removed,its an oreo cheesecake so im going to guess that its probably crushed oreo
food,not_removed,thats genius
food,not_removed,that makes sense but i dont get why they put dirt underneath the sorbet sure itll help stop it from sliding around the plate but surely it would ruin the taste
food,not_removed,s
food,not_removed,coffee
food,not_removed,coffee definitely maybe sushi its not the same culture per se but sushi chefs are usually very highly trained
food,not_removed,i love trying new craft sodas craft sodas will be a booming industry in the next few years it all started with visiting a httpwwwmacshardwarecom in north dakota they have a wall with different sodas to choose from i picked up a bottle of abitas root beer and fell in love i liked abitas beer already so i was surprised to see a brewery making an amazing soda as well i like trying new colas root beers and orange drinks in vermont i only ever saw coca cola available at one gas station everywhere else it was craft soda like maine root
food,not_removed,for foods cheese there are so many kinds just here in italy i think we have at least kind of cheese about of which have the protected designation of origin or dop status under european union regulations
food,not_removed,tea coffee are the only ones i can think of off the top of my head for food id say chocolates there are a wide variety of different incredibly skilled chocolatiers who use cocoa beans sourced from around the world either blended together or from one region by them to make delicious bars truffels other assortments that give a unique exprience
food,not_removed,kombucha
food,not_removed,root beer
food,not_removed,coffee tea both come with a rich aroma of bullshit in my opinion
food,not_removed,ah i also dont drink coffee man i dont do anything
food,not_removed,excellent answer cheese is probably the closest to the various alcoholic beverage fandoms
food,not_removed,i was thinking tea but thats not something you can buy and be a snob about you actually have to prepare it yourself
food,not_removed,why plenty hotels have a dedicated tea menu if you ask for it
food,not_removed,i mistyped in the title it was actually hawaiian bread french toast
food,not_removed,i need this in my life right now that looks amazing did you make it
food,not_removed,how was it
food,not_removed,need mac nuts
food,not_removed,i never thought about using hawaiian sweet bread this is definitely something i am going to try and make this weekend thanks op
food,not_removed,i would just wrap it up like a burrito and dip it in the syrup
food,not_removed,that looks so delicious
food,not_removed,now all you need is bacon get your elvis on
food,not_removed,its elvis pancakes
food,not_removed,what is coconut syrup how is it made
food,not_removed,no spam
food,not_removed,the coconut syrup looks like a fat bowl of nut
food,not_removed,this sounds amazing
food,not_removed,reminds me of beaver tails looks delicious
food,not_removed,that sounds disgusting fun fact i hate peanuts and peanut butter i dont like coconut and im fairly unhappy with bananas
food,not_removed,nothing bout this food is hawaiian its literally carribean made food from the god damn peanut butter from a black man to the god damn boujie coconut oil that you even been using as sunscreen but my bad cause when i think of bananas the thing that pops into my mind is fucking hawaii
food,not_removed,i was about to say sir that looketh like french toast
food,not_removed,unfortunately no its at the bread crumb ohana cafe in huntington beach ca
food,not_removed,amazing we had just back from hawaii a few weeks earlier so it brought us right back their portuguese sausage was amazing too
food,not_removed,totally had them on the side
food,not_removed,what is a mac nuts
food,not_removed,thats not fun thats terrible coconut peanut butter and bananas are all great
food,not_removed,how is peanut butter caribbean
food,not_removed,how was your first thought not i didnt know they called french toast hawaiian pancakes in hawaii
food,not_removed,too far away for my breakfast tomorrow it looks scrumptious thanks for sharing
food,not_removed,went to hawaii a few years back fell in love with portuguese sausage learned to love coffee there as well fell in love with the sound of zebra doves the smell of plumeria and local banana bread stands as wellman that was a great vacation
food,not_removed,macadamia nuts
food,not_removed,i respect every opinion im just gonna say that your opinion is wrong
food,not_removed,how is a paste created from an african hawaiian
food,not_removed,well i did also doubt my belief and think that maybe id falsely called hawaiian pancakes the wrong name all my life
food,not_removed,expensive also i bet i wish i could go someday
food,not_removed,oh neat those are delicious
food,not_removed,alright more hawaiian goodies for me
food,not_removed,its not too bad price wise especially for what you get considering taking my honey moon there in a few months
food,not_removed,not as bad as you may think plane tickets are the worst expense we got a travel rewards card just for that reason there are nice cheap hotels there with some good incentives other than that eat cheap and stay away from the expensive touristy activities goodness knows theres plenty there to do for free
food,not_removed,could you give me an estimate who knows i might go in a few years
food,not_removed,sounds good there is plenty of stuff to do for free especially staying outdoors and hiking may be something that i plan on doing in a of years if you dont mind me asking how much was the cost
food,not_removed,fun fact squab is pigeon
food,not_removed,you know what a squab is its like a pidgeon i suppose
food,not_removed,this is like saying boy is man
food,not_removed,its not at all i love squab but most people wouldnt eat it if you told them it was pigeontheyd just picture city pigeons eating cigarette butts and used condoms
food,not_removed,that is my point people are mixing contaminatedsophisticated adults with untaintedinnocent virgins
food,not_removed,well i think people know that calamari is squid
food,not_removed,what would someone possibly think it is
food,not_removed,go chargers
food,not_removed,i find that the combination of having only cheese and bacon is pretty salty
food,not_removed,looks like shit
food,not_removed,i am not quite sure which recipe i used it doesnt really matter the most important thing is to use the best vanilla bean you can afford dry riesling goes really well with it
food,not_removed,ughhhi can just hear the cracking of the top layer
food,not_removed,oh my dear lord can you make this one for me i got everything you need for sure but for free i would let you the first break through the surface in return
food,not_removed,im thoroughly upset you didnt provide a gift of the first break through the surface
food,not_removed,gif wouldnt do it justice you would totally need the sound
food,not_removed,drooool
food,not_removed,recipe please
food,not_removed,here ya go never tried cooking risotto before but this came out extremely well
food,not_removed,why am i seeing a lid ive never done risotto either but im lead to believe that its in a pot and stirred for like many many minutes like constantly drtr
food,not_removed,i did it in a skillet i added chicken broth cup at a time until the rice absorbed all cups of it
food,not_removed,huh smrt
food,not_removed,thats a shower and a grower
food,not_removed,cherry peppers are among my favorite for taste but if i want something with more kick jallapenos habaneros serranos etc
food,not_removed,i really like scotch bonnets nice mix of flavor and heat
food,not_removed,that looks terribly delicious id jam in my burger hole go to confession and tell the priest what i ate when he makes me say hail marys ill just eat more of those
food,not_removed,that looks terrible
food,not_removed,did he smash that ass afterwards
food,not_removed,lol i forgot to mention he put prosciutto ham in it as well it was good but was way too much for one person
food,not_removed,it was terribly awesome
food,not_removed,my first attempt at making deep dish pizza turned out to be a success dough recipe sauce recipe i used a sauce from the late and great marcella hazans essentials of classic italian cooking hazan helped bring classic italian cooking to american households i would recommend her cookbook to anyone interested in italian food you can purchase here edit the cross section httpimgurcomarqlcw
food,not_removed,that looks great usually when someone posts a deep dish the only filling seems to be cheese i like a good fully loaded pizza i do the same whenever i make lasagna
food,not_removed,thanks i dont mind just cheese but with as deep a dish as i made it wouldve been too overwhelming i think plus im addicted to hot peppers ive been known to eat them straight out of the jar
food,not_removed,i used to get pickled hot peppers but then i found a great way of using them in food to get them super tasty basically i use the fire from my stove to burn most of the skin off then remove the stem and add them whole but nothings better than a pickled hot pepper on a nice cheese sandwich though

food,not_removed,where do i get one
food,not_removed,good job
food,not_removed,cool cake
food,not_removed,nice which brewery
food,not_removed,how
food,not_removed,it was taken last week a filter was used however the decor awesome couch was a hand me down from an employee so it is surely based that picture is in the employee area of the brewery which is simply a loft over the production area nothing fancy
food,not_removed,twodeep brewing co see the can
food,not_removed,i have never made a cake or know how to but either a metal rod covered in stuff is holding that or its some sort of stickbread
food,not_removed,that looks amazing the white onion is a nice touch do you remember the name of the place ps tonkotsu pork bone tonkatsu pork cutlet
food,not_removed,this is silly but ive always wondered what grits taste like pudding like consistency
food,not_removed,not quite its more like a thick oatmeal or a cornmeal porridge its also pretty flavorless so you have to season it really well mine has lots of cheddar cheese in it that compliments the spicy shrimp
food,not_removed,you think your question is silly but i dont even know what grid is so can you tell me what it is
food,not_removed,your grits looks so creamy really well done have you ever tried smoked gouda in grits i just discovered this last week and have been telling anyone who is willing to listen about it
food,not_removed,i would describe it as a coarsely ground cornmeal thats boiled like a porridge
food,not_removed,thank you i have not this was my first time ever making grits and probably my third time ever eating it i bet smoked gouda would be amazing in it im always open to trying new things
food,not_removed,smashed potatoes let the boiled taters cool flatten them with a heavy pan sauté with whatever herbs you want in a little butter
food,not_removed,just eat boiled potatoes its good after all or make croquettes
food,not_removed,gnocchi
food,not_removed,tacos im mexican we make tacos out of anything smash them and put them in a half folded tortilla then fry top with sour cream lettuce and some salsa really delicious
food,not_removed,now theyre ready to be sliced and turned into german fried potatoes or just plain old pan fries i prefer the sweetsour of the germans myself google some recipes youve only just begun
food,not_removed,potato pancakes
food,not_removed,potato salad
food,not_removed,treat them like baked potatoes cheese sour cream bacon butter salt pepper whatever you like slice or quarter or whatever
food,not_removed,cover them in some oil and salt and roast in the oven realise op has prolly eaten the potatoes by now what did you do in the end
food,not_removed,i made garlic butter gnocchi today with mushrooms and onions
food,not_removed,whats your address the rest of my family wont eat mushrooms not even fried morels
food,not_removed,rpicsthatneedtobesliced wants a word
food,not_removed,you spelled it wrong lasagne is the pasta lasagna is the dish
food,not_removed,actually in italian lasagna is singular while lasagne is plural so the dish made from multiple sheets of pasta would technically be lasagne
food,not_removed,shit rip
food,not_removed,thought it was just a different spelling brits never spell it as lasagna either way
food,not_removed,bleh then nix my comment
food,not_removed,is that grilled halloumi tell me thats grilled halloumi god i love halloumi
food,not_removed,that looks fucking amazing for a music festival halloumi hummus and falafel is a great combination
food,not_removed,bet it cost bucks
food,not_removed,falafel song
food,not_removed,oh hell yeah applewood is the only way to go
food,not_removed,and here i am stuck making green bacon because i cant find anywhere i could smoke the stuff its still good but could be better the best thing is making varieties of bacon with different themes maple pepper hot pepper curry etc
food,not_removed,thank you also with a side smoker i just soak the bastards in water and apple juice for a really tangy smoke if such a thing exists
food,not_removed,eh mesquite for me personally cant complain about any homesmoked bacon though its all good
food,not_removed,to me hickory has always been the quintessential bacon flavor when i eat anything that has been hickory smoked i always think it tastes like bacon
food,not_removed,good luck please shoot me a message to tell me how it goes or if you need some pointers
food,not_removed,fruitinfused meat is just the best thing ever even though it was meant as a joke i still want to try hannibal buress strawberries and ham that just sounds delicious to me
food,not_removed,mesquite would definitely be my next choice i had some mesquitesmoked ghost peppers a while back that were amazing they were lavahot but so delicious i couldnt stop eating them
food,not_removed,that sounds amazing i would want to make a sauce out of those so badly mesquite is definitely a good bit more harsh than applewood but i love the flavor of it
food,not_removed,was this inspired by bobs burgers
food,not_removed,wow that looks amazing who is the lucky person that you served this too
food,not_removed,made with chunks of feta cheese grated colby cheese red and green lettuce and knockoff big mac sauce edit grated autocorrect to something incorrect
food,not_removed,meta feta
food,not_removed,what are those leaves
food,not_removed,lol
food,not_removed,always
food,not_removed,this is actually the ladies version of the burger mine had a patty but wasnt as photogenic
food,not_removed,i feel like with that name it should have onions or peppers maybe a slightly pickled red onion or a spicy pepper relish just my thoughts
food,not_removed,red and green lettuce i forget what its called lollo rossi or something
food,not_removed,never been feta and foot fetaish burger would also be accepted
food,not_removed,pounder odd no
food,not_removed,those ingredients would be tasty af i agree but i dont get how that work into the pun
food,not_removed,i second the motion hearing no objections the motion carries enjoy op
food,not_removed,thats my point the ingredients fit the not cry part of the existing pun i chose onions and spicy peppers because those are foods easily associated with tearing up
food,not_removed,as a southern vegetarian the only cravings i get are for biscuits smothered in sausage gravy i give myself cheat days just for the top half of this picture
food,not_removed,literally my favorite goto comfort food these look great once question my gravy always turns brownishhow does everyone keep theirs looking so white am i cooking it too long
food,not_removed,people who eat biscuits without gravy are savages
food,not_removed,im sure theyre delicious but they look just like the ones they serve at the prison i work at except theyre much smaller at the prison and the sausage bits are smaller
food,not_removed,biscuits are great by themselves the real savages are the people who leave sausage out of their breakfast gravy
food,not_removed,seeing as how all biscuits and gravy look pretty much the same that is not surprising
food,not_removed,how can you have breakfast gravy without sausage
food,not_removed,most biscuits are round not square or rectangular
food,not_removed,i just meant its hard to make them look too different so im okay that your prison food looks similar to this but thank you for fact checking me
food,not_removed,i use sausage bacon and hamsteak in mine i call it whole hog gravy
food,not_removed,right i was just explaining why they reminded me since i didnt clarify that it was the shape that basically reminded me of them i wasnt fact checking you just clarifying my original statment
food,not_removed,also why i found it so funny was how the prison manages to make something that usually tastes great taste like garbage it looks almost exactly the same but its crazy how different it tastes
food,not_removed,looks heavenly
food,not_removed,grass fed beef bacon arugula ketchup mayo mustard you know a cheeseburger
food,not_removed,almost perfect just take off that green stuff
food,not_removed,chopping board will seem less ideal when you add the gravy id suspect looks great though
food,not_removed,no yorkshire puddings
food,not_removed,i like your portion size
food,not_removed,that looks mint tho man
food,not_removed,i think ill roast some veggies soon
food,not_removed,rwewantplates
food,not_removed,nice but where is the sauce
food,not_removed,that looks pretty great but is no one going to comment on that solitary pea in the to left of the board with the potatoes
food,not_removed,that looks pretty decent
food,not_removed,food on cutting boards make for great pictures suck for eating though this sub jesus
food,not_removed,that one pea
food,not_removed,that looks really good man that lamb is crying out for some mint jelly in my mind either way this is making me hungry
food,not_removed,i dont understand why people add gravy it doesnt add anything other than liquid to the meal it doesnt have any taste especially when eaten with meat not hating just dont understand gravy and gravy eaters
food,not_removed,traditionally they are only served with beef
food,not_removed,you mean gravy
food,not_removed,not necessary when everything is moist enough and cooked right which this isssss
food,not_removed,shh hes pretending to be a potato
food,not_removed,if your gravy has no taste youre doing it wrong
food,not_removed,now im curious about what kind of gravy youve hadmake my fav thing is to put gravy on rice or plane potatoes because it adds flavor so now im wondering if were eating the same gravy
food,not_removed,thats just water youre pouring onto your meal no wonder it has no taste btw theres different kinds of gravy and some can make your meal go from delicious to holy fkn shit i now believe in a higher power
food,not_removed,this is probably the dumbest thing i have ever seen in reddit and that is saying something
food,not_removed,while im not a fan of gravy ive had it before and it does add taste well all the gravy ive had adds taste anyway
food,not_removed,extra lubrication same reason i put mayo on my sandwiches
food,not_removed,at first glance i thought it was beef can see its lamb id still have one though
food,not_removed,he goes to cinema
food,not_removed,i can either do what everyone else has done for donkeys years no reason or eat tasty tasty yorkshires no brainer
food,not_removed,yes sorry english is not my native language
food,not_removed,its never necessary its just nicer
food,not_removed,historically i thought gravy was both a way to hide the taste of spoiled meat among working class and a way to keep the food warm on its way from the kitchen to the dining room in large mansions for the wealthy
food,not_removed,im exaggerating slightly it does add some flavour but its just a bland meat coating which doesnt do anything for the meal imho
food,not_removed,of course ill eat them with anything
food,not_removed,no sorries some people call it sauce some gravy i think gravy is meat based while sauce is more like a tomato sauce ive never really thought about it until now still yummy either way
food,not_removed,i dunno man i have had some dry ass roast sometimes its necessary
food,not_removed,saying gravy doesnt add anything to a dish is like saying seasonings dont add anything to a dish a gravy can be made out of so many different ingredients it can be thick thin salty sweet sour we arent always talking about the watery brown shit your aunt lisa used to make for thanksgiving turkey
food,not_removed,have you ever had gravy its generally the most flavourful part of these dishes
food,not_removed,than youve never had good gravy
food,not_removed,you can still eat it but its nicer with sauce top end restaurants serve their roasts with sauce too and its not because it isnt cooked right
food,not_removed,definitely the one on the right
food,not_removed,haha whereas i would definitely go left
food,not_removed,why not both

food,not_removed,any brand of ramen noodles youre particularly fixated on
food,not_removed,regardless of high blood pressure which salt obviously contributes too high salt intake also contributes to atherosclerosis hardening of blood vessels through superoxide formation point is even if you control your bp through meds the high salt intake alone can kill you over time try only using half of one packet and reduce that over time too once you bring your salt intake way down your tastebuds will be extremely sensitive to salt and may keep you away from such eating habits
food,not_removed,its the salt you can retrain yourself not to be addicted to salt pretty quickly by not eating so much of it but once you start eating a lot of it it is a lot harder to quit
food,not_removed,thats a scary thought ill keep it in mind i dont think humans were meant to eat half the food on shelves in stores like a slow poisonous death for those who no know better and lack discipline
food,not_removed,that makes perfect sense ive got high blood pressure too theyre killing me but its so goooood
food,not_removed,just make sure you are on blood pressure meds if your blood pressure is high otherwise you are waiting for a stroke
food,not_removed,recipe for this

food,not_removed,i wouldnt know how to slice it like cake or cheese fact idk what to do with it
food,not_removed,just because i could and it looks neat
food,not_removed,probably yeah though its way too bitter as is apparently one tablespoon of sugar wasnt enough
food,not_removed,thank you its awesome
food,not_removed,with a hot knife maybe that might cut it otherwise i guess you have a chocolate ball to lick forever
food,not_removed,what kind of sugar granular powdered brown youre in pretty deep now so maybe you could add a layer of strawberries or icing to cut the bitter
food,not_removed,well thank you for those kind words and here i was about to delete the picture instead of uploading it
food,not_removed,or maybe you can fit the whole thing in your mouth and wait for it to melt slowly
food,not_removed,mmm that sounds really good lickingwait ill just make chocolate cake duh

food,not_removed,why post this
food,not_removed,rbachelorfood i can envision you starting that sub and winning it
food,not_removed,the pantry
food,not_removed,get on that boat just clean it up quicklykeep your pan warm for cleaning purposes
food,not_removed,because everyone needs attention in whatever pathetic way they can get it
food,not_removed,but all dbotworld had was cheese and butter and milk
food,not_removed,yup just looking for attention is this not rfood should food pictures not be posted
food,not_removed,in the fridge
food,not_removed,good luck with the diet i shall be joining you when my dissertation is done in a month just excited to feel healthy again
food,not_removed,which is what this post was about whats in the fridge not the rest of the kitchen if that was the case then a grilled cheese could have been made or quesadillas or cheesy rice etc etc ambiguity caused this misunderstanding of miscommunication
food,not_removed,there isnt anything ambiguous about the statement nothing in the fridge except cheese and butter and milk its a definitive statement that defines the only contents of the fridge
food,not_removed,except bread and riceprecooking are also not kept in the fridge typically
food,not_removed,what have you done would love to know
food,not_removed,yeah youre right its a definitive statement which inquires whats in the fridge which narrows down what the ingredients are noodles of some sort are required which werent mentioned in the post
food,not_removed,cant tell if the one with the sour cream is mashed potato or not but if not mashed potatoes
food,not_removed,scallops parboiled thick sliced potatoes deep fried

food,not_removed,wrong you bitched out after two nibbles and took a snap shot
food,not_removed,im confused at how you slice your steak id so eat that ribeye it just looks like you scalped it
food,not_removed,the amount of ice in that monkey shoulder is triggering me
food,not_removed,i think you need more fiber in your life
food,not_removed,hey there friend i recognize that ribeye i was present at ops meal here is my take at a man meal it was a good meal with our friends

food,not_removed,i concur buy some httpswwworiginalboscom
food,not_removed,lol why are you in rfood this entire sub is pictures of food
food,not_removed,the irony must be lost on you one who comments in a subreddit dedicated to pictures of food complains about pictures of food
food,not_removed,i mean it just takes good taste to appreciate some good shit
food,not_removed,because good things cannot be bought s
food,not_removed,scottish from manchester i think youve got a bit mixed up there mate
food,not_removed,agreed i prefer usda prime filets that dont even need a knife its just odd to see a butter knife
food,not_removed,not if you have good steak ive eaten at steak houses in london and none had steak knives because the steaks were so good
food,not_removed,i always associate that much ice with someone trying to water it down
food,not_removed,ve hef vord for zis in old country i believes is called joke
food,not_removed,try labelling it the narcissisticenvironmentallyunawaredouchbagmeal
food,not_removed,bought in manchester
food,not_removed,im guessing its for show in reality he probably ate it like pizza thats what i wouldve done at least
food,not_removed,be careful not to choke on your tofu bacon

food,not_removed,gallery
food,not_removed,you might not have heard me correctly when i said i want all of the kimchi and meat dumplings that you have
food,not_removed,amazing i want this as an adult
food,not_removed,lemon basil
food,not_removed,try buying modalert from httpexpresspharmacyrxtcom
food,not_removed,i like hummus and tzaziki
food,not_removed,standards are a yogurtbased sauce maybe a hot sauce i put sriracha maybe bhaba ganoush sp eggplant dip
food,not_removed,i dunk them in hummus d same with a falafel sandwich i know some people make a tzatziki sauce but it takes time you can get a pretty decent greek dressing from trader joes and cut up some cucumber and add to it and it is amazing
food,not_removed,yogurt sauce
food,not_removed,the hummus acts as a sauce or put some bbq sauce out
food,not_removed,would you like some chick peas with your chick peas and chick peas
food,not_removed,please dont put bbq sauce on falafel
food,not_removed,haha
food,not_removed,eh de gustibus
food,not_removed,wow looks delicious and very simple to make actually thank you for the idea i guess you can replace sausage meat with mince are you in nz by the way recognizing pams brand
food,not_removed,mmm i love scotch eggs and here in the uk they are undergoing a bit of a gourmet revival at the moment you can get them with black pudding beef and ale even coated with crisps chips for our american cousins the other thing thats really popular here is soft yolks they wont tell me how they do it but i assume you have to really just boil the egg till the white is just set so the frying finishes the cooking so so good while traditionally its egg wrapped in pork i say go wild wrap them in anything you like have fun with food
food,not_removed,removed rule
food,not_removed,it was very delicious indeed i guess mince could work ive never tried i would be inclined to guess mixing the mince with raw egg would make a nice sticky bond to both keep the ball form and help the crumb stick might be a future video in that and yeah kiwi born and bred thanks for the comment
food,not_removed,these have always been a childhood favourite of mine mums old recipe kinda thing you would have to get the timing just right with the eggs maybe around the minute mark to get them runny but formed enough also deep frying might help too cooking the entire outside surface and meat rapidly well worth experimenting
food,not_removed,my apologies i skimming the rules and missed the approved yt channels only is there a process as to which i can become approved
food,not_removed,will be looking forward to your next video you have a follower from central otago
food,not_removed,i think deep frying is generally how its done here they are from scotland after all and those guys will deep fry anything apparently mars bars werent enough you can get battered deep fried pizza too
food,not_removed,get a show on the food network make a gigamillion dollars and become a celebrity or have a few million followers
food,not_removed,this is one of the coolest things i have ever seen
food,not_removed,this is one of the most wonderful things ever created
food,not_removed,i need to try this
food,not_removed,tastes as good as it looks got it at tommy bahama in wailea
food,not_removed,oh my gosh where was this praying its in the south
food,not_removed,chicko tako does a fusion and theyre up in philly and soooooo bloody worth it

food,not_removed,what the north has bread and eggs and ham lmao
food,not_removed,very cool check out this i made
food,not_removed,looks like a breast implant
food,not_removed,i hate all these people who call it a cake it came to the trendy smogasborg advertised as cake its freaking jello and crappy jello at that cake is soft sweet food made from a mixture of flour shortening eggs sugar and other ingredients baked and often decorated
food,not_removed,looks like water served in a bugs life
food,not_removed,no its not a cake have you never seen a cake
food,not_removed,what does it taste like
food,not_removed,it doesnt look like cake or mochi
food,not_removed,this year at my local summer night market richmond bc if youre ever there this summer there is a booth that is selling these next time i go im buying one
food,not_removed,how can you guys be so stuck up about something being a cake or not its not like theyre calling carbonated water champagne or grape juice with some pure alcohol in it a classy wine if something is translated from a asian language and its being called a cake it usually just means its a kind of dessert and cake made it easier to sell it to the public not like the creators were lets cause a ruckus and call our new chocosnot swirled cookies cakes muahaha
food,not_removed,what would ron swanson say
food,not_removed,tons of whining over the name it looks really neat though regardless of being essentially jello
food,not_removed,it looks like a large drop of water but its actually a cake this japanese invention is as delicate as it looks and sounds but it needs to be consumed in only minutes after which it will simply turn into a sweet puddle of water make it yourself pic source httpwwwodditycentralcomfoodsthisjapanesewatercakelooksandtastesunlikeanysweetyouvetriedbeforehtml
food,not_removed,cakeit looks like a crystal ball
food,not_removed,pretty sure this is just agar agar ive made similar transparent desserts cool thing to add are rose water orange blossom essence jalabe syrup and mastic
food,not_removed,what is this sorcery
food,not_removed,everyone has already mentioned the whole thing about cake but either way it looks very lovely good job
food,not_removed,its not cake
food,not_removed,this is the second thing i see on this sub labeled as something it isnt
food,not_removed,its fucking water jelly who the fuck eats water jelly
food,not_removed,now this may look like a cake but its actually a drop of water
food,not_removed,meta me
food,not_removed,came here to say that i see i have been beaten to it well played fellow redditor well played
food,not_removed,going along with that definition what do you refer to rice cakes as then
food,not_removed,also its not a raindrop
food,not_removed,well if you want to use specific definitions this isnt jello either then these are made using agar powder not gelatin and jello is a brand anyway not everything that has this texture can be classified as jello
food,not_removed,its smörgåsbord but yes i agree with you this definitely isnt a cake and i dont understand why they call it so its definitely not cake thats for sure
food,not_removed,it really bothers me that they call it a cake as well it is just gelatinized sugar water also known as jello
food,not_removed,crap like this drives me batty its not a cake it has zero similarity to a cake how is this a cake again
food,not_removed,its like saying a hot dog looks like a sausage but its actually a dog
food,not_removed,thats what its formally called by the creators
food,not_removed,i add sugar to mine so sugary to me japanese tv anchor mika miura wrote this mizu shingen mochi from kinseiken in hokuto city is transparent and delightfully soft the jelly is made from underflow water from mount kaikoma and has a pleasant natural sweetness add the rich kinako powder and brown sugar syrup and it goes incredibly smoothly down your throat the taste is really amazing
food,not_removed,saw it at the night market for
food,not_removed,how is this a cake
food,not_removed,so its like gourmet jello
food,not_removed,paper styrofoam
food,not_removed,thats just semantics this is a variety of a gelatinagar based dessert
food,not_removed,if i call jello a diamond youre going to pay me market value for it sweet
food,not_removed,sounds like the description on the side of a fiji water bottle
food,not_removed,sounds like something the panel members on the original iron chef would say
food,not_removed,so it tastes like water from that description it sounds like it would taste like water and all youd really taste would be the added stuff powder and the syrup i mean id give it a try to prove myself rightwrong but i got a nagging feeling this dish is moderately out of my budget
food,not_removed,for the clueless like myself httpsenwikipediaorgwikikinako is roasted soy bean powder
food,not_removed,the definition of jello from multiple sources describes it as gelatinbased desserts so its not semantics its the actual meaning of the term definitely similar to jello though
food,not_removed,must of been awesome
food,not_removed,that looks amazing we did a similar but instead off egg we used chicken and portioned for bite sized apps also minus the amazingashire which my chef thought questionable was a holiday formal for my country club
food,not_removed,you are making me hungry
food,not_removed,unless you make the crème fraîche yourself which is what i did as for the richness im assuming youre referring to the body this can be controlled through not only the ratio of cream to buttermilk used but also the amount of time you let the mixture sit at room temperature while it does its thing ie the longer it sits the thicker it gets and the more sour the mixture becomes its insanely simple to do this on your own and allows for you to control what the end product tastes like and therefore what it is able to better pair with like a worcestershire sauce thats infused with thyme and reduced to concentrate its sugar content and darken the flavors to match the meatiness of the mushrooms
food,not_removed,i think alot of people are in the same boat in regards to the paranoia involved with doing such things especially fermenting your own foods at home as long as youre keeping a clean workspace washing your food sanitizing their containers properly paying attention to holding temperatures and relative humidity during maturation you should be alright people have been doing this stuff for hundreds if not thousands of years in some cases in conditions that most would consider to be way worse for this dish i didnt make my own worcestershire because i knew the storebought would serve as a solid base for what i needed the end product to be but thats a really awesome question and one that i constantly ask myself while planning meals do i make it from scratch or doctor something up when im faced with the question of whether i should make a condiment or secondary ingredient from scratch it depends on a mixture of things in order who am i cooking for is the readily available option high quality enough to use asis or as a platform to build upon have i made this from scratch before if youre really into cooking you should have a go at making all your condiments and secondary ingredients from scratch atleast once if anything itll give you a greater appreciation and understanding of the ones you buy from the store edit edits
food,not_removed,that looks so damn good
food,not_removed,thank you
food,not_removed,how did you like it and wasnt the rice hard to eat
food,not_removed,wait where i need to eat here do you remember the name

food,not_removed,antiamerican comments in a post about food from a place in canada what does that say about you
food,not_removed,i think you mean cows with the myostatin inhibitor gene which can also happen in other mammals and causes crazy muscle growth and longevity my guess is that these pancakes are using soured milk and sit for about an hour to rise
food,not_removed,bisquicks
food,not_removed,knew it as soon as i saw the photo i went there last year on holiday best pancakes ever have you tried the chicken and waffles from school

food,not_removed,anything that can make a mushroom taste good has to be worth trying
food,not_removed,what potato type would you suggest seems to me russets would break down somewhat in a soup
food,not_removed,the russets worked fine for me i used pacific coast to be specific i didnt dice them though i cut them into medium chunks but not too thick where they wouldnt cook in mins i did notice deformity in maybe chunks of potato

food,not_removed,i think a lot of recipes that call for marinating chicken in pickle juice forget one thing that is to use pickle juice that doesnt have food coloring in it if you do it turns your chicken this fluorescent green color i prefer using claussen or boars head for the very reason
food,not_removed,just pick up both endsand whap them together really fast
food,not_removed,i do this all the time cold ingredients on the top bun hot ingredients cheese on the bottom bring them together and fold as if folding a piece of paper in half
food,not_removed,very very very quickly use an arc motion to get the onion side onto the pickled side looks delish

food,not_removed,amateur i see this kind of shit with fast food all the time and they arent even making it cute
food,not_removed,add acres of garlic
food,not_removed,whenever i see a recipe call for one clove i cant help but think thats adorable
food,not_removed,i think they might be out of season
food,not_removed,deleted
food,not_removed,that is correct i must have hit the wrong reply
food,not_removed,a wide knife you mean like a spatula
food,not_removed,is it really whapman
food,not_removed,also yes
food,not_removed,i used a whole head yesterday for pieces of chicken and it wasnt enough i recommend a good garlic press for any kitchen
food,not_removed,when i started cooking i thought a head of garlic was a clove everyone loved my food except for the people who were wrong i see no reason to go over to the side of accuracy on this one
food,not_removed,youre amazing thanks so much
food,not_removed,well theyre less good at chopping but sure that works too
food,not_removed,howd you make the sriracha salt
food,not_removed,recipe was very simple sea salt and cracked black pepper on both sides before hitting the grill grill on both sides about minutes each pull off the grill let rest for minutes slice and topped with sriracha salt
food,not_removed,it was actually a lot easier than i thought preheat the oven to i measured out about cup of sea salt and put in a bowl with roughly teaspoons of sriracha mix until all sriracha is blended with the salt line a baking pan with parchment paper spread out the mixture evenly then once the oven has been preheated turn it off if you dont itll burn quickly pop the pan in the oven and keep in there for a few hours i had mine in for hours once its completely cooled remove it and pour into a mason jar good luck
food,not_removed,thanks that looks amazing definitely going to try it out
food,not_removed,give it a go and let me know how it turns out delicious im sure

food,not_removed,its icing made with meringue powder and powdered sugar
food,not_removed,alright so ive been seeing posts about the california burrito and people are saying so and so created it well first the beautiful lady in the picture is my grandma and she was married to roberto robledo and they founded robertos taco shop and help start albertos so after working hard and building up the chain of course they had children one of the kids was my aunt her and her husband started lolita s mexican food and it was her son joaquin who created the california burritoso a lot of the san diego mexican food history came from that family and all together we have over stores including my moms chain which is valeries taco shop due to a divorce so thats where the california burrito came to be heres a picture of the thats sold at lolitas and valeries
food,not_removed,i could read about the history of san diegos mexican food and the families behind it for hours
food,not_removed,really interesting i have ate a few of them i have been fooled do you all source from the same places
food,not_removed,when i was growing up albertos was the best taco shop near us it changes owners but the food seems the same still lolitas is one of my favorite spots now its cool to learn how all those shops are connected
food,not_removed,i loved reading this about my grandpa httpsimgurcomacgjlj
food,not_removed,when it comes to our tortillas for the most part yes but we make sure we get the best quality ingredients wether its in san diego or las vegas
food,not_removed,the california burrito is a burrito that originally had carne asada steak crispy fries cheese and sour cream
food,not_removed,they were selling it before it officially became a part of there menu but also whats going around is the other taco shop which is robertos also created it and there still a part of the family and also the oldest chain
food,not_removed,ah im so sorry you had to grow up in those conditions but now albertos is no longer affiliated with robertos
food,not_removed,it was freshly shredded mild cheddar
food,not_removed,just normal french fries
food,not_removed,all credit already went to both of the chains and id have to confirm with my dad if they do have the proof of it for robertos
food,not_removed,and wheres your credibility of this because im pretty sure you and i had this same discussion a couple months ago receipt from that time is proofbut even in articles most only state that the california burrito started about the and even then it was being sold way before that
food,not_removed,wasnt me
food,not_removed,post this on gordon ramsays twitter id love to hear his roast
food,not_removed,now im sad
food,not_removed,what are those steaks for ants
food,not_removed,haha thats good you end up over eating at the end because you eat waaay too many ssam wraps we cooked of beef for ppl no leftovers

food,not_removed,drumpsters keep craybs fraysh
food,not_removed,ah good question that will forever remain a mystery unless you venture to pebble beach and decide to partake in this awesome buffet i was fortunate enough to be treated by a good friend so i never saw the bill i can imagine it was pretty
food,not_removed,man it look fantastic
food,not_removed,i see no burger
food,not_removed,for the patties cooked organic black beans lentils and red beans separately once cooked and at room temperature mix with garbanzo flour chopped carrots and chopped red onion bake at f for min there is really not much to cook at this point but it give consistency to the patties you can experiment with more time drier or less time juicy it is a vegan dish that not a single burger lover would criticize of course it does not replace meat and that is not the point i added mozzarella cheese not homemade red onion a thick slice of tomato and pickles buns are also homemade just the classic recipe ketchup mustard and vegan mayonnaise not homemade a bit of fresh cilantro mixed with the mayonnaise my wife should open a restaurant or a youtube channel
food,not_removed,the sarcastic part of me wanted to say as if there is any other type of taco besides mexican but this is one of those foods that has been basterized with soy ginger sauce and wontons that are called thai tacos good work op can confirm these are tacos am mexican

food,not_removed,thats the real deal holyfield
food,not_removed,there are though tex mex while undoubtedly not mexican definitely has some level of ownership in what a taco is and its totally american one is the many cool things about food to me is the adaptation of dishes in other cultures edit sorry i forgot that expressing a dissenting opinion in a friendly manner is looked down upon on reddit jeez
food,not_removed,basterized with soy ginger sauce and wontons that are called thai tacos not gonna lie that sounds kind of good right now
food,not_removed,tacos vs thai tacos vs white people tacos all are different things
food,not_removed,i would live off these if i could so fucking goooooood

food,not_removed,theyre friedhardshell though
food,not_removed,knife and fork you philistine
food,not_removed,you grab one and hope the salsa hasnt soaked the tortilla enough for it to lose its structural integrity it has
food,not_removed,american or texmex
food,not_removed,im guessing the reason for this post is the amount of not so authentic tacos in the states these are the real deal and so damn good
food,not_removed,still waiting for thats to happen
food,not_removed,havent taken a dump yet
food,not_removed,taco bell sells tacos and certainly isnt mexican there are food trucks around my city that sell them with koreanstyle meat and kimchee those arent mexican either
food,not_removed,rumor says there are some hard shelled things called tacos those are most definitely not mexican
food,not_removed,not at all americans have gringonized the awesomeness of mexican food tacos arent crunchy dont have cheddar cheese on the or whatever else people put on them tacos are made with arrecherra carnitas al pastor barbacoa and other good stuff topped with onions cilantro and perhaps some good ass salsa

food,not_removed,hi mexican im dad
food,not_removed,have you been to kogi im assuming youre in la tho
food,not_removed,for me its definitely the raddish that gives it away which is also a good gway the surfers describe their tacos when they are a little bit rad but not too rad
food,not_removed,sounds like a new low budget film on scifi
food,not_removed,easier than you think to do my friend its street food from a less wealthy country after all source am mexican
food,not_removed,good tacos are from california in styrofoam boxes or styrofoam plates with tinfoil i hope youre happy to be back
food,not_removed,these look identical to the ones at the tiki taco down the street from me
food,not_removed,there is only one true taco and that is the soft tortilla kind you will not find any hard shell shit in the hispanic countries unless you go to a jack in the box or the like christ those jack in the box tacos make me want to renounce my citizenship you could get real delicious tacos from any hispanic food truck around edit sorry i forgot about tacos dorados those are real good too httpimgurcomaofdap these are not okay though httpimgurcomaxcdvg seriously why
food,not_removed,then i need to make my way down to so cal pronto i paid for each
food,not_removed,never been to chicago but i can say that here in texas we have our fair share of deep dish pizzas so its probably the same edit looking at some of the other comments in this thread apparently you do have legit tacos
food,not_removed,no worries beef is better anyways
food,not_removed,i was just talking about the style of meat in the taco dont know of a place called trompo there are a few in houston that still do the trompo style of cooking that i hit up every time i pass them
food,not_removed,have you tried the oakley one i think the meat is better
food,not_removed,beef tacos are chicken pork are when you run a specialized menu with mostly inhouse made ingredients it costs less than getting everything from sysco or us foods we dont have to subsidize lower selling items by uppricing the higher selling items plus its a truck not high end dining lol
food,not_removed,omaha nebraska home of a dozen junky to middle quality taco trucks all of them serving the southeast barrio well be working the west side home of the hipsters gringos

food,not_removed,lines ive been making tacos wrong my whole life
food,not_removed,i didnt know there were different kinds of skirts steaks thank you
food,not_removed,yeah al pastor is just marinated pork with some pineapple tasty but far from living on the edge
food,not_removed,lengua is the best shit pour some of that dank green salsa
food,not_removed,fried is ok gives it a flavor you cant replace with soft corn tortillas that said do not ever use taco shells from the store must fry fresh tortillas yourself at home into taco shape your welcome
food,not_removed,these are proper doublecorntortilla tacos they have staying power
food,not_removed,korean bbq shudders
food,not_removed,oh definitely my mexican family always has a container of pickled jalapeños carrots onions and cauliflower in the fridge i rarely seen radishes served with tacos outside of family dinners
food,not_removed,well i guess its time to start building a wall around rfood
food,not_removed,i am the senate
food,not_removed,sombrero checks out

food,not_removed,soy mexicano
food,not_removed,im a mexicant
food,not_removed,nah portland every time im down there i find some amazing food though
food,not_removed,ayyyyy 👈
food,not_removed,which is funny because you will never see radishes when having tacos in mexico
food,not_removed,youre saying last night i didnt eat real tacos
food,not_removed,tacos in guatemala and honduras are always rolled and fried tacos like this are specified as tacos mexicanos in those countries not to mention there are tacos dorados in mexico why you can even easily find nachos with fake cheese in mexico seriously dude additionally hispanic refers to spanish speaking so are you getting tacos from a spanish food truck you should say latino and more specifically mexican because there is a lot more difference in the cuisines than you seem to be privy to
food,not_removed,uh tacos dorados are definitely a thing
food,not_removed,make tacos great again
food,not_removed,please tell me they stopped those horrible tacos i had a dog that wouldnt eat them
food,not_removed,are you referring to my thread and of course chicago has great mexican food we have the largest mexican population in the us to la for chicagoans having mexican food is as an everyday thing more common to have a quick taco than a deep dish pizza
food,not_removed,theres a tacoteria in dallas named trompo little hole in the wall that was fantastic then bon appetit listed them on their best new restaurants in the country and get this named them as having the best taco in the country fuck cant even get close to the place anymore have to stand in line for hours
food,not_removed,no i havent but my brother was telling me last night thats where their first store was then they opened one in brentwood he said he knows the owner and has been a customer since he opened he also mentioned a place in pittsburgh that was good too cant think of the name and said when he stopped by there hed bring me some tacos from there
food,not_removed,hm it wasnt overly wet or soggy due to liquid at all i guess it may look like it but it wasnt heres a photo of the container with the last taco in it so ill let you be the judge of that httpsimgurcomalubhw
food,not_removed,wait what tortillas per taco wtf
food,not_removed,lol i just noticed i had hand surgery and typing on my phone has been interesting
food,not_removed,i had a good one down in socal that was like shwarma no pineapple though real nice with lemon on nachos i cant get the same stuff in this small norcal college town
food,not_removed,its just not for me but my whitey husband is making menudo today love me some tripe
food,not_removed,the conversations in the thread were about how mexican tacos arent fried traditionally thats what i was pointing out i lived in mexico and then in arizona for most of my life i can cook tacos and tortillas just fine thanks
food,not_removed,uafishthatvapes will pay
food,not_removed,its to late any mexican that can run swim or jump is already in rfood now you are just not allowing the fat ones that make the best tacos s
food,not_removed,spartaaaaaaaaaa kicks butt i sorry watching too many movies lately
food,not_removed,this is sparta and the taco is just a stolen gyro
food,not_removed,hola soy hector
food,not_removed,maybe it is regional but a lot of places in baja california serve radish slices as garnish or have sliced or whole radishes in a jar on the table often with pickled carrots as well
food,not_removed,sinaloa here we serve radishes sliced or whole with our tacos its a regional thing people on the northwest serve radishes with your tacos
food,not_removed,really ive been to mexico city tijuana and guanajuato and all of the tacos i ate had radishes
food,not_removed,i lived in guerrero and morelos and ive always gotten radishes
food,not_removed,exactly what i was thinking these are american tacos based solely on the radish
food,not_removed,yes tijuana has the best tacos hands down there are a lot of places in socal like el gordo that make real mexican tacos they arent wrong their formula of tacos is legit but down here tacos el gordo are some of the worst taqueriastaco joints around
food,not_removed,my family is from oaxaca mexico we make flautas which are tacos that are rolled up and fired covered in a bean paste sauce and covered in salvador sour cream and dried cheese on top of a huge roman lettuce favorite thing to eat honestly
food,not_removed,this guy knows how to fucking taco stay gold my amigo
food,not_removed,oh my fuck i completely forgot about those my bad im pretty white washed by now but i remember my mom making way back then and they were real good as well i meant specifically the ones from jack in the box and the like with the hard as hell shells and this 🌮 shape with barely edible contents i should fix my comment
food,not_removed,those are called taquitos im from guatemala
food,not_removed,but those are fried soft tortilla tacos not a premade ushaped tostada
food,not_removed,yeah deep fried iceberg lettuce with a slice of american cheese product isnt the way to go
food,not_removed,corn tortillas dont have any strength they tear easily double up to keep the juices from spilling on your pants
food,not_removed,it basically is shwarma al pastor was brought to mexico by lebanese immigrants
food,not_removed,the meat is marinated in pineapple
food,not_removed,well then info is for uninformed readers did not mean to offend missed that part about not being fried
food,not_removed,then we shall build it around rfood and start ryugebestfoodforever
food,not_removed,ni hao soy sauce ¡hola ¡soja
food,not_removed,would those places happen to be regularly frequented by american tourists the pickled carrots i know of although theyre more a side effect of rajas than a side in itself
food,not_removed,nope its national i lived in chiapas and yucatan radishes too
food,not_removed,never been to sinaloa that makes sense
food,not_removed,yeah i lived in mexico city most of my life and ive eaten my fair share of tacos if there were radishes involved it was the minority and im only adding this because it while it might have happened i cant remember a single instance examples you can see the grilled onions there but no radish anywhere
food,not_removed,nope i live in mexico city and many places serve sliced radish or cucumber
food,not_removed,can confirm deliciousness was in oaxaca last year ate many dozens of flautas and gordas gordas were in st luis potosí
food,not_removed,i made a mistake in reading this thread before i had breakfast
food,not_removed,refried beans or is bean paste sauce something else
food,not_removed,that is a rolled up tortillas not a rolled up taco taco is a way of preparing food not its ingredients
food,not_removed,amiga por fa
food,not_removed,i have only ever seen or heard them them called tacos i lived in guatemala for a over a year and honduras for six months not to mention taquitos are just little tacos but that may or may not be a regional thing just one i never saw i dont even know how to ask for coffee without saying cafecito
food,not_removed,what the fuck do you think the premade ushaped tostada was before it became a hard shelled taco
food,not_removed,sure but theyre crunchy taco shells
food,not_removed,first time i hear that but that makes sense they break really easily
food,not_removed,i have heard this also reminds me of the fact that salma hayek is lebanese
food,not_removed,although that would have been lamb rather than pork originally
food,not_removed,in oakland in the fruitvale district every taqueria and taco truck will give you radishes with your tacos this area is majority hispanic and tourists have no reason to come here oh actually anthony bourdain came here to eat at a taco truck so maybe there is a reason for tourists to come now lol
food,not_removed,well you would probably know better than me if you lived there also have you tried the al pastor con pina it was my wife and is time trying them like that and they were amazing
food,not_removed,literally bean sauce its mixed with a bunch of spices making it spiced and pretty tasty i might make a recipe in how my mother prepares the flautas i
food,not_removed,take a bite out of a crappy jack in the box taco then take a bite out of a freshly made taco dorado the taco dorado would destroy that crappy taco
food,not_removed,so is carlos slim
food,not_removed,yeah you cant have the pastor without the pineapple it adds a lot to the flavor
food,not_removed,i want to mexico couple weeks ago food was delicious i wish i knew how to make all that food
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,it was my first attempt and i was limited to dough cheese egg butter salt and pepper no garlic parmesan or olive oil no marinara

food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,your pork looks like chicken
food,not_removed,flying pigs
food,not_removed,heres the sauce recipe httpwwwthegourmetgourmandcomporktenderloinwithblueberrysauce pork was sous vided at for just under hours
food,not_removed,lol sous vide
food,not_removed,what exactly do you find funny about sous vide
food,not_removed,ive never actually seen it used for pork before isnt the point usually to get an even pink on red meats
food,not_removed,other than it requires you to boil your food in a bag of water and takes times longer to cook anything lol the guy on the youtube channel cracks me up want the perfect steak just boil it in this bag of water that costs a ton of money for an hour
food,not_removed,its really just about controlling your cooking in restaurants its used for consistency mostly and eliminating error the great thing about sous vide is you will never overcook anything drop it in the water bath and forget it until its time to sear it off without ever having to worry about it being overdone also the lower temp cooking for longer periods of time will make extremely tender braised items like pot roast its great for all sorts of meats not just red meat and pork is the best when its pink throughout a solid medium on pork is the way to go
food,not_removed,i mean youre not boiling it at all the temperature for anything youre doing will never be anywhere close to boiling you can look at my comment above about why its used in restaurants considering its used by the vast majority of the best restaurants in the world i would say its a pretty good technique
food,not_removed,yeah but that pork looks like its actually well past done and slightly dry the sous vide is handy and all and if youve got the money to buy one and play around then sweet have fun but if youre using toys to make your cooking more precise and still over cooking it maybe youd be better off learning to cook a piece of meat properly the old fashioned way first
food,not_removed,yeah youre splitting hairs and you know it the perfect steak cooked in a bag of water for an hour in a device that costs almost im not saying the outcome isnt great im just saying it isnt practical for the average person at home
food,not_removed,we got one for the fun of it and it was not worth it there is way more effort and waste dealing with the vacuum seal part the taste isnt really all that better than grilling a steak or chicken in our backyard i was very disappointed
food,not_removed,i would agree it does look a little overdone you really have to know your temperatures i would say for a pork chop about is the absolute most you would want to go so that by the time you gain a few degrees from searing and resting its perfect
food,not_removed,maybe not for the average person at home no but for a restaurant completely worth it but you can achieve some amazing results in things even at home
food,not_removed,you can just use a ziplock bag no need for a vacuum seal
food,not_removed,it all looks nice until the egg hope it still tasted good
food,not_removed,i just dont get the appeal in boba tea the texture really weirds me out
food,not_removed,oh did you leave it to a chance cube to decide the fate of your meal
food,not_removed,it was delicious first time eating it with raw garlic and it really brings out the flavor of the sausage
food,not_removed,i wish it didnt appeal to me too because i need to cut down i drink it like times a week and its crazy high in sugar
food,not_removed,haha it came from the jenga game they let you borrow
food,not_removed,all i can think of is what a mess it would be to eat by hand
food,not_removed,dude the japanese friends i have call it a have it your way pancake so i am inclined to call it a pancake
food,not_removed,pizza is an odd description of okonomiyaki frittata or omelette is much closer to a useful description
food,not_removed,ive only ever heard it referred to as okonomiyaki in the west is japanese pizza
food,not_removed,but its not tuesday whoa whoa whoa were allowed to have taco thursdays as well they look delicious by the way
food,not_removed,too funny the bag of doritos in the background

food,not_removed,nice care to divulge your carne asada recipe
food,not_removed,we do taco night at home but we should really call it taco bell night because our mexican food looks closer to taco bell than real mexican food
food,not_removed,that looks amazing any chance you could share the recipes
food,not_removed,it looks great could you post the recipe on here that would be awesome i would love to try it out myself
food,not_removed,please post recipes one final step i always do with my carnitas after its been pulled spread it out on a cookie sheet with aluminum foil drizzle the juices back over the top of it and then finish it off under the oven broiler for about minutes adds a little crispy to it
food,not_removed,shells or tortillas because if shells i dont like you anymore if tortillas you fine adding a picture of what a taco night looks like in mexico which are called and consist on several stews which all can be thrown into tacos remember tortilla is your friend if the food can stay inside the tortilla while you eat it it is a taco not just meat congratz on your taco night looks awesome

food,not_removed,im with you on that onions can be overpowering i like the cilantro but for me it is the fresh squeezed lime that makes carnitas a favorite dish
food,not_removed,as a person who loves onions the only way there can ever be too many onions is long past the point of sanity for other people so i never experience this too many onions phenomenon but i sympathize with ratios ratios are important in your food and seeing that yeah it definitely needs more cilantro
food,not_removed,you can never have enough onions o
food,not_removed,im part hispanic and hate cilantro damn genetics
food,not_removed,i really wish places wouldnt mix the two together i love some cilantro on my tacos but hate white onions

food,not_removed,i spy tortillas in the background next to that persons hand
food,not_removed,shells errytim fight me irl
food,not_removed,haha im english so if i came over there id only have shells because of the novelty itd be like having a poppadom also ops pic has the most delicious looking meat i can imagine but your pic has vegetables and i couldnt have a tortilla without some crunchy veg
food,not_removed,if anyone is from la check out el taurino for some bomb birria and consome
food,not_removed,do you have a pressure cooker i just cut mine into chunks put seasoning on cumin salt chili powder etc put it in with a half cup broth and two fresh squeezed oranges and one lime put the orange chunks in there too minutrs when it was done i broiled it for a few minute and defatted the liquid they were awesome if you dont have a pressure cooker id go hours in a degree f oven
food,not_removed,httpiimgurcomdxwrtjpg i have used twice recently amazing results they are a bit cheating and more the shredded braised style not quite the same as the roasted then flash fried style the chipotles in adobo can be quite hot i cut it back to of the chiles and then add salsa to tacos as required i love spicy food but i think its better in salsa format not built into the protein when it comes to tacos i also brown the meat off in the pan first and deglaze with some beer before i get the process going dont be afraid to keep the boil going pretty decent or it will take longer than hrs to cook all the liquid out i also dont broil it at the end just throw the portions for tacos into a small pan and fry it up a bit to warm it back thru before going into a taco add cilantrolimejuiceonionsalsa as desired in a good tortilla and consume
food,not_removed,please
food,not_removed,pretty close to the recipe linked below in slow cooker i put a whole pork shoulder squeezed in oranges and a grapefruit cloves of chopped garlic an onion can of chipotles in adobo oregano cumin salt and pepper cook it on low for some number of hours shred the pork with some of the juice then i pan fry it in a skillet right before serving that gets it nice and crispy the key is the peach mango habanero sauce that you dont see in the pictures edit no more propagation of lies
food,not_removed,chipotle in adobo sauce blend it in a blender with some garlic and pour it on pop it in the slow cooker
food,not_removed,well unless they have a spit to roast it on it is not al pastor
food,not_removed,my favorite kind after having them i can no longer go back to eating most other types my friends call me a taco snob but they dont know what theyre missing out on
food,not_removed,from which you make tacos its not complicated
food,not_removed,white onion cilantro lime juice
food,not_removed,thats definitely not carne asada but now im curious about skillet steak tacos
food,not_removed,picture of taco night not one taco in frame
food,not_removed,that is a mountain of sauce on fries
food,not_removed,dafuq is this monstrosity
food,not_removed,ha prepared for the official kick off dinner of the guys olympicsmaybe next year
food,not_removed,me just me
food,not_removed,isnt this how everyone does it spritz a little lime over the tortilla too
food,not_removed,theres also a game we play called beer pong which requires many of these cups
food,not_removed,salsa for sure guac absolutely peach mango habanero sauce for the carnitas you bet
food,not_removed,what do you call carne asada then skirt steak marinated grilled sliced enlighten me please
food,not_removed,well to everyone else it tastes fucking delicious sooooooo
food,not_removed,its sad that youll never be able to understand the magnificence of coriander the sun is bolder and the sky bluer in my shoes
food,not_removed,its strange to see the only mexican beer in other places is modelo about half of the people i know that drink dont like it very much
food,not_removed,less cleaning bra
food,not_removed,im guessing those are the tortillas right
food,not_removed,httpimgurcomaijgtl
food,not_removed,except for when you make it correctly and cut across the grain then you simply eat it and it works
food,not_removed,what the hell do you think tacos are made with my friend
food,not_removed,well this is mexican food not american food also your comments makes zero sense since literally all food everywhere in the world is mixed up otherwise youre just eating raw fruits veggies nuts etc separately food without spicescondiments etc that sounds terrible
food,not_removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,your sweet sweet meat dayum thats righteous
food,not_removed,what is the marinade you use on your meat
food,not_removed,twohundredtwentytwothousandtwohundredtwentytwo
food,not_removed,have you tried just
food,not_removed,meat tastes hella good tho fam
food,not_removed,im lost does eating meat make them cowards or down voting makes them cowards or does being a coward cause them to do one of the other two things
food,not_removed,perhaps the rfood subreddit is not for you
food,not_removed,your more outta place here than a chicken at a pigeon convention
food,not_removed,bacon need i say more
food,not_removed,its thirsty thursday where you drink all the tequilabeer you didnt have room for when you ate the tacos on tuesday

food,not_removed,need a shirt with this
food,not_removed,thats loco
food,not_removed,love it or tacos al pastor and squeezing that lime out all over the tacos and then the first bite holy fuck its my favorite
food,not_removed,soak the onions in water for a bit and drain takes out some of the punch
food,not_removed,its all about that lime
food,not_removed,im full mexican american and i hate both cilantro and onions
food,not_removed,same here i also cant stand raw onions
food,not_removed,any good mexican taco place will let you ask for just one or the other
food,not_removed,my grandma in mexico does that actually because she knows that i like more cilantro than onions my mom hasnt caught on though
food,not_removed,any special way you make or season the beef and what cut a good slice of quality beef is enough for many applications but taco meet needs some spice i have never tried oregano cumin or coriander on beef before although they are staples of many other mexican dishes curious how that works maybe i should try some fajitas later this week
food,not_removed,hey thanks
food,not_removed,throw some orange juice in that marinade trust meee edit also thanks for writing the pork recipe that looks really good
food,not_removed,carne asada cuts in the us are super expensive now same as steak because of its popularity
food,not_removed,thanks ill definitely be trying both of those its never crossed my mind to put stuff in a blender for a marinade but i cant wait to try it
food,not_removed,awesome im going to try the carnitas recipe ive done one similar but havent added grapefruit or canned chipotles
food,not_removed,thanks going to give these a shot love expanding my repertoire and my mexican is average at best
food,not_removed,i think you are right my powers of observation suck
food,not_removed,they are all mostly meat dishes too though except for the rice also ops is their actual taco night ive never taken a picture of one of my familys taquizas which i should you know for karma p so ops taco night my taquiza picture
food,not_removed,on point☝️
food,not_removed,what the point of saying fresh tortillas in spanish im pretty sure you can translate fresh pretty well
food,not_removed,i have a recipe where i braise them in lard with pretty much the same ingredients for about hours then fry them for about minutes at the end with a little sweetened condensed milk i learned to make it from my moms neighbor so good
food,not_removed,yeah my wife cooks ours in a dutch oven i love walking in the door and smelling carnitas mmmmmm
food,not_removed,do you add any other seasonings also what kind of broth did you use just curious i have a pressure cooker and am looking for a good way to cook carnitas
food,not_removed,if you care about random input from a stranger who is not op i put can of enchalada sauce in the slow cooker with the pork but we really enchalada sauce flavor on the pork
food,not_removed,fyi its correctly spelled habanero there is no ñ so many english language menus and websites get this wrong they propagate the error
food,not_removed,the only one missing out is the guy that limits himself to a single type of taco
food,not_removed,bro tacos can be made with any good meat skillet steak us awesome i always buy it from stater bros and they are awesome
food,not_removed,that is a mountain of meat on top of chips
food,not_removed,the mt halal mate a giant halal snack pack from melbourne
food,not_removed,darn
food,not_removed,i agree and to me its absolutely acceptable if you dont throw them away after using once we here in germany play water pong and can therefore save the cups for playing pong other nights
food,not_removed,damn for you op serious though try a homemade tortilla one time go with a lard based recipe
food,not_removed,here in mexico we never use meat that thick theyre thin steaks that never have pink inside
food,not_removed,people on here crack me up based on genetic factors some people have an aversion to cilantro i happen to be one of them i mean isnt this common knowledge
food,not_removed,you are correct ill show myself out
food,not_removed,yeah apparently its a language barrier thing where i come from we call those crunchy hardshell ones tacos and when you use tortillas you just call the end product tortilla as well
food,not_removed,you just admitted hes right though if tacos are made of tortilla then this is just tortilla i dont know what tacos or tortillas are i was just pointing out a flaw in your logic
food,not_removed,your fucking username
food,not_removed,how many times do you get why do i see you everywhere a day seriously i see you everywhere
food,not_removed,heyyyyy
food,not_removed,bloody hell youre everywhere
food,not_removed,you again what are you omnipresent or something
food,not_removed,i saw you earlier today
food,not_removed,ive seen you every where
food,not_removed,god damn it you ruined my appetite
food,not_removed,i have seen you everywhere lately
food,not_removed,all the teachers would have the same password for their online domaines that were school related all they had to seperate the accounts were different usernames
food,not_removed,given the number of red solo cups in the background id say theyve got it covered on all fronts
food,not_removed,juebebes
food,not_removed,or just use sweet onions
food,not_removed,thanks mom
food,not_removed,in blender mix jalapeños anaheim poblano peppers a white onion cloves of garlic cilantro lime salt and olive oil put that deliciousness in a ziplock with the skirt steak overnight to marinade grill over high heat until your desired level of bloodiness
food,not_removed,although i dont have the tools for it personally spit roasted beef is the best had it at like a meat banquet and didnt want to stop eating
food,not_removed,i use flank or skirt steak and use the marinade recipe mojo in this link httpwwwfoodnetworkcomrecipestylerflorencetacoscarneasadarecipehtml then i cook it in the broiler because i hate lighting up my grill let it rest dice it up top with cilantro white onion and occasionally some cotija cheese its so good just make sure that you tenderize the meat because these cuts can be tough also be sure to slice against the grain of the meat
food,not_removed,the spices you listed are my gotos when it comes to making anything mexican food depending on what im making i also add garlic onion lime juice vinegar red chile powder again depends on the dish
food,not_removed,but i meancarne asada is a style there is no specific cut that makes it carne asada people tend to use skirt or flank steak in the us flap meat is traditional and the best taquerias in tijuana use well marbled steak cuts for it
food,not_removed,to try and sounds cultured lmao
food,not_removed,yours is the closest to actual carnitas
food,not_removed,dutch oven smelling carnitas
food,not_removed,darn if only there were any aspect of germanys history or culture that i could look to as having a higher cost in human life than americas use of plastics
food,not_removed,it is youre just in the minority and the rest of us dont care except to pity you why should we not think this is delicious just because you dont
food,not_removed,good steak marinated for a long time then grilled hot and sliced cross grain shouldnt do you wrong
food,not_removed,the crunchy hard shells are an american abomination real mexican tacos are made with tortillas
food,not_removed,tacos are made using tortillas sort of like how a sandwich is made using bread it doesnt mean a taco is just a tortilla anymore than a sandwich is just bread
food,not_removed,sorry
food,not_removed,no way
food,not_removed,my inbox has new messages must be a few in there
food,not_removed,this is the second thread since i woke up that ive seen this asked
food,not_removed,i know or wait maybe were everywhere
food,not_removed,its pretty cool to kill an animal with your own hands and then eat it nothing cowardly about that man is born to kill
food,not_removed,but you cant voice your dietary activism here it is in the rules
food,not_removed,what did you do for carnitas
food,not_removed,ah that sounds really good being a pretty shitty cooker i had no clue what an anahiem was after some googling i found it was a type of pepper and by context it seemed that way but at first i thought you misspelled something so bad it became a city near disneyland
food,not_removed,oh nice thanks for the tips
food,not_removed,yeah oregano cumin and coriander all ground are the tenants of good carnitas i have a shit ton of all three because you never know when youre going to need to make a huge pot of carnitas lol also chipotles in adobe sauce i started using in any mexican dishes that are tomatoe based and it added some great flavor and bit of spice i usually get a little eight ounce can of it in my carnitas and then use the last bit in my spanish rice i make the rice comes out a bit darker a little spicy not too much if you make a lot but it has a real great flavor lot more depth then just some tomato and onion
food,not_removed,thats not nice lol
food,not_removed,thanks i grew up in south texas so i have some good recipes

food,not_removed,for as long as i was there we often got into trouble for messing their meeting schedules up since we could just enter their accounts we didnt write wierd messages though we assumed they could guess it through the poor grammar
food,not_removed,chipotles in adobo are excellent i love those little cans usually have or of them in my pantry i had chicken guacotacos last night that uses some of that as part of the sauce the baby can of the chipotles in adobo the same size can tomato sauce and one cans volume of orange juice a few shakes of cheap mex hot sauce if you want more heat than the chipotles bring blend in a blender until smooth cut the raw boneless chicken into appropriate tacofilling sized pieces breasts thighs doesnt matter season with oregano a tiny bit of cumin coriander granulated garlic sp baking dish put chicken and enough sauce to coat all of it cover with foil and bake at treefiddy for an hour i serve mine with fresh corn tortilla shells pico fresh guacamole aka i make a bunch of pico moosh up an avocado combine with a little more cilantro squeeze of lime kosher salt a little jack cheese sour cream if youre into it we had a growler of a local beer bosque brewings elephants on parade paired amazing just something about beers and tacos amiright

food,not_removed,those are tacos not gorditas real mexicano here so i consider myself a connoseur
food,not_removed,thats not a gordita that looks like a pita
food,not_removed,lettuce underneath the beef and cheese what kind of monster are you
food,not_removed,i love mexican food i also love food that pretends to be mexican food im just happy that youre happy about your food and i think we all should just be happy for you
food,not_removed,thats not a gordita a gordita is a fat piece of corn masa that looks almost like the size and shape of a burger patty you fry it and it should be crisp on the outside and ever so warm and soft on the inside you slit it open and make a pouch to stuff it with ground meat lettuce tomato grated cheese and all the hope with love a mother can give this picture is what hitler makes to spite gypsies i hope youre proud of yourself
food,not_removed,and now youre gordito
food,not_removed,sorry my friend that is not a gordita thats just meat on flat bread maybe next time
food,not_removed,is that straight up just pita
food,not_removed,im so high right now and i want of those
food,not_removed,if were talking taco bell gorditas i know theyre not the real thing the chicken baja ones are delicious
food,not_removed,not a gordita at all
food,not_removed,thats not a gordita im mexican
food,not_removed,not a gordita very americanized tortilla with very americanized ingredients coming from someone who is mexican and living on the border of tx mx
food,not_removed,thats not a gordita you god damned heretic
food,not_removed,apparently thats not an authentic gordita as one can tell from the screaming in the comments it does however look like an awesome naan taco and i wish to eat it
food,not_removed,looks delicious not a gordita at all though
food,not_removed,so how did you make the sauces
food,not_removed,is that pita bread
food,not_removed,is that nacho cheese please tell its not
food,not_removed,thats not a gordita gorditas are supposed to be filled with thats more like a sope or a fat taco but it looks good
food,not_removed,is that pita bread naan what did you use
food,not_removed,how did you make the cheese
food,not_removed,edit link cleanup
food,not_removed,looks good and i would eat the shit out of it but nothing about this mess is even close to anything that even resembles a hint of a memory of a clue as to what a gordita is flat bread its good especially with the american nacho cheese and not even close to picadillo tacobell meat it looks great i would eat of those right not if i could but its not a gordita its homemade awesome tacobell
food,not_removed,what kind of shells are those
food,not_removed,i dunno probably three hours like three and a half hours making you know the sauce and the lettuce and meat and you know the necessary accouterments and then by the time i was done i didnt really feel like like eating it
food,not_removed,i wanted a gordita i made a taco
food,not_removed,thats a taco bell style gordita
food,not_removed,not a gordita or mexican food at all id still eat it tho
food,not_removed,now what we can do for you
food,not_removed,now make a naked chalupa
food,not_removed,i thought that was a chalupa
food,not_removed,i wanted godzilla i made godzilla i ate godzilla

food,not_removed,my mouth is salivating so hard
food,not_removed,and two taco salads for the señoritas
food,not_removed,now i also need it
food,not_removed,i dont know what gordita is exactly but it looks nice although it looks like id have more filling
food,not_removed,whether these are true gorditas or no how did you make them specifically just the shells they look delicious
food,not_removed,hell it sounds like you also shat these so called gorditas right out of your ojito gordito
food,not_removed,next time put a hard taco in there and do a gordita crunch
food,not_removed,now make a cheesy gordita crunch
food,not_removed,deleted
food,not_removed,thats a new way to make a gorus dita good job hungry mexican here supporting your method edit ps is that canned cheese tho because if so fuck dude
food,not_removed,fuck me that looks nice i want some now too
food,not_removed,are you now gordita
food,not_removed,i think this is more of both a philly cheese steak and a grilled cheese than a gordita
food,not_removed,yummy
food,not_removed,and then just top that off with a little creme fraiche
food,not_removed,why the fuck do people eat fast food i do all the time
food,not_removed,i knew people would point out that these are not legit gorditas but as a mexicanamerican i just wanted to point out that you may not like legit gorditas if you tried them i know i dont care for them too much theyre usually very doughy and bland you have to pack loads of condiments on them for them to taste anything fried gorditas on the other hand insert ric flair woo here
food,not_removed,thanks for the high resolution photo of your disgusting food i dont even have to wish for you to have wild diaharrea
food,not_removed,what cheese was used
food,not_removed,is that supposed to be cheese
food,not_removed,it may not be a gordita or even close to a gordita but i would like to applaud you for liking mexican culture enough to attempt to make our food truly thank you
food,not_removed,and then i became gordita
food,not_removed,not sure if anyones mentioned this but thats a taco not a gordita im now an expert after reading this thread
food,not_removed,thats pita not even a mexican dish not a gordita looks good either way glad you enjoyed it
food,not_removed,those look like naan bread
food,not_removed,damn it now im hungry even though those are not gorditas
food,not_removed,now i want gordita
food,not_removed,ill have some of that by goodness jah
food,not_removed,looks decent but this is not a gordita its more of a taco than anything but it has pita bread instead of tortillas and some kind of cheese spread out of a jar and sour cream which is only in texmex and big pieces of lettuce and tomatos
food,not_removed,that looks like pita bread gorditas are slit open and filled and theyre made with corn theyre one of my favorite mexican foods and this post and that yellow cheese are ruining it for me lol
food,not_removed,not mexican food i dont know what this shit is
food,not_removed,fuck yeah you did well done well fucking done
food,not_removed,everyone here is talking mad shit about how its not authentic if it tastes good then who gives a fuck fucking food elitists
food,not_removed,this is obviously a taco bell gordita i want the nearest taco bell is tooooo damn far
food,not_removed,dude great job that looks delicious i bet half these people here cant even make a sandwich
food,not_removed,you are the julius caesar of food
food,not_removed,did you gorge yourself on your gordita
food,not_removed,i have made over of those
food,not_removed,just fyii did not claim to have made mexican i made a taco bell styled gordita and didnt want to call it something unpoetic like fake mexican food pita wrapped taco also i made it because i wanted it to be better than taco bell not out of worship or anything funky
food,not_removed,congrats kind sir
food,not_removed,that looks fucking gross like you just get a mouth full of cream and cheese and nothing but meat inside you might as well made a hamburger for the low quality garbage food youre eating
food,not_removed,i love gorditas the best are from a little place in el paso tx that i am keeping a secret 😉
food,not_removed,everyone knows thats a chalupa
food,not_removed,congrats kind sir
food,not_removed,congrats kind sir
food,not_removed,congrats kind sir
food,not_removed,another mexican here and i can confirm those things are not gorditas thats not mexican food at all are gorditas
food,not_removed,you are correct the ops are wrong for all gorditas are like a thick corn tortilla that is not really dense the trick is the baking soda making the masa puff slightly
food,not_removed,taco bell has ruined what people think a gordita is
food,not_removed,they sell a pita taco at taco bell as a gordita and gorditas are hard to come by in the us unless you find a proper taqueria so its conceivable someone thinks this is one also theres a restaurant near me that has gorditas on the menu but you get one and its a tostada ive been fooled multiple times by this because its so unexpected
food,not_removed,can confirm
food,not_removed,the american version typically just uses a thick flour tortilla ground beef nacho cheese and what ever other toppings you like it is just one of those food items that get lost along the way personally i really like both the traditional mexican variety and the american fat tortilla taco i mean if it tastes good i really dont care what you call it
food,not_removed,then perhaps a connoisseur 👀
food,not_removed,link to youtube video please
food,not_removed,taco thats a strange burrito
food,not_removed,do you have a recipe
food,not_removed,bread is too thick to be a taco
food,not_removed,how do you feel about the cheese
food,not_removed,ive had a gordita that looked pretty similar to this in mexico it was also flour the only difference the fillings were on the inside like a pita bread
food,not_removed,op here im an uncultured white guy operating solely on my knowledge of the taco bell menu this is a and thats what i wanted to eat so thats what i made while the label may be off my delight was unaffected
food,not_removed,youre a real mexicano and you consider anything with lettuce and ground beef to be a taco and nacho cheese sauce really
food,not_removed,wall
food,not_removed,but obviously not a connoseur at spelling
food,not_removed,greatnow i gotta take my up vote back
food,not_removed,who cares i have a mexican friend who always corrects me on mexican food lol ffs as long as its good who cares
food,not_removed,you dont tell op what words mean thats definitely what he says it is even if its lacking basically all of the elements necessary to be a gordita its still a gordita if he wants it to be
food,not_removed,i assume to try to stop the grease from destroying the tortilla
food,not_removed,i find the weight of the meat stops the lettuce and tomato from falling out with every bite
food,not_removed,gorditas have earned a spot in my no go list after i ordered one take out from a local mexican joint it all started as your regular run of the mill order out experience i called them they said it would be ready in minutes i get there exchange money and get my food but on the way home is when shit begins to change i placed the bag with my food inside in the passenger seat as i do with most things but driving through the city you encounter some crazy drivers a person ahead of me slammed on their brakes and the bag slid forward dumping the contents all over the floorboard where i had my work documents i quickly reach down trying to get the food off my folders and papers and get some done but realize that i am holding up traffic so i keep on going i get to a redlight and start cleaning up again the light turned green and i started moving forward while switching my attention to cleaning up the mess off my work and then i hear a thud i hit a woman walking her dog damn i get out and ask her if shes alright and she pulls me to her face and she whispers on my ear that in nineteen ninety eight the undertaker threw mankind off the hell in a cell plummeted feet onto an announcers table
food,not_removed,same but im also happy that i now know what a real gordita is so i can try making one some time
food,not_removed,where the heck are you from that you guys fry your gorditas weve never fried them so it seems weird maybe i should try itmm
food,not_removed,yes this is a valid and great variation there are many but not the one pictured above still looks so good minus the under lettuce
food,not_removed,very proud thank you
food,not_removed,tacobell does sound good today
food,not_removed,baja sauce hasnt been around in years at tbell cmon man
food,not_removed,thats not a mexicanim dad
food,not_removed,thats not mexican im a gordita
food,not_removed,living on the border of tx mx i read that as living on the border of tex and mex which texmex food is quite good

food,not_removed,the real shells are a corn masa like a fluffy pancake they set to cooking them is to fry and they will puff edit corrected spell check
food,not_removed,looks like pita bread which is the best way to eat anything
food,not_removed,cool cool
food,not_removed,i have made over of those
food,not_removed,i shit a brilliant shit
food,not_removed,the plasticky one that has no milk
food,not_removed,most are complaining that its simply not a gordita not that it isnt authentic it would be like someone posting a pancake and setting the title as i made a delicious waffle it might be delicious but its not a waffle
food,not_removed,i bet it taste good
food,not_removed,if a post has more than comments at least one is its not authentic if the item isnt authentic just wish people would read before posting but that means they cant get their two cents in like they matter
food,not_removed,completely
food,not_removed,wait east or west side im from el paso too d
food,not_removed,but i thought chalupas were deep fried
food,not_removed,whenever theres leftover gorditas i like to reheat them on the comal until they get a little crunchy best thing ever
food,not_removed,i think i just fatted
food,not_removed,que hambre
food,not_removed,can confirm this guy is actually correct
food,not_removed,its beautiful
food,not_removed,damn i dont think ive ever seen those on a menu i always make sure to order tortas when i see them and people never know what those are
food,not_removed,hey they come in spinach dip buffalo wings and apple pie flavor
food,not_removed,quick question whats in those or what do you frequently put in your gordita
food,not_removed,no httpiimgurcomndakrcejpg are gorditas
food,not_removed,please post authentic instructional video i want to make the real thing inquisitive gringo
food,not_removed,it looks more like naan bread
food,not_removed,taco bell gave us the damn cheesy gordita crunch theyve ruined nothing
food,not_removed,wait so they arent made with the meat of a little fat girl
food,not_removed,hey maybe were just thinking outside the box
food,not_removed,so whats a taco bell gordita classified as then imy whole life is a lie its all a lie
food,not_removed,mexican here i fucking love tbell its the bomb
food,not_removed,theyve ruined a hell of a lot more than that
food,not_removed,true
food,not_removed,theres good gorditas in southern cali but the best are from swap meets in mexicoso good
food,not_removed,it really seems sometimes that at least here in canada taco burrito gordita fajita etc can all pretty much be used interchangeably apparently the details on the differences get lost between mexico and here
food,not_removed,by american you mean from up north no where in the south are they made like that
food,not_removed,thanks my dpeling iz preety bad sumtimes but really thanks i dont usually communicate using this language so i require assistance from time to time
food,not_removed,the fillings are supposed to be inside thats what makes a gordita even thou i hate when fresas change the corn dough for flour they are still gorditas very awful and gross but gorditas nevertheless
food,not_removed,we still love you despite your sacrilege
food,not_removed,as long as its wedged in between a tortilla its a taco for us
food,not_removed,in his defense theyre are both fucking good
food,not_removed,can confirm this is not a taco mexicano its a taco bellano
food,not_removed,lol
food,not_removed,look at this delicious i made and heres i had for lunch i love american cuisine
food,not_removed,im opthank you thats exactly how i feel about it was still a fantastic thing to put in my mouth hole regardless of what we call it
food,not_removed,thats a pita not a tortilla
food,not_removed,hey you arent ushittymorph
food,not_removed,did not work in context at all meh story
food,not_removed,no
food,not_removed,no dude its a taco
food,not_removed,in truth your tacos are quite lovely
food,not_removed,im high again and i still want those
food,not_removed,the one by me still has it if you ask for it its just not on the menu
food,not_removed,the border of texas and mexico so basically what you said
food,not_removed,i dont eat texmex food its nasty lol
food,not_removed,which is exactly why he needs correcting
food,not_removed,some folks go skiing at snow mass i like to go eating at corn mass
food,not_removed,lol
food,not_removed,there is such a thing educate this non american
food,not_removed,on montoya almost to canutillo
food,not_removed,coworker brought a toaster to work i thought he was going to make some toast i was wrong this dude heats his gorditas in a toaster
food,not_removed,yes
food,not_removed,like a nice middle ground of gorditas with a sopes crunch
food,not_removed,i would gold this comment because its relatable af i actually reheated some gorditas today but these fajita tacos aint gonna pay for themselves
food,not_removed,i too am a genuine mexican and i enjoy how real gorditas have qualities that fake gorditas lack
food,not_removed,think of a thick pita bread made of corn instead and fill it with the good stuff
food,not_removed,those are pure awesomeness too im probably going to order a torta de pierna for lunch with a shitload of avocado sour cream and lettuce because of this post
food,not_removed,those seem to be rajas con queso asado de puerco and chicharrón rajas con queso are just cheese with poblano pepper asado de puerco adobado is seasoned pork and chicharrón is fucking chicharrón no better way to describe it contents vary from region to region here in the north where we eat better than the whole country or i will fight u irl well fill them with barbacoa chilorio chicharrón or cheese mainly fuck im hungry
food,not_removed,the green and white one has strips of peppers and cheese the green one is fried pork belly in green chile sauce and the red one is pork in red chile sauce but it has many spices and stuff that gives it a very characteristic flavor all three are amazing besides those other common ones are nopal cactus refried beans with cheese crunchy pork belly with fresh cheese chorizo picadillo ground beef stew deshebrada shredded beef stew eggs in green chile sauce and many others im sure there must be tons of regional specialties that i havent tried and are equally amazing
food,not_removed,i just said that
food,not_removed,i posted a link of a cool mexican lady making real ones but the auto mod bot removed it we only allow official youtube cooking channels which is total bullshit
food,not_removed,i posted a link of a cool mexican lady making real ones but the auto mod bot removed it we only allow official youtube cooking channels which is total bullshit
food,not_removed,they just used pita
food,not_removed,in the future all food is taco bell
food,not_removed,ive always thought the crunchwrap supreme was meant to be a closer replica of an actual gordita and it was the closest they could get without messing around with masa
food,not_removed,fuck ya bro murrica
food,not_removed,the fat meat of a little girl
food,not_removed,yes
food,not_removed,outside the box bun fixed
food,not_removed,i live in a border town with some of the best mexican food anywhere imo and i love taco bell too i used to feel guilty about it then i decided taco bell is no more mexican food than chicken nuggets with sweet and sour sauce is chinese food its just another fast food place that i enjoy
food,not_removed,whoa whoa i never said taco bell isnt the shit
food,not_removed,we have taco bells in atlanta we have a pretty good variety of mexican food there are fancy mexican restaurants where presentation is taken into account and the quality as well as providing consistent mealsorders is excellent entrees range from not at all authentic mexican but quality food told to us by the mexican bartender and bar back independent restaurants taxco el torro el porton many more that have almost the exact same menus at every restaurant somehow they have the exact same menu items speedy gonzales combos like one taco one chalupa and reach and beans they are very reasonably priced per entry food is severed in seconds pretty much immediately after ordering and they dont use trays when bringing out food some guy comes out with hot plates balanced up each arm these places are my favorite all employees are mexicans working there but the food is not quite authentic probably considered americanized mexican or texmex actual authentic places taco veloz is a small fast food type chain others exist on buford hwy there is also an awesome mini restaurant for lack of a better term in a convenience store off roswell rd called quick shop food mart i went there once hungover had hevos rancheros and i usually dont care much for hevos rancheros and it was amazing helped my hangover and was just great food in general i typically dont like places like these because i dont speak spanish and the majority of people working and eating at these places are speaking spanish i feel a bit uncomfortable and sometime i feel like i am intruding on a groups regular hangout taco bell and other low end mexican nothing wrong with itsometimes a person just wants nachos bell grande two chalupas supreme soft tacos and two burritos at
food,not_removed,you can definitely find them here but if you go out to the typical texmex place good luck tamales are harder though i think i once ate a tamaleshapedsubstance at an on the border otherwise few and far between id settle for taco bell tamales at this point
food,not_removed,til there are no taco bells in the south
food,not_removed,this is taco bells version of a gordita not a northern version we have authentic gotditas up north too mexican immigrants still make the same food wether they move to ca ny or il
food,not_removed,fresas are strawberries but clearly it means something else in your comment what would that be
food,not_removed,actually i have those melted fucks get pissed of if it doesnt look a grilled cheese
food,not_removed,bingo theres nothing wrong liking something different but constantly calling something by a different name leads to confusion and not being able to order what youre expecting that said i want to eat what ops making
food,not_removed,i looked through your post history mr diesel youre an alright guy im upgrading you to vin you dont have to be a regular old jim anymore anyone that sets up an ops mom joke like this without a second thought is a legend in my book
food,not_removed,fire the torpitas
food,not_removed,who cares id eat it
food,not_removed,i stand corrected
food,not_removed,ahhhh just like my mother would say until i broke my arms when my dad john cena beat me with jumper cables for giving the loch ness monsta tree fiddy cause he was mad because in the undertaker threw mankind off hell in a cell sending him plummeting ft through the announcers table
food,not_removed,dude context the picture is neither a taco or gordita what the dude i commented to described is a gordita re read who i said it to and what they said thanks for the downvote anyhow i guess btw my mom makes gortidas all the time can you downvote reality
food,not_removed,i appreciate that mr kang
food,not_removed,fucking liar
food,not_removed,yes
food,not_removed,to each their own i find its great drunk food
food,not_removed,reddit really loves their fajitas and burritos lmao
food,not_removed,so if he was intending to make the thing from taco bell what should his title have been
food,not_removed,taco bell needs correcting
food,not_removed,i was raised in a trailer park so i dont know shit except not to be picky sir i think i would eat anything
food,not_removed,masa stupid auto correct
food,not_removed,educatedamerican you can take that to any bank preferably in bendigo kangaroo flat
food,not_removed,my brother does that with breaded chicken burgers
food,not_removed,la michoacana ice cream store
food,not_removed,that makes me hungry but you forgot carnitas oh mah globi love me some carnitas
food,not_removed,damn that shit sounds good im starving right now and mexican sounds pretty good
food,not_removed,gorditas al pastor is another to add to the list
food,not_removed,the most believable aspect of that movie honestly
food,not_removed,in the future we shall have to yell taco bell at our television screens to cease an ad
food,not_removed,lol you definitely asked the right person it is called spicy ranch and its my flair on the rtacobell that i frequent i always get a side of either the spicy ranch or avocado ranch for cents to dip what i order into it
food,not_removed,someone please think of the delicious chidren
food,not_removed,the little meat of a fat girl
food,not_removed,that makes much more sense now
food,not_removed,oh there are but they are not mexican food
food,not_removed,its slang for people who are a bit particularpretentiousdelicatesnobby
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,oh id absolutely eat it its just not a tortilla
food,not_removed,dont pretend youd eat anything
food,not_removed,no mames es un pinche taco
food,not_removed,it does though exist in some areas for some reason the bay area still has it
food,not_removed,racist non mexican approved taco s
food,not_removed,its a good idea but with the gorditas grease gets everywhere
food,not_removed,this guy doesnt know what the shells are for
food,not_removed,i love when beautiful things like this happen on reddit now kith
food,not_removed,still the only thing i order from tb but it was loads better when they still had the baja sauce
food,not_removed,dude why do i sometimes get different tasting sauce on my quesadilla theres spicy ranch and jalapeño ranch right
food,not_removed,my hero
food,not_removed,traitor baja sauce is
food,not_removed,dropped the bun on that one
food,not_removed,necesitas live más
food,not_removed,tiquismiquis in castellano i get it thank you
food,not_removed,i ate your momma stretched out the hole you slid from
food,not_removed,what is a taco not what is in the picture the dude i comented to said thats not a gordita a gordita is a fat piece of corn masa that looks almost like the size and shape of a burger patty you fry it and it should be crisp on the outside and ever so warm and soft on the inside you slit it open and make a pouch to stuff it with ground meat lettuce tomato grated cheese and all the hope with love a mother can give this picture is what hitler makes to spite gypsies i hope youre proud of yourself to which i agree with my previous comment on this post is looks good and i would eat the shit out of it but nothing about this mess is even close to anything that even resembles a hint of a memory of a clue as to what a gordita is flat bread its good especially with the american nacho cheese and not even close to picadillo tacobell meat it looks great i would eat of those right not if i could but its not a gordita its homemade awesome tacobell larn english puto
food,not_removed,its confirmed by corporate employees that baja sauce has been long gone on rtacobell and ive yet to see anybody post about having it if you can prove that you can get your hands on it id post it there as you would become a legend for having access to it
food,not_removed,meat lettuce and cheese obviously
food,not_removed,correct baja sauce is superior
food,not_removed,that shit doesnt exist anymore
food,not_removed,actually more like pijos
food,not_removed,pusqueña in tangamandapio hey could you deliver this letter for me im pretty tired
food,not_removed,im no expert maybe im getting the other spicy ranch thing
food,not_removed,i discarded pijos because of the particular connotation but i realize it can totally have that too depending on context so thank you again
food,not_removed,i just call them mamones p
food,not_removed,yeah fresa is definitely a little broader than pijo but it covers much more than just tiquismiquis the mirrey is probably a little closer to a spanish pijo but mirreyes are almost like a specific subcategory of fresa a really fucking annoying one source lived in barcelona for years and mexico city for years
food,not_removed,check his name again
food,not_removed,i am triggered
food,not_removed,why they were yummy
food,not_removed,maybe they didnt eat a doughnut today
food,not_removed,ow i wouldve gladly invited him one
food,not_removed,hickory smoked bacon black peppercrusted slab bacon maple bourbon glazed smoked pork belly canadian bacon herb cream cheese with bacon bits inhouse made mayonnaise infused with bacon sharp cheddar fresh romaine lettuce sliced tomato
food,not_removed,melt bar and grilled
food,not_removed,rip
food,not_removed,yessiribob
food,not_removed,call it what it is not whatever you want by definition this isnt even close to salami
food,not_removed,salami is a type of cured sausage consisting of fermented and airdried meat typically beef or pork
food,not_removed,so i assume there isnt actually salami in it is it nuts
food,not_removed,you must be really funny on partys
food,not_removed,mouth watering
food,not_removed,how well does the garlic and rosemary flavor the meat when prepared this way
food,not_removed,looks tasty
food,not_removed,that album makes me want to buy a sous vide vacuum machine bunch of bags binder clips steal some spoons from work oh and a steak stupid expensive package of rosemary and head of garlic some butter and a potato
food,not_removed,just because youre correct doesnt mean i have to stand for this
food,not_removed,thanks for sharing this recipe
food,not_removed,yes there is a lot more shrimp underneath all the veggies long story short i spent months on the coast of ecuador last year fishing met a local chef who i became buddies with even through my shaky spanish over our love of fish and seafood after a few days i would bring him what i caught from the beaches and points and he would show me the traditional and his spin on traditional way to prepare the catch the ceviche de camaron he prepared was the best ive ever had and thats saying alot for that amount of time in that area so i tried the recipe i learned from him it came out very good but nowhere near as good as on the coast itself
food,not_removed,local place here has it covered in chocolate so you can get diabetes and clogged arteries at the same time fucking delicious
food,not_removed,so crispy and yet soft we like the flavor of paradox
food,not_removed,warning if you see something called canadian bacon run it is not bacon its ham
food,not_removed,throw some maple syrup over it next time
food,not_removed,never had good bacon dont kill me pls im from europe though
food,not_removed,now i just want to go to america to eat bacon
food,not_removed,eat american bacon everyday
food,not_removed,fun fact bacon in the us and canada became popular when a marketer for the pork industry in the early came up with the idea of getting doctors to say on record that a higher calorie breakfast is better for you than at dinner bacon is now eaten of the time during breakfast
food,not_removed,glad you liked it
food,not_removed,now you see why were fat
food,not_removed,i handle probably of bacon a week im sick of it
food,not_removed,bacon is good for the soul
food,not_removed,two ways to make bacon and i feel both are good theres crispy and then theres soft layering the crispy and soft bacon into layers gives another effect to it the fat in bacon also melts and then ends up kindof deepfrying itself
food,not_removed,you can get streaky bacon that is mainly meat and streaky bacon that is mainly fat it just depends how its cut i buy streaky bacon from the butcher more often than i do back bacon and it tends to be fat to meat but i render out most of the fat
food,not_removed,cant count the number of times the great bacon debate has popped up on reddit english bacon snobs say of american bacon its disgusting all fat yuck and so on american bacon snobs say english bacon is just ham nothing special lacks character and so on theres a thing called canadian bacon which isnt canadian isnt bacon and no one ever was a snob about it when a canadianite says bacon they mean the same thing real murkans he said with tongue planted firmly in cheek mean by bacon ill note that my limited experience indicates that mass market bacon our northern neighbors see is better quality than our mass market crap they are all good save the mass market crap which is merely okay but in no way interchangeable the only time i can think one could substitute any one for another is when served as a stand alone item on a breakfast plate english bacon is made from the loin with a bit of the flap included that pointy fatty part is the flap it is always cured i think and sometimes smoked recently someone elsewhere on reddit said something about how disgusting a bacon sandwich proper english name bacon butty made with american bacon would be i pointed out that you cant make a bacon butty with american bacon if you made linzer torte with orange marmalade it wouldnt be linzer torte a bacon butty style sandwich made with murka bacon isnt a bacon butty i do like a bacon butty they are more often made with a roll rather than sliced bread almost always the bread is buttered and may have ketchup or brown sauce american bacon is made from pork belly no loin meat at all it is always cured and smoked uncured bacon products started showing up in stores not that long ago but thats for wusses afraid of nitrates and it isnt bacon alas most of the bacon is waterlogged smoke flavoured crap wrapped in plastic found in the supermarket fridge bins good bacon however is plentiful and they probably sell it in that same supermarket check at butcher counter the best bacon is artisanal harder to source costlier and delicious the classic american bacon sandwich is the blt crisp but not crumbly bacon crunchy probably iceberg but romaine works too lettuce ripe tomato heirloom ftw on toast slathered with mayo i hold that a blt is made with three slices of bread but thats just me ketchup on a blt is abomination anything else makes it not a blt though turkey and oft times avocado added to a blt make a delicious club sandwich i fucking adore a blt canadian bacon is cured pork loin which has been trimmed of all fat it may be smoked but if so it is lightly smoked the name probably comes from pea meal bacon a toronto invention thats slightly similar though far from the same thing pea meal bacon more closely resembles english bacon canadian bacon is most often found in breakfast sandwiches the egg mcmuffin most notably and the open faced sandwich eggs benedict dont be a bacon snob
food,not_removed,next try it candied
food,not_removed,pepper bacon they sell it at walmart or used to anyway cook it on a cookie sheet in the oven using parchment paper to keep it from sticking better than splatter on the stove have you tried pork rinds
food,not_removed,youre welcome
food,not_removed,british bacon is a totally different piece of meat isnt it
food,not_removed,what do europeans do with the bellies of all the pigs they must slaughter i dont even know where to try to find a raw one in the los angeles area
food,not_removed,bacon is overrated to be honest
food,not_removed,
food,not_removed,you really think that salty rubbery piece of crap they call bacon over there is superior to our juicy thick rashers
food,not_removed,psabacon is also ham
food,not_removed,never cared for sweet meats not even ham
food,not_removed,i think its funny that you and i are the only people in the thread to mention maple syrup and we both got downvoted for it some touchy motherfuckers on reddit
food,not_removed,this
food,not_removed,go to a butcher and ask if they do pork belly bacon from my understanding that is the american cut
food,not_removed,bruh yall dont have american grocery store gotta be a way to find bacon what about butcher shops they gotta have bacon
food,not_removed,fat doesnt make you fat sugar does americans are overweight because they have a high sugar and starch diet soda pop hfcs breads pasta rice pizza crust etc it is very hard to gain weight on an allprotein diet it may burn out your organs though
food,not_removed,easy there i dont know if hes ready for that just yet
food,not_removed,hell yes so easy to make and so delicious crumble it over some vanilla ice cream and drizzle it with maple syrup
food,not_removed,pepper bacon literally bacon with black pepper optional use brown sugar or maple syrup
food,not_removed,or you could make yer own by putting pepper on bacon
food,not_removed,yep british bacon is from the back of the pig american is from the bellyin my opinion they are better for different things british bacon is best with a fried breakfast american bacon is best on a burger
food,not_removed,british bacon i just looked this up what a difference i would guess british bacon tastes like the canadian bacon we get on pizza which imo tastes like sandwich ham
food,not_removed,agreed i mean does it really have to be put on everything
food,not_removed,thats not bacon thats just ham
food,not_removed,it is the best
food,not_removed,yeah but ham is a totally different thing i never cared for tomato sauce until it was on pizza is the same thing
food,not_removed,i blame the big aunt jemima syrup lobby
food,not_removed,thanks ill give it a try
food,not_removed,that will get you part of the way there american bacon is pork belly that has been salt cured and then cold smoked
food,not_removed,yall dont have american grocery store lol
food,not_removed,never trust link text always verify before clicking
food,not_removed,out of nowhere holy crap that was unexpected
food,not_removed,god dammit as i clicked the link and waited for it to load i said to myself im probably about to get rick rolled did not disappoint
food,not_removed,like every time i click on the sexy pictures in my pc days
food,not_removed,calories in calories out is what makes you fat actually
food,not_removed,too many calories makes you fat we have insanely calorie dense processed foods that make it easy to overeat
food,not_removed,if you are eating bacon you arent eating an all protein diet
food,not_removed,kinda sad you got downvoted people really do like finding an easy answer energy in energy out fat gain and not looking past it
food,not_removed,chocolate covered omnomnom
food,not_removed,the traditional cut of british back bacon actually includes some of the loin but the full loin cut popular as american bacon is what us brits usually call streaky bacon
food,not_removed,i mean its certainly good but its not as amazing as everyone makes it out to be im just not a big fan of it there are a lot better things out there
food,not_removed,no it is not
food,not_removed,i learned something today
food,not_removed,many many times always such a disappointment
food,not_removed,thats the funny thing most americans are fine eating corn syrup and not realizing that its not even the same thing as actual maple syrup totally different items ill take real syrup over aunt jemima any day of the week
food,not_removed,so calories of almonds will have the same effect as calories of coca cola
food,not_removed,yep and theres more calories in sugar than fat edit see below
food,not_removed,isnt the traditional american diet based around peanut butter
food,not_removed,on your weight yes on your overall health thats a different story
food,not_removed,sugar has about calg while fat has
food,not_removed,no fat is more calorie dense but the idea is that eating good food helps you stay full for longer where as its easy as fuck to smash down sugar riddled drinks and snacks and still be hungry
food,not_removed,not at all where are you getting your information from
food,not_removed,i wish i was
food,not_removed,except if you eat calories of almonds you will probably not feel nearly as hungry over the course of the day as if you drank calories of soda so in all likelihood the soda will contribute more to weight gain
food,not_removed,a calorie is not a calorie dietwise see gary taubes peter attia robt lustig et al how much you eat is important but not nearly as important as what you eat
food,not_removed,not true regarding weight that calories of coke is entirely sugar large quantities of sugar like in soda causes increased water retention in the body those almonds will not have that effect while not fat it would still be considered weight gain
food,not_removed,please explain
food,not_removed,mostly tv sitcoms and old spiderman comics where people heavily rely on pbj sandwiches im also old enough to remember it was a huge story across this side of the pond when jimmy carter got elected as potus plus one of elviss favourite meals was supposedly a deepfried pb fritter where are you getting your info from
food,not_removed,thats more because you wont feel satisfied so youre more likely to go take in more calories elsewhere
food,not_removed,youve seen where people have been able to lose weight eating nothing but mcdonalds and snack cakes your overall health will suffer because youre missing key nutrients youre more likely to overheat because youre not satisfied but it still boils down to calories in v calories out
food,not_removed,living in america all my life peanut butter is hardly ever used as more than a snack if youre on a diet its a good cheap way to pack in fat protein and calories but i have never heard of anyone basing their whole diet around it not even in past tense pb and j is legitimatly delicious though no one really eats that after childhood
food,not_removed,where did you find this information
food,not_removed,the science of the metabolic rate was understood starting in the early the antifat thing of the has been proven bunk based on bad conclusions from a faulty study
food,not_removed,where did you find this information
food,not_removed,learn to fish partner
food,not_removed,im pretty sure you have no idea what youre talking about
food,not_removed,do your research everything i said is true peace
food,not_removed,ive done it and youre right about a few things and backwards on others its interesting that you have no idea why but feel compelled to give information to others on the subject i dont think asking for underlying reasoning for your conclusions is asking that much but it seems to be a problem for you i encourage you to do some research
food,not_removed,backwards on others oh okay sorry which ones

food,not_removed,my sincerest heartfelt tiramisu mouth filled apologies ingredients instant coffee granules about boiled water sponge finger biscuits egg yolks cup castor sugar mascarpone cheese i love this stuff cream whipped dark chocolate grated method place boiled water and about coffee granules in a bowl wide enough to fit a sponge finger biscuit dissolve and allow to cool completely beat the yolks and sugar until light and creamy add cup of the coffee mix plus the mascarpone and beat slightly until combined start layering quickly dip a sponge finger in the coffee mix and line the bottom of a tray if you use individual cupsbowls then break it up with your hand spoon a layer of the mascarpone mix second layer of the sponge finger second layer of the mascarpone third layer of the sponge finger top with whipped cream and grated chocolate now dont be greedy and eat right away allow to sit in the fridge for at least so the fingers soften further and the whole mix of flavours gel together oh yeh this is alcohol free
food,not_removed,was gonna say same thing wtf
food,not_removed,replace the coffee with powdered chocolate
food,not_removed,typically when talking about food safety with anything that should be refrigerated it is not recommended to keep it out of the refrigerator for more than four hours
food,not_removed,this looks sounds reads full of deliciousness
food,not_removed,why use instant coffee instead of regular ground coffee or even gourmet coffee
food,not_removed,actually its two hours perishable food should not be kept in the danger zone to °c for more than hours
food,not_removed,because its usually in everyones pantry
