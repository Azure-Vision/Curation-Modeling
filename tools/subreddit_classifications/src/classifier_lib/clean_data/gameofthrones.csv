gameofthrones,removed,she has a clause in her contract to not show off her two dragons anymore and by dragons i mean boobs so sad
gameofthrones,removed,in a world with ice zombies dragons shadow demons witchcraft resurrection giants and more ill accept someone using swords in an unrealistic way ultimately the point is that arthur dayne was the best fighter who ever lived most people book readers and show watchers alike are not medieval martial arts experts so making someone do something that is more flashy and unrealistic has to be done to convey the point
gameofthrones,removed,first off they didnt drop dawn or at least it doesnt look like it whether they did or did not drop it is mostly irrelavant since there was no time to cover its importance to the story anyway no ashara no starfall no house dayne backstory at this point its a glorified prop even if we say one of the swords is indeed dawn which is might be varys isnt quite as whitewashed as tyrion no murdering minstrels to keep shaes cover or arya lets make meryn trant a paedophile to make aryas wayward assassinations more justified and i think i might have exaggerated the issue though the simple fact of not cutting the little birds tongues is quite meaningful here last the manderlys are likely to be in the show mayhaps the snowbowl leaks dont name them though

gameofthrones,removed,you are on point i am almost certain she will become just as mad as the mad king in the books she burns down the tower of the hand and it is implied she gets sexually aroused just like the mad king did i like jamie being the in who kills cersei jamie is probably one of the most important characters especially for the end of the series he is on the path of redemption and he will become the head of the lannister army which jon can use i have a feeling he will be a hero in the end
gameofthrones,removed,no thank you

gameofthrones,removed,i think so the one thing that is critical to his storyline is his oath to cat and brienne is making sure arya and sansa is safe when it comes down to it jaimie makes the right choice and when the white walkers come he will help defeat them jon will not refuse his army more men the better

gameofthrones,removed,they already killed stannis barristan mance shireen and myrcella in season they will die in book they cut of quentyn victarion arianne jonconn aegon quentyn already died victarion is eurons puppet aegon is just a blackfyreif you not sure about this you dont understand it yet no offense there is no time to explain this blackfyrething in the series i think they all will die in twow so the series already became shorter without them on the tvshow i think lady stoneheart only logic to come in season and not before cuz jaime and brienne goes to the riverlands now and thoros is back in season its confirmed in season bran may leave the cave and the two biggest thing he may learnbooks as well the others and jons identity the bastardbowl will happen in the books as well the pink letter by ramsay was the foreshadow for that and ramsay wrote it only the dreamer little summer childs think the other versions sansa and petyr will goes to wf as well but without team jon davos will not return to stannis with rickonif he returns i hope at least he does maybe he will be back to jon thats why they put him on jons side already dany with tyrion will finally meet in the books as well and theyll take care of the harpiesdaario the battle of meereen already wonned by team dany according to tyrion kings landing will be destroyed by the lannistertyrellsparrow gangs and that storyline will ended with cerseis deathmaybe in season already but its certainly happens in book we dont know what will happen to brienne and jaimebut i have a bad feeling about jaime will die and if the wall falls in episode then we will be there where the book is ending because the horn of winter is on the cover and its a typical cliffhanger moment there too and thats it there is only one bookstory remains for episodes its logical
gameofthrones,removed,why dont you post the whole fuckin book
gameofthrones,removed,i got two ongoing bets for each episode first titsdong and first death as in who dies who do you guys predict will die next episode and who will show titsdong
gameofthrones,removed,think she still is
gameofthrones,removed,i would say either the targaryan theme or greyjoy theme
gameofthrones,removed,show version was better had more of the psychopath theme that ramsay is
gameofthrones,removed,she will prob leave slavers bay soon she needs alot of gold to get ships perhaps she will take her army to braavos get gold and ships there maybe arya will even join her to get across to westeros perhaps land at dragonstone then sail into the bay of kl
gameofthrones,removed,he also started to get a boner when he saw her naked in the harrenhall baths
gameofthrones,removed,my class and me
gameofthrones,removed,imho the probability he survives this season is close to none
gameofthrones,removed,i agree while his death is pretty much a foregone conclusion at this point likely we wont get the satisfying cathartic drawn out death that the deserves i read an interesting article about how the show backed itself into a corner with a villain as evil as ramsey
gameofthrones,removed,if ramsey doesnt die then lsh is confirmed it is one or the other

gameofthrones,removed,how do you know the person who created the sign didnt intend it to be a quote from got i think he did intend that
gameofthrones,removed,yeah ok well thanks for explaining
gameofthrones,removed,twist you let your friends gang rape your gf and made these to make up for it
gameofthrones,removed,triggered
gameofthrones,removed,sansa then honestly with how theyve merged book characters into one show character i get the feeling that arya is going to merge with lsh and kill pod and brienne
gameofthrones,removed,oh my sweet sumer child you need to rewatch the scene again he was poisoned by his enemies
gameofthrones,removed,damn i wish she would shame me
gameofthrones,removed,i know im gonna get downvoted to hell but it must be saidshe still looks like a man
gameofthrones,removed,why would tyrells even do that their entire grasp in power lies with tommen remaining legitimate listen to yourself ffs creating bullshit excuses to get a character you love back gemdrys story is over and house baratheon is extinct when this series is finally over all the great houses will be extinct i suggest you start getting used to that
gameofthrones,removed,holy shit i hate daenarys emilia clarke so fucking much i hope dd cut her from the show and replace her with someone who actually shows tits
gameofthrones,removed,spot on and he says it so casually like yeah i held the door to save your cripple ass but no big deal id do it again
gameofthrones,removed,emotional trauma survivor and you study psych what a surprise 😂😂😂😂
gameofthrones,removed,jaime will try to convince the blackfish to down easily he will refuse brienne will show up and tell the blackfish sansa needs him so his escape might happen like the book im hopefully for jaime to threaten edmure like he did in the books badass northern houses will refuse to support john but sansa convinces them otherwise yara and theon might try to win dany over before euron arrives arya and the waif will fight and arya escapes cersei will ask for a trial by combat and finally i hope we get a gravedigger reveal but im not sure how the show will do it it seems if they just show him itll be out of left field
gameofthrones,removed,ramsay did throw sansa a bone tho
gameofthrones,removed,if i recall correctly you stated people that dont like dany are jaded if im not mistaken thats an insult right there which makes you a filthy hypocrite in addition to the rest of your negative qualities
gameofthrones,removed,what good is it without any sensation though unless theres some kinky porn production happening in westeros
gameofthrones,removed,he is gendry storm right now isnt he
gameofthrones,removed,no one will fap to this
gameofthrones,removed,gravedigger sandor is great and surely true hshr is absolutely horrible
gameofthrones,removed,that was just snake porn
gameofthrones,removed,you forgot to paint the best part
gameofthrones,removed,with the name of the episode being the broken man ill focus on the broken men on the show the hound the most obvious reference to the title in the books septon meribald is a former soldier turned holy man who wonders the riverlands helping the common people among the people he helps is a gravedigger who is large in stature and walks with a limp its widely believed that hes sandor clegane even though meribald claims he personally buried the hound note the hound not sandor clegane i would say well see him reappear in one of two ways hell either run into briennepod en route or returning from riverrun or the brotherhood without banners will be involved meribald makes an amazing speech about broken men and outlaws that i really hope ends up in this episode theon greyjoy a mentally broken man theon is slowly becoming stronger after the physical and psychological abuse at the hands of ramsey the preview show him and yara on long bridge of volantis along with yara enjoying some time with a volantene whore i would not be surprised to hear some talk about daenerys while there as volantis was one of the groups funding the sons of the harpy davos seaworth while wondering around the countryside recruiting stark bannermen i think well see davos come across the remains of stanniss last camp there hell find the spot where shireen was burnt and likely some sort of momento like the wooden stag he carved for her last season edmure tully before the last we saw of edmure was him being carried off to the bedding ceremony just before the red wedding as the lord of riverrun he controls the possession of the castle even though the blackfish is physically holding it jamie will make him an offer he cant refuse and force edmure to cede the castle of course the blackfish wont give it up and well see a battle for riverrun given the numbers i doubt it ends well for the tullys loras tyrell loras is not handling imprisonment well he wants out by any means necessary so who knows what hes been telling the high sparrow or what deals hes making might see some talks between him and the high sparrow this week bran probably nothing major but a little bit of interaction between him and benjen about whats been happening would be logical bran will be carrying a tremendous amount of guilt with him after what happened in other than that i think well see more interaction between margery and tommen regarding the faith arya will be plotting her flight from braavos im sure the waif will be stalking her as well i would wager this episode will also lay the groundwork for an illadvised scheme by cersei to kill off her enemies sparrows pycelle olenna tyrell anyone who opposes her family could be getting a visit from frankenmountain before the end of this season i also wonder if bronn will fill jamie in on some family secrets involving lancel

gameofthrones,removed,howland reed is supposedly waging guerrilla warfare on the ironborn that hold his castle greywater watch
gameofthrones,removed,i do prefer this over the strange and weird absence we see sometimes at first it appeared as though dan was giving a speech to dothraki instead in thousand and i am sure the ones in the back probably dont even know their khals dead yet lol
gameofthrones,removed,that also explains how theon and yara captured a whole fleet with just a few men on a couple of boats
gameofthrones,removed,i thought pedophilia was an adult lusting after a child these are two children who are almost exactly the same age lusting after each other sorry to kill your boner but its important to get these things right

gameofthrones,removed,i think the next time i orgasm and come inside a girl ill rest my head next to hers nibble on her ear and whisper quietly the lannisters send their regards
gameofthrones,removed,too soon it will always be too soon
gameofthrones,removed,they used to bang back in college
gameofthrones,removed,i wasnt claiming to be a special snowflake snowflakes melt into the dirt and make mud not exactly something to aspire to i was simply asking for opinions on the show not on your perception of me
gameofthrones,removed,psaripscom should have some direct download links if the torrents arent working
gameofthrones,removed,if my sister looked liked cersie or khaleesi id bang em
gameofthrones,removed,why does she seem to get prettier and prettier everytime i see her pic posted
gameofthrones,removed,yeah but its been a while since weve seen her do something really horrible to someone like sansa a lot of was written so that we would feel sorry for her and we would have felt even sorrier if not for some comedyrelief in the form of olennas burn moments i really wanted her to fuck the sparrows up badly and then she goes and burns the sept and after the absolute jawdroppingness of it combined with the absolutely perfect amount of smug but then tommen jumps out of the window and we start tallying the cost of her actions and sympathies drops a bit imo cersei is one of the best written characters and villain in the show we go from absolutely hating her to sympathizing moments back and forth lena really should have gotten an emmy by now
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,being a total milf probably helps in the role
gameofthrones,removed,i love her she is the milf next door we all wish
gameofthrones,removed,shes so fucking hot god in heaven
gameofthrones,removed,call me a pervert but i really want lena to be my sugar mommy
gameofthrones,removed,illyrio was a different actor too
gameofthrones,removed,who else was expecting a titty hanging out
gameofthrones,removed,in before butthurt nerds sperging on the difference between white walkers and wights
gameofthrones,removed,hes a targaryen whether hes a bastard or not is still unclear
gameofthrones,removed,i liked all of this up until the full of sandwiches part that was fucking week come on you can come up with something more interesting than sandwiches even the night is dark and full of grinders wouldve been better for intent but for execution
gameofthrones,removed,yeah i guess that makes sense but someone should really get on this sandwitch development as luck would have it we now have a big belly character in oldtown who could get started with the sandwitch research sam is sitting in the great library and studying all day and he builds up a mighty hunger he knows he should return to the inn where he left gilly and the baby but he promised john he would try his hardest to become a maester and return as fast as possible he just isnt as smart or as wise as they thought he was he is letting them all down theres is a rummble from his stomach again and sam whines in pain aaoooww my poor fatt belly he says in a moan maybe a am a good for nothing crawen fatt boy as my father says i am sam thinks to himself as he closes the book he was reading and returns it to its place in the shelvs as he is walking back to the inn where gilly and the baby are he once again notices how hungry he is so he coungs his last silvers and coppers he has left its not enough for full meal so he is going to have to forrage what he can and maybe that baker will be kind to him again and sell his burnt loafs of bread on the cheap he walks up to a street mongrer who seems to be shutting her stalll down for the day its not much left on the table and what is left seems like it could might as well feed the rats of the city but it seems like all he can afford now when he finally gets back to the inn he spends his last coppers securing the room for gilly one more night here then he is going to have to find some other way to make money for them gilly seems happy to see him and they embrace for a bit to long he just want to be held he doesnt know how to fix all the trubble he has gotten in to but he cant let her know how down he feels i git some food for us sam says cheerfully as he sets down the bundle on the small table in the room it seems like too much for the small amount of money he had but he managed to get a good price on the cheese butter and salted beef and ha had found a park with wild lettice growing and stolen some while the guards were chasing away a street urchin he even got two whole loafs of burn bread for the price of one he really had done good job as he laid everyting out on the table gilly pick up one of the loafs and tried to break of a piece it was hard as stone she pullled her belt knife to stab in to the blackend crust of the bread as the tip of the knife bit in to the crust a sharp ping could be heard as the blade broke of from the bone handle of her knife that knife had been with her since crastors keep where sam had taker her from rescues her now the last of that place had broken in her hand the cold north of the wall had been broken by a burnt loaf of bread from the south she sheed a single tear down hee cheek sam saw his love try in vain to break the bread open and he couldnt take it anymore he grabben hus stolen ancestreal sword heartsbane and pulled it out of its scabbard it might not be what a two handed valyrian steel sword was meant to do but no bread will make his true loved cry he raised the sword above his head and aimed for that loaf he gently started slicing the bread because this bread will not win he felt a bit silly as he put the sword down but atleast gillt was smiling ohh my brave knight thank you for saving me from that horrible bread how shall i ever repay you she said and gently kissed him on the cheek sam feelt his whole face grow red what had he done that was no sword for slicing bread but suddenly he thought to himself slicing bread this was the firsg timw he had sliced bread this was the first sliced bread he had heard of never in all his castle years he had it he had lots of cakes tart pies cookies and all other marvelous things but never sliced bread gilli was already eating a picka and mix of everything but s just sat there quiet and thinking suddenly he reached out and grabbed a piece of bread he knew bread and butter go together but what happens if you slice some cheese on it as well and maybe some salted beef on there too he tried to pick it up i his hands but the topping would just slide of the bread it need something els he ripped up some off the wild lettuce and put it on top with another bread slice this could be it this could work he picked up this new food it had a thick slice if bread as a bottom to act as support for the thing in the middle and then you had a top piece to hold it all together by now gilly had stopped eating and was just looking at him in a strange way surley she must think of him as nothing more then a fat fool who want to stuff his mouth with all the foods at once he timidly tried a bite of this new thing and loo and behold it was tasty maybe this could solve his money trubles
gameofthrones,removed,there are basically no big houses left already think about the families left the only big families or well known families have like people living with the exception of the lannisters due to all their cousins varys wants dany to have the throne but my personal opinion he did want the families sizes to diminish so it would be a lot easier to control varys cant have kids there is no furthering his line why would he want to one and done it when he has lived more than half his life presumably so someone can come along and fuck it up
gameofthrones,removed,ugh rpunchablefaces you know the one im talking about
gameofthrones,removed,i would sell my soul and sacrifice my first born child for a shot at maisie williams she got so hot
gameofthrones,removed,it really was it wasnt funny at all
gameofthrones,removed,i have a feeling ice spiders will make an appearance in the show at some point otherwise why mention them i think in the great battle the white walkers will be riding them
gameofthrones,removed,id do red priest expirements on them
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,rhailcorprate
gameofthrones,removed,those are some luscious lips
gameofthrones,removed,lol rhailcorporate
gameofthrones,removed,you now nothing fabio snow
gameofthrones,removed,it is my second most favorite scene
gameofthrones,removed,well he was the young wolf
gameofthrones,removed,id warg into tommen and bang margaery
gameofthrones,removed,yer mum is throuroughly debunked everyday baby
gameofthrones,removed,yes but that is show only mainly included for oh my god dany is so cool moments in the books however targs are only more resistent to heat therefore she doesnt get burned by the hot water
gameofthrones,removed,would still bang
gameofthrones,removed,but he is in search of his cure i bet he goes to old town and meets up with sam
gameofthrones,removed,j
gameofthrones,removed,still would
gameofthrones,removed,what is honor compared to a womans love robb stark xd
gameofthrones,removed,what could they possibly have been doing to get his junk slammed in a door like how hard do you have to be trying
gameofthrones,removed,stuck his tongue pretty far down her wildling throat if you ask me i only think he killed her because she reached for the knife i think he wouldve finished the deed and flayed her in the morning if he had the option
gameofthrones,removed,what is this i cannot fap to this
gameofthrones,removed,if r l j then that would make him jons great granduncle
gameofthrones,removed,and he is still the only character whose true motive is unknown serving the realm is just a lie cause he killed kevan lannister when finally realm had peace we know littlefinger is a creep but we still dont know jack shit about vayrs
gameofthrones,removed,the only man at the wall who had the respect of all of the nights watch
gameofthrones,removed,such a great character i think his death scene was one of the most beautiful scenes in the show so far
gameofthrones,removed,i totally missed the chance of them being the relatives if jon is indeed a son of lyanna and rhaegar
gameofthrones,removed,dude knew how to end a scene
gameofthrones,removed,robert baratheon kills the boar
gameofthrones,removed,oh stfu
gameofthrones,removed,every day hey look at my poster hey look at my stark flavored cookie cake hey look at my drawing of jon snows face hey look at my blah blah blah
gameofthrones,removed,unpopular opinion but i feel like the show has been missing high quality dialogue like this for the past seasons at least we got rid of the sand snakes plot but still take this scene the writing just plain isnt that good
gameofthrones,removed,the best part is that jon snow is really a targaryen amon is his grandfather
gameofthrones,removed,arya needs an analrapist wait its funnier when spoken than when written
gameofthrones,removed,ned was going to kings landing to be the hand of the king it is safe to say that the next time they would see each other would be in a really really long time
gameofthrones,removed,rhaegar wasnt mad it was the and green sight
gameofthrones,removed,until she got stabbed in the back for the last time and now jon just fantasises about sansa and tyrion having dwarven sex
gameofthrones,removed,gawd damn how do you people do that i read the books and i feel like i havent even seen the show well okay arya dies in the snow
gameofthrones,removed,its simply the last words of a dying old man as he longs for youth just before he dies aemon is no longer an old man on a table life slipping away he sees his brother memories of youth and family overcoming him his last words are not directed to anyone in the room but to his brother who to him is much more real than castle black around him he feels bemused returning to those days and believing his long life of servitude to the nights watch and pain of hearing of his familys downfall and growing old to have been just a dream its nothing deeply significant or foreshadowing or anything just a human moment reminding us all that we all grow old and we all want for youth and lost days and lost friends and family more and more as the years go by but we cannot return to them and those days until we ourselves have passed
gameofthrones,removed,arya wore contacts for her blind eyes i dont see why his would be any different
gameofthrones,removed,lady stoneheart isnt a dead catelyn
gameofthrones,removed,much deserved
gameofthrones,removed,there are a couple reasons i put him there hes the divide between ned and catelyn always has been he keeps the flow of black clothing balanced across the image he is most likely a catalystic character in the grand scheme of things
gameofthrones,removed,my cock stirs everytime shes on screen i truly hope bronn can find his into a bed with her
gameofthrones,removed,i do miss one thing about dorne on the show her tits

gameofthrones,removed,httpiimgurcomzalvnsajpg
gameofthrones,removed,the problem with this is nobody likes it he viewers will hate it it is not smart of clever it is just poor writing next thing you know got will juts suddenly flash to waking up in a mental hospital saying he had the strangest dream and he has got go back to so he can save westeros
gameofthrones,removed,what kind of question is that do you really need an answer can you not deduce what that means
gameofthrones,removed,yummy yummy yummy i got cum in my tummy
gameofthrones,removed,calling it shes somehow undead and jon kills her for good fulfilling the prophecy
gameofthrones,removed,i recently watched the entire got series in marathon and i got completly heart broken when ygritte died how could most of the fandom not even bat an eye

gameofthrones,removed,your favourite character will die then your new favourite character will die so on and so on
gameofthrones,removed,definitely would
gameofthrones,removed,theres been set photos of her leaving a trailer with bella ramseylyanna mormont in starkish clothing
gameofthrones,removed,hawt
gameofthrones,removed,probably her porn star acting she was a porn star
gameofthrones,removed,i really hope tyrion isnt a targaryen it would completely undermine his entire relationship with tywin it would basically justify all of tywins hate for him
gameofthrones,removed,there are a few spoilers in there though that hot dog spoiler bran with a shirt of a superhero who can enter the minds of others spoiler tbh i cant make out who that character between jon and robb is is that jaimenikolaj
gameofthrones,removed,he was still a player in their game
gameofthrones,removed,fuck your shitty repost
gameofthrones,removed,would you have described it as a big veiny triumphant bastard
gameofthrones,removed,from what ive read she redraws her army from fighting the ww after pledging them to help fight jaime abandons her out of disgust and goes to join the north
gameofthrones,removed,maybe columbus didnt discover tobacco yet if i see them use tomatoes or chocolate or turkey or potatoes or black beans or indian corn i will get confused

gameofthrones,removed,hes president of the united states
gameofthrones,removed,then why bring him to hodor in the past at that exact moment the threeeyed raven specifically brought bran there to affect the past to save himself and meera
gameofthrones,removed,lesbian lick fest with yara and dany come and see
gameofthrones,removed,youre not even right which is why youre getting downvoted saying or is syrio sexy jesus without a question mark wouldnt even make any sense instead he said or syrio is sexy jesus which is just him stating another theory he basically said as a respone or this is the case which makes perfect sense i doubt you can be convinced youre wrong though because that should have happened already
gameofthrones,removed,you know what it
gameofthrones,removed,what happens if two different people cum on the same woman does the dna get mixed up and shit maybe explaining why tyrion has two different eyes
gameofthrones,removed,you should have saved this for after the season this is some top quality postseason shitpost
gameofthrones,removed,you said the show showed something it didnt you just imagined it
gameofthrones,removed,ep bran enters tower and sees ned and lyanna lyanna dying says promise ned we see a baby and next shot is of jon credits and music
gameofthrones,removed,i love how much ive been down voted for saying dany is slowly losing her mind and her story will not end well now even alt shift x agrees with me just goes to show the majority opinion isnt always the right one
gameofthrones,removed,dont worry a red priest brings robb back to life but has to use grey winds head
gameofthrones,removed,we do also the same s that killed oberynhttpiimgurcomfufkyorjpg
gameofthrones,removed,go to rcleganebowl to be involuntarily hyped
gameofthrones,removed,you just wrote an essay about the politics of a fictional character think about that for a second and come back to us
gameofthrones,removed,is it really
gameofthrones,removed,no cleavage i was crossing my finger for the walk of shame but this makes me sad too
gameofthrones,removed,thanks
gameofthrones,removed,thanks
gameofthrones,removed,thanks
gameofthrones,removed,tyrions true parentage tinfoil cap on
gameofthrones,removed,that was rodrik cassel
gameofthrones,removed,that guy has no chill submitted by cerseisbigoltitties
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think cleaganebowl is gonna happen because according to reddit user trude he was right about everything so there is a chance for no cleaganebowl bowl this season
gameofthrones,removed,does anyone know why the show is ending in episodes beyond season isnt this show hbos best show out there im talking because i feel like everythings being too rushed now and tbh find it less enjoyable especially with the overhype of dany and jon i also think that the shows are literally copying famous fan theories
gameofthrones,removed,have you read the books there is a connection the hound could have to the faith in the books brienne meets a character called septon meribald hes a former soldier turned septon and he delivers a monologue that has been dubbed the broken man speech thats where the title of the next episode presumably comes from he then takes brienne and pod to the quiet isles where there is a monestary run by a guy called the elder a brother when they are there they see a gravedigger whose physical description matches sandor clegane the elder brother also tells brienne he came across the hounds body and buried him but it could be metaphorical meaning he metaphorically buried the old sandor clegane but a new reformed sandor still lives so theres the connection to the faith ian mcshane has been cast in this season and based on what hes said and casting calls that were put out plus next episodes title it is believed hes playing septon meribald the casting call said something about leading a band of reformed warriors so did ian mcshane in some interviews so i think sandor clegane will be in his band of warriors and theyll skip all the quiet isle stuff if thats the case then its easy to imagine the a faith going to him to find a champion to represent them in cerseis trial by combat hes a former soldier turned to the faith who leads a band of other former soldiers who have turned to the faith hed be the first person they turn to
gameofthrones,removed,spoiler theyd both get killed by cheap tactics though
gameofthrones,removed,her character is probably the biggest hypocrite on the show in addition her storyline has become boring and repetitive i dont understand how she thinks slavery is so abhorent but her going around buying the unsullied freeing slaves to fight for her and stealing the khalasar in much different in the end it is slavery to her that she wants and a lot of the people in her service are going to die because of it i hope at some point she tells grey worm to have the unsullied do something and he flat out rejects the command and tells her that she is not histheirs master
gameofthrones,removed,also is the sword sam stole valyrian john and brienne have one for sure thats all i remember its been so long since i read the books since the last one came out sobs
gameofthrones,removed,echo
gameofthrones,removed,echo
gameofthrones,removed,he will commit suicide
gameofthrones,removed,i think the show will fix what dd have messed up last season and return to what is happening in the book jaime is going to riverlands returning edmure to bf edmure will surrender but let bf leave jaime will learn that her sister slept with his cousins and will turn his back on her we have seen that brienne is going back to the riverland as in the book
gameofthrones,removed,she looks like a plastic doll still pretty though
gameofthrones,removed,a lot of makeupbut other brain dont seem to care smokin
gameofthrones,removed,also smokin hot
gameofthrones,removed,its jaqen not jaquen fuckin op
gameofthrones,removed,taking a pounding from behind by drogo
gameofthrones,removed,is this the same chick cosplaying daenerys in volantis
gameofthrones,removed,meh she doesnt look that great in this picture but then i checked out her instagram
gameofthrones,removed,o baby
gameofthrones,removed,if happens ill be fairly angry bran is marked it was immature of him to put himself in such a position but its understandable at the time he didnt realize the consequences of his actions but now he knows and hes got benjen to advise him so if he brings down the wall by crossing he best have a backup plan for keeping the army of undead at bay btw he doesnt need to go south of the wall to find a weirwood tree theres one within walking distance of castle black on the north side of the wall and probably many others that we as viewers dont know about
gameofthrones,removed,she can ride my dragon
gameofthrones,removed,i was always under the impression he died because the witch or whoever she was danny asked to help basically tainted his wound instead of healing it was it just an infection and she had nothing to do with it
gameofthrones,removed,why post this you should delete your comment no one would know its a spoiler if you didnt write that
gameofthrones,removed,thats because it isnt the subreddit rules are in the sidebar you know feel free to review them at your leisure
gameofthrones,removed,littlefinger dies and dany jon hook up
gameofthrones,removed,seriously i cant judge tywin or randyll tarly after playing crusader kings ive murdered attractive quickminded heirs because little brother was an attractive genius heir in the got mod ive sent kind charitable kids to take the black because i didnt want them muddying the line of succession
gameofthrones,removed,it may be the upcoming season we finally get to see the casterly rock
gameofthrones,removed,i think political mastery is a little too strong for tyrion especially given how harshly we judge ned for getting thrown into the black cells for treason tyrion went to kings landing and the entire time all he did was compromise everything for a whore who he was paying to love him and be a puppet to both littlefinger and varys who are both trying to put an end to the lannisterbaratheon rule the wildfire and the chain were cool military tricks but he still didnt do enough to defend kings landing in fact had edmure not quashed tywins forces stannisnwould have sacked kings landing tywin and littlefinger saved the city its easy to think that tyrion was a political genius during his time as the hand because its told from his point of view and tyrion thinks that hes a genius in all aspects i know this is an unpopular opinion but i think tyrion ruling casterly rock would lead to the same fate as tytoss rule all he would do is undo the fear and respect that tywin spent his entire life building for the name lannister
gameofthrones,removed,varys are we really going to spend the entire road to volantis talking about the futility of everything tyrion youre right no point
gameofthrones,removed,hes still unnecessarily cruel to him regardless of whether or not hes politically viable
gameofthrones,removed,no hes the only reason the lannisters are great rich and feared he brought it up from the ground and wants to keep it that way if anything his children cersei jaime and tyrion are the fcked up ones he doesnt kill or torture for fun like ramsay he does what he thinks is necessary to win for the good of his family including arranged marriages and plots to swiftly end wars decisively he also actually held the seven kingdoms together while robert and joffrey did whatever look at what happened with the high septon the country needs tywin besides if tywin had normal children he would be one of the best fathers to exist his interactions in harrenhal show this his lessons to his children are good ones but they just dont listen even though he doesnt like tyrion he still entrusted him to become hand while he is away simply because tyrion is his son and tywin copes with it tyrion later betrays his trust by bringing a whore to the capitol literally right after tywin told him not to and goofs off while as hand instead of running the country
gameofthrones,removed,heh the full article the sweet summers child explanation of rtfa

gameofthrones,removed,jesus she may be even more beautiful than emilia if possible
gameofthrones,removed,clearly
gameofthrones,removed,i honestly think shes hotter than daenerys
gameofthrones,removed,does anyone else kinda get frustrated looking at women who are this attractive like you literally dont have to do anything else just fuckin abuse the shit out of the fact that people crash cars while you walk down the sidewalk
gameofthrones,removed,this chick is hotter than emilia clarke maybe im weird but ive never found her attractive at all maybe the purple eyes make it
gameofthrones,removed,id take it a step further and have a child with natalie dormer
gameofthrones,removed,yeah but when i picture the year old i like to think shes a hot year old
gameofthrones,removed,this is how you get wifed
gameofthrones,removed,yes
gameofthrones,removed,you love your children its your one redeeming quality that and your cheekbones tyrion lannister to cersei lannister now she doesnt have any children but she still has those cheekbones and look whose sitting on the iron throne you mock but maybe it does make a difference
gameofthrones,removed,lol actually prettier than emelia clarke
gameofthrones,removed,looks hotter but nothing like the original
gameofthrones,removed,what does having sex with dragons have to do with conquering kingdoms
gameofthrones,removed,hotter than emilia clarke
gameofthrones,removed,a little too young dont you think i mean im not years old either
gameofthrones,removed,are there any pics of her wearing the outfit dany wore when she burned all the khals
gameofthrones,removed,where does she live and is she by any chance gay or bi you know asking for a friend
gameofthrones,removed,the amount of image shaming here is ridiculous im not talking about costume shaming jaw line eyebrows people dont want to bleach their eyebrows so kill them im a mixed race person my dad is australian my mum is half japanese i was born with blonde hair and dark brown eyebrows it happens as a kid i was shocked when i met someone with blonde hair and blonde eyebrows now i know that this is a mythical universe and people will say they probably had blonde eyebrows potato potarto does it say it anywhere in the book can we give people a break for not wanting to put bleach above their eyes for not wanting to potentially have a skin reaction in my opinion fake blonde eyebrows would look pretty awful but thats potato patarto too going on about the wig should she have bleached her hair and risked ir all snapping off id just like people to be aware that this is something that occurs naturally and they should pull their head in for saying negative things about someones physical appearance keep your criticism to rhe costume if youre going to but even blind freddy could see this girl put a lot of effort into it beautiful cosplay
gameofthrones,removed,hi hotter daenerys wanna go out some time plz

gameofthrones,removed,added it digitally to some famous scenes and it wasnt very hard with a budget like gots it would be a drop in the bucket
gameofthrones,removed,umbers wanted to curry favor with ramsay the new power because they expect that something is up with the wildlings and jon snow smalljon also wanted to take a shit on him and let him know everyone knows hes a murdering prick osha is there as a visual aid because most viewers wont even remember rickon stark and because her character is awesome no other reason my gf has read the books and watched every episode and didnt even remember rickon existed
gameofthrones,removed,what dd did with dorne should get them sent to the wall
gameofthrones,removed,its really not that slow considering were just episodes in so far are you sure you dont just have blue balls from the toj scene i think we all do
gameofthrones,removed,i just did he orders his men to take ned hostage but he obviously knows ned will resist plus jamie isnt going to fight someone with the intention of not killing them it was very clearly a fight to the death telling his men to take ned alive was more so political correctness later tywin asks jamie why is he still alive jamie responds that a man interfered and it wouldnt have been a clean kill
gameofthrones,removed,dont get angry over a tv show
gameofthrones,removed,no ser arthur dayne wielded a great sword called dawn dawn is a legendary blade said to be made from metal forged from the heart of a fallen star the blade itself is as pale as milkglass and looks nothing like a valyrian steel blade but it shares all of the properties being incredibly strong and never losing its edge
gameofthrones,removed,its not that i want anything bad to happen to her i am just making a point that do to her importance in the overall story you know nothing bad will happen to her which mean im not scarred for her character that was what my kryptonite comment was about superman needs a weakness otherwise he will always win which does not make for a compelling story did you guys hear that the harlem globe trotters won again probably not because you didnt watch the game why because you knew the outcome already training her dragons would be awesome to watch

gameofthrones,removed,i think were due for a family reunion this plot has to start going somewhere i think hes lost as you say but he is about to get two info ramsay has rickon and sansa knows what a monster ramsay is no way he walks away from that i do like the idea hes going to the weirwood for counsel also we have leaked pics of jon in stark battle clothing

gameofthrones,removed,oh my sweet summer child
gameofthrones,removed,trust me its really just low hanging fruit as tyrion says in this episode every one thinks theyre the first one to make a dwarf joke theyre so oblivious to the fact that its literally the obvious joke to make and most people thought of it when it hits you in the face with its obviousness as tywin lannister said youre really not as clever as you think you are thats what i dont like with reddit its a bunch of cersei lannisters who think theyre tywin lannisters

gameofthrones,removed,theres a point in the book not sure if it was mentioned in the tv series where robb establishes jon as his heir which should make him king of the north
gameofthrones,removed,dear god that is the single dumbest reasoning i have ever heard i am cringing at the sheer stupidity holy shit

gameofthrones,removed,are you one of those people that just really needs to argue no matter what well its true you make a mountain out of a molehill you just have that need to just be right about something there was honestly no reason to start an argument there what i said was a joke everyone accepted it but you i wont take this any further i have been on reddit long enough to understand that some people dont have enough going on in their lives so they need to argue about shit online i aint gonna be the one that supplies you with that drug

gameofthrones,removed,so can not bawling like a baby over things that arent real
gameofthrones,removed,rule if it exists there is porn of it
gameofthrones,removed,i do just wanna point out a few things starks are pretty much raised learning how to rule remember the first episode ned has bran robb learn about stark honor and that a man who executes does it himself if starks who are supposed to be the premier northmen do it the others probably do too at least the more honorable houses tommen isretarded not like figuratively in the books hes described as being slow more than a few times considering hes an incest baby thats not a surprise tommen even if he wasnt mentally ill hasnt been raised to rule at all the lannisters and baratheons are really rich and powerful and the children got what the want when they want thats why geoffry is such a cunt and mycella is so naively romantic they havent seen the real world outside of shelter and the few times geoffry did see that even though he was king he wasnt immortal he almost shit himself black fire the peasant revolt his own demise andcersei then only one who taught the children how to play the game is one of the worst players of the game just last week cersei tried to play the game and threw away her wildcard like a dumbass instead of going to see the sparrow she let her emotional revenge win and let all the sparrows know that the mountain is immortal which makes them ban trial by combat and this is the woman who taught her children how to rule shes a stupid cunt she has no idea what shes doing
gameofthrones,removed,i think it would be a weird thing to bring up after tyrion just bitched him out for ten minutes riiiight um so anyways remember sansa
gameofthrones,removed,because she went behind jons back she would have risked loosing his council then and in the future especially if the vale was a noshow she may have been scared of worse punishment for betraying his trust i think the tactical issue that she may not have trusted jon to reveal their trump card to ramsey was also a factor also im not sure that knowing the vale would have changed the outcome much sure more information is usually always better but all of jons plans went to hell anyway when he charged after rickon
gameofthrones,removed,nah if they reveal it it would be changed on season episode
gameofthrones,removed,no im rejecting secondary sources because they conflict with primary sources primary sources are ones i can discuss even if they conflict with my own im historiography primary secondary
gameofthrones,removed,i have a theory that the ricon that died was actually the waif wearing his face

gameofthrones,removed,no what you replied doesnt make sense to what i wrote
gameofthrones,removed,i have this sinking suspicion that there is no lord of light i think bran is doing the resurrecting in the future weve already been shown that bran might be able to influence the past and references to being able to see all time at least dany has had visions who has been resurrected beric who in turns resurrects cat and jon two of those are pretty important people to bran so maybe what bran eventually does is work through all the possible kill a butterfly in the past and see what happens in a few hundred years combinations and maybe beric just happened to be the missing other piece that fits the chronology together it also seems a little lame to actually have an inexplicable god controlling things especially since the other deus ex machina like things have been explained creation of white walkers

gameofthrones,removed,my most confused lady boner i miss his crazy eyes already who will we hate on now
gameofthrones,removed,now youre ignoring what the show and books have said about the process of being brought back and what it does to people instead you want to call me names and make arguments for the sake of it even though its bullshit beric lost all prior memory on his very first revival the only thing he could remember was his mission to kill the mountain which is why he died so many times afterwards all in his quest to get the mountain back you want this this is why i think you are full of shit and frankly can hardly trust anything you say after this and that last part you have no idea what ive been through so for you to say something like that is entirely absurd
gameofthrones,removed,karstark to get fucked by tormund instead implying karstark can even hold a sword and go to a fight seriously i dont get how that dude was castedthe karstarks are supposed to be one of the most ruggedmilitaristic of the northern houses rickard karstark looked that part perfectly but this pedo gaybear sheeeeiiieeeet

gameofthrones,removed,you want to be straddling ramsay with an erection
gameofthrones,removed,youre fooking joking right i hope you choke on spam and die a horrid death
gameofthrones,removed,i am absolutely blown how bad the screenwriting for this episode was the battle served no purpose at all other than to look good it added nothing to the overall plot s a lot of people died for nothing i get that john is a bit dullish but this episode has made him look like hes amazingly stupid he just charged like a moron and would have killed all his people he done the same stupid thing as stanis did just charged to death im sorry i just cant imagine him being so stupid especially with davos on his side who at least has some experience in battles sansa could have told him something like ill get more men you just hold him and bait him while im gone i get that that would have been a boring battle but thats actually my point a lot of people died just so that we could have a well shot scene let me just clarify this the battle scene was shot amazingly the tension and the thrill were really nice and i liked how it was shotacted but what i didnt like was the writing it was bad and it made me enjoy the episode a lot less
gameofthrones,removed,hahahaha hmmmmmm 🤔 now there was something we were going on about oh welp long live our merciless overlords the boltons they may be crule but boy can they sing like a human saxophone
gameofthrones,removed,dany better bang yara
gameofthrones,removed,wtf are you goin on about my view is that the question has been posted and reposted a million fooking times you think i was bothered by the scene of her rape my god man you should see my porn folder that scene was positively romantic vanilla ok heres my case do you really think she would carry a child of ramsays moon tea answers that question and yeah i know youre going to counter with the new clothes shes wearing but i have kids trust me its been long enough that she would be showing too much to be able to hide by now and there are plenty of clues that its been months since that happened simply looking at a map and figuring travel times from winterfell to the wall and back and people have sailed to the seas in that time cling to the theory if you want remind me if youre right i wasnt originally commenting on the veracity of the concept only the amount of reposts asking the same damn thing
gameofthrones,removed,i just came
gameofthrones,removed,i dont even think gilf would cover that dude
gameofthrones,removed,i do not its been at least a year but if westeros south america and there are other continents that are bigger or the same size as it planetos is bigger and i cant seem to find but after the conversation between arya and lady crane when arya saya she will go west of westeros it think george said in an interview that there were more continents to find so you can say thet planetos is bigger than earth i will have a look and edit the comment with links if possible sorry
gameofthrones,removed,gonna eat every fucking frey in that room from the preview
gameofthrones,removed,rickon has to be one of the most pointless characters in the show and i guess he meets this same fate in the book at this point will be interesting now that baelish is involved in the winterfell storyline also looking forward to the eventual showdown between euron and dany
gameofthrones,removed,horses arent stupid they wouldnt just crash into something im sorry but that is objectively wrong they absolutely will if theyre panicked ive seen it on several occasions
gameofthrones,removed,no the murderous asshole

gameofthrones,removed,i felt like the symbolism in neds honor basically dooming lady sansa fit she was basically a pretender from that moment on perhaps something similar will happen with bran he might not be himself anymore as hes supposed to take over as the
gameofthrones,removed,stfu bot
gameofthrones,removed,that is ridiculous you really think so in the medieval times depicted on the show this isnt a show about hipster sjws
gameofthrones,removed,i have the exact same tought this even made me not hate ramsay i got to know him trough the books and i found him repulsing yet interesting but ive never really hated hated him as ive read a lot of people do on the subreddits geoffrey on the other hand fuck that little twat

gameofthrones,removed,imdb credits have been inaccurate since the benjen reveal was leaked
gameofthrones,removed,i dont feel like most of these are actual inconsistencies and are actually fairly simply explained why are soldiers without shields in a battle involving archers but of course you start off with the one i have no good answer for shields are great its clear jons force is poorly and hastily composed though weve never really seen the wildlings fight with shields and thats the bulk of his army why didnt sansa tell jon that reinforcements were a possibility couple possibilities personally i think shes icecold and knew ramsay would never take the field if he didnt have what looked like a huge numerical advantage over jon if sansa had told jon hed delay until the knights of the vale showed up whereupon ramsay would fortify for a siege and let the winter kill jon and his army ramsay had to be overconfident of victory to risk battle outside the walls where hes vulnerable sansa knew that and didnt particularly care about how many wildlings would die to make that happen why did jons brother run in a straight line and how was bolton able to hit him but no jon because hes a scared child the actor got really tall but keep in mind rickons not yet a teenager kids maybe arent the smartest to begin with and panic can make people really dumb ramsay was probably perfectly in range to hit jon he just didnt want to he was hoping to lure the rest of jons army into range of his archers to protect their leader if hed shot jon there that mightve just ended it ramsay loves to draw things out to inflict as much suffering as possible often to his own detriment why would an army ever charge in a poor strategic position at a larger enemy force and why would jon charge alone i meanjon charged alone because he was angry and not thinking straight he played into ramsays hands just like sansa warned him not to the rest of the army charged because theyd sworn to follow him into battle and didnt want to watch him die alone not sound tactically but that was kind of sansas whole point that ramsays good at mind games and getting people to make dumb emotional mistakes why would jon survive so many arrow volleys for the same reason anyone else would right place right time luck this isnt exactly an inconsistency but it was just pure dumb luck arrow volleys certainly fill a space with a lot of deadly projectiles but dont kill or even wound every single person in that space also the story being and then some random shmuck got a lucky shot and jon snow died would be kinda lame why are there no mounted archers in boltons army i dont think weve seen any westerosi armies with mounted archers have we mounted archery is an incredibly difficult skill to master and mostly in real world history you only see it employed largescale with nomadic horsepeoples because the level of comfort and familiarity with horses to pull it off is only possible when you spend almost all your time on horseback its part of how the mongols were able to overwhelm nearly every opponent they came up against they had mounted archers that were really good and nobody else did why couldnt jon hear his own cavalry coming from behind im not sure theres any indication he couldnt we couldnt because the show turned the sound effects volume down and the music up for dramatic effect butyknowtv show they do that sometime jon doesnt look particularly surprised his cavalry showed up why did jons archers stay put out of range they didnt davos stops the archers from firing because he doesnt want to hit any of his own men in the cavalry brawl ramsay keeps shooting because he doesnt care about hitting his own men davos and the archers eventually abandon their bows and join the fight in closequarterscombat arguably a bigger tactical blunder than the initial charge davos archers couldve prevented the encirclement later by shooting the bolton shieldwall from behind why didnt bolton use archers after surrounding the enemy one no need to the enemy was encircled and pretty screwed two looks like most of the archers actually took up spears and joined in the shieldwall three it probably wouldnt have been more effective wind would be a factor and if the wind blows your volley of arrows offcourse and into the bolton line it could create a gap through which jons forces could break out why is jons army just watching while they are surrounded by boltons army no good reason really they were exhausted from fighting off the cavalry charge and the encirclement happened really quickly probably before they could react keep in mind the folks on the left flank of the fight cant easily tell whats going on on the right flank and vice versa as viewers we get a nice aerial view but they dont have that luxury its loud their commanders are bogged down in the melee and they cant spend their time looking at whats happening on the other side of the field because theres assholes trying to kill them right in front of them why are there people wearing capes during a battle because some people are dumb and wear dumb things into battle also its the north and freezing and cloaks are pretty good at keeping people warm why do the three heroes jon tormund and the giant happen to be at the exact same spot after the battle its a tv show and these are the characters we care about not an accurate historical representation of what is likely to happen in this specific scenario why do a couple of men rush the castle after the battle is won instead of quickly gathering more men to put some pressure on the defenders before they can realize they lost the field fight and organize a more effective defense why does jon stop to look at the giant while there is still at least one enemy in sight and why does bolton not kill him at that exact instant first its a tv show not a reenactment two the giant probably seems like a bigger threat than jon id shoot the giant first too why do jons men let him fight bolton after the battle is won only watched this part once but iirc it was mostly wildlings around jon unlike ramsay the wildlings actually respect the whole settle this oneonone thing jon challenged ramsay the day before and ramsay chose to accept if jon had told his men to kill ramsay they probably wouldve but instead jon chose to settle it with a duel and his men respected his choice
gameofthrones,removed,so youre saying we should stop all critical thinking i think deserved every bit of criticism it received and definitely had characters acting like idiots to drive the plot there just happened to be so much fucking awesome jam packed into last episode that it was really easy to overlook but not every episode will be like last episode and the shoddy writing will be a lot more noticeable in the toned down episodes
gameofthrones,removed,mark my words itll be daenerys they need to find a way to create conflict between the people of westeros and dany and her immigrants trying to invade their country you either die a hero or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain donald trump

gameofthrones,removed,i think she should be team starks ambassador to all the other northern houses send davos with her and her maester let her tell the other jackasses that this isnt a joke their survival depends on cooperation sooner rather than later when sansa tried to flatter her she stopped her dead my mother wasnt a great beauty or any other kind of beauty but she was a great warrior though when jon started into chatting her up about her uncle jeor mormont she said enough of this small talk why are you here jon then asks for the allegiance of house mormont she leans in and seeks advice from her counselors shes not freewheeling it she knows enough to know what she doesnt know and isnt too regal or full of herself to seek counsel she lays it on the line youre a snow shes a lannister or is she a bolton ive heard conflicting reports establishing that they cant just call on her to support a stark without further explanation of the needwhen jon and sansas claim to that title is in question she establishes that she is going to need to be persuaded they are fighting for something other than just propping up one house or another when jon tries to talk down to her what you have to understand my lady she cuts him off at his knees both jon and sansa get lockjaw dont know what to say so davos steps in she listens patiently to davos opening salvo and makes the judgment on the spot that he was worth listening to go on ser davos he tells her about the ww threat after she hears him out she asks jon is this true seeking confirmation having previously sought advice from her counselors including her maester the maester leans in to offer her his unsolicited advice she stops him cold with an upraised hand he backs off like shes wunwun not a old then she reaches back and leans on the history of her house and the starks and agrees to support jon and sansa which makes them feel good even though her decision was just not just based on the loyalty of her house to the starks but to the survival of her people jon is all grateful never knowing until she speaks again that she has only knights to contribute she gets a full explanation from this stark delegation makes them tell her everything she needs to know without ever revealing what her contribution to the cause might actually be then goes on to make the point that those knights value will be greater than their sheer numbers credit goes to the writers here they gave her great lines and whoever the director was conveyed to her the exact attitude she needed when reciting those lines but the way she pulled it off the timing the attitude the tone of voice the expressions she used totally nonemotional matter of fact was brilliant and became a legendary character in this series few will forget that scene as an ambassador for team stark shed be amazing she would make it clear that shes not begging for their help but offering them the opportunity to help secure the future of mankind the writing would have to be as good the direction as good but bella could pull off the idea of a old leader of a house without many resources to offer successfully persuading the leaders of other houses to their cause a much bigger role for her is something that i would embrace wholeheartedly as a child actress she has it whatever it is and would love to see her browbeating the houses of the north into doing the right thing shed be damn good at it

gameofthrones,removed,also she excels at throwing shade see prebattle meeting for the battle of winterfell
gameofthrones,removed,formally i believe sansa assumes rulership over winterfell since female fullblood heirs should trump bastards though they will probably rule together for all intensive purposes littlefinger will be a problem yes but this appears to be addressed coming in well see it would astonish me though if sansajon dont maintain control of winterfell for some time im predicting an arya reunion there in but who knows

gameofthrones,removed,im on my reread of a feast for crows i noticed something i noticed that this book is horrible and the series feels worse with every twist of a page the once vivid vibrant world feels dead the individual character arcs have blended together in a disgusting amalgamation of pain and misery in my mind every morning i wake up to reread a feast for crows and every night i cry myself to sleep i stopped going to work to reread a feast for crows its ok id tell myself there are many species of birds i dont even know what that means i dont understand anything i could no longer pay rent so i moved to a lowcost lowmaintenance derelic apartment downtown nobody here is educated enough to appreciate a feast for crows everyone is constantly drunk or high or both and the crime rate is only getting higher one day i saw a drunk man drinking from a filthy shoe and defecating at the side of the street the more he drank the more he shat i thought and giggled to myself he saw me and stabbed me with a rusty papercutter i think ive got tetanus now but at least ive got a feast for crows i got home bleeding and crying and i opened up my copy of a feast for crows its so disgusting now bloody and filthy and full of disease it sickens me i reached the broken man speech and the nuance of septon meribald eased my pain a bit i didnt have to cry in order to sleep today i dont think i could even if i tried though ive been eating nothing but soy beans and pasta sauce the past months my mother came to visit but all my malnutritioned eyes would allow me to see was a shady silhouette that resembled a fat pink mast she tried to talk to me i couldnt understand words are wind i thought and started laughing i scared her she left in a panic and i dont think ive seen her since i dont remember how long ago that was i lost count of the days time for me now is counted in rereads of a feast for crows david benioff only read this book times he doesnt understand i understand there are many species of birds ive grown sickly and malnurished i left all my friends a long time ago and my family barely visits anymore i can no longer stand up every day i wake up and can barely move i put my copy of a feast for crows on the coffee table next to me so that i can open the book faster every time i wake up ive lost all my will to live i want it all to end i cant move my mouth but i want to scream and cry and tear this awful book to shreds george martin is a hack game of thrones is terrible i hate essos i hate westeros i want to go home i want to die my house has fallen into disrepair every time i wake up i pray to the faceless god to end my suffering i dont remember what gods are worshipped in the real world whoever they are i hope they end my suffering i look at the ceiling and see its musty and about to collapse i pray that it falls on my head and cracks my skull in half i remembered that men have scars women mysteries but i fear that if that happens i might survive and forget all about a feast for crows i love a feast for crows i hate a feast for crows i hope the country gets invaded war seems like a fine adventure after all i hope the war kills me i want it all to end i miss the world i miss my family i even miss emilia clarke and mark mylod i hate this goddamn book i hate myself how did i let it all come to this so how are you guys enjoying your reread of a feast for crows d
gameofthrones,removed,ah man rats
gameofthrones,removed,would be a quite boring plot
gameofthrones,removed,i mean he does use children whove had their tongues cut out as spies hes not exactly a saint either
gameofthrones,removed,its not just that he wants the old royal family reinstated rhaegar had plans to try to take the throne from the mad king and create a different type of government possibly a republic or democracy and varys supported these ideas he probably believes that daenerys will do the same thing or something similar and that she will just generally be a better ruler than anyone in westeros can be
gameofthrones,removed,about the other two i agree with you but just think about how littlefinger killed lysa its not true that sociopaths cant feel emotions they do feel them but they usually react to them in a way thats considered inappropriate psychopaths on the other hand are a completely different story if littlefinger isnt a sociopath then i dont know who is
gameofthrones,removed,there are no requirements to be a sociopath there are common traits one of which is indeed lack of social behaviour that however doesnt mean that if you have social skills you cant be a sociopath ted bundy for example was one of the most famous sociopaths to ever live and not only he was able to lure his victims into his carplacewhatever but he also had a couple of close friends who didnt suspect for a second what he was check out ann rules book i dont consider him a sociopath because he killed people as you pointed out most of the characters have but because of the way he kills you might think of him as a machiavellian a man that chooses to ignore what is good in order to achieve a purpose and yes killing lysa assured him the control of the vale but he didnt show any sign of remorse whatsoever he has muted responses to some situations eg he has never been compassionate and exaggerated responses to others eg his love for catelyn is so fierce he has transposed it to her daughter and will not back off even though none of those women love him back he also midkilling told lysa that he never loved her thats a sociopath right there
gameofthrones,removed,he is more psychopath than sociopath sociopaths tend to have good impulse control and are very patient with their schemes while psychopaths do whatever pops into their minds and fuck with people because it amuses them in the moment ramsey is pretty much a textbook psychopath if he was a sociopath there are several things he would have done differently the biggest is he never would have killed his dad and would have arranged for an accident to happen to his brother rather than just getting stab happy until he got his way
gameofthrones,removed,varys so far seems hobbesian enlightened monarch or divine right eastern tradition from china we dont know if hes really in targaryan koolaid or if its just a stop gap for keeping the the sinking ship floating
gameofthrones,removed,shitposting at its finest
gameofthrones,removed,none of these are even close to true on a political level and seem to be based entirely on stereotypes regarding what youd expect a conservativeliberallibertarian to look like
gameofthrones,removed,this is painfully cringey but then again so is most of the posts on this sub
gameofthrones,removed,and varys is a white he wants to restore daneyrs that isnt exactly liberal
gameofthrones,removed,libs r dickless pretty accurate
gameofthrones,removed,in this case it means youre being contrary just to get attention and are a little bitch
gameofthrones,removed,i preferred nude dany but whatever
gameofthrones,removed,uh hi jon had a fucking giant who could tear down the gates theres no defending that writing
gameofthrones,removed,theres a theory he shaves his head to hide his targ silver hair this fails to account for the fact that he might just have a hard time growing hair with no testosterone or testes
gameofthrones,removed,tyrion was legally disinherited he aint gettin the rock without serious shenanigans
gameofthrones,removed,the reach its suppose see to be most similar to france which is a nice place plus without the draw backs of modern terrorism
gameofthrones,removed,oh boy more grey worm and missandei next season everyones faaavorite characters sigh
gameofthrones,removed,do you understand what a siege is
gameofthrones,removed,thats also a good guess he was a mummer when he was young
gameofthrones,removed,piece of paper or not nobody in that rock is giving him anything without a fight its kind of hilarious that people think the random joes in westeros just roll over whenever the monarchy tells them too have we learned nothing from the sparrows
gameofthrones,removed,yes
gameofthrones,removed,its when an army tries to cut off supply lines to a castle and wait them out because they cant get in the fucking gates they have a giant who busted the gates how are you this fucking stupid
gameofthrones,removed,youve identified the worst thing about the writing spectacle over substance seeing lf smiling with his forces looks cool but makes no goddamn sense seeing as scouts or ravens from moat cailin or any of the numerous houses sworn to the boltons would have sent word to ramsey weeks before their arrival or did you forget that it takes weeks to get from the vale to winterfell
gameofthrones,removed,tell that to dorne
gameofthrones,removed,saying its a story the choices dont have to make sense is aggravatingly stupid
gameofthrones,removed,if youre not aware of a word definition fucking google it asking it in this conversation implies that im misusing it in some way
gameofthrones,removed,and again i say they have a giant its not an assault so much as it is a five minute battle the semantics are unimportant here theres a gaping logical flaw that nobodys willing to address because the shock and awe still hasnt worn off on the botb
gameofthrones,removed,im not the one whos confused here dd gave no reason as to why sansa refused to inform jon of the vale forces they wanted a cool come from behind victory and they twisted the characters around that plot what should have happened is that sansa should have immediately told jon about the vale he would have given ramsey terms ramsey wouldnt have accepted those terms wun wun would have smashed the gate stonedin or no with a tree trunk and boom jon wins
gameofthrones,removed,so a bunch of houses unaffiliated with the westerlands are somehow going to win over the westerlands do you understand how this world works
gameofthrones,removed,no it isnt your not caring is the reason why nobody feels the need to try anymore got is just fantasy shlock now that im forcing myself to watch so i dont need to wait ten years for a dream of spring
gameofthrones,removed,you dont have any idea the reputation tyrion has in his homeland do you
gameofthrones,removed,yeah no they fucking dont you dont know anything about history real or fictional tyrion is universally despised in the westerlands because he killed tywins wife maegor the cruel tried surpressing the faith militant through force and that didnt fucking work and i refuse to believe that every single sparrow in the order was inside of that fucking sept thats an idiotic contrivance to get rid of a plotline that was too intelligent for the lowestcommondenominator writing scum that is dd how do you even live with yourself being this ignorant
gameofthrones,removed,so what youre saying istheres even less of an excuse for ramsey getting sneakattacked brilliant
gameofthrones,removed,its not liked it was sacked and burned and had to be hastily rebuilt or anything
gameofthrones,removed,step one dont send a defenselss giant into the castle like a fucking moron theres no reason they couldnt have made armor for wun wun there was no ticking clock on their attack winterfell is easy pickings for jon and sansa considering they know literally everything about it weaknesses best route of attack etc not that you thought about that at all
gameofthrones,removed,thats what you think tyrions reputation is best shitmover are you aware that they called him a demon do you remember anything from season
gameofthrones,removed,were that it were that simple
gameofthrones,removed,thats a problem with sansa herself she wasnt thinking straight she was trying to be calculative but actually being stupid malicious and overall unreliable no that wasnt what she was doing youve fallen into the trap of explaining away things for dd that they didnt do an adequate job of explaining she didnt tell him for no reason because nothing onscreen ever indicated a reason for her doing what she did she never said anything nothing was ever implied you are flatout making shit up to excuse terrible character writing yeah no you have obviously no idea what a sealed gate is smash with tree trunk people use battering rams and they still fail more of than succeed but sure thats good writing because you came up with it dd came up with much worse shit that youre still willing to swallow hes a fucking giant give him a tree and he is a oneman super battering ram theres nothing you can say here that will make their incredibly flawed writing good the fact that theres a contingent of fans who think like i do is proof that there is a fundamental flaw in the writing if it didnt exist nobody would complain people come up with stupid oversimplifications like the idea that we just hate the show because its not the books because they dont want to listen to our actual logic the writing here is stupid no matter how you slice it compare this battle to the blackwater and youll see that the latter is just better written nobody complained of obvious plotholes because there arent any dd cant write original material theyre good adapters at best
gameofthrones,removed,so what are the dragons just going to magically gain the ability to burrow into casterly rock a gigantic mountain they could ravage the westerlands to draw out the folks in the rock but then theyd just earn the ire of the smallfolk
gameofthrones,removed,what the hell are you talking about tywins army is basically at the same strength it was right after the blackwater he engineered the red wedding specifically to avoid casualties the freys have joined that army as well in case you forgot that family existed and they have a ton of soldiers also you cant just waltz into casterly rock your options are to starve them out or draw them out by killing the smallfolk who didnt flee into the rock but that would just earn the ire of the westerlands smallfolk you cant break into casterly rock even with dragons
gameofthrones,removed,every single thing you just said to me was either conjecture or flatout wrong proportionally theres no point comparing the wall attack with winterfell the wall was magically engineered to be insurmountable via army winterfell is a regular castle your false equivalency detracts from the very real overpowering battlewinning factor that is wun wun these kids would just know the inner workings of their home theyd lived there for years theres not a single weakness they wouldnt be aware of just from their days exploring the castle and playing in it your argument is invalid five minutes was obvious hyperbole i dont care if youre so defensive that you cower at the mere uttering of words fucking moron even when they arent directed at you remove the comment if you must as tyrion once said if you cut out a mans tongue youre not proving him a liar youre only proving that you fear what he might say
gameofthrones,removed,has been actively attacking anyone disagreeing with any of his opinionsposts for the past few hours at least
gameofthrones,removed,yeah they fcking do real and fictional history is filled with failed peasant revolts and people just bowing down to tyrants nobody likes it only becomes news when they do resist and succeed thats whats coloring you perception of history name them your obvious oversimplifications will give me a good laugh no tywin hates tyrion for killing his wife rest hates him for being a debaucherous dwarf who also killed his father none of that will matter when tyrion comes down with three dragons and the biggest army any of them has ever seen at the end of a long devastating war offering peace this is flatout fucking wrong oberyn mentions hearing tales of a demon having been born to the lannisters there were even rumours that tyrion was a curse put upon tywin for his pride you would know these things if you did an ounce of research except it did he burned them time and time again eventually his own family raised up against him with their own dragons and lords of the realm rallied to them then maegor died upon the iron throne under mysterious circumstances in fact maegors one service to targaryen family was that he rendered faith militant pretty much nonexisting allowing his successor jaehaerys i to easily disband the remnants of the organization and ban it completely so by your own admission the faith militant didnt immediately disperse the first time he fought them or the second time or the third your hypocrisy and lack of logic here is hilarious except it did he burned them time and time again eventually his own family raised up against him with their own dragons and lords of the realm rallied to them then maegor died upon the iron throne under mysterious circumstances in fact maegors one service to targaryen family was that he rendered faith militant pretty much nonexisting allowing his successor jaehaerys i to easily disband the remnants of the organization and ban it completely fucking lol these guys were a group within the faith of the seven modeled after the catholic church theyre insanely structured another boldfaced lie youre making this easy ah yes the ridiculous insults towards both financially and critically acclaimed writers i have only one question if you hate it this much why still watch it wow i knew you didnt do research but i didnt think you were stupid dd are riding the coattails of georges meticulously crafted storylines and characters theyre not responsible for any of the good writing but they are responsible for all of the bad these guys are glorified adapters one of them cowrote xmen origins wolverine a universally reviled film thats a question for you as in my most ignorant moment i still know more than you im sure you tell yourself this every night before bed
gameofthrones,removed,all hail our lord captain
gameofthrones,removed,useinera i suggest you to not waste your precious time in crafting any replies to he has been actively attacking anyone disagreeing with him like a spoiled little brat who must have everything he wishes people like this are best ignored and left to rant alone

gameofthrones,removed,literally thought you typed looked like curry on porn night i was so confused
gameofthrones,removed,i want to rewatch so badly but my internet streaming speed capability would make you think i live in a jungle anybody willing to fix that with dls feel free to pm me but i just started reading the books and book has so many double meanings and for shadowing its amazing i had on idea the boltons and mormonts where there so early and i just got to the part where maester aemon cries as he tells jon hes the last targaryan and in one of the very early chapters about hordor it says hes always had trouble with doors
gameofthrones,removed,wow ive never seen that postet before keep up the quality shitposting op
gameofthrones,removed,if it werent for my children i would have thrown myself from the highest tower in the red keep cersei which is how tommen commits suicide seasons later
gameofthrones,removed,it was baking much like margaery
gameofthrones,removed,same as im rewatching it im thinking wait did i even pick up on that did i even realize what was going on for example im pretty sure i didnt even realize who roose bolton was until we saw him and ramsay at the same time for the first time i was too focused on trying to remember all the other names that i figured some random lord in robbs army wasnt important enough to pay attention to let alone his last name i didnt put it together that his men were the ones who captured jamie and brienne if i had i mightve been suspicious of him for letting them go instead of being suspicious im pretty sure i was just really fucking confused or thought they were some random people who werent loyal to robb aside from the names the locations really confused me too when robb and catlyen went to riverrun for her dads funeral i thought they were way in the south because people were saying it was a distraction i thought they went way to the south just because of the funeral also i didnt remember who a lot of the minor characters were like knights or other lords and just figured they were new characters or couldnt put a name to a face like meryn fookin trant i heard his name mentioned but i didnt know who he was unless he was on screen and they said his name or jorah and jeor mormont i didnt realize they were related until jorah captured tyrion and they were sailing through valyria and tyrion said your jeor mormonts son although i think i came to that realization a bit before he said it like i finally put together and i thought they just unveiled some cool little secret i totally misunderstood jorahs whole spying thing in the first couple seasons when they reintroduced that with selmy telling him he found out i thought that was something that had happened before the beginning of the series somehow it wasnt until a bit later that i realized he was a spy from season of course during season i didnt realize he changed sides nbsp i mightve actually known more than im giving myself credit for here and im sure that there are other fairly obvious things that i didnt realize but i honestly dont remember i didnt start using reddit until my junior year of high school so season was the first season i followed through on this sub that actually helped so much with my understanding of various things going on i bet if i joined earlier i wouldve been more knowledgeable and competent about the show and storylines
gameofthrones,removed,if it werent for my children i would have thrown myself from the highest tower in the red keep cersei s tommen commits suicide by jumping out one of the windows of the red keep
gameofthrones,removed,well an interesting thing in the books when arya becomes a cup bearer at harrenhal she is the cup bearer to roose in the books but tywin in the show theyre both dilfs though
gameofthrones,removed,jon was referred to as lord commander when he wasnt a knife though
gameofthrones,removed,lord indicates nobility not a knighthood janos slynt wasnt a knight but he became entitled to the title of lord after he was raised to the nobility by joffrey so bron wasnt entitled to the title of lord because he wasnt a noble not because he wasnt yet a knight nobles and knights are two separate class of people and its important to distinguish them yet a person can be both like loras rip to make matters even more confusing
gameofthrones,removed,im am too is there a place for simple got questions season episode catleyn has her discussion about brann being pushed out the window and it is so top secret that she has to go to kl to deliver the message herselfim thinking weird that theon was included i guess she trusts him since she raised him but then is season she tells robb never trust a greyjoy what gives i saw melisandre season ep wout necklace and is still the younger version
gameofthrones,removed,theyre different places
gameofthrones,removed,i just rewatched neds death his last words he was whispering something about a promise sneaky bastards
gameofthrones,removed,poosey
gameofthrones,removed,very similar piles of ash
gameofthrones,removed,i was able to mostly follow who most of the characters were but there are subplots that i totally missed when jorahs pardon is exposed in i was totally lost rewatched it and its totally mentioned in the first season and then hes given the pardon a little later completely missed that also i thought i must have missed an episode when i first watched because they introduced stannis out of nowhere and i didnt expect that they would drop a whole new and significant part of the plot that late the books definitely put a lot more into context though i would recommend reading them purely to act as study material if they werent also just really good books
gameofthrones,removed,did you read this post it is a hamilton parody rewritten to include the characters from got this take down is absurd
gameofthrones,removed,you have horrible grammar for a writer
gameofthrones,removed,stop with the khaleesi sh her name is dany
gameofthrones,removed,a writer should have pretty good grasp on grammar an editor is there to fix mistakes not to take good ideas and make them readable
gameofthrones,removed,youre the same guy on here that refers to her as adolferys and insists that stannis is the best character in the show not even gonna bother with you anymore
gameofthrones,removed,looks bad
gameofthrones,removed,i like that your interests are mainly sneakers and porn in that order
gameofthrones,removed,stop
gameofthrones,removed,never too late to promote shops
gameofthrones,removed,wow you must be the first one to post that
gameofthrones,removed,jon snow tho
gameofthrones,removed,you are now a moderator at rdreadfort
gameofthrones,removed,jorah dont look at the boobs dont look at the boobs dont look at the boobs
gameofthrones,removed,cheeky peek from jorah the explorer
gameofthrones,removed,i loved that video they have more of that too hahaha but man when i saw that i was less on crack on more on a fucking tear drug cause i was crying the shit out of cerseis face get it i can truly imagine that fist pumping tho because of stuff you know not porn
gameofthrones,removed,when jorah looked all i could say to my husband was fealty boner did you see that fealty boner this was such a fantastic scene i especially love coming back here and seeing the discussion on the details of scenes like this
gameofthrones,removed,its all speculations though
gameofthrones,removed,i knelt down to conceal his erection
gameofthrones,removed,i wasnt blaming him just stating what happened and i was genuinely curious if it was another complaint about jaime being different on the show shit gets taken way too seriously i dont really care about spoilers like the one i read there i just find it funny how upset people get over jaime i love the downvotes as well when i literally stated what happened i got downvoted when i gave people shit for theorizing what olly might do to jon based on the way he was acting last season as well like i know you claimed im a child over something so trivial that i wasnt even upset over but it was pretty obvious what people were theorizing about and you claiming im hostile when i didnt say any derogatory names towards the op is pretty funny after reading your comment
gameofthrones,removed,as always littlefingers thinking ahead and his goal is ruling he is going to ride in and take winterfell and sansa will be so grateful after what ramsey did littlfinger will seem like quite the prize and bang hes lord of harrenhal protector of the vale and king of the north but instead hes going to die
gameofthrones,removed,maybe she is maybe she isnt
gameofthrones,removed,i was too proud to fap to got until
gameofthrones,removed,sister i mean theyre related we assume but arent we all sure shes not his sister
gameofthrones,removed,this goddamn scene gave me chills the look on ser jorahs face terror love and absolute trust but he might have just been checking out her bewbs
gameofthrones,removed,i am legit afraid that we are going to get jaded from the killings when osha was murdered my reaction was oh four seasons ago my reaction would have been ohhhhhh
gameofthrones,removed,just wait till late season fucking brutal
gameofthrones,removed,i would drink her bath water
gameofthrones,removed,poosey not poosi
gameofthrones,removed,weve seen her naked like twice now given that the snowbum in the wildling cave was a body double weve only seen jon mostlynude once im ready for more naked jon but hey if we can get a scene where theyre naked together im all for it
gameofthrones,removed,she will not be in the show and from what ive heard in interviews i believe the actor ian mcshane will be carrying on that type storyline with a character yet to be revealed
gameofthrones,removed,jon danerys bran tyrion will all be alive at the end i have £ riding on this
gameofthrones,removed,i first started watching the series when there were seasons out first couple of episodes i was like yeah i can watch this pretty cool show until when i decided i was done watching the series took a couple of weeks before i could bring myself to continue eventually came as the ep ends in silence so did i sat there just like k what now then thats when i fully understood what got is about also calling dany or tyrions death in mark my words
gameofthrones,removed,hi im wondering why my post was pulled i reworked it so that the thumbnail had no spoiler its simply an image of jon snow that doesnt spoil anything can you clarify this for me please i know i posted it before with jon and sansa embracing but the new version had a different nonspoiler image
gameofthrones,removed,i wouldnt mind a nude jon snow
gameofthrones,removed,s based on the trailer some people were concerned that they would merge tyrion and quentyn martell in this scene
gameofthrones,removed,listen manyou ever touch a tiddy
gameofthrones,removed,oh my sweet season child
gameofthrones,removed,damnit now this looks like the night king is summoning my boner
gameofthrones,removed,game of thrones season watch online recap and preview all episodes
gameofthrones,removed,mirror httpsvidmewgmu mirror
gameofthrones,removed,well she kinda does right
gameofthrones,removed,yup he did this turning the oberyn and mountain fight too i saw that coming though
gameofthrones,removed,there should be an iso chapter regarding bewbs quality assurance
gameofthrones,removed,penile erections
gameofthrones,removed,people who arent mouth breathing losers who need chris hardwick to make fart jokes and silly faces as a clown mc i know talking dead is good for business and lots of people are delusional over twd despite it becoming literal trash the past few seasons so saying this isnt popular but i still think its worth if you see this talking bad and talking dead are a cancer and if you enjoy those shows or think anyone wants to emulate anything about it then you have objectively bad taste hbo focuses on making quality content not retaining as many viewers as possible from their cash cow like amc so maybe your tastes are more the midnight style where hilarious internet memes xd are the focus if so you should kill yourself
gameofthrones,removed,arya and sandor outside the castle duringjust after the red wedding the chapter ends with the hound smashing his axe broad side down on aryas head
gameofthrones,removed,oberyn dies to the mountain and tyrion escapes jon snow dies but is resurrected
gameofthrones,removed,so theyre basically sanders supporters
gameofthrones,removed,i rewatched this several times trying to find some hidden meaning to the gif i settled on the wws arms rising while looking at daenerys symbolizing getting a boner from looking at her cause rising and yeah
gameofthrones,removed,lmao this guy thinks hes discovered something new
gameofthrones,removed,the issue is that we arent used to seeing such graphic nudity and sex scenes in tv when youre not used to seeing it it really stands out but theres really not that much i saw a site where someone crunched the numbers and in the first seasons hours of show theres minutes of sex nudity most scenes of sexnudity are less than a minute thats of the show it just seems like a lot because youre not used to seeing it in tv shows its honestly not that distracting if youve ever seen naked people before theres usually important plot points or character development going on during those scenes and if youre not seeing it youre paying too much attention to the wrong things
gameofthrones,removed,oh my sweet summers child
gameofthrones,removed,why you gotta be so stonehearted man let him have his moment
gameofthrones,removed,that looks more like a misshapen dildo or a perfect on depending on what weird shit one may be into than a dragon
gameofthrones,removed,the fact that shes not even fat and its just the angle and the way her dress hangs in different pictures is retarded obviously her body is still banging last weeks episode was fact of that
gameofthrones,removed,its actually hilarious that you edited your comment considering the original one said something to the effect of sure if you say so my vocabulary is fine you dont rephrase something when youre quoting someone my argument didnt change at all youre a strange one
gameofthrones,removed,shes gonna have such a justice boner in season
gameofthrones,removed,im picturing the scene from the other guys where wahlberg is telling farrell that hed swim out to the ocean and bang his tuna girlfriend if he could but obviously direwolf vs lion
gameofthrones,removed,his choice of arm and hand accessories is kind of a boner killer
gameofthrones,removed,cersei is arguably one of the worst human beings in this world that said she did not push him in any way to suicide if she thought that were an option she would have taken more caution about it she underestimated just how brainwashed her son was that aside my original comment was dumb because of all the istilllovetheimp stuff still fuck him and fuck olly
gameofthrones,removed,some guy in overwatch spoiled it for me after we beat him in a match so the scene was ruined for me
gameofthrones,removed,its from the game overwatch at the end of the game it shows you the play of the game which is usually one person tearing ass through the other team and getting a lot of kills
gameofthrones,removed,smalljon should have killed him im a little annoyed about how watered down the writers are making the northern story i guess they are reading fan boards about tormund and brienne tormund is no hero
gameofthrones,removed,incesty incestish porn
gameofthrones,removed,kings landing voted brexit
gameofthrones,removed,remember you know nothing
gameofthrones,removed,leaking
gameofthrones,removed,a smirk as sweet as her cleavage was deep thats fucking beautiful man
gameofthrones,removed,my brother and i just tought of a possible play of the game on this episode when sansa rejects littlefinger kiss that was clearly a shutdown i would do a video as yours but i lack the editing skills yours is awesome btw
gameofthrones,removed,natalie dormer naked makes up for burning girls at the stake in my eyes
gameofthrones,removed,and yet by your logic the dragons are completely immune to the harshest winter ever and millions of undead lead by the night king
gameofthrones,removed,i just finished reading the hedge knight last night and at the very end when spoiler alert the very good and honorable heir apparent is killed i thought if dunk never punched prince aerion they wouldnt have had the trial of seven which caused the death of the heir he would have become a great king and unlucky aegon fourth son of a fourth son never would have been crowned and the mad king would never have had any power and none of the wars or rebellions would have happened
gameofthrones,removed,a barrage of crossbow bolts straight into cerseis face keep talking im gonna cum
gameofthrones,removed,give melissandre the black youporn link
gameofthrones,removed,plus woman arent exactly who youd trust a secret with you know estrogen

gameofthrones,removed,yes indeed there is always to laugh when the argument is religion
gameofthrones,removed,im definitely in angry boner territory right now burst out laughing on the shitter and my mum thought i was having trouble breathing

gameofthrones,removed,for piracy just google watch game of thrones online keep trying until you find a suitable like to stream from for legit but inconvenience buy a sky subscription and then get sky atlantic which doesnt come with the base package i think you can get it on amazon prime but im not sure have a look at that might be easier than getting sky i have sky but im not by my tv box i just got locked out from registering my pc or tablet to the account because i switched between the two too many times this month so i get to reregister it next month so i have to pirate it despite having a sky subscription its a fucking joke no wonder its the most pirated show truely awful service
gameofthrones,removed,its likely because of all the porn it was basically the internet in there
gameofthrones,removed,cersei was nothing like rhaegar rhaegar wasnt the mad king he was the mad kings son and jons father with lyanna he was killed during the rebellion by robert and not by jaime
gameofthrones,removed,everyone and everything is sexualized no reason to hide and supress that
gameofthrones,removed,yup sorry totally forgot about jaimecersei and the gilly thing there is another one between dany and drogo before they fall in love but im not sure which episode it was exactly in definitely one of the earlier ones
gameofthrones,removed,all i see is margs cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,deal with it thats the only time someone can be brave

gameofthrones,removed,i think i just came
gameofthrones,removed,im picturing a version with cersei and zombie mountain
gameofthrones,removed,what has been seen cant be unseen will still fap
gameofthrones,removed,opinions are only idiotic when you disagree with them calling anothers view on something idiotic is a quintessential example of getting defensive at least be honest with yourself you either allowed yourself to get caught up in group think or youre being defensive
gameofthrones,removed,tell me whats worse getting raped as a man or getting raped as a woman
gameofthrones,removed,he can always use the pommel of his sword if he cant get a boner
gameofthrones,removed,g rhaegar targaryen and lyanna stark supposedly got married before jon was born so he is legitimately jon targaryen but nobody knows this yet
gameofthrones,removed,divide and conquer everyone knows that cersei makes stupid and emotional decisions pissing her off with a letter would be a great strategy and would also make olennas revenge taste even sweeter
gameofthrones,removed,to elaborate denmark has a higher percentage of english speakers than canada we learn english very early in our school system and a lot of us would easily be confused to be americanneutral english since none of our media is dubbed so we also listen to english all the time the majority of people under the age of has no accent because of this and thank god because our accent sounds ridiculous my example of a danish accent would be froggen the blond guy in httpswwwyoutubecomwatchverkkmpjjphc video the other guy is also danish and still has some of the accent at this point but since he is a professional caster hes had a lot of training for an example of another danish league of legends player who doesnt have the accent there is video
gameofthrones,removed,the show has been dropping majorly notsosubtle hints about it littlefinger and sansa in the crypts rhaegar kidnapped my aunt and raped her forget who but someone mentioned neds bastard to stannis in the same episode that wasnt starks way there were a handful of others that im blanking on
gameofthrones,removed,how is episode rape
gameofthrones,removed,will i ever walk again no but you will bang
gameofthrones,removed,who will think of the whores waiti willumill be in my bunk
gameofthrones,removed,nothing fap worthy there

gameofthrones,removed,assault survivor why would you say that it isnt as though you were likely to die
gameofthrones,removed,oh screw loras im just sad that we wont be seeing his sisters cleavage anymore
gameofthrones,removed,did anyone else find the scene with uncle benjen to be really eerie he says the dead cannot pass i cannot pass almost seems like uncle benjen is on the nightwalkers side in other words uncle benjen intentionally left bran there because as soon as bran crosses the barrier the night king may be able to cross the barrier as well given that bran has the night kings mark bran would accidentally break the magical barrier around the wall allowing the dead to move south
gameofthrones,removed,there it is the same rehashed meme that reddit memorizes in order to seem funny
gameofthrones,removed,that should be the title of the article just you wait next week on buzzfeed jon snow is a big fat phony you wont believe it when you find out why
gameofthrones,removed,how do we know that he is a stark of the nights watch
gameofthrones,removed,after rereading your comment this is a direct reference to the show why did you fuck me over and remove the post
gameofthrones,removed,which is a lie we saw from the documentary that jon snow knows how to enjoy good poosay
gameofthrones,removed,cool no one cares have a nice day
gameofthrones,removed,if euron has a certain horn hes going to subdue one of her dragons thats a big problem
gameofthrones,removed,straight from the book of cartman
gameofthrones,removed,no one was bad writing the last two episodes were good but the two before that were awful writing the speculation is a reaction to bad writing its very simple concepts that the writers fucked up you dont want your audience confused unless you intend for them to be confused confusion is what leads to speculation in some cased like jon targaryan is the son of lyanna and rheagar it is good intended speculation in others it isnt you want your audience to speculate it drives hype and tension you dont want your audience to speculate about plot points that you did not intend for them to you had arya acting out of character aftet a multi season arc where she trains to be one thing she completely disregards that and acts stupidly the audience will be confused by this so they speculate there must be a reason for this nope arya just went retarded for no reason apparently you had arya surviving multiple stab wounds to the gut and then swimming in a dirty canal its already established in this universe small stabs and infections can kill the audience will speculate there must be something more to the stabbing than what it is nope it was just a cheap cliffhanger she actually did survive a seemingly fatal stab and then not long after shes able to run and jump and do parquor the show has established that characters we think are dead can come back into the picture regularly beric was rumored to have died offscreen during the mountain ambush turns out he was resurrected and the bwb was what his group became the hound was said to have died when arya left him for dead turns out he was alive this is something that has been established in universe if you kill a character show him dying there is no reason not to otherwise the audience will get confused and speculate he is still alive this happened with stannis too but the reason for that was to give grrm a chance to release twow before next season killing the blackfish offscreen made no sense and doesnt tell the audience if hes actually dead or not just show him getting overpowered and killed it didnt have to be an arthur dayne epic clash its especially confusing for book readers because the blackfish swims out and survives in the books foreshadowing is a thing that does exist rlj was very foreshadowed thats why people speculated over it the trial by fire was foreshadowed thats why people speculated over it cleganebowl will eventually happen there is too much foreshadowing throughout the series for it not to the audience was only wrong about when after the battle of the bastards its only natural the audience would speculate about what sansa knew and why she held back that part was later explained to us when she apologized you have confusion speculation and explanation thats not a problem with writing or a problem with anything what is this forum supposed to do other than talk about the show and discuss what we think will happen i mean thats the whole point hell the whole reason this show exists is because dd were able to put the clues and foreshadowing together and through speculation of their own figure out what would happen one of the questions grrm asked them was who jons mother was they answered correctly so he gave them permission to make the adaptation he wanted to make sure they understood his books he understood that an audience will take clues and draw conclusions because its good writing he meant for you to speculate about jons parents do not complain about the audience having a natural audience reaction to this the writers are the ones who are supposed to make the audience think and feel one way or another if the audience is confused when they werent meant to be then that is bad writing end of story
gameofthrones,removed,even if im gay i will tap that sisters cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,i got a justice boner watching that
gameofthrones,removed,i guess that means euron is cumming from behind then
gameofthrones,removed,my issue is mostly with the fact that the previous season left us with so much conflict and it all got immediate resolved right away and the whole jon snow thing at the beginning of the season it really sets an unfortunate precedent for the rest of the story beric dondarrion
gameofthrones,removed,recent events have really put me off the name boris i have to say
gameofthrones,removed,not everyone can be brought back they make a big point that it isnt a spell they do it by the red gods blessing i would really love to see a scene where they fail to bring someone back
gameofthrones,removed,while hilarious hate the sand snakes and their story arc this unfortunately would not work since dorne is in an alliance with dany and highgarden
gameofthrones,removed,i think you are looking at it wrong the show has always featured a fair amount of activity that got resolved rather quickly however in addition to that we are now experiencing the payoff of plot arcs that are literally years in the making arya been waiting three years to lay the hit one frey high sparrow has been three years in the making dany getting out of the west has been literally years in the making we waited years for a stark reunion what loose ends were hastily ushered in most killings off in this show hastily take place so i dont really know what you are referring to there ultimately i think that got fans are going through a weird transition period right now weve been so accustom to the doom that typically takes place that adjusting to this payoff period isodd the show runners have been very deliberate with their pacing and i dont imagine that to change there were three or four really active episodes while the remaining episodes were dedicated to development and the moving of chess pieces weve basically got one more season to situate westeros and then the final season to take care of the nights king in whatever capacity that will take place
gameofthrones,removed,i was legitimately nervous for jon even though i knew he wouldnt die which says something about the shows story telling i dont trust off screen death either show me a body blackfish lives
gameofthrones,removed,i mean there could be a distinction hot i wanna bang beautiful i wanna marry
gameofthrones,removed,well beric dondarrion is on her list the next closest target and sandor is currently with him
gameofthrones,removed,i thought i read somewhere it extends at least as far as kings landing for normal winters and this one is probably going to be much worse
gameofthrones,removed,youre an edited interview
gameofthrones,removed,has next seasons budget been released yet because with it only being episodes i can see each episode being alot better
gameofthrones,removed,except jaehaerys jons greatgrandfather has been cut from the historical timeline of the show
gameofthrones,removed,except that even kevan lannister muses to himself how dangerous randyll tarly is and suggests appointing him hand of the king admittedly to rob the tyrells of one of their most powerful bannermen but you still dont want an incompetent idiot in the role of hand that does not speak of someone that is an incompetent idiot as you imply lets not forget that tywin lannister was hardly going to win any personality or popularity contests himself least of all with his own family barring kevan he was constantly cutting down nearly everyone around him he just did so with more subtlety than randyll tarly
gameofthrones,removed,i think its a law that the better liked a character is the more we have to suffer im sure jaime will kick the bucket now that hes come full circle from the shithead that we all hated after he tossed bran from the window of course joffrey met his end so theres that
gameofthrones,removed,the titties did all the talking for me
gameofthrones,removed,the word is planet or if you want to appear smarter than you are and want to use the actual greek word πλανήτης which would be planetes using english phonetics
gameofthrones,removed,rekt reekt
gameofthrones,removed,the fuck
gameofthrones,removed,ashara is dead and has been for a long time also dawn has been the sword of house dayne for thousands of years
gameofthrones,removed,dany is grrms worst written character she has been given so much plot filler and plot armor she is a fan favorite so she gets a ton of screen time i personally believe that she should get about half of the scenes she does then when she enters into a scene it would be much more intriguing also she chains up her dragons after seeing one dead baby but she is willing to burnkill thousands of people in westeros just to get the iron throne and be a ruler she is never in danger what a terribly boring character
gameofthrones,removed,ser pounce is the bahd poosey that was promised
gameofthrones,removed,hi all first thread here sorry for mispelling words or thing like that this is shown in the last episode during brans vision exactly after young ned asking for his sister so could it be that g thats lyanna blood and even more the body seems to have a huge cut on the upperleft corner
gameofthrones,removed,not that tinfoily howland and ned were the only two at the tower of joy when lyanna died makes sense that if theyre twins that each would agree to take one to raise as their own also seeing as how the casting director makes it a point to pick people that look like they could be related when they are supposed to be its hard to ignore the fact that they look like they could be siblings
gameofthrones,removed,bang tidy aye
gameofthrones,removed,what if he is really just a lover and is saying bury your ballscuz he just wants to bang all the time
gameofthrones,removed,the book further explained that he misplaced it in the neck of one of karstarks sons
gameofthrones,removed,just like overwatch am i right
gameofthrones,removed,ive enjoyed how this joke has sometimes mutated into the super tin foil joke theory that littlefinger is actually the identity of identical triplets similar to the prestige nobody knows its more than one person this also explains his changing accent
gameofthrones,removed,tell him there are titties in every episode
gameofthrones,removed,i hope ukjhatch removes this pursuant to the recent crackdown on post quality
gameofthrones,removed,shes actually pretty attractive itd be funny if she were wearing some scandalous lingerie under that sack
gameofthrones,removed,is that word poosey
gameofthrones,removed,sooooooooo if its tormund that turns out to be the flayed man in the trailer are you going to flay his face off the tattoo
gameofthrones,removed,is it gay if he wargs into her and fucks himself or just masturbation
gameofthrones,removed,just like overwatch am i right
gameofthrones,removed,its almost as bad as having sex with your sibling beside the corpse of your dead son
gameofthrones,removed,what is dead may never die
gameofthrones,removed,someone pm me when im allowed to see it
gameofthrones,removed,lol that sounds like something ramsey bolton would say xd
gameofthrones,removed,this puts the last episode into perspective really jaime climbed up so many steps to sit on throne he knew what he was doing
gameofthrones,removed,greyscales isnt a place and jorah wont go back there remember how they attacked him theyre savages infected with a disease that ruins there minds they cant help him also i dont think endless valyrian steel would be a good plot point its kind of a thing that there isnt an abundance of it if every asshole in planetos had valyrian steel it wouldnt be special
gameofthrones,removed,just let us fap in peace
gameofthrones,removed,brans flashbacks in the newest episode
gameofthrones,removed,yeah but they were more driven by personal ambition than stannis was he is very driven by duty and law he has learned that he is the next in line for succession and so it is his throne by right as he loves to remind everyone he is duty bound to take his spot as king and when you pile on that hes been told that he is azor ahai and it will be his responsibility to save the world then he becomes singularly focused because it is his destiny not necessarily because he wants it but because he feels bound by obligation and duty
gameofthrones,removed,piratebae
gameofthrones,removed,hey fuck you
gameofthrones,removed,also in the books its mance raiders son that goes with sam not gillys baby who gets left at castle black if this is cast in the light of ned then it might lend some credence to the idea that rl does not j and that maybe jon is the son of ned stark and ashara dayne and daenerys is actually the daughter of lyanna stark and rhaegar targaryen but when ned returned arthur daynes sword to dorne after the tower of joy he swapped the babies taking his son jon home and leaving danny in dorne explaining why danny remembers the citrus trees near the house with the red door no citrus in braavos
gameofthrones,removed,i wasnt sure about the ageup of tommens character at first but this season has hammered home how well this modification works theyve successfully adapted tommens book character who is nine years old to a character that is much older and more mature tommen is a kid who has absolutely no idea what is going on he loves his cats wants to outlaw beets and puts the royal seal to anything presented to him since he loves doing it most of his court uses this to advance their own interests only the sound ruling of his regent greatuncle kevan stops what pieces are left from falling apart the show instead has a pretty mature teenager who is completely powerless as regent hes caught between the sparrow one side and his mother on the other he is also held back by his sense of morality and always wanting to do the right thing everyone even his wife is playing him like a harp the only difference here is that the show isnt emphasizing how much of a positive influence his uncle is perhaps its because hes the hand as well which doesnt have much influence either
gameofthrones,removed,id say horribly inaccurate reddit fanbois tend to gravitate to stannis roose jaime for some unknown reason and of course cleganebowl

gameofthrones,removed,the blacksmith who reforged ice for tywin told him that he had a much easier go of it than usual because the spells and runes he uses in the process of working valyrian steel seemed to be extra effective for some reason its a neat theory but i dont think its true based on what we know about valyrian steel from the books
gameofthrones,removed,i am going to break the wheel refers to the system of highborn shitting on the lowborn thats not exactly madness material but what hes saying is that everything anyone uses as proof that dany is going to go nuts is either itd be poetic or things that other people have done on a much worse scale and have not been called mad for doing literally the only reason people suspect shes mentally unstable is because her father was but heres something to consider the very line used to illustrate the targaryan propensity for madness refers to the gods flipping a coin the poetic thing about dany is that her brother was the mad one and she is not
gameofthrones,removed,drama my point is that you all have lost sight of the mission the missionis to provide a place where everyone can safely enjoy and discuss the game of thrones television series the a song of ice and fire novels and the works of grrm regardless of their level of knowledge about those works for those of us who are totally new to computing let alone reddit posting flairing and a thousand other new things this is not a friendly place i have no idea what posting scope even is so im definitely not making drama about it
gameofthrones,removed,good ol grandy
gameofthrones,removed,because its true they said it but that doesnt mean that anyone is upset
gameofthrones,removed,how is everyone misinterpreting the video are you all seriously this fucking daft not only op here a lot of people are everyone is pointing out that the argument is wrong because dragons came to westeros only years ago no the argument isnt that dragons halt progress but there would be progress without dragons try to follow this logic before cannons stagnation after cannons progress before dragons stagnation after dragons stagnation its not that hard to grasp hes saying that dragons are different to cannons because while cannons ended up resulting in stronger more centralized government with lots of taxation dragons have an opposite effect the incredible progress of valyria makes that argument that dragons halt progress lose almost all credence inuniverse id argue though that the video isnt trying to say that grrm thought about this stuff but it just says its worth trying to explore this its saying that thats the effect dragons should have if its suddenly canon that they cause progress it doesnt invalidate the argument however thats not my point my point is you might disagree with dragons the idea that dragons halt progress thats valid but the but dragons came to westeros only years ago hurr durr checkmate simply reveals that you misunderstood the video

gameofthrones,removed,the road to hell is paved with good intentions rfuckcatelyn
gameofthrones,removed,pointless posts bring em on
gameofthrones,removed,i have no doubt theres porn for that rule
gameofthrones,removed,all ridiculousness of that scene aside nothing in the show turned me on more than that
gameofthrones,removed,ill be in my bunk
gameofthrones,removed,changing the dragons was a compromise the people likely wanted to kill them she could have just told them to fuck off instead she meets them in the middle by letting them live but keeping them safely chained up marrying hizdahr was not her duty she was not promised to him she was under no obligation to marry him she chose to because while she didnt want to it was the most bloodless way she could think to bring peace to mereen in other words she compromised her own free will to try to achieve something for her people reopening the fighting pits was a compromise she was morally and ethically against them and yet she did it yeah she wasnt physically affected by it but she did have to go against her own beliefs to do it she compromised her own morals and ethics
gameofthrones,removed,the main role was killed off in season welcome to westeros lol
gameofthrones,removed,totally deserved she should blow up the whole ceremony with wildfire if she doesnt win
gameofthrones,removed,fake
gameofthrones,removed,well she is now on the iron throne so
gameofthrones,removed,to be honest id have to see your boobs to really tell in a side by side of danys to know if you pulled it off
gameofthrones,removed,yeah cause there totally wasnt a very main character like person that died
gameofthrones,removed,i believe for season they did run ned as the only lead character just to make the impact bigger at the end of the season
gameofthrones,removed,someone like sansa stark
gameofthrones,removed,tyrion lannister isnt exactly a common person but either way i dont really see the benefit of having a kings bastard either it doesnt seem like it did gendrys mother or any of those other bastards mothers much good really the only person so far who has benefited from being a lords bastard is ramsey who was able to get legitimized is there some historical context maybe
gameofthrones,removed,id love to ride you on the throne
gameofthrones,removed,what about sansa
gameofthrones,removed,the only head role was ned in season one but he lost that
gameofthrones,removed,tyrion is an excellent hand but i think her headstrong characteristics and fiery lol tendencies are going to become a real issue in kl its not going to be easy to rule when you dont understand the commoners at all source google donald trump
gameofthrones,removed,i think shes more than years old
gameofthrones,removed,not actually naked
gameofthrones,removed,i added additional shame and assumed that was clintons face on the doll
gameofthrones,removed,she should have done a cosplay of mel when she gave birth to her shadow baby
gameofthrones,removed,this brings up an important question is your girlfriend single
gameofthrones,removed,i fucked your mom last night and she enjoyed it i came on her face and with her long tongue she licked the cum off her left eyebrow
gameofthrones,removed,id ride that stallion good job
gameofthrones,removed,this didnt really work you are too chubby just putting that out there you look like you ate drogo
gameofthrones,removed,would bang
gameofthrones,removed,she said she dressed as dany not cersei
gameofthrones,removed,i was referring to the scene at the end of last season with the sept
gameofthrones,removed,enjoying your sister 👌🏻
gameofthrones,removed,this whole scene is the lamest thing ive ever seen who the fuck plays dungeons and drgaons
gameofthrones,removed,daenerys stormborn of the house targaryen the first of her name queen of the andals the rhoynar and the first men queen of the seven kingdoms and protector of the realm queen of the meereen khaleesi of the great the unburnt mother of dragons breaker of chains
gameofthrones,removed,who won the war who taken back the north sansa also has neds blood trueborn kid why jon snow was declared king cause he was declared the one who avenged red wedding and taken back the north but in truth it was sansa he stole her credit and hailed king for it
gameofthrones,removed,the only event i knew as an eventuality was the death of hodor because i remembered the internet exploding fairly recently other than that everything was brand new
gameofthrones,removed,well i got house bolton guess im fucking piece of shit at least i get dreadfort
gameofthrones,removed,haha maybe although i actually have a house tyrell keychain i bought online after margaery and loras were killed
gameofthrones,removed,since ned stark died in the first season they are basically chaotic something
gameofthrones,removed,on a completely unrelated note sams mom is a straight up milf
gameofthrones,removed,im in the military and we were in the field when both the stabbing episode and the next one aired some asshat who got to go home a few times was telling everyone in the field he watched it and that the waif killed arya freaking jerk i almost didnt want to watch glad he is a good liar
gameofthrones,removed,this looks like the cast of a porn parody
gameofthrones,removed,rachel dolezal acts
gameofthrones,removed,no shot peep the tyrion stunt double he got that hand resting on her thigh like whatever homie aint nothin this my bitch right here he is totally hitting that and you you know aboutta turn around and smack the shit outta the guy with his hand on her arm fuck outta here with that shit
gameofthrones,removed,but the eyebrows i just cant shes not emilia
gameofthrones,removed,this looks like its about to be a very very bad porn
gameofthrones,removed,rosie mac
gameofthrones,removed,that just means she does butt stuff
gameofthrones,removed,so says her instagram featuring posts of her in a bikini or less
gameofthrones,removed,one lucky cat
gameofthrones,removed,suckin aint fuckin bro
gameofthrones,removed,too bad he looked like a porn star
gameofthrones,removed,danys stunt double is hot as hell anyone got her name for research purposes
gameofthrones,removed,except this dany is way hotter
gameofthrones,removed,rosie mac
gameofthrones,removed,can i just have a link to her nudes instead
gameofthrones,removed,a true bitch
gameofthrones,removed,given the bunching up of genderaltered characters i have to wonder if a third restroom was provided and what the symbol on the door might look like
gameofthrones,removed,warning labelb lady stoneheart
gameofthrones,removed,loras tyrell and renly are actually really good fighters in the books its just in the show that they only portray them as gay fucks
gameofthrones,removed,looks like a porn parody
gameofthrones,removed,impregnate boner
gameofthrones,removed,wow this exact thread was posted a few days ago with the exact same title
gameofthrones,removed,naw there was a post about spoilers for next season and the nk killingmounting a dragon was like the only one that stood out regardless theres so many damn posts on this thread repeating every once in a while shouldnt be a bother at all
gameofthrones,removed,moist swamp
gameofthrones,removed,dany and yara sansa and margaery
gameofthrones,removed,no its spelled braavos
gameofthrones,removed,guess the missandei daenerys scene wont happen
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,rfuckollie
gameofthrones,removed,i hope they go through with it it would be annoying if theyre just queerbaiting again
gameofthrones,removed,he wanted to bang you not as much as cousin orson though
gameofthrones,removed,ill be in my bunk
gameofthrones,removed,well bad writing is the only thing keeping her going at this point in all seriousness though dragons are not the beall endall technically dany should not be able to control the other two its bad writing that she somehow can but even beyond that dragons have been defeated in westerosi history before rhaenys and her dragon meraxes were shot down by a scorpion and jacaerys velaryons dragon vermax was also shot down by arrows and scorpions my point is that good artillery weapons can bring down dragons
gameofthrones,removed,that was very clever
gameofthrones,removed,scissorbowl hype
gameofthrones,removed,please no my erection can only get so hard
gameofthrones,removed,arya will be at the twins with negans face and she will choose who to stick the shit out of with eenie meeny and then it turns to the victims pov and she will kill him
gameofthrones,removed,if only he wasnt afraid of the bad poosi
gameofthrones,removed,if only he wasnt afraid of the bad poosi
gameofthrones,removed,cripples bastards and broken things first appearance on the raven first real appearance of holddoor he carries bran lady stark is not at winterfell and tyrion knows it when he arrives to give bran the blueprints for cripple saddle first episode we meet sam promptly gets his ass beat jon steps in and saves him
gameofthrones,removed,then everyone cums each other the end
gameofthrones,removed,ygritte makes me sad for jon she wasnt gonna shoot that arrow at him you could tell
gameofthrones,removed,no thats rickon his only hope of running away from ramsay in time was that bike rip rickon
gameofthrones,removed,are we really going to scrutinized every travel a character makes if thats the case we would probably be still in season episode where jon snow is travelling to castle black
gameofthrones,removed,s the wall is woven with spells to keep out the white walkers as well as being a physical barrier so some kind of powerful enchantment breaking will probably need to happen kind of like how the night king found brann yeah branns gonna be responsible for getting the white walkers through the wall
gameofthrones,removed,now do one with mover of mountains id like to see daenerys play with her titties
gameofthrones,removed,well bang ok
gameofthrones,removed,do you think theyll show tyrions erection
gameofthrones,removed,if youre brave enough everything is a dildo
gameofthrones,removed,lol at little bitches who complain about this get off of a discussion site if you dont wanna be spoiled that shit is inevitable
gameofthrones,removed,everything is a dildo if youre brave enough
gameofthrones,removed,bewbs
gameofthrones,removed,they battle had too many plot armor for jon snow and how did beat ramsay easily when he is tired from the fight and ramsay didnt fight at all
gameofthrones,removed,he is good strategist he has more men and they also had a solid plan he would step up if they needed he got jon snow off track by killing rickon
gameofthrones,removed,did you not see when yara wanted to rescue theon he killed her most of her men easily
gameofthrones,removed,he did went to stannis camp and fucked their supplies if he was a coward he wouldnt do that he also fought with roose bolton against stannis you are not giving ramsay credit
gameofthrones,removed,why did they kill jon snow and bring him back without any consequences there was no point of killing him if you are going to bring him back and he is same person
gameofthrones,removed,shut up cunt
gameofthrones,removed,now you are talking about leaving out the entire parley which would not have been a little thing like we were talking about at all you went from a little piece to the whole thing not even comparable
gameofthrones,removed,here we go with the over analysis again i thought we talked about this on this sub
gameofthrones,removed,i strongly disagree but nice try
gameofthrones,removed,because this is a shitpost and youre another one of these magic xylophone turds here to circlejerk over the same topics the question takes about seconds to reason out stannis was mired in a blizzard which mean his men couldnt stay out on patrol ramsay would know that jons army wasnt as dependent on supply lines and more adept at looking out for night raids because theyre an army of wildings and northmen the twenty good men didnt kill anyone they destroyed the remaining provisions and cut off the supply lines two things jons army doesnt need again you probably figured this out in seconds but you wanted to make a shitpost with the phrase sulky sansa and diarrhea davos so you could pat yourself on that back
gameofthrones,removed,this is a shit post wtf is this analysis cuh fuck
gameofthrones,removed,maybe its more like how mr garrison secures himself on his it with the dildos that vehicle he invented
gameofthrones,removed,naw i just enjoy watching rape scenes could never really get into game of thrones since im not into bloody violence though
gameofthrones,removed,ew
gameofthrones,removed,uh i never said i was interested in helping rape victims
gameofthrones,removed,martin omalley would prefer you dont use the term boots on the ground
gameofthrones,removed,jons storyline is a mess just like this analysis
gameofthrones,removed,are you serious haha
gameofthrones,removed,naw i just enjoy watching rape scenes could never really get into game of thrones since im not into bloody violence though
gameofthrones,removed,til that there are people out there that assume that if you ask for a list of rape scenes its because you want to protect fictitious characters
gameofthrones,removed,did you not read my post i said she asks to be filled in jon fills her in that is the reason what are you missing here
gameofthrones,removed,you come off as someone that is looking to bitch about something argument for the sake of argument how you cant comprehend that jon told her ramsays dogs were starved is beyond me i feel like its common sense
gameofthrones,removed,it doesnt seem unlikely at all its pretty plausible i have no idea why you think its possible that jon told her that the dogs werent fed for days considering the starks all got direwolves and obviously have some bond to canines seems a bit ridiculous for something to harp on
gameofthrones,removed,if its not confirmed or otherwise resolved on sunday its going to go down as the worst case of blueballs in tv history theyve teased it far too long its time now
gameofthrones,removed,but the problem is that the question has to be asked in the first place no it doesnt anyone with common sense understood what happened there are a very select few of people on this subreddit that are bitching about this go to your coworkers who watch this show and ask them if this plot point annoyed them and no one gives a shit again maybe to you the question has to be asked in the first place but you are in a very very very very very small minority to everyone else its perfectly plausible show runners cant make everyone happy its inevitable that people like you will bitch about such small things
gameofthrones,removed,gay porn hard
gameofthrones,removed,if rlj is true then jon is danys nephewwere starting to get into jamiecersei territory and im not okay with the fact that im okay with that
gameofthrones,removed,but did alt shift x vote remain or leave though
gameofthrones,removed,is varys evil
gameofthrones,removed,daeny so what shall we do at night bath or bed jon not now auntie there are people here
gameofthrones,removed,plus when toj happens ned barely even knows cat they were married quickly had just enough time together to conceive rob and then he was off fighting in the rebellion when he made the promise he genuinely didnt know whether cat could be trusted after that in the books at least their relationship is portrayed as something that became close and loving very slowly but the time he realized he could trust her and would be possibly willing to break the promise to keep her from hurting itd been so long that hed lie that there wasnt a clear time or way to tell her and then it definitely would have been weird if she went from detesting jon to suddenly not
gameofthrones,removed,this was porn
gameofthrones,removed,sansas well past puberty which means that littlefinger isnt a pedo you idiot
gameofthrones,removed,varys did kill also sociopathically kill kevan though
gameofthrones,removed,im quite sure that if dany fails jon fails too theres no way only one of the two gets the throne no way
gameofthrones,removed,hair isnt red enough would not bang
gameofthrones,removed,plus when toj happens ned barely even knows cat they were married quickly had just enough time together to conceive rob and then he was off fighting in the rebellion when he made the promise he genuinely didnt know whether cat could be trusted after that in the books at least their relationship is portrayed as something that became close and loving very slowly but the time he realized he could trust her and would be possibly willing to break the promise to keep her from hurting itd been so long that hed lie that there wasnt a clear time or way to tell her and then it definitely would have been weird if she went from detesting jon to suddenly not
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,you should of made out if any of the judges were part of the fandom you would have won their vote easily
gameofthrones,removed,no wonder you didnt its hardly great
gameofthrones,removed,shes worn a dress before in one of the episodes when her and jamie were hostages
gameofthrones,removed,thats what brienne asked him to wear into the bedroom
gameofthrones,removed,maybe hes just like his mother invited to dinner to die
gameofthrones,removed,is that a naked lady in the back
gameofthrones,removed,so is there a chance we could have chaka khan bring him back to life
gameofthrones,removed,you definitely look like an older joffrey if the character actually made it to an older age id imagine him looking quite similar to you
gameofthrones,removed,youre too hot to be brienne
gameofthrones,removed,true but hes retired from acting and the character is dead so we arent really going to see a grown up joffrey i guess you might mean we can just check gleesons twitter or something in ten years to see grown up joffrey
gameofthrones,removed,a for hot melisandre instead of year old saggy tits melisandre
gameofthrones,removed,thats quite a striking ressemblance and i bet she looks the same if she takes off her necklace too
gameofthrones,removed,he looks like a sad jack black with down syndrome
gameofthrones,removed,even if he wasnt using dawn hes still fuck oberyn stop sucking his dick for a bit and realize that
gameofthrones,removed,so anybody with a spear and was relatively fast would beat dayne gg
gameofthrones,removed,she went from milf to instant gggggggggginlf
gameofthrones,removed,so not wearing armor and being faster means you win every fight now it makes sense
gameofthrones,removed,i was agreeing with you though lol im fucking stupid i didnt count in the factor that wearing no armor and using a spear automatically won you every fight sorry d
gameofthrones,removed,no seriously lol daynes shite probably cant even tie his damn shoelaces before getting stabbed
gameofthrones,removed,hes thinking to himself i have the power to write a scene where this girl is naked
gameofthrones,removed,this is the internet if you expect that every stranger have common decency or is over then you are sadly mistaken
gameofthrones,removed,oh yeah the canon that doesnt fucking exist yet becuase book isnt out yet what did you watch some pricks video and decide huh thats my opinion now and now youre off to spread your shitty opinion to anyone who will listen
gameofthrones,removed,terrible
gameofthrones,removed,yeah he totally looks like them if they were ugly ass transvestites
gameofthrones,removed,cocksucker isnt even looking at ghost probably writing his death
gameofthrones,removed,what you see in school is worse kids show other kids porn the swearing is more frequent and gore isnt bad if you read about it hell i could watch oberyn get exploded times and still rather not have a single injection theres literally nothing in the show i dont see on a daily basis at school not that i want to
gameofthrones,removed,the books are far less graphic than the tv show except descriptions of what foods they are eating if they are aware that you have watched it there is no reason to stop you from reading the books
gameofthrones,removed,give it up for this actor this actor should play this character stop with the shit posting
gameofthrones,removed,itd take longer to build ships than to sail to westeros im afraid
gameofthrones,removed,it makes perfect sense posts like this plug up the sub with contentless off topic shit that degrades the subs content go shit post elsewhere you tourist
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,tormund acts big and bad but the truth is that there was a horrible accident with a bear that resulted in the loss of his dong
gameofthrones,removed,i didnt like the book
gameofthrones,removed,fully agree
gameofthrones,removed,one theory about arya i havent seen yet
gameofthrones,removed,dany should get more screen time for her amazing speeches
gameofthrones,removed,i felt nothing on the red wedding
gameofthrones,removed,the best moment of the show will be when jon snow kills ghost then turns the sword on himself
gameofthrones,removed,did you make this thread just to post that lol
gameofthrones,removed,the show is written for the now generation known for their short attention spans and entitlement issues
gameofthrones,removed,the sand snakes are well written well acted characters with considerable depth and nuance as well as operating on idealised feminist principles unfortunately the entire dorne arc was ruined by the poor acting and characterisation of doran
gameofthrones,removed,i hope the white walkers slaughter everyone
gameofthrones,removed,i really hope that bran is behind all the events like the mad king going mad it would be such a clever twist
gameofthrones,removed,cleganebowl was always a dumb idea and would have never happened im actually serious
gameofthrones,removed,ned stark was an idiot who would have made a shit king he jumped head first into trouble and doesnt how to play the game for shit if he had just taken his time with the information he had he could have prevented everything no wonder his children fucked up so much and got themselves killedstabbedraped the starks deserve everything they got
gameofthrones,removed,daenerys needs to keep her clothes on
gameofthrones,removed,dunno i could definitely see yara giving her swordfighting lessons on the way back shes going to be the first woman warrior dany has met so far right could give her some inspiration
gameofthrones,removed,most dynamic character in westeros are you kidding me i could name characters that are better writtenacted and have better character development not even close to being dynamic
gameofthrones,removed,who cares
gameofthrones,removed,im waiting for someone to dump flaming oil on her get that shiny look going on
gameofthrones,removed,brienne and pod
gameofthrones,removed,littlefinger and robin arryn
gameofthrones,removed,rickon and meera
gameofthrones,removed,rickon and the red witch
gameofthrones,removed,rickon seems like and obvious choice but i also think davos death flag is raised as son as he finds shireens pyre
gameofthrones,removed,it has to be someone important sansa is my guess
gameofthrones,removed,i remember that rumor ive been thinking about that all week i think rickon will be one for sure then i really have no idea there is gonna be some build up before the actual fight starts it could be possible that davos gets captured while morning shireens pyre location
gameofthrones,removed,maybe one already happened osha as for the other its probably rickon as much as i hate to say it
gameofthrones,removed,gravel grave gravedigger cleganebowl double reconfirmed
gameofthrones,removed,the show needs a full episode exploring grey worm and missandeis relationship
gameofthrones,removed,if she wins the iron throne she has to be perpetually engulfed in wildfire while she sits on it
gameofthrones,removed,sand snakes rule
gameofthrones,removed,got is just shitty lotr fanfiction
gameofthrones,removed,septa unella is gendry
gameofthrones,removed,im sick of davos so i hope he dies in the battle
gameofthrones,removed,thats because youre a feminista
gameofthrones,removed,im not gonna lie that photo is hotter than a volcano ill be in my bunk
gameofthrones,removed,never played with em thats harsh or maybe he played the samegame like the one on ygretnever minsd im just high thnx bruh
gameofthrones,removed,download qbittorrent from ninitecom then go to rarbgto and do this
gameofthrones,removed,olenna growing strong
gameofthrones,removed,arya will be featured in the finale according to watchersonthewall filming reports from last year in belfast she will show up in westeros most likely in the riverlands a houndarya reunion or possibly something more legged and longlost we cn only speculate
gameofthrones,removed,got bad new for you
gameofthrones,removed,ye rhaegar will be proud
gameofthrones,removed,he was an evil sob and i enjoyed watching him choke but part of me misses that little shit joffrey
gameofthrones,removed,i miss joffrey he was a psycho but unlike ramsay i loved to hate him
gameofthrones,removed,then ecksploded oberyns head into bloody pulpy smithereens nbsp classic mountain
gameofthrones,removed,so was rape in fact ramsay had a pretty fuvked upbringing can we assume its debatable whether he was a piece aid shit too
gameofthrones,removed,how does it compare to the sword of ned stark before they melted it of course
gameofthrones,removed,miss me yet king joffrey from beyond the grave
gameofthrones,removed,ok fine magic sensei and drill sergent and jaquen can teach magic training that undoes biology and turns humans into vulcan robots everyones convinced of this here so i must be wrong you all must be incredibly powerful emotionless warrior assassins whove been in lots of fistfights and combat situations and come out victorious every time without a scratch or even a feeling about what you did or witnessed good job according to popular opinion here emotions are the devil i guess
gameofthrones,removed,all of those expect the titties girl were in the show prior to
gameofthrones,removed,didnt work too well for the joff
gameofthrones,removed,bang cersei
gameofthrones,removed,bring back joffrey
gameofthrones,removed,well thats not true they definitely look alike
gameofthrones,removed,book selmy had no weakness
gameofthrones,removed,joffrey had the hound fight the mountain in an arena ramsey fed his step mom to the hounds i have to go with joffrey winning psycobowl
gameofthrones,removed,if becomes president they can add the wall to the intro
gameofthrones,removed,do you jerk off when lf is onscreen what show are you watching wanker edit sorry i thought the is trash talk thread
gameofthrones,removed,really i think he was a hero any other member of the kingsguard would have died fighting instead he sacrifices his honor and reputation to save countless lives and for what to be hated for the rest of his life because of it just because he externalizes pride doesnt mean hes a piece of shit isnt that one of the lessons this story nobodys perfect
gameofthrones,removed,olly however the subreddit you are referring to has since shutdown
gameofthrones,removed,fuckolly
gameofthrones,removed,bang whores until my dick fell off
gameofthrones,removed,in the book he does end up against dany to support another character it seems the show has merged dany with that character though but we shall see
gameofthrones,removed,ayra wargs into an ice dragon and kills everyone on her list plus ramsey but no one knows its arya so they call the ice dragon lady stoneheart
gameofthrones,removed,youre outraged that he doesnt know about an orange trope kill yourself
gameofthrones,removed,during the first watch you get to experience the twist turns revelations and big moments without knowing they are coming which makes it awsome during your second rewatch you lose that because youve already seen them however you gain a much deeper appreciation for the majority of scenes that lie inbetween the big moments both were very enjoyable first watch was a better experience but the second rewatch made for a better show
gameofthrones,removed,wow this video was very interesting and informative i feel like its good to get acquainted with house reed because i have a feeling we will see a good amount of them in the upcoming seasonbooks thanks for sharing
gameofthrones,removed,this picture really sucks the guy couldnt find better pictures use a better font wonder how old ops account is ah i see days
gameofthrones,removed,jesus christ i read the words culture of rape and instantly my mind rearranged them into rape culture what the fuck is wrong with me
gameofthrones,removed,then well be hit with the big twist hes tied her up im fine with this theory if it means we get a bound and gagged sophie turner kappa
gameofthrones,removed,horrible
gameofthrones,removed,cant narrow it down to best music cinematography episode lyanna mormont davos hold the door worst arya woundchase scene was way out of place tyrion fillers with missandeigrey worm were horrible the weird sansa vs jon snow scenario and they made the surprise way too predictable the scene when dany finds drogon and rides back to hype up the dothraki horde felt way out of place for an episode ending scene on an episode where we were promised extra minutes it has happened so many times in the show including this season no one cares about dany until she is on a damn boat or interacting with cool people ghost mia giant fighting with no weapon how to fix all of that stick to the books plenty of material left to cover no reason to make up bs alternatively this season could have been episodes or less like the next one will be so much pointless filler could have been cut out and budget allocated to animating ghost or the giant fighting properly
gameofthrones,removed,many of those characters are going to die some of them barely last minutes
gameofthrones,removed,just to be clear many of the new chacrters are only for about epsisodes paxter satin xollo wyrick and victartion all die fairly quickly
gameofthrones,removed,game of thrones could easily be retitled foreshadowing porn
gameofthrones,removed,they still sweep over the sea when dany lands in westeros doesnt someone need to stay behind in slavers bay to make sure those cities dont rebel again
gameofthrones,removed,if shes single i can be the jaime to her cersei
gameofthrones,removed,well arya is still in braavos for now anyway
gameofthrones,removed,hi i am a student doing my undergraduate degree at leeds beckett university in tourism the subject of my research project is game of thrones and the impact that it is having on peoples interest in visiting its filming locations especially those in northern ireland it would be fantastic if you could take a few minutes of your time to complete this survey for me thanks so much it will only take minutes anyone whether they have travelled to the northern ireland filming destination or not are welcome to answer this survey
gameofthrones,removed,thanks so much glad you find it interesting

gameofthrones,removed,i like the progression of winterfell showing it burning then being reconstructed with the flayed man sigil showing
gameofthrones,removed,personally i found band of brothers a very boring show maybe because i dont like army stuff i give it a but shows as gotthe wirebreaking badsopranos are much better
gameofthrones,removed,where robb went wrong should have fucked and married his sisters
gameofthrones,removed,yes youre so totz right it would do nothing for the white king to kill jon snow aka the embodiment of azor azai and by far his biggest threat gee i sure wish i had your perceptive analytical skills 🙄
gameofthrones,removed,creampie poontang
gameofthrones,removed,sansa and jon naked on the bed sansa i havent been fucked this hard since grade school
gameofthrones,removed,you are a potato dude
gameofthrones,removed,quick off the top of your head without using the internet name a song from this show that isnt the theme song the rains of castamere or a folk song sung by people inuniverse aside from the few sniddy cunts wholl respond to this in the most predictable fashion replying with song names they googled to look smart it just proves my point that none of these songs are memorable
gameofthrones,removed,i literally called it and you couldnt even wait five minutes right away you go for the insult like a fucking insolent child
gameofthrones,removed,shes been spotted in northern clothes on set
gameofthrones,removed,the whole point of setup is that it precedes the payoff if you put in the payoff then explain it away later you have contrived writing its not gonna happen get over it and have a nice day yourself you passive aggressive turd

gameofthrones,removed,when has he ever raped anyone
gameofthrones,removed,meowing im cumming
gameofthrones,removed,will you go on a date with me
gameofthrones,removed,one of my personal favourites is a lannister always pays his debts from season it builds gradually with intensity and screams game of thrones at me everytime i listen to it i have to be honest the children is close too the way it subtly grows into a younger and fresher version of the main theme is amazing and as its sung by younger people or children it makes the scene seem more relevant to arya and we remember how far shes gotten considering shes still a child my favourite although has to be light of the seven this song it doesnt follow the majority of ramin djawadis reoccurring sound and theme in his game of thrones music however this one piece is constructed so well and by the end im in tears the way different elements are added together piano solo opera singer violin each with more flavour and power than the last creates to build so much tension the song fits the scene so well as it almost shows the ending of high sparrows business with ceresi as the ending was pretty unavoidable however once again she uses her cunningness and contacts to find a way to winit dips into the main theme slightly as the song finishes so it takes us back to reality as i find that with that song i became so absorbed in the action on screen
gameofthrones,removed,this gives me the weirdest boner
gameofthrones,removed,aborted ahai the punch that was promised
gameofthrones,removed,margery so i can perv on her more
gameofthrones,removed,my source is six fucking seasons and books alt shift did a video on this ages ago
gameofthrones,removed,he is mocked by melisandre when she refused to bang him the second time cause he had a small dong and she was like nope not with that tiny thing
gameofthrones,removed,yeah a few mods in this sub are power hungry cunts i could very well get banned just for making a comment like this
gameofthrones,removed,thats so crazy this is a subreddit about a show that practically shows penetration not to mention incest murder genocide and what ever you call the shade birth not to mention the author of the source material has gone on record and said sexuality and sex make people happy and should not be tabooparaphrasing wtf mods i get this isnt a porn sub but come on
gameofthrones,removed,it rhymes with pain
gameofthrones,removed,what a whore
gameofthrones,removed,no it wasnt why are you being so arrogant the casting call said she was to be in two scenes with the last having a great twist revealing arya was using a face the older lyanna actress only had one scene
gameofthrones,removed,no no no i think u mean denyrease according to uoakenwrath shes the greasy verson of daenerys if thats the case then ya i could see why shed be a sex symbol all rubbed up in grease or whatever
gameofthrones,removed,i think they just represent darkness against light or maybe we could consider them as the devil and his demonsit is ironic because in their case they are not fire but ice but the night king the first white walker and the creator of others was a first man who was turned into a white walker by the children of the forest followers of the old gods against first men but first men converted to the faith of old gods later and made peace with the children of the forest however the threat that the children of the forest created continued beyond their intention i dont know what that represents in terms of mythology
gameofthrones,removed,the ghetto version who works at burger king
gameofthrones,removed,im the jerk okay next time you go about trying to make your point dont be be so stubborn when you really dont know what youre talking about youre the one with the down voted comment so i see no need to be calling me a jerk
gameofthrones,removed,rdreadfort is leaking again
gameofthrones,removed,season is probably the weakest mainly due to the whole dorne subplot and the poor conclusion to stannis plotline it still had hardhome but it had a very slow meandering start and a lot of filler also barristans death was done very poorly i think mainly the reason season was weaker was because the last two books were very difficult to adapt to television season again it had a lot of moments that kind of felt like filler the book is also my least favorite so that may be why i found season to be kind of boring and qarth ugh still episodes and were fantastic season a lot of people love this one and it did have some really awesome episodes and moments but it also dragged in the middle with the constant theon torture porn and the unnecessary tripod plotline it had a pretty weak start as well still it has of my favorite episodes kissed by fire rains of castamere and and now his watch is ended season the final two episodes really saved this season they were exemplary and some of the finest television ive ever seen episodes and were also great unfortunately it also had some real duds with no one and the red woman which were just poorly done but it also had some really great moments that elevated it above the other seasons the winds of winter is in my mind the best episode in the series season season was the most concise and accurate season and was strong throughout but thats also a benefit of the first book being much less complicated season is the only season that i found had no weak moments every episode was solid and the last episodes were the best run the series has had with every one knocking it out of the park
gameofthrones,removed,you bang one red head and get branded for life
gameofthrones,removed,this looks like it was written by an adult trying to emulate a teenagers handwriting
gameofthrones,removed,i still cant watch that episode and the red viper vs mountain one for the second time one time is enough for me

gameofthrones,removed,s season was just in a tough position it just adapts such a transitional period in the novels where george is setting the stage for future events the showrunners tried to liven it up by rushing some events mergingd and adding in some others some things went well hardhome was beautifully done and full of action in an uneventful season cerseis storyline was hastened in a manner that kept it interesting yet complete and briennes escapades in the riverlands were cut a godsend if youve suffered through her affc chapters other aspects were not so well done stannis storyline ended up being rushed too much burning shireen needed to be the result of more dire circumstances not a mostly offscreen silly attack by ramsay dorne was a complete wreck ariannes presence wouldve served the story far better than the sand snakes and ellarias silly motivations to mention a few misgivings sansas storyline being merged with jeyne pooles while in my opinion wasnt awful but many fans didnt like it and finally just some glaringly goofs or silly plot movers such as jon marching the hardhome survivors back to castle black rather than sailing to eastwatch by the sea just to have a staredown and brienne leaving to kill stannis literally seconds before sansa lit the candle if you ask me season is the weakest season because it had to adapt weak slowpaced material that followed the midseries climax that was a storm of swords aka coupled with poorly implemented additions it is not a bad season of television and was still entertaining it was simply a weak season that had to happen to set the plot for the endgame of the series if anything im glad they just rushed the material rather than fleshing it out to the novels standards for or more seasons
gameofthrones,removed,i think you will know when he is done watching season 🔪🔪🔪
gameofthrones,removed,i guess someone should tell him about the season finale of season
gameofthrones,removed,its not an assumption
gameofthrones,removed,on the other hand what other episode could it really be
gameofthrones,removed,alright i guess thats not pretty normal
gameofthrones,removed,unfortunately i had the red wedding spoiled for me so i didnt get the full effect when i saw it for the first time i knew basically nothing of what happened after that though so the mountain vs the viper battle for castle black battle of the bastards and cersei blowing up the sept all got genuine inhuman screaming reactions out of me
gameofthrones,removed,im not sure which made me cry longer when the episode ended this or oberyn
gameofthrones,removed,well at least he gets the tits too
gameofthrones,removed,the part of the rw that fucked me up the most was the scene where theyre parading robbs body around with grey winds head attached to it i watched it live and then never ever again nope on subsequent rewatches i skip it that and the scene where oberyn martell dies are the two bits of violence from the entire series that i just cannot subject myself to again
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,sorry to hear that here is some
gameofthrones,removed,oddly enough this is why i thought it was great
gameofthrones,removed,khaleesi is a fucking title people thats like referring to someone exclusively as captain like fuck yo name you are captain
gameofthrones,removed,red wedding and viper vs mountain was bad but nothing is worse than shireen the flipping between pure rage and extreme sadness made me stop binging for a while
gameofthrones,removed,im disappointed that you warned him at all
gameofthrones,removed,triggered
gameofthrones,removed,you are a fucking slave of your god fuck muhammad
gameofthrones,removed,if youre looking for a way around your religion so you can do what you want id say you have more pressing matters than finding a rated version of got now to actually answer your question chances are your shit outta luck
gameofthrones,removed,you sound like you want allah but also need a bad poosi
gameofthrones,removed,wow just wow
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think muhammad cares that much its still got im sure he watches it too
gameofthrones,removed,welp i guess youll never be able to watch the show then
gameofthrones,removed,shit loada muslims going to hell for this
gameofthrones,removed,err they probably recommended it for the boobs and the killing and the soft porn
gameofthrones,removed,watch it and eat a big pile of bacon thatll cancel got out
gameofthrones,removed,oh look its the guy who is in love with dany and will say anything to make her the chosen one
gameofthrones,removed,maybe dont be such a slave to your religion you really think allah is going to care if you look at some tits on a screen im all for respecting other peoples religions but this is just taking the piss if youre not prepared to watch the kind of material in this show because of your religion then youd need to give it a pass
gameofthrones,removed,hes the true kingindanorf
gameofthrones,removed,if bronn died in pursuit of the bad poosi
gameofthrones,removed,her name is fucking daenarys
gameofthrones,removed,fuck allah mohammed
gameofthrones,removed,you shut your cunt mouth
gameofthrones,removed,its called not being a pussy who cares
gameofthrones,removed,if you dont stop talking im going to have to eat every fucking chicken in this room
gameofthrones,removed,also tyrion is a beast for bacon seriously if they sensored the nudity they would probably sensor the violence as well and there wouldnt be much if anything left there is only one god and is name is death deal with it
gameofthrones,removed,thats just shit
gameofthrones,removed,is it who is the biggest moron contest week and i didnt know
gameofthrones,removed,underrated comment
gameofthrones,removed,it isnt counted as a rape scene as in the books it quite clearly isnt and the directors said they screwed up and made it seem too rapey
gameofthrones,removed,wew lad great comeback
gameofthrones,removed,duck frump
gameofthrones,removed,not gonna lie i was expecting something i could fap to this is pretty great art though
gameofthrones,removed,how the ramsey and osha talk should have gone osha what will it take to seduce you ramsey cum and see
gameofthrones,removed,this should have been tagged
gameofthrones,removed,because house targaryen is where its all at rlj get hype
gameofthrones,removed,boobs
gameofthrones,removed,i have a feeling that around the time of the confrontation with the high sparrow lancel will reveal to jaime that cersei had been sleeping with him this will then cause the rift that happens between them in the books and jaime will leave kings landing maybe even before cerseis trial leaving her to rely on qyburn and ungregor just like in the books this might actually tie in with the knights of the vale rebelling against the lannister rule by marching against the boltons in the north and would give an excuse for the kings army led by jaime to march to the riverlands to confront littlefinger the battle between tullys and lannisters taking place between the vale and the lannisters instead might this be a chance for the blackfish to finally return
gameofthrones,removed,do you live in alabama by any chance
gameofthrones,removed,avoid tumblr then xd there are many of us
gameofthrones,removed,god youre cracking me up hows the view out of your trailer
gameofthrones,removed,via nurture rather than nature in this case the savable kind of shitty past where as ramsey and joffrey were unsalvageable garbage like rusty dildos
gameofthrones,removed,you might want to keep that fantasy of yours to yourself from now on
gameofthrones,removed,you trippin
gameofthrones,removed,melisandre seems totally irrelevant as a character now since jon wont pay any attention to her i could see her being killed by davos but at the same time she saw herself wank amongst the battlements of winterfell and shit so who knows
gameofthrones,removed,some of them followed her the others let her go to seek another khalasar i guess if she had met another khal while she was walking the red waste she would definitely not have been free to go but that wasnt the case
gameofthrones,removed,weekass tommen currently is on the throne so i dont think the scene would be as interesting as when joff or tywin had their asses on it small council scenes has always been the best in my book so as long as we still have those its fine
gameofthrones,removed,i wonder if ncw is gonna wear a wig or if theyre going to cast someone to play him younger anyway i think this flashback is there to remind us how jaime killed the madking before he does the exact same thing to cersei when shes going to go mad
gameofthrones,removed,since a bolton soldier brought the letter to castle black i think the showauthor is definetly ramsay book readers will always looks for great conspiracy in the show when theyre probably none
gameofthrones,removed,seeing it without and made me look at it differently
gameofthrones,removed,shes twice the unburnt she used to be
gameofthrones,removed,because sandor clegane isnt dead and cleganebowl is real get hype
gameofthrones,removed,whatever i swiped right
gameofthrones,removed,being fed to his hounds seems like the most obvious and appropriate way or maybe they could just feed his dick to his hounds thatd give some justice to theon sansa and walda all at once flaying would be a decent alternative but i dont think there are many people other than ramsay who would do it
gameofthrones,removed,poisoned by his enemies
gameofthrones,removed,his own men are tired of his horrendous acts he leads them into a certain suicide battle against jon wildlings northern houses and the vale when his soldiers see there is no way out they kick his ass and give him up to jon jon cuts his head on the same device ned used to kill that nighs watch guy from season a sudden breeze drastically lowers the temperature a few nights watch guys are seen in the horizon running towards them followed by a dark cloud jon along with some other lordsimportant people look at ramsays head in disgust as his eyes turn blue and his body is seeen strangling sansa in the background end of season
gameofthrones,removed,hew storms into his bedchambers for a last stand there stands with a longsword i did as you asked in the letter ramsey i have come to see and then she gives him the meryn trant treatment
gameofthrones,removed,ours is the dickbutt
gameofthrones,removed,this post right here reads different than the post i actually responded to if thats what you were actually trying to say you utterly failed the first time around
gameofthrones,removed,a song of ice and boners
gameofthrones,removed,yo meera duuuuuude this one time the fucking white walkers got hold of the horn of joramun and pretended to use as it as a dildo it was rad man

gameofthrones,removed,dude what if theon meets up with melthoros and they do some zombie voodoo to give him an undead boner
gameofthrones,removed,make out with eddard stark super hard
gameofthrones,removed,i would be ecstatic if she gave ramsay the lisbeth salander treatment
gameofthrones,removed,i hope she goes to yi ti so the show can have a whole bunch of stereotypical chinese people going oh so sorry sum ting wong with their huge buck teeth and slits for eyes
gameofthrones,removed,cleganebowl l e g a n e b o w l
gameofthrones,removed,probably not but im super hyped for this scene ever since i saw it on the trailer
gameofthrones,removed,theyre both adults
gameofthrones,removed,oh yeah uh that scene yes definitely not splooshing over any other scene this is the scene ive been focused on right ill be in my bunk
gameofthrones,removed,like its bull semen administered rectally or something
gameofthrones,removed,id fap to this ser
gameofthrones,removed,how about bronn and the sand snakes in jail how many times did you watch that scene
gameofthrones,removed,how many times have you watched that scene whelp im a perv bc i thought you meant the ending scene although thankfully i only watched it the once
gameofthrones,removed,is that a problem not a rhetorical question im actually curious
gameofthrones,removed,its not creepy since theyre adults
gameofthrones,removed,well bang ok
gameofthrones,removed,i thought you were referring to daenaerys rockin tits
gameofthrones,removed,the actors lie gotta look to the extras a couple of months back prior to the trailers a selfalleged extra from the show gave an entire synopsis of what is going to happen at the battle of the bastards people questioned him and whether he was actually making shit up now looking back at the post it is clear that he wasnt lying my question is where can i post a picture of the post and not get a lot of shit or dropped from this sub
gameofthrones,removed,in my inbox
gameofthrones,removed,i would also like to know
gameofthrones,removed,yes ive seen it referenced particularly in regards to rickons fate but havent been able to find it through a search
gameofthrones,removed,im still highly skeptical of it
gameofthrones,removed,well its interesting because its a megaspoiler in the way that neither show fans nor book fans would know about it i would say your best bet is to send this post to all the mods and let them figure it out
gameofthrones,removed,tell me
gameofthrones,removed,hey kids want some sweets sign language you asshole we cant taste sweets we dont have tongues
gameofthrones,removed,i need to know
gameofthrones,removed,you can inbox it to me id be ok with that
gameofthrones,removed,isnt everything everything you can post a link to the pic of the post and if it gets taken down so be it you will not be banned for that i dont think i keep making mistakes with titles being too spoilery the mods just take it down and inform me no one is mean or terrible i would just you know put orange cones around it
gameofthrones,removed,in my inbox fellow got superfan
gameofthrones,removed,my inbox too

gameofthrones,removed,perhaps an ugly version of her
gameofthrones,removed,he says every move he makes is about sitting on the iron throne long pause with sansa by his side i dont think much has changed in lfs calculus

gameofthrones,removed,i agree that was some great acting
gameofthrones,removed,even the god grrm short changes them in asoiaf to be fair he has touched a lot on their back story in other historical books though dunk and egg being my favorite

gameofthrones,removed,this was all explained in show now please answer my question why are you posting his here
gameofthrones,removed,your high horse dumbass good now that youre arguing semantics i know youre dont have a real rebuttal
gameofthrones,removed,the war of the five kings not the war of the six kings this is easily the worst argument over ever had on reddit can you just do me a favor and pay attention to the show the vale is not a kingdom robin is not a king
gameofthrones,removed,yea like i said youre a child
gameofthrones,removed,dont fucking turn this around i didnt start belittling you until it was a response
gameofthrones,removed,fuck all of you predicting jaime lannister will kill himself after cersei if he dies i will literally quit this show season i backed my boy ned stark cause the starks represented all that was good in the world i was pissed when they killed him but got over it quick i started backing his younger hotter alpha son robb he even had a direwolf i almost cried when he killed robb stark at his own fucking wedding okay so season comes along and i started backing prince oberyn he was a badass fighter and had some cheeky lines the sick fukk grrm kills him in the most gruesome way possible jaime lannister is the only cool character left in the show he was an alpha fighter with cheeky lines and i jizzed myself when he pimp slapped that frey with his golden hand jon snow went to the jaden smith school of fukking acting sure he fucks people up but hes got about as interesting as some of the redditors in rpolitics daenerys has some banging titties but every time i watch her its some painful friendzone scene with jorah or her being the white saviour to a bunch of brown people if jaime lannister dies i swear to god i will literally quit this fucking show
gameofthrones,removed,rob stark dies end of season joffrey dies beginning of season
gameofthrones,removed,euorn greyjoy of course he was good in the first scene terrible at the kingsmoot from what we can tell of leaks and pics it looks like they are sticking to kingsmoot big cock euron wyman manderly was such a dissapointment for one a description of too fat to sit on his horse is pretty specific for casting directions secondly we didnt get the real north remembers speech and no northern conspiracy very disappointing i was really hoping that the manderly name drop throughout was a chekovs gun for his arrival in bobbut whatever also edmure and brynden tully the show really fucked up their relationship for the sake of drama as far as i could tell they were never antagonistic towards each other even after edmure misses the shot brynden wanted to make sure that he didnt feel bad because apparently loads of people cant make that difficult shot book wise they seemed like pretty good allies that were not defensive towards another i did like their character portrayals but i was quite disappointed when they chose to kill brynden and make edmure a bit of a bitch
gameofthrones,removed,makedornegreatagain

gameofthrones,removed,if we had a total war with afghanistan absent the geneva conventions we wouldnt need to worry about guerilla tactics group of fighters retreat into a village napalm the village and a few thousand feet around it for good measure we think this house is helping make ieds level the block after executing everyone over in it
gameofthrones,removed,it all started when i accidentally witnessed the queen fucking her brother
gameofthrones,removed,drogo surely didnt marry virgin and could have other women besides dany dothraki are poligamic and rapists daenerys was his or at least his first known khaleesi the woman that will breed a potential new khal thats why when the khal dies the new khal kill his kids and future dosh khaleen i think drogo wanted a special woman to breed this new khal and not a slave or a common dothraki girl or its just fetish of his side seriously everytime i google images of anime it shows white little girls with latino men porn
gameofthrones,removed,i fucked tywin in his nazi hole while he swallowed a gallon of stark cum but he got the job done
gameofthrones,removed,so how much halloween strange did ya get
gameofthrones,removed,bro you just short circuited my brain you beautiful thing
gameofthrones,removed,even the spoilers which i wont spoil concern me greatly because it doesnt seem possible that they can cover the ground they are claiming unless they are just hitting the fast forward button it took jamie lannister an entire season to get from the riverlands to kings landing in season and now at the end of season we have arya warping from bravvos to the twins in a single hour
gameofthrones,removed,i need to stop judging the oggling of lady cosplayers so much when the tables turn and something like this shows up i lose all respectable thoughts i mean god damn oh and look there are on facebook ugh there goes my half hour

gameofthrones,removed,lol theon kills two unknown farm boys in an age where lords already act like theyre a different and superior species to lowborn folk they are killed offscreen and also probably before they are burned stannis kills his daughter and heir by burning her alive after his morals only stood as long as his ambition let it the second he decided it was now or never he gave in thats all well and good they would probably all be killed by winter if they stayed in that situation and shireen would most likely have died anyway but the thing that ruins it all is that he doesnt even have the stones to stand in front of her and look at her in the eye while he makes his sacrifice instead he lets her cry and scream for the one person she would have always looked to for safety show stannis is a pos
gameofthrones,removed,hes getting some good poosey at a brothel somewhere on his way to his next adventure or his wife
gameofthrones,removed,westeros doesnt like sole women rulers look at the dance of dragons the bloodiest war in its history was caused by half of the realm not willing to crown the rightful queen instead they would crown the less able prince her half bro everybody loved the queen and she had like the dragons dany had but she was also fighting dragons if tyrion is a tygaron he would be the people choice

gameofthrones,removed,heres my discussion from hours before your post that someone claimed had a spoiler in the title so took down apparently from the main forum i think there is significance to the number and if i had to hazard a guess id say jamie or jorah
gameofthrones,removed,why do you like the sand snakes they have shitty writing shitty plot and shitty choreography and mediocre acting i can understand not hating it but putting it above most other aspects of the show just seems baseless to me
gameofthrones,removed,if one hair on a poor womans head is harmed feminists are gonna be outraged meanwhile theres times more violence towards men on this show and those bigots dont give a shit feminism is a fucking disease

gameofthrones,removed,true especially that cnn show presidential election uses that theme a lot
gameofthrones,removed,get a life
gameofthrones,removed,i cant tell if this is a popular or unpopular opinion anymore but i think sansa is the worst character dont get me wrong i understand she has suffered a lot over the past few years but she has two modes either shes the meek timid victim or she thinks shes a badass ice queen for surviving being a victim then when shit goes wrong she reverts back to being the victim again her unearned confidence just comes across as incredibly arrogant to me especially when she makes bad decision after bad decision its hard to feel sorry for her having to live with cersei and joffrey when after the blackwater the hound offers to take her home and she says no its a bit hard to feel sorry for her with ramsey because brienne warned her about littlefinger and offered to protect her but she said no and yes she didnt know ramsey was going to be a psycho but she knew he was the son of the man who stabbed her brother in the heart and she still agreed to go to winterfell and marry him then when miranda tries to warn sansa about ramsey she just goes lol bitch you cant scare me i know what i am doing its that kind of arrogance that really annoys me and yet her fan club laps it up and theres a hundred posts a day about her amazing character development sorry for the rant
gameofthrones,removed,well it resulted in some of the nicest titties in the history of the show so no complaints from me
gameofthrones,removed,so does that mean the hodor thing is different in the books or how would that work
gameofthrones,removed,you dont use littlefinger he lets you use him s ͡ ͜ʖ ͡°

gameofthrones,removed,i have a theory bran realizes that he is bran the builder he doesnt know jack shit about building walls so he decides to time travel to the future to gain expertise he hears so much about german engineering and the leader who transformed germany he also hears people say that things couldve turned out even better if their leader wasnt poisoned by his enemies he decides to save the leader in exchange for the knowledge he gained he tries to stop the leader from drinking the poisoned orange juice he wargs into the leader and yells get rid of the juice leaders mind is now broken and he keeps saying get rid of the juce

gameofthrones,removed,well she went through a lot of shit and mow shes all grown up and telling it like it is shes earned your attraction i think

gameofthrones,removed,and chain necklace the power of veto
gameofthrones,removed,likewise
gameofthrones,removed,hshr unless the sparrow is lying which isnt impossible but is very improbable it disproves the hshr theory for the tv show the theory must now be totally dead in the water the books might be very different though as hr is only mentioned in passing during the show i think hs in the show is just to represent the opposite power structure that rivals the ruling families we really dont get a great insight into just how poor kings landing or westeros commoners are but we know the houses are superbly decadent greedy morally corrupt and they all lie to achieve their goals hs is the polar opposite of that a commoner very poor who is commanding a power based on morality so rather than being a key to rlj as the hshr theory supposes a simple explanation is that these characters just represent dualities
gameofthrones,removed,lol i noticed that too and burst out laughing
gameofthrones,removed,why women go through puberty around you shouldnt do anything due to social and legal reasons but being attracted to them isnt concerning in the least its the by product of millions of years of evolution
gameofthrones,removed,eats flat bread sexily
gameofthrones,removed,jesus she was when she started with game of thrones
gameofthrones,removed,the fine folks over at the donald can think
gameofthrones,removed,implying you can only be attracted to people your age
gameofthrones,removed,ive never found myself attracted to her personally i mean shes clearly attractive but ive never been attracted to her wtf is wrong with me
gameofthrones,removed,ha people used to ask me if i flew weird thinking that mila kunis was hot in that show me well shes my age so nope
gameofthrones,removed,had to sort by controversial to find this comment look im all for equal rights but going full girl power is just as bad as going full damsels in distress i hope this wont be such a dominant theme in the books
gameofthrones,removed,how about httpiimgurcomcqvcrlajpg or
gameofthrones,removed,as soon as a female hits puberty they develop all of the things that trigger attractiveness to straight men obviously they are still minors and its statutory rape to do anything with them but if you are trying to argue that there arent attractive year olds then i call bullshit
gameofthrones,removed,that was the first scene i found myself feeling attracted to her its very flattering lighting and she was trying out new facial expressions since this was the first time shes spoken to a family member in a long time
gameofthrones,removed,to me this is the first episode where i thought she was actually hot its the first time we see her smiling and being happy as an adult i guess its true what they say looking happy does make you more attractive
gameofthrones,removed,ive been the same age as her as the show has gone on can confirm she has definitely peaked in the last season or so
gameofthrones,removed,rinsidejorahshead
gameofthrones,removed,bible spoiler jesus dies but theres a theory that he might be resurrected called gvj godvirgin maryjesus
gameofthrones,removed,ignorant selfish little girl wtf you wouldnt want your ancestral home back from the assholes that stole it youre being ridiculous if you think she was wrong in wanting winterfell back from the boltons we all want that so how is it selfish that she does she went there with littlefinger to try in the only way she could its not like shes just sat back waiting for the menfolk to do her bidding now its going to take a war to take it back and jon snow is the perfect choice being of stark blood and a man he also has experience fighting and leading
gameofthrones,removed,why is this shit allowed here
gameofthrones,removed,wow shit automod for a shit sub

gameofthrones,removed,same aryas actress was born one month before me id like to give her a needle
gameofthrones,removed,i used to hate arya but i suppose the aging is turning her into a fine woman as well
gameofthrones,removed,i feel honored between the shit captions and the shit titles i didnt think my post would lead to more shit content
gameofthrones,removed,well technically it is a boob
gameofthrones,removed,i think last nights episode was the first time they let sansa be clean comfortable and happy in a long while i think this goes a long way towards perception of attractiveness
gameofthrones,removed,first
gameofthrones,removed,the image that changed my mind about here was the snow castle shots with the dark blue dress the imagery was amazing
gameofthrones,removed,wasnt she when filming season one she really grew up in front of our eyes i think that helps her character though it seems all the stark kids minus robb and jon have grown so much
gameofthrones,removed,damn thats a good point at the time i kind of supported her in that because i think as an audience you feel the guy is a piece of shit and he probably deserves what he gets but as a political move i suppose it is disastrous and it showed how emotional and impulsive she is which arent exactly good qualities in a ruler
gameofthrones,removed,im a good deal older so i can only really say shes an attractive young lady especially in the new xmen movie
gameofthrones,removed,im shes older than my gf she doesnt turn till sunday
gameofthrones,removed,rfuckhouseumber
gameofthrones,removed,yup
gameofthrones,removed,one eye it seems from the poster but i doubt they will do anything to his pretty face euron was supposed to have one eye and an eyepatch and they didnt even give him that euron has two eyes on the show the main pretty boy on the show will probably keep his two eyes

gameofthrones,removed,chaos is a ladder should be thrown in the mix as well theres almost too many ones in this show lol
gameofthrones,removed,no you dont
gameofthrones,removed,maybe hes playing the really long game and did this on purpose to set up sansa as the queen in the north just in case dany fails
gameofthrones,removed,its funny because i relate these stories in my countrys sub all the time and most people in there know very well that its a serious problem but of course its a lot more plausible that id make up a story in response to a random comment in a got thread s
gameofthrones,removed,the story goes downhill as soon as they hit earth lol just a season of main girls potential lovers and herself doing dumb shit oh no hansome dude dies because he shot up a village for no reason oh no creepy underground people are vampires who raise bloodthirsty savages oh no black guy has sacrifices himself but at the last second goes nope and builds a makeshift rocket to get to earth

gameofthrones,removed,in the books when the iron born are having the kingsmoot euron has one of his men start off by blowing a crazy magic horn it was a loud shriek and sounded different than most horns and later on the guy who blew the horn ended up dying euron claims the horn has the power to tame dragons euron has sent his brother victarion to mereen to propose a marriage of euron and dany he could possibly lure her to his side with the offer of the iron fleet and once he has her in control i could see him turning on her and and when she says her name in full an her dragons appear to fuck shot up euron brings the horn out and the dragons are tamed and the iron born rule maybe but probably not
gameofthrones,removed,all boners must die
gameofthrones,removed,bit of a tinfoil theory jon weds sansa this is based on the shows links to jons interestconnection to redheads the fact theyre the only stark children we dont see connectinteract on screen before this episode obviously this is obviously assuming the rlj theory is true it would be too weird for the audience otherwise the way they greet one another sansa reaching over and taking his hand i am aware that in the past martin has said something about arya jon but i think this would be too strange for a tv audience because the last time we saw them they acted like proper brother sister also i think arya if she ends up with anyone will be with gendry obviously the other alternatives would be jon returning as lord commander lf somehow marrying sansa difficult to believe jon dany falling for one another but if this happened i reckon one would sacrifice the other azhor hair prophecy
gameofthrones,removed,they havent my opinion built up much sympathy for her or cause to rally behind her in the westeros stories there are nothing but support for the stark kidswho will eventually all die by being roasted by the mad queen daenerys when she gets back to westerosi hope thats not how the story ends with a coming fullcircle ending in which she breaks the wheel by firing everyone up on a kabob her story is getting a bit lame at this point and coming across as just filler material for the show she did the im the queen of dragons and impervious to fire and will kill everyone so bow to me thing again in want her to either start doing essos porn or just die
gameofthrones,removed,khal pornhub i hardly fap ye
gameofthrones,removed,all boners must die

gameofthrones,removed,lmao
gameofthrones,removed,it is a spoiler its the final act of the show dr peter who baelish reveals his true plan
gameofthrones,removed,this is my first time posting why was this post removed wtf
gameofthrones,removed,why was my post removed this is not a theory nor does it contain spoilerswhat the hell pussies
gameofthrones,removed,lol no one was gonna hurt her they only say they gonna gang bang her which she would actually love btw but thats beside the point because she doesnt wanna live by their tradition
gameofthrones,removed,lol so threatening to rape her is worse than killing her mate she mightve actually enjoyed a good ol gang bang
gameofthrones,removed,im just impressed that the show was able to make us root for team incest
gameofthrones,removed,if jon really wasnt neds bastard it would be a huge tragedy if jon never got to meet catelyn again i feel like that apology is really needed if like in the books catelyn is resurrected by beric dondarrion the guy who was resurrected a bunch of times himself then maybe there is a meeting we havent seen beric for quite some time in the series and maybe this is a big reveal at some point seems like a bunch more plot for the tv show though so it might not happen and cat might stay dead
gameofthrones,removed,give it a week itll be on every porn site known to mankind
gameofthrones,removed,the title and the article have multiple spoiler tags not sure what you guys were expecting when you read it
gameofthrones,removed,theyre teaming up to deny viewers the walk of shame a bunch of them really wanted
gameofthrones,removed,people just want to see natalie dormer naked
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,no i was lucky as i was young and the nerves werent completely severed they could reroute regrow and find new comnections and yes there are many who get paralyzed and higher areas of the spine than both me and bran i know people who are paralyzed from the neck and down now that is hell bran can move his arms and seeing as hes not dead from constipation then he must have some control of those bodily functions again being paralyzed is no small thing and fighting it comes down to a degree of luck as well as willpower ive been handicapped in different ways my entire life when i got paralyzed years ago my reaction was pretty much well shit one more thing to deal with bran even now has way better odds of surviving in the wilderness then i ever did even before my back injury i just happen to take paralysis rather lightly at least i wasnt dying anymore scoliosis would have killed me paralysis was an acceptable risk of the operation
gameofthrones,removed,not because of her character it was because they wanted to see natalie dormer naked and walking through the street
gameofthrones,removed,this question is adorable
gameofthrones,removed,i heard no white walkers at the bastard bowl and the battle of the bastards is the episode battle like the battle of blackwater and battle of castle black my idea on the white walkers is they attack the wall and maybe destroy it at the season finale like how season ended with there first large attack on the nights watch at the fist of the first men
gameofthrones,removed,you could say hes rock hard
gameofthrones,removed,what the duck is dd that everyone keeps saying im assuming its part of the hbo writing team or something
gameofthrones,removed,oh man i totally forgot what kind of arrogant douche jamie used to be in the first season christ the books are amazing just sad that the show didnt maintain that character development plot development i dont even remember how loras used to be anymore to care for him being destroyed anymore and cersei went through all of that only to go back to her old self again i mean she should be mentally furious at this point but she doesnt seem all that different from how she was before albeit a little more angry at the high sparrow than margeary lazy writing imo
gameofthrones,removed,none of what i said is spoilers are you going to say this same thing to every other comment in the thread
gameofthrones,removed,i never considered danaerys what an awesome twist that would be pointing to jon snow was it the sword that shattered the white walker his potentially targaeryn blood or the fact hes azor ahai just like with cerceis prophecy a young queen will take everything from you which she assumed was margery fuckin butchering these names but could now likely be sansa oh ho ho buddy
gameofthrones,removed,well i like daenerys a lot because she acts very bravely added to that she looks gorgeous but that doesnt matter although i like her i think she is or will get a villain and fight against the starks
gameofthrones,removed,ive never been a fan of danys storyline wasnt a fan in the books and not a fan on the show she has singlehandedly destabilized two entire regions and cultures slavers bay and now vaes dothrak and her plan is still to leave for westeros im not saying abolishing slavery was a bad thingfar from itbut running off after upending a good chunk of the continent and bringing it to the precipice of war is incredibly irresponsible the thing is i dont dislike dany as a character part of what bothers me is that from a storyline standpoint she makes a lot of mistakes and always comes out smelling like a rose starks make mistakes and get dead in a hurry shed be redeemed in my eyes if she decides that essos is her home now and she needs to rule what shes conquered and find a way to successfully manage the transition rather than heading across the sea to conquer a home she doesnt even remember anywaylongwinded way of saying i didnt like the ending of that episode either
gameofthrones,removed,things got all kinds of hot at that funeral pyre
gameofthrones,removed,you mean dany youd be surprised how far a voice can reach when youre yelling everyone else is silent youre out in the open dany spent an entire night in a fire and apparently managed to breathe just fine then so i dont know why shed have any trouble this time around

gameofthrones,removed,no bewbage
gameofthrones,removed,should have done cosplay in her true form without the necklace
gameofthrones,removed,seems like the necklace is working
gameofthrones,removed,it would be very painful

gameofthrones,removed,she looks ugly as fuck what the hell is wrong with her face
gameofthrones,removed,ive never wanted to be jaime lannister more in my life
gameofthrones,removed,we learned via ned stark studying baratheon genetics that in the asoiaf world dark haireyes are a dominant trait and light haireyes are a recessive trait same obviously holds true in the real world so a targaryen breeding with another family would most likely result in nonsilver hair and darker eyes we see this in jon the child of a targaryen and a stark having both dark hair and eyes one of the reasons why the targaryens inbred so much was to keep the purity of the silver hair and purple eyes
gameofthrones,removed,did i even once suggest it didnt
gameofthrones,removed,dinklage is an incredibly attractive man but him being a dwarf is really confusing and makes it difficult to think of him like that

gameofthrones,removed,i just have to say i hate shae mostly because the actress is awful while plenty of the characters are overly dramatic they all work really well as their character and make me forget theyre acting at least for the most part the woman who plays shae is horrible though she sounds like shes reading lines every time she speaks her being a porn star was the least surprising bit of trivia ive ever heard

gameofthrones,removed,i dont know why i keep responding youre hatred for her is clearly clouding your judgement she was a weak girl who was forced to marry a man then she got this fakealphabitch over night i dont even know what to say to that or the rest of that first bit im actually shocked at the mental backflips youre doing to call one of georges strongest characters weak and with no value how disappointing that some people read his work and come out with opinions like these as for her home id say that theres more emotional value in longing for a home you were never allowed to have she never had peace or stability the starks at least grew up with love and a stable home i just give up the rest of what you said is so blinded with hate and inaccuracies that i cant be bothered

gameofthrones,removed,what kind of dumb question is that if immortal means you live forever how can anyone know they are immortal if forever is without end even if you lived until the end of time wouldnt that mean that when the end of time came you would no longer be alive and therefore not be immortal just cause im old means im immortal then where do we draw the line of old enough to be immortal by youre logic you could be immortal too

gameofthrones,removed,upvotes for a picture of a shirt on a tv show sub what a joke
gameofthrones,removed,youre black eughhh
gameofthrones,removed,there are numerous problems with translating this story to film first the story is boring and predictable battle starts with aegons forces losing just in time saved by dragonfire and another king bends the knee thats okay for grrms history books but audiences will get restless if you show them the same arc three times in a row second how do you expect an audience to root for a hero who is essentially an incestuous polygamist terrorist not really sympathetic and the main love triangle aegonvisenyarhaenys will make most theatergoers uneasy again this makes sense in grrms planetos but not something that is easy to sell third theres not even a clean resolution as the kingdom of dorne remains defiant not very dramatic to end things with rhaenys flying home emptyhanded of course this sets up many future events in westeros but it would be lame to see in a film also the surrender of torren stark while noble is again a letdown for the audience who expect to at least see some sweet dragonfire in short many event and details would need to be changed to make a marketable product this will of course anger the fanboys and the compromise would probably make a lame derivative action movie id rather not see that happen
gameofthrones,removed,if city tv can show softcore porn go watershed

gameofthrones,removed,if your watching a torrent just download a zip drive online and import the subtitle file into vlc when you start each episode search game of thrones dothraki subtitles you should find the same file i did that had the first seasons and all non english subtitles you need the newer seasons i think have all subtitles hardcoded i could be wrong about that though

gameofthrones,removed,rhaegar son of the mad king banged neds sister who had the child we saw in the flashback who is jon snow rhaegar kidnapping or possibly eloping with lyssa was one of the catalysts for roberts rebellion i would guess he doesnt have the platinum hair because its a recessive trait preserved when targaryens bang each other but losing out to the stark hair gene when they marry outside the family unanswered questions include how will jon find out his parentage very few people knew and most are dead was he legitimised in some way targaryens have been known to have multiple wives so its possible r and l married how willing was lyssa to run off with rhaegar most people have described him as a kind honourable man who wouldnt kidnap and rape a woman and what impact will the revelation that jon is a targ have at this point its pretty much whoever takes the throne wins theres no one out there searching for the one true king maybe hell be able to ride a dragon
gameofthrones,removed,she has a fat ass
gameofthrones,removed,whoever told you depression was a weakness had no idea what they were talking about
gameofthrones,removed,dont know why youre being down voted it was the truth king tommen was weak and couldnt make a decision for himself without cowering with his tail between his legs
gameofthrones,removed,what would have been brave is if he had his mother executed for mass murder he took the cowards way out
gameofthrones,removed,dildo
gameofthrones,removed,i feel like they might leave lyanna mormont as warden of the north halfway through the season while jon and sansa travel south to rally troops from the riverlands etc and maybe jorah will head north with an army of rock people
gameofthrones,removed,tarot is bullshit and so is this post
gameofthrones,removed,i can give them more names if theyre bored
gameofthrones,removed,and listen to country music hey they arent called white walkers for nothing
gameofthrones,removed,suicide is not brave he chose quick escape over the difficult road of punishing his mother and moving forward without his queen he knew what cersei did and still chose to leave the citizens of westeros in her hands he was put in a brutally difficult position and i feel bad for him but im not going to glorify suicide the brave thing to do is overcome not quit
gameofthrones,removed,so
gameofthrones,removed,wank to some undead porn
gameofthrones,removed,oh shucks look at that youve been beaned my friend 😂😂😭😎 reply bean boy life now or be forced to spend the rest of your days in legume limbo

gameofthrones,removed,whoa here she comes cums
gameofthrones,removed,blehck youre sick in the head
gameofthrones,removed,so according to this post everyone in the books look like porn actors
gameofthrones,removed,glad to see that olly isnt on this list fuck him
gameofthrones,removed,ill be disappointed if jon ends up like every other and is smitten upon meeting her same tbh itll just be the same tired old story which is why the burn of jon x sansa would be wonderfully wrong and horrible yet in character with not only the targaryen love for sisterbrother romance but also the ned cat parallels which makes it so right imo but honestly jon seems just tired of it all so i could see him not giving any shits about love anymore he probably just wants to live a hermit life in the north
gameofthrones,removed,my life partner loves this show oh and the books too being the greatest partner i can be i sit with him every sunday night and watch the game of thrones one episode we watched and immediately i pumped this tune out i owe it to the dragons for sure i hope you enjoy and in turn get inspired too
gameofthrones,removed,well bang ok
gameofthrones,removed,according to all the sources i can find lf assumed ramsay was a nicelittlebastardmadelegitimate who would treat a high born wife like gold he had no clue he put sansa in place to take over winterfell once stannis defeated the boltons and then he would bang her and take the north maybe not in that order basically lf made a huge miscalculation and sansa suffered i am hoping this will help sansa to be more badass in the next season the writing with her character in the show is inconsistent
gameofthrones,removed,well he is a product of incest
gameofthrones,removed,true but the big thing about bookjorah is that he only follows dany because hes in love with her if he ever realized he didnt have a chance hed go full neckbeard show jorah loves her but hes mostly aware that he doesnt have a chance with her and would still follow her anyway
gameofthrones,removed,jon will bang dany vicariously through sam confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,i would be nice if it didnt feel like arya has been training for only week were expected to believe shes a kickass assassin now when she was struggling to fight a few episodes earlier and i wish that she was luring the waif by pretending to let her guard down into her trap and that she didnt get stabbed those scenes just ruined aryas storyline for me fuck that director tbh
gameofthrones,removed,roldpeoplefabebook is leaking theres lasagna on the fridge
gameofthrones,removed,were starting a bit later because at the end of this season winter is here and that means that sunny weather doesnt really serve our purposes any more so we kind of pushed everything down the line so we could get some grim grey weather even in the sunnier places that we shoot thats understandable and all but my heart cannot bear the pain of waiting longer than i should be c doesnt that also mean that season eight will be delayed too since presumably its going to ultimately be around white walkers vs everyone

gameofthrones,removed,read the article before running your mouth youre really stuck on this point about porn its not about that yes there are parents who censor too much on shows that kids could handle but got is not like that theres a fuckton of gore that would have traumatised me had i seen it as a year old even offcamera scenes like wild dogs eating a mother and child would have given me nightmares its completely ageinappropriate for of year olds
gameofthrones,removed,wont happen she gets eaten by a dragon they talk about it in the books
gameofthrones,removed,she is already pregnant with a white walkers baby thats why she isnt doing it they talked about it in the books
gameofthrones,removed,no im serious the dragons sense the ice baby in her tummy and focus her with their ults and she gets bursted down before she can regen in the books anyway
gameofthrones,removed,no one thinks lf might have someone for her to marry okay then
gameofthrones,removed,i apologize once again but thats nonsense firstly the holy roman empire was not an hereditary monarchy but an elective one secondly francis i was elected to succeed not maria theresas father but an unrelated emperor charles vii who had been elected to succeed charles vi thirdly husbands regularly shared their wifes titles during the duration of their marriage jure uxoris but they did not transmit it to their own family which is what you are saying

gameofthrones,removed,in the books they have a relationship and always talk about trusting each other so thats it probably
gameofthrones,removed,in the books droggon died and it is alluded that ser pounce is gunning after the other two
gameofthrones,removed,i was so cringed while she spoke shes just a character that they keep forcing into being cool and saying cool things but oh well everyone else seems to like getting a character shoved down their throats
gameofthrones,removed,yes okay the little girl everyone likes is a character you liked too we know lets move on please
gameofthrones,removed,uh what the fuck does that have to do with the price of tea in china the green trial happened months before dany set sail pay attention to the show
gameofthrones,removed,seriously fuck the retards responsible for this and the short seasons coming
gameofthrones,removed,and he died because he wanted to involve the nights watch in the war against the boltons not because were so evil because we hate wildlings
gameofthrones,removed,cersei doesnt understand feelings that poor woman as aspbergers and didnt consider that murdering the only two people that were nice to him would upset him
gameofthrones,removed,did you forget how viserys died
gameofthrones,removed,ser davos youre dead and now youre not thats completely fucking mad
gameofthrones,removed,you can only prove a claim through having a large backing and by force no one is going to care about the bastard of a targ or a trueborn targ female unless they also have a huge backing to take the throne by force
gameofthrones,removed,jon is definitely burned in the show in the show either being a real dragon or a targ makes you fireproof or at least dany thinks it does thats how she concludes viserys isnt a real dragon and she even says he was not the last dragon fire cannot kill a dragon or something to that effect im not sure how it will play out or if theyll ever address it again there is definitely at least a rumor of targs being fireproof in the show and this trait being hereditary even if it is just a belief dany holds
gameofthrones,removed,the prophecy that he would bang a hot chick
gameofthrones,removed,what the fuck happened to neil marshall
gameofthrones,removed,lol
gameofthrones,removed,holy shit what if jaime is azor ahai plunges his sword into cersei during the seige of kl pulling it out covered in flames
gameofthrones,removed,some random salty fuck on the internet
gameofthrones,removed,forgive me but the first thing i thought of when i read your comment was jaime with a golden dildo hand
gameofthrones,removed,meh doubt that would be a big nono in the seven kingdoms or alabama
gameofthrones,removed,lfs power play was revealing what he wanted to her hes obviously going to be a big player right up until the end so expect his idea he planted in her to blossom into a plotline next season of course there is the possibility that dd fucked up his character horribly
gameofthrones,removed,i see lf as the most likely pick since that will tie in with what theyve set up so far
gameofthrones,removed,sir drago there is no one by that name in the show i think
gameofthrones,removed,fuckin helli would go gay for kit
gameofthrones,removed,being so dumb thag the point goes over your head by a mile
gameofthrones,removed,thats someone having a stroke while typing
gameofthrones,removed,this topic was better than i expected
gameofthrones,removed,the whole show just ends in the greatest porno ever
gameofthrones,removed,season ended days ago exactly how much have you read in those days there are what books each at least pages and youre days in and it all makes sense to you
gameofthrones,removed,if it exists there is porn of it
gameofthrones,removed,he has already fucked her along with nearly entire female cast fucking manlet
gameofthrones,removed,happy shitting
gameofthrones,removed,stop sniffling glue if you think there is any teleportation going around that isnt adequately explained by the show the green trial most likely happened months before dany sets sail with her full fleet the events of definitely took months to occur jamie at the twins those events happen then he travels to kl miles with an army miles per day so days green trail happens day and night olenna travels to dorne miles by land so days or miles by ship which would be days word gets to dany or varys travels to mereen miles or at least a month by ship each way assuming that varys sailed with a fleet of marteltyrell ships you dont need to add any additional time if you assume dany sailed to dorne and met the other ships there more likely then add another days onto the total time whether or not varys travels back to mereen is irrelevant because the information has to travel their either way i dont think there is any way to look at the information and think that the events of this episode didnt happen over many many months there is no teleporting
gameofthrones,removed,commenting without reading so hot right now
gameofthrones,removed,while linking to a porn sub is weird in itself here the subreddit doesnt even mean these kind of lips
gameofthrones,removed,i have no idea but it gets posted all the time
gameofthrones,removed,i would guess it would take brienne a month or so to get to winterfell from the twins people can move much faster than an army with wagons but they have much further to go so maybe at the same time i assume brienne will turn up in winterfell but i could be wrong on that point if she does show up that will give us more concrete dates and push the botb much sooner than we assume it happened now not enough information to know for sure but if cersei takes the throne im sure ravens would be sent in all directions and word of that would be spread very quickly however i feel that briennes quest north puts a soft limit on when the botb could happen well have to wait until next season to nail down this timeline a bit more
gameofthrones,removed,if jon is half targaryan they should bang while in flames
gameofthrones,removed,definitely they would have thrown in lines about the crazy woman taking the throne when they crowned jon kidn
gameofthrones,removed,brienne and pod are thousands of miles from winterfell how long would you expect it to take them to get there in a row boat and currently without horses the white walkers cant move past the wall so they arent slow at all just confined to an area i feel like youre just trolling though
gameofthrones,removed,totally agree i saw the changes in her expression as well all throughout that scene i got the vibe that the looks between sansa and littlefinger was more like shit maybe i really cant trust jon and see i told you so especially the way that jon in private was all like nah you take the master bedroom you saved us all with your knights of the vale and im not even a true stark then in public jon just so happily absorbed all the praise and made zero attempt at even mentioning sansa even the actors in that scene got that vibe game of thrones youtube channel actually publishes interviews after every episode as well in the one labeled episode king in the north kit mentions that he thinks jon is being oblivious to sansas feelings sophie turner talks about how sansa has always disliked jon because cat disliked jon and now shes agitated that shes getting no credit at all for all shes done even liam cunningham mentions that sansa might have a problem with jon being declared king in the north according to varietycom sophie turner did an interview where she described sansa as feeling like shes not getting the credit she deserves whats going through sansas mind in those final moments as jons being declared king in the north shes not getting the credit she feels she deserves that littlefinger would grant her with he obviously wants her on the iron throne and him by her side – she doesnt want that but she wants recognition for the effort that she put in in order to claim back winterfell because if it wasnt for her it wouldnt have happened so i think shes seeing littlefinger as a bit more trustworthy and more of an ally than she initially thought so im very surprised how many people think sansa was really happy in that scene
gameofthrones,removed,most costumes look like the porn versions of characters yours is a step up from that nice job
gameofthrones,removed,i believe that jon is a steward a fact that he was rather sore about
gameofthrones,removed,if you look like john snow you have an obligation to do got themed porn but then again arent there lots of john snow lookalikes

gameofthrones,removed,httpadultimgsitebvhgifv
gameofthrones,removed,this is a bit unrelated but just made a tribute video for the hound dont have enough karma to post but if anyone watches it and likes it would be much appreciated if u shared it
gameofthrones,removed,look up cologne new years rapes or how the paris attackers came from syria killed people
gameofthrones,removed,is it too much of a stretch to tie in the boy he follows downstairs they hit it pretty hard with lancel peering at him and the boy looking back a few times i was thinking it might be pointing to how lancel was used by everyone cercei in bed and for bobby ba murder and then manipulated by tyrion and then even by the high sparrow his childhood was so carelessly stolen from him so in following the little boy hes trying to find the boyhoodinnocence he never had which is made all the more vicious by the little boy himself being manipulated into becoming one of the littlebirdassassin kids while being too young himself to understand how messed up it is just a thought
gameofthrones,removed,i hope you dont post anyone that disagrees with you in rtherecordcorrected so they can be stalked brigaded and doxed like you usually do ok that is not good behavior and i am really tired of you doing it

gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,fake and gay
gameofthrones,removed,its still rude and hurtful to say it to him you dumbass
gameofthrones,removed,yes understanding that at least a small percent of any audience is made up of assholes i think the community that has grown around the books has been amazing and the majority are not making rude comments about him being a fat aging man that being said i think it is well within the rights of the community who loves the story to become impatient when deadlines are repeatedly missed and if the audience turns against him it is entirely his own doing
gameofthrones,removed,rfuckolly
gameofthrones,removed,given that he doesnt have much future in that department he should really look her up and legitimize the kid
gameofthrones,removed,i got a nice full screen popup of a giant cock cumming on a womans face with my phone repeatedly vibrating
gameofthrones,removed,some of you motherfuckers have way too much free time on your hands
gameofthrones,removed,its pretty heavily implied from adwd but youre no lord are you only reek not even a man truth be told and another youre dry as an old bone ramsay pulled his hand free and slapped her face i was told that youd know how to please a man was that a lie nno my lord i was ttrained ramsay rose the firelight shining on his face reek get over here get her ready for me for a moment he did not understand i do you mean mlord i have no i with your mouth lord ramsay said and be quick about it if shes not wet by the time im done disrobing i will cut off that tongue of yours and nail it to the wall
gameofthrones,removed,or tyrion imps delight wear your faults like armor only works for so long i think its really telling that even in his highest fantasy hes still viewed by others as an imp thats not healthy also he has no friends at all varys eh barely his father wanted him dead his sister wanted him dead hes viewed as a joke throughout the seven kingdoms married to sansa as a joke he feels an deep guilt for killing his mother and hes a dwarf and that physical difference keeps in disrespected pretty much anywhere he goes he murdered the only woman he ever loved after she sold him down the river during his trial and after finding out she was sleeping with his father who was at the time attempting to kill him and he murdered who he thinks is his own father i never thought i would say these words but im pretty sure alcohol is the only thing keeping him afloat hes happy about being danys hand he might have subconsciously talked himself into believing so but dany de jure is literally nothing he is the hand to a woman with boats and dragons thats all the fact that he can be that happy about a nameonlytitle is telling he has no reason to believe in people he has the slightest of holds over who he is and everyone hes ever loved or was supposed to love either hated him or viciously turned their back on him this all easily warrants wanting suicide when he walked into that dragon lair everyone cheered for his balls of steel but he didnt actually believe he was a dragon whisperer he just had nowhere else to go in his life the wastedaway alcoholic no one loves him no one cares deep inside he wanted a dragon to just end it all how poetic his favorite animal ending up killing him a losing all hope is freedom ending to his life that the intellect he is would have enjoyed hes not a badass hes just alienated and with nothing to lose so he just does fucking whatever and seeing what comes out the other end possibly the most disheartened character in the story it wasnt sudden traumas that beat tyrion but slowroasted deepstabbing traumas

gameofthrones,removed,i wonder if youd let me borrow your costume for an amateur film im making i promise to have it cleaned once weve finished with it by the way its for a game of thrones porno
gameofthrones,removed,stunt double would have cartwheeled out of the church before it blew up no problem
gameofthrones,removed,all of these miss a massive trick by not adding makeup some decent burn prosthetics for margaery would be more appropriate but then the person clearly just going for hot with that rack on show and more halloween instead of just a lookalike in a dress johns is pretty obvious and really simple this one would be the challenge and where it actually becomes cosplay for me
gameofthrones,removed,if the mountain smashed your face it would be considered it an improvement lol
gameofthrones,removed,rgayforoberyn
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,she needs a double for the scene in the season seven premiere where she rides the hell out of the explosion oops spoilers sorry
gameofthrones,removed,someone had to get engulfed in wildfire on her behalf pretty sure that is how stunts work
gameofthrones,removed,not spoilers glenn

gameofthrones,removed,so new pics of jon with the dragon props which might signal that a certain leak if you have seen it might very well legit
gameofthrones,removed,yall fukin
gameofthrones,removed,we already know one of these is true from leaked footage of the filming and sets sorry to burst your bubble
gameofthrones,removed,i read that as my god the titles titties and similarities are declining with each still applies i guess
gameofthrones,removed,who wouldnt blow up any natalie dormer
gameofthrones,removed,are you fucking blind its a good cosplay but theres no mistaking the original not as much as that margaery cosplay imo
gameofthrones,removed,ok thrice is enough please stop now
gameofthrones,removed,right i wouldnt fuck with olenna shes obviously someone to not mess with just ask joffrey haha
gameofthrones,removed,there is no end to blacks whining
gameofthrones,removed,i also noticed that the shows title is game of thrones and that the sky is blue
gameofthrones,removed,a marriageor at least a relationshipbetween the two is heavily foreshadowed in the books during danys little acid trip at the house of the undying
gameofthrones,removed,three mounts must you ride one to bed and one to dread and one to love her silver was trotting through the grass to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars a corpse stood at the prow of a ship eyes bright in his dead face grey lips smiling sadly a blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice and filled the air with sweetness mother of dragons bride of fire pretty clear interpretation in my eyes the silver horse represents drogo the smiling corpse on a ship represents victarioneuron and the blue flower growing from the wall is jon the mount to bed is drogo the mount to dread is a greyjoy and the mount to love is jon
gameofthrones,removed,a blue rose growing fro mthe chink on the wall of ice its in the bride of fire part heavily speculated to be about husbands partners or simply important people in her life but also important to add whole hotu section is from danys perspective what she will experienece saw or what wil she have to do so no word on jon there show on the other hand cut this out or any reference to it it seems unless i missed something in show version of it
gameofthrones,removed,rpunchablefaces
gameofthrones,removed,the gay boner
gameofthrones,removed,shes not a great actress but thats because shes actually a porn star
gameofthrones,removed,season was so awesome the final scene is just amazing
gameofthrones,removed,just like jon snow was not coming back
gameofthrones,removed,does anyone remember seeing a leaked photo from filming of varys speaking to shae not from season whatever happened to that scene
gameofthrones,removed,ollys lifeless eyes as he hung from the gallows
gameofthrones,removed,i thought next season was the last
gameofthrones,removed,chaosh ish a laddah
gameofthrones,removed,you just defeated yourself in your own post arthur dayne with dawn as confirmed by grrm would beat barristan fookin selmy who as you said is just as good as dayne which as you said is considered one of the most skilled swordfighters of all time obyren isnt near them despite as much as i like him dayne with dawn is pretty much batman with prep time
gameofthrones,removed,scheduler so pretty much youre saying how about we limit dayne so hes on oberyns level dawn is arthurs weapon of choice as the spear is for obyren you cant pick and choose
gameofthrones,removed,theres a porn parody where varys has a dick and bones cersei dont ask how i know that
gameofthrones,removed,but it can be a creepy no offense to your friend and if you were going to bang a young westerosi women id go after cersei meeeoooowww
gameofthrones,removed,man that finale was basically jerking you off for an entire hour then not letting you cum
gameofthrones,removed,what is your view of jaime lannister on a whole new to the show just binged seasons
gameofthrones,removed,but he did do some pretty terrible things mad king killing bran attempted murder why do you call him honorable
gameofthrones,removed,just a theory but could this be the remnants of the castle where leann stark gave birth to jon kinda looks like it from the steps that go up and the height
gameofthrones,removed,winter ain´t the only thing that´s cumming
gameofthrones,removed,youre an idiot
gameofthrones,removed,im ignoring it because its insignificant when youre putting him up against someone of daynes level you think he never fought and killed anyone with a spear before
gameofthrones,removed,id like to see bran ultimately become lord of winterfell and king in the north using his powers to try and keep the realm stable like bloodraven used to in kings landing id like to see jon sit on the iron throne although im not sure therell be an iron throne left by the time the story wraps up id definitely like to see theon sit on the salt throne and rule the iron islands with everything hes been through hes now a living embodiment of the phrase what is dead may never die i really think hes one of the few characters we have that will die of old age with a long life to look back on that feels like grrms style
gameofthrones,removed,alright bud im not gonna continue this conversation p
gameofthrones,removed,dayne swung a greatsword like it was nothing in the books he was the only man alive who could swing a greatsword like it was nothing have you even read the books to be talking about them
gameofthrones,removed,littlefinger falls off a ladder
gameofthrones,removed,shiny
gameofthrones,removed,contains spoilers from what i have read from the season spoilers dany gets her ass handed to her in multiple battles due to qyburn building something or euron greyjoy using his dragon controling artifact thing from the books after that jon tries to convince dany that the real enemy is the white walkers but she doesnt believe him jon then features beyond the wall with a group of people tormund davos gendry etc to capture a white walker and bring it to danycersei and hope to align them jon and his group end up getting attacked but dany comes and rescues them one of her dragons dies presumably the green one and the night king arises it to take down the wall then thats how the season ends spoilers can be unreliable and all that jazz but from it seems correct from what scenes the cast has finishedrecorded
gameofthrones,removed,oh my bad i meant they look to me
gameofthrones,removed,nothin better than cosplay hotter than the real thing
gameofthrones,removed,the tattoo was the spoiler congratulations you have a shitty tattoo for the rest of your life and everyone else is too nice to tell you otherwise deal withit
gameofthrones,removed,the first one is awesome do you happen to have storyboard of the nk on viserion
gameofthrones,removed,people had seen gendrys actor joe dempsy in the belfast at the time they are filming season so its looking optimistic that well have our awkward dose

gameofthrones,removed,i love jaime and yeah but he literally havent done anything wrong except to kill his own cousin he kills aerys ii saves the entire city he had to kill bran to protect his own children and his lover as you say its a terrible act but he had to do it
gameofthrones,removed,sometimes i wonder what itd be like to be one of the most attractive women ever
gameofthrones,removed,we dont know how much time jump there was between arya taking the milk of the poppy and lady cranes death it could have been a few hours or a few days for that matter
gameofthrones,removed,boo
gameofthrones,removed,oh my sweet summer child
gameofthrones,removed,everyone acts according to their character so you can almost predict how things play out when two characters meet jon snow having been reborn may be the wild card i think hes going to be more smart and less honorable at least i hope so
gameofthrones,removed,except the one with the nice bewbs
gameofthrones,removed,you missed jon
gameofthrones,removed,lovepopcardscom is launching a 🔥 new exclusive live facebook feed with a guest cohost who is a sword maker steel bender thing destructor and all around bad ass likes and ill post the link at noon est

gameofthrones,removed,haha no she actually almost missed her own proposal i had it planned out for nycc and she had to work and missed train so she arrived just in time for my plans i did spot one or two briannes at dragoncon i did the smile lol my gf wore the lord of bones costume during the dragoncon parade which i had made for a friend for nycc last year we plan to do stoick and valka from how to train your dragon for in addition to tormund video pinned on my twitter at httpwwwtwittercomkevinclose
gameofthrones,removed,nice to see everyone talking about the costumes and not the womans body oh wait this is reddit shes so hot look at how tight her clothes are camel haha
gameofthrones,removed,milf of dragons
gameofthrones,removed,why is that wine labeled as porn
gameofthrones,removed,ignore the guy who said low effort you took your kid to comic con and put effort into having costumes for him and yourself oh and also nice boobs
gameofthrones,removed,everyones thinking it
gameofthrones,removed,oh shit is that your wife as in your using some got vocabulary to say thats your khaleesi i didnt catch that at first pretty pretty clever there id apologize for calling your girl a boy but theres literally no way for me to know that in that dragon costume also drogon is a boy so thats your fault really and now that im assuming youre the husband im gonna say nice boobs
gameofthrones,removed,if it missed mate thats a fucking telephone pole with an erection those dont miss
gameofthrones,removed,yeah its floppy penis by primus
gameofthrones,removed,it was just a joke
gameofthrones,removed,tyrells armors are kind of parade type beautiful pieces but somehow i get the feeling that those are not very practical i just read about euron mother of god valyrian steel armor i want to see that on the show
gameofthrones,removed,one theory ive seen around a couple of places g arya or sansa will become lsh i think it will most likely be sansa maybe
gameofthrones,removed,got goes on a loop with the warging and brans greensight this post about the hound went on a loop hyped confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,hssssssssss
gameofthrones,removed,then old nan takes off her mask and its fucking ted on his way to bang aunt robin

gameofthrones,removed,what scene
gameofthrones,removed,this and this
gameofthrones,removed,not cotf but fetal
gameofthrones,removed,frey pie confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,thatd be a pretty big departure from the books i mean the story in the north is radically different in the show from the books but to drag ramsays rape baby into it just seems over the top not that i dont disagree i just dont like that they may be going there
gameofthrones,removed,im pretty sure i say that the she was ready to defend against attacks to other parts of her body and that the waifs strength surprised her but thanks for the canned response im sure that since it couldnt possibly be staged then it must have been jaqensyriodaariodavosbloodravenser pounce wearing the waifs face stabbing the waif wearing aryas face
gameofthrones,removed,ah so they do capture riverrun
gameofthrones,removed,then word it that way its not my fault you failed at communication you worded it in a way that sends the message that your friend is casual because he only watches the show and doesnt read the books in any case its irrelevant to mention that you have read the books all it does is make you come across as some douche who just has to mention that he is of some literary elite
gameofthrones,removed,they think its for keeping the wildlings out you heard how blindly bigoted randyll tarly was against wildlings and how his other son his favored son laughs at the idea of the others
gameofthrones,removed,people need to stop trying to make lsh happen shes not going to happen you can be gauranteed there would have been a leak that she was on set at this point weeks into the season
gameofthrones,removed,it probably sounds crazy but i think the clegane bowl is going to be metaphorical oh god what am i saying it has to be real get hype hear me out following on with the idea sandor has no motivation to go to kings landing and fight his brother i agree because i dont think it fits with his character development he seems to be shifting from asshole lapdogthug to force for good the last episode really laid out this new direction for him – this path of reform going off to fight zombiegregor would probably derail this and heres the thing he cant physically fight his brother he cant beat him through combat that man is dead zombiegregor is not his brother hes just a creation of qyburn an empty vessel that being said we all really want to see him beat or rather overcome the mountain so how can he do this well we know his brother burnt him terrorized him gave him his deepest fears his brother exerted power and control over him bullied him humiliated him scarred him left him a broken man his brother made him into the cruel person he was while working for the lannisters in that time he had no direction no pride no family escape from his own sense of worthlessness it must have been a sad life he had no true connection to those he worked for no sense of duty he had nothing he saw himself as nothing he hated his brother and he hated himself more his brother treated him like he deserved to suffer and the hound lived that reality arguably a way of beating his cruel brother would be to rise above – to escape – the kind of brutality that drove the mountain sandor could do this by retaking his power – by finding purpose loyalty a direction at the beginning of the last eisode he spoke of being driven by hate we could assume he meant gregor or perhaps brienne but i think he was actually referring to arya mirroring the way arya told jaqen she hated the hound and jaqen called her out on her lie why would he hate arya well she represented something he doesnt or didnt think he deserves because his brother taught him he was too worthless to deserve it love loyalty and family arya began to care about him and he hated her for it she wouldnt give up on him by letting him die and give up and he hated her for it in the last episode towards the end i think sandor began to see he actually might actually be someone worthy he began to see arya was right he began to want to fight for his life something that would give him some very solid character growth after fucking up the brotherhood is finding arya i think he began to feel a strong sense of love and friendship for arya if he ultimately devotes himself to helping her to being her loyal friend he could find that sense of family – and that in a sense would be beating down everything his brother was it would be a sort of clegane bowl – a fight where he overcomes the ghost of his brothers cruelty which left him a broken man and takes back some actual fucking happiness as a side now my tinfoil prediction is hell somehow find nymeria in the riverlands wholl somehow guide him back to arya hey a girl can dream but whatever it happens i think his future is arya i think hes tied to her now his new desire to give a shit about someone and himself is him regaining everything his brother took from him and more shes his family shes his clegane bowl
gameofthrones,removed,the spoiler scope of the thread is everything so literally everything is fair game here up to and including twow sample chapters
gameofthrones,removed,where are you getting your source for the cost of a life
gameofthrones,removed,i have to say its rather reminiscent of robb stark with his direwolfs head sewn onto his neck

gameofthrones,removed,what the fuck this looks terrible
gameofthrones,removed,literally take a step back and fuck your own face
gameofthrones,removed,theyll bang first and then howland reed or bran will tell them theyre related to which jon responds doesnt matter had sex
gameofthrones,removed,am i the only one who thinks the waif is sexy
gameofthrones,removed,id tell jaime not to bang his sister
gameofthrones,removed,then ramsay has a melsansa redhead threesome
gameofthrones,removed,my hype boner is so plump
gameofthrones,removed,milf island
gameofthrones,removed,see what happened was that syriostrant knew that arya might have become a prostitute to keep herself alive the too old was that he was trying to find her and the women being brought out were too old to be arya
gameofthrones,removed,you make valid points all the stuff on hand are pretty vague and implicit to start with especially the blinding scene however i only choose to believe that it is a hallucination because it seems likelier for me it just helps me sleep at night since i think of the faceless men as this secretive organization that thrive on deception somewhat in a lowfantasy kind of way where magic is very minimal and mostly depend on mental tricks to fulfill their mission surely the game of faces was for something furthermore i think at this point any answers regarding the blinding scene would actually answer most of the questions raised in the entire aryafm plotline it is borderline mindfuckery that scene exists and it raised more questions than it answers with the fm as for the glamour i realize that mel did and could maintain her glamour through potions this is possibly implied in the scene where selyse sees mel in a bath and acts all wideeyed when she sees mel selyse calms down after some melsplaining and a drop of a potion in the bath not explicit but still however we also cannot dismiss fully the effect of mels necklace could also be used for glamour if we know mel she only has three powers creating a demon baby resurrecting people and hiding her wrinkly self and all of them seem to be done with the necklace other than her potions if the necklace does give glamour magic then it can be safe to assume the faces too one thing to note from this is that the fm seems to be able to use all the kinds of magic maybe not the resurrection stuff though they possibly used hallucination on arya and they possibly used glamour in the blinding scene and also there is glamour magic in the masks themselves magic could very well be a technology or a tool and not bound to a god or anything hence the house of undying the fm and mel all can use parts of this technology with varying degrees of intensity or yes it could be bound to a god and since the fm worship most of them anyways and we have seen both instances of magic being used by the fm as for the last point i just dont see it that way what about the masks that arya and waif has to use the masks are very clearly shown to be taken off from the wall by arya also both arya and waif are clearly taking on and off something from their faces hence clearly demonstrating they are physically objects if the faces are sacred they dont seem to be shown in the show since they mostly are treated as mere tools your proposal seems possible if we do get to see other faceless men which in the show so far have only been arya waif and jaqen and possibly the bald dudes who carried the bodies
gameofthrones,removed,based on current play i expect or more of different photos in separate posts and a tidy slide show post a day later i am concerned they are real spoilers since they wouldnt bother with such a noticeable suit unless we were supposed to see it i am equally concerned it is a desperate level of hype since only yesterday jaqen was arya now he is extra and no one is going with him being the waif all along
gameofthrones,removed,this scene makes sooooo much more sense today than it did back then when it aired seems like hes basically saying jon ned did what he had tobut youre my relative just as much as you are his
gameofthrones,removed,r l j confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,i miss aemon
gameofthrones,removed,off screen
gameofthrones,removed,its not him one of the trailers showed ramsay looking at the burning bodies on the battlefield
gameofthrones,removed,oh no im just on asos i was moved by jaimes evolution posthumiliation with brienne i want at least one character to demonstrate an evolution from egobased to compassionate damn
gameofthrones,removed,ead olly ya bish
gameofthrones,removed,faux sansas bewbs
gameofthrones,removed,others take you olly ya little bitch boi
gameofthrones,removed,no shame in wanting to see that
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think theres any rlj this episode young neds actor appears in the season finale and other than the i promise thing i dont see what hed be doing im hoping for harrenhall tho
gameofthrones,removed,😛
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think theyre gonna make cersei be nearly as crazy as she is in the books theyre basically two different characters at this point and i dont see them making her turn insane at this point if they were they would have started earlier
gameofthrones,removed,dude is dead
gameofthrones,removed,i do agree that perhaps the show hasnt given the direwolves as much service as they deserve but in the books i believe that apart from shaggydog and lady all of the direwolves are at least somewhat important to the story obviously in varying degrees or at least mentioned a fair bit in the books a lot of the warging that bran does is through summer and all over westeros b theres stories of a strange pack of wild dogs running through the woods led by one exceptionally large dog who we assume to be nymeria even greywind gets what i would consider to be some exceptional book time considering that robb isnt even a pov character but admittedly he is mentioned less than the others i think saying that grrm treats them like fodder may be a bit unfair
gameofthrones,removed,yep im a couple episodes away from finishing season and i just know something bad will happen to robb like his marriage to the walder girl will distract him from his inevitable march south you cant go into this show expecting everything to go according to plan
gameofthrones,removed,high sparrow is not a villain
gameofthrones,removed,if charlotte hope myranda was born on october and she appeared first nude in the bear and the maiden fair which aired around may wasnt she underage during that scene around year and months when it aired so a bit younger when they filmed it
gameofthrones,removed,in the books he has already written cercei off and his arc towards redemption is moving forward for some unknown reason he remains at cerceis side in the show he does kind of but nothing like he was and i think its changed so gradually that how the relationship has changed has slipped under the radar a little ive just started rewatching from the beginning and the difference is quite marked he may not have turned away from her completely but their relationship is not nearly as obsessive as it was
gameofthrones,removed,also because the majority of american actors are terrible
gameofthrones,removed,i wish melissandre had also revived olly just for jon to hang again little cunt
gameofthrones,removed,no hes going to riverrun in the show but the timing is different i think hes going to go in episode
gameofthrones,removed,you find out later bran influenced the choices that were made and thus ultimately killed his father
gameofthrones,removed,theyre returning to river run and jamie is going to be there this season
gameofthrones,removed,this is actually the worst part about the showthey are only doing this so that they dont have to divide screentime between jaime and cerseisame is the case with brienne and sansait saves valuable time for the showlsh character was eschewed for this very reason
gameofthrones,removed,arya has no problem killing people and has done so multiple times in the books she does kill the waif and she isnt that waffled by it either
gameofthrones,removed,you say that as if they had a sex scene or something also their stuff is all shot in either spain or northern ireland age of consent would be

gameofthrones,removed,why do people post this crap no one cares that your wife is and a half years behind the rest of the world no one cares that she is watching a tv show for the first time or that she gets wet watching sean bean
gameofthrones,removed,oh yeah my comment was confusing i just meant i hadnt reached that juncture yet in the books so this was a question in my mind that was still wide open i read the comment i responded to the same way im just so disappointed that showjamie wont demonstrate the same sort of evolution many many people only watch the series
gameofthrones,removed,yeah i think jaimes character arc is something grrm and dd have to have discussed a lot so any turns he takes in the show probably mirrors something from the books maybe something does happen to myrcella in the books and in his desperation he hangs on to the love he has for cersei i dont think in the books he actually ever stops to love her he just rationalizes how destructive she is and distances himself
gameofthrones,removed,clearly you dont watch enough porn
gameofthrones,removed,on this sub ive read recently that sam dies i know i shouldnt click on threads marked everything but this is honestly the first time anything has been spoiled for me

gameofthrones,removed,buddhism doesnt fit neatly into either category of religion or philosophy when people asked buddha what he was teaching he said he teaches the way things are he said nobody should believe his teachings out of faith but instead they should examine for themselves to see if they are true or not not everything is black and white some things are more complex than what human society labels it
gameofthrones,removed,get a life loser
gameofthrones,removed,ive seen a lot of people say that the past few days asking what she accomplished she became the queen just like she said she would what more did people expect her to do bar try and maintain that power she learned how to somewhat control joffrey or at least distract him enough to diffuse tense situations when no one else could like their wedding feast she had tommen wrapped around her finger before their betrthal was even formalised she was relentlessly good at ascending to queenhood and playing her part whatever it was at any given moment multiple times we see her understand present dangers faster than those around her not least of which was her final moments sure she had olenna on her side but all the key players had someone who had their back with more experience even when she was completely caught off guard with the faith she managed to play her way out of the dungeons and bring them on side too to maintain her reign she was always astute clever nakedly ambitious and could play most people like a fiddle all while being not much older than sansa and maintaing a relatively warm and kind disposition compared to pretty much all the other power hungry major players i can totally get if someone didnt like her but she was easily objectively one of the best players its just that cersei flipped the board
gameofthrones,removed,guzzle a mods cum
gameofthrones,removed,one of magaerys only mistakes let to her death so unfortunate yet it just proves even more how the game of thrones is a dangerous game and that any mistake could be devastating
gameofthrones,removed,in the books stannis and tommen are both claiming storms end as its rightful heirs but in the show its now presumably under the control of cersei who could elevate a loyal lord but im doubtful it will even be addressed the stormlands seem to be out of the count for the remainder of the story and will likely abide by whatever outcome
gameofthrones,removed,years since ned died rip
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,im willing to bet a few hundred bucks that there will be more than one book after winds of winter we have a fundamental outline of the story and it has something similar to major acts the first act ended with robb dying took books the second one would end with jon taking winterfell that has taken books but hasnt happened yet the third act would probably end with a truce with the others and its supposed to be the most massive fight in the book along with it concluding a large number of open threads and plots it simply cant be done in the books that are left assuming grrm writes the same way he used to the aegon storyline alone seems to be about as complex as robbs storyline
gameofthrones,removed,youre the kind of guy whod complain about getting a blow job while playing lol
gameofthrones,removed,heres me sat on it i never could find gandalfs sword until now thanks

gameofthrones,removed,jorah couldnt even keep his head bowed related though wonder how greyscale impacts ones ability to get an erection
gameofthrones,removed,the only question that matters was it really her tits or was it a body double
gameofthrones,removed,i was certain when she reached into his pants she would rip it off or at least injure it painfully
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,i choose not to listen to anyone say that was a body double or cgi im not scrutinizing hard enough to notice so to me that looked just like a naked daenerys my penis approved

gameofthrones,removed,shit she gave grey worm a boner and hes a fucking eunuch
gameofthrones,removed,kill baelish after you take whatever information and money you can get from him the vale that the boltons are dicks and support the queen or king of the north other northern houses will be mirin and suddenly start switching sides to support the guy who doesnt skin people alive the dothraki fight your wars and profit from beating gold coins out of the harpy supporters like theyre fucking sonic the hedgehog profit remind the people of kings landing who has money sort of and swords
gameofthrones,removed,this is not trolling you stupid fuck
gameofthrones,removed,thats some good kush they smoked
gameofthrones,removed,most likely use himself as a martyr we saw in the trailers that jaime will begin to lead the lannister forces so i dont think that a confrontation will take place in kings landing just yet i dont see how they would work together if the sparrow causes a civil war than the forces will move to keep order in the city and not away as was suggested
gameofthrones,removed,too busy cumming hard here
gameofthrones,removed,she didnt
gameofthrones,removed,she didnt its her
gameofthrones,removed,and naked actually kind of proud emilia clarke went all out did the damn thing

gameofthrones,removed,anyone have any gifs or stills i love some emilia clarke nudity
gameofthrones,removed,i too missed danys ass
gameofthrones,removed,she has too much on her plate this season to to that after they take back winterfell she is going south to fill lady stonehearts role and have revenge of the red wedding ii
gameofthrones,removed,lmao tormund is gonna bang brienne
gameofthrones,removed,why was the removed is she your gf 😂😂😂
gameofthrones,removed,a quick search of your history shows you are a strong proponent of the northern conspiracy theory not surprised
gameofthrones,removed,please let her young tits be as nice as mellisandres
gameofthrones,removed,that is this entire show female empowerment female empowerment at the contrast of male weakness everywhere its getting very old tbh
gameofthrones,removed,i read all those titties at first and thought fair enough
gameofthrones,removed,just finished watching the episode of season got this entire season portrays men as weak morons and women with magical powers and political prowess even lord commander jon snow seems to be under the control of sansa theon is a broken eunuch under asha greyjoys thumb cersei controls the small council the king and even kevin lannister dannygirl kills the khal and has the dothraki bowing to her robin arryn is portrayed still as a pussy mamas boy the sand snakes control dorne ser loras a knight who is actually quite skilled in battlealthough gay cant withstand the torture of the high sparrow but margaery somehow can it seems to me that since the show has now gone past the books for source material the writers have been pushing this subtle feminist propaganda since they have such a large audienceand of course this is on hbo but the storyline is getting quite sloppy and anyone can see this antimale sentiment a mile away if you really look
gameofthrones,removed,this cant be his boner levels over
gameofthrones,removed,so long as she doesnt have a dick im up for as many shadow babies as she can handle ehhh no baby but the necklace back on and dim those fucking lights
gameofthrones,removed,her tits must be at her knees
gameofthrones,removed,rlj has been spoiled on every corner of the internet
gameofthrones,removed,the erection that was promised
gameofthrones,removed,i just liked her tits
gameofthrones,removed,i think its heavily implied that they bang in the books not sure though its been a while
gameofthrones,removed,vagina poosay
gameofthrones,removed,no
gameofthrones,removed,i think none of dothraki warlords wanted to get up after the first lamp went over because they had awkward boners
gameofthrones,removed,a couple of niggerfaggots thrown in for good measure wouldve really sealed the deal
gameofthrones,removed,bastard bowl in the north featuring the vale tyrells vs jesus freaks in kings landing dothrakiunsullied vs slavers bay except tyrion tried to be diplomatic with them tower of joy and apparently more about the white walkers as well arya becomes one of the faceless men oh and the iron islands
gameofthrones,removed,in college we call those abortions
gameofthrones,removed,one thing i didnt like about this was that in the old game of thones anything could have happened in that scene in the new game of thrones it was obvious that was going to happen
gameofthrones,removed,her titles i read this as titties
gameofthrones,removed,flash sweat is a bullshit coward pyromancy dany confirmed to have leveled dex
gameofthrones,removed,agreed after about five seasons of her walking around this was refreshing hopefully fire tits will sail to westeros and go mad queen on some white walkers
gameofthrones,removed,her bewbs are enough to make most mortals bow in awe
gameofthrones,removed,boner level
gameofthrones,removed,going to put me at boner level so youll be growing strong
gameofthrones,removed,but u need the bad poosy
gameofthrones,removed,his boner level its over nine oh sorry carry on
gameofthrones,removed,milf
gameofthrones,removed,you condescending fuck explain to me the intricacies that were laid down this episode because it was pretty clear cut and hit you over the head type writing its just that a majority of it was pointless and only a couple things advanced plot
gameofthrones,removed,question was that all cgi or was that actually emilia clarke naked need to know for research
gameofthrones,removed,that scene gave me a boner and i didnt even notice they were showing her tits since i was watching on airplane wifi her fucking smirk as she burned them all wow mad king like
gameofthrones,removed,barristan had the record for a single person getting the most people to reach for their swords until tonights episode
gameofthrones,removed,high sparrow cersei is a milf
gameofthrones,removed,these red priestesses are really fucking sexy until they take their necklaces off and no i dont care if thats not what actually gives them the illusion of a younger age
gameofthrones,removed,looks like this episode might actually deliver
gameofthrones,removed,we know whos gonna champion the faith and it aint lancel get hype
gameofthrones,removed,thanks seriously im here wondering if i went unconscious for some nude jon scene
gameofthrones,removed,i mean if i were in the got universe id still hit it safe word is no the necklace stays on its kinda the same reason why with ugly girls you only do it from behind except with melisandre its her whole body not just her face
gameofthrones,removed,well i guess it was just too confusing for the show only watchers to understand that dany isnt immune to fire so fuck it lets just boost that plot armor up to also im starting to see this season as a great big apology to female fans for last season apparently every male character is actually completely useless this season without a woman to tell him what to do christ i fucking hate dany in the books for not ever suffering from her constant bad decisions so what to they do to rectify this in the show make her even more insufferable im so happy the show is officially saying fuck the books now so i can still hold out hope that dany gets what she deserves in the books a sword through the chest
gameofthrones,removed,i dont really give a shit what his character is in the books if you want to talk about the books there is a subreddit for it they are independent from eachother and something said in one does not apply to the other
gameofthrones,removed,meh tits and cgi the salt to disguise weak story telling
gameofthrones,removed,red bitches be errwhere open your boxes you get a red bitch you get a red bitch everybody gets red bitches
gameofthrones,removed,only my boner level will be over
gameofthrones,removed,overall it was a mixed bag this week all the stuff at the wall was great as usual but im really starting to hate the high sparrow segments i was so happy to see the jon and sansa reunion and i thought nothing could destroy itand then dany happened dany is without a doubt the worst part of the books so what does the show do make her more intolerable of course god shes the only character i want to skip in the books and shes my bathroom breaks in the show unfortunately i sat through her scenes this time and it destroyed the episode for me i got so fucking tired arguing with show watchers that she wasnt immune to fire and then the show goes and makes her immune to fire and asphyxiation apparently god damn it she still cant seem to ever suffer any consequences for her actions i really wish that scene had gone the way it would have in the books if she ever had things go wrong for her in the books as well she would have first burned her hand in the fire then while she was still being stupid shed push over the fire then burn to death with the rest that is the only time id enjoy one of her chapters
gameofthrones,removed,best seller in asshai the wonder necklace just like the wonder bra but with less pressure on your tits
gameofthrones,removed,youre not a comic reader are you
gameofthrones,removed,how about her just being a hot priestess
gameofthrones,removed,to me
gameofthrones,removed,ill bring the gamecube and big black dildo
gameofthrones,removed,priss in boots
gameofthrones,removed,sexy lady trees are no longer sexy
gameofthrones,removed,this entire is a girl power trip they killing all the old cis white men
gameofthrones,removed,volongtits
gameofthrones,removed,you want a good girl but you need the bad pussy
gameofthrones,removed,there is no faegon in the show and thank goodness for that his reveal would take away the shine of jon being a targ
gameofthrones,removed,and thats how corruption in washington happens too with blind devotion
gameofthrones,removed,the giver of fap material
gameofthrones,removed,the last scene how did the dothraki that couldnt see daenerys exit the building know she was there and that they should kneel perilously close to a burning building
gameofthrones,removed,ugh suck a dick
gameofthrones,removed,well hes only half targ maybe thats why
gameofthrones,removed,am not sure what jons idea of a vacation is i mean i understand his attitude but if he thinks he can live a peaceful life where he doesnt have to fight he came back delusional the white walkers are coming from the north there will be war in the south and the boltons and lannisters want him and his sister deadhed have to fight whether he wants to or not but if its as you say and he lost his courage to fight then i dont see the point of bringing him back he must have an important role and he must at some point take the lead back again and regain confidence
gameofthrones,removed,because not all targs are immune to fire in fact in the book none of them are dany only survived the fire because of blood magic
gameofthrones,removed,butthurtedness detected youre a sheepish dickwad who tends to watch melissa mccarthy movies and actually enjoy it im a bot this dank retort was automatically generated have a problem i dont give a shit
gameofthrones,removed,you and me both
gameofthrones,removed,the tits that were promised
gameofthrones,removed,it would be a nice way for theon to make amends but for that to happen asha has to be crowned the next queen of the iron islands that doesnt happen in the books at least i think euron will claim that positions and the kingsmoot will elect him why else has he been introduced and killed his brother
gameofthrones,removed,boobs finally
gameofthrones,removed,jorah be like those bewbs were definitely different from what i remember khaleesi
gameofthrones,removed,daenerys tits just made jon snow season second biggest return
gameofthrones,removed,lol so suddenly we can only base on ones actions and rumours that made it to the screen in order to get to know a character just get out already
gameofthrones,removed,fucking bitch i hope she dies a horrible death
gameofthrones,removed,any word on if danys boobs were cgi like cerceis walk of shame last season
gameofthrones,removed,robin was trying so hard to be as good as
gameofthrones,removed,to be fair i wanted rosie mac to be her nude doublesadly she wasnt
gameofthrones,removed,i thought i was immune after six years but those impeccable sooty tits
gameofthrones,removed,swagina
gameofthrones,removed,there were tits in the end
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,just you wait
gameofthrones,removed,what you got the censored version
gameofthrones,removed,pretty sure that was cus it was a body double
gameofthrones,removed,confirmed real by her in an interview
gameofthrones,removed,meanwhile autistic kid is all like oh look a falcon lets do what uncle p says
gameofthrones,removed,please clap
gameofthrones,removed,prepare to be horribly upset tormund dies in the bastardbowl as does wun wun
gameofthrones,removed,it would have been odd coming from shaes actress she was a porn star afterall
gameofthrones,removed,maybe their cycles all syncd
gameofthrones,removed,imo this is just some equality bs that the shows directorsproducers are shoving down the viewers throats john went from the badass leader to the coward who wants to run away and the sister being the bad ass leader now
gameofthrones,removed,anyone else got triggered by ramsays apple peeling skills
gameofthrones,removed,damn does he arrive in the north super quick
gameofthrones,removed,what wasnt plausible was the roof beams crashing down after about seconds from the fire starting and the khals making no attempt to take dany down with them still that last shot was the most proud confident naked woman ive seen outside of porn and it was awesome
gameofthrones,removed,it could have been a good line if not the retarded quip afterwards went from an almost according to stannis baratheon jaime has fell on you too repeatedly tier line to a cheesy dumb diss
gameofthrones,removed,wow i posted this like a week ago and it got deleted for being a repost seriously
gameofthrones,removed,and yet feminists still complain about this show even when the only strong characters left are all women
gameofthrones,removed,we see in the trailer sansa in a room with mormont banners behind her so i think its pretty safe to say that they will join their side
gameofthrones,removed,theyre all killed
gameofthrones,removed,any reason you didnt respond to uneedanusername s comment dont like being wrong cunt
gameofthrones,removed,this is all me all proud all strong that aint no body double shots fired lena headey
gameofthrones,removed,this is some quality shit fucking post send this fucking shit back to tumblr you cunt
gameofthrones,removed,the bastard the gay boy and then dick less boy
gameofthrones,removed,no offense though but this is literal shit like holy fuck man how could you post this garbage anywhere
gameofthrones,removed,tormund is going to bang brienne
gameofthrones,removed,now jorahs got grey worm
gameofthrones,removed,i was wondering if she used a body double but i could pick those tits out of a lineup soguess not
gameofthrones,removed,hate to be that guy but this theory isnt new you just explained the very popular rlj theory thats been talked about a lot now you explained much better than most ive seen though so props to you
gameofthrones,removed,alright cunt
gameofthrones,removed,the mad king aerys ii was never in love with lyanna it was rhaegar targaryen but if someone was to know the secret it would be howland reed there also doesnt have to be a mystery man because i think that bran will find out and somehow relay the message to jon
gameofthrones,removed,i like my boobs grown locally not those shitty import boobs
gameofthrones,removed,funny you should mention that because i went from to midnight
gameofthrones,removed,those actually looked like childrenlike entities but these ive seen some comments there debating whatever or not theyd be up to bang them i wouldnt t they kinda scary
gameofthrones,removed,it took episodes outside the canon story to become a feminists wet dream
gameofthrones,removed,the thirst is strong
gameofthrones,removed,the night is dark and full of boobies
gameofthrones,removed,cant forget the cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,no one is talking about how blatantly feminist this episode was it was all just showing how weak all the men are and how strong the women are who chastise them weak jon snow vs strong sansa weak loras vs strong margary weak khalasars vs strong daenerys weak theon vs strong yara weak tommen vs strong cersei weak davos vs strong brienne weak robin but mother is gone to scold him not to mention the men of dorne got killed by women in the last couple of episodes it all seems its become one big message for girl power
gameofthrones,removed,the theory you just discovered has been common for years and its often discussed here at this point its basically accepted as the story
gameofthrones,removed,i heard tormund eats poosay like he eats chicken
gameofthrones,removed,thanks for pointing this out im sure the feminists will not make a huge deal out of this
gameofthrones,removed,im perfectly fine with it
gameofthrones,removed,ramsey wins snow bowl robert strong wins cleganebowl high sparrow sits on throne gendrys boat capsizes
gameofthrones,removed,basically tyrion is giving the masters the best deal available the slavers are very wise when it comes to their own selfinterest they recognize that if slavery were to be abolished immediately it would most likely mean war and countless casualties on their end with the offer they can still have slavery for years and are able to adjust to not having slavery rather than having to change overnight
gameofthrones,removed,could be hiw sad a time this is that we have to give in to some of their shit at all
gameofthrones,removed,i mean littlefinger pretty much is a woman sneaky conniving always trying to avoid confrontation always dressed nicer than most of the people in the room and if you dont like that explanation then robyn is pretty much a little bitch too and he ha all the power in that scene over royce
gameofthrones,removed,get warm more evidence to support rlj
gameofthrones,removed,no story with a naked emilia clarke can be considered awful ok maybe terminator genysis but this story has dragons
gameofthrones,removed,i agree shes essentially powerless
gameofthrones,removed,its going to failfuck up the plan is to rescue m before her walk of atonement which was set before cerseis trial ie cleganebowl if cleganebowl is still gonna happen the tyrels rescuecrush the faith militant attempt must fail
gameofthrones,removed,whats the difference between racism and dothraki racism has many faces
gameofthrones,removed,could you
gameofthrones,removed,well then fuck your government i vote for boobs
gameofthrones,removed,i personally like the theory that rhaegar was azor ahai lyanna was nissa nissa and jon is lightbringer
gameofthrones,removed,he tried again with a citation needed vat of pigs blood it was the heart of a lion not pigs blood which could be foreshadowing for jon needing killing a lannister before killing his nissa nissa
gameofthrones,removed,test post
gameofthrones,removed,theme of this episode grrrrl rule fuck continuity what sublime creative genius came up with this idea also pay special attention to the warpdrive that brienne is carrying under her armor and mostly dumb and unsophisticated dialogue throughout the episode
gameofthrones,removed,what the fuck spoilers holy shit
gameofthrones,removed,it has been many moons since she was naked he was patiently waiting for this moment
gameofthrones,removed,and dont forget hype train all aboard horns boats and hoes ships and wenches
gameofthrones,removed,prostitutes midway outdoor dothraki sex and finally denys fire scene at the end
gameofthrones,removed,abort fap abort
gameofthrones,removed,how dare he leak such an important plot point
gameofthrones,removed,many things must happen before the battle sansa isnt leaving castle black in episode then if shes in episode that could be the start of her gathering other lords to support her plus not all characters must appear in every episode so it wouldnt be difficult to prolong a story arc also the full episode battles have always been in the final episodes of the season but even if it that wasnt good enough proof for you you really think they would set what the creators of the show have called the biggest battle yet for the middle of the season
gameofthrones,removed,yeah this in his original query of game of thrones it said that arya and jon would have a weird incest relationship until he discovers his real parentage it also said winds of winter was the title of his third and final book of the series
gameofthrones,removed,why would ramsay care i know he demands him back in the books but he has gotten everything out of theon that he needs sansa is way more important at this point theon is just a broken down cunt who is hated in the north as well as his own home no one cares about theon
gameofthrones,removed,i too am cumming
gameofthrones,removed,while remembering the lemon tree that clearly establishes her parentage as rl right
gameofthrones,removed,weve got set photo leaks of the hornwoods with the mormonts their banners are seen in the trailer as well
gameofthrones,removed,id be curious to see what the fine folks over at rthedonald think of this
gameofthrones,removed,i never used to find sansa attractive but goddamn how thats changed
gameofthrones,removed,more like tv producers shamelessly pandering toward a female demo and ignoring everything thats gone before
gameofthrones,removed,a sister that pressures you to fight another suicidal invasion when youre fed the fuck up with fighting and being killed and then she gets praised as a powerful strong independent woman for pressuring you a broken beaten murdered man to keep fighting her battles yeah real female empowerment this feminism stuff is so consistent
gameofthrones,removed,if yara does end up becoming queen about that
gameofthrones,removed,i feel like those are the last words walder frey needs to hear even though hes a piece of shit ramsay did in fact take back winterfell from the iron born and he married a stark technically he isnt really a traitor
gameofthrones,removed,did i tell you how you look like youre mother also i wanted to bang your mother
gameofthrones,removed,to be fair if r l j turns out to be true it would be more cersei and lancel
gameofthrones,removed,maybe youll be the first women to rule the ironborn or maybe not aeron damphair i wouldnt hold your breath
gameofthrones,removed,implying more gilf action i like it
gameofthrones,removed,waitarent all the kings mel mentioned in the leech scene dead
gameofthrones,removed,what is dead may never die but rises again harder and stronger
gameofthrones,removed,but were those her reals boobs or was she doing the body double thing again thats the real question in all of this
gameofthrones,removed,boner level is the default for all of jamies scenes
gameofthrones,removed,did they create the composite by hand or did they use computers to generate the image
gameofthrones,removed,oh of course cuz ramsay is a piece of shit just saying that in present day just having sex with her would be rape if she said no even if theyre married whereas in westeros they both mutually agreed to getting married which entails having sex on the wedding night so having sex that night even if she didnt want it would not be considered rape
gameofthrones,removed,and an erection
gameofthrones,removed,im waiting for the rlj to resolve and jon turning to sansa and saying we arent related
gameofthrones,removed,we make peace not with our friends but with our enemies
gameofthrones,removed,i never watched got until today yes i live in a hobbit hole under a rock felt attached to the characters after episode im on the last episode of season now this show is pretty engaging also s fuck joffrey
gameofthrones,removed,make a hot pie shirt
gameofthrones,removed,hopefully not sexually
gameofthrones,removed,too cold to speak
gameofthrones,removed,dont be sorry just trying to make sure you understand where i am coming from
gameofthrones,removed,or she finally realises that being the ruler of westeros is a mans job
gameofthrones,removed,oh i agree with you percent but i think incest is a horrible way to join our heroes if yall dont see something wrong with that then i dont know what else to say
gameofthrones,removed,no you just cant articulate an argument
gameofthrones,removed,incest is fine by me for jamie and cersei but not jon and dany jon and dany are supposed to be good guys while jamie is just now abandoning cersei in his mind and starting in the path to righteousness away from nasty shit like fucking your own sister all f that other stuff is fine by me even incest like i said w jamie and cersei jon and dany are supposed to be better than that plus as i have stated this whole time i dont want incest as our skewed happy ending
gameofthrones,removed,dont talk about your sister that way
gameofthrones,removed,says the incest fanboy who cant articulate a decent argument
gameofthrones,removed,the fact that you even bothered to reply in the first place your only rebuttal being i dont care and your cop out of trying to end the debate with indifference shows how little you know and how little thought you put into presenting your side of the argument
gameofthrones,removed,of course you are wrong what are you smoking got fans at least star wars fans are marginally better luckly for us got fans or people in general no one cares about what the fuck you think
gameofthrones,removed,im not your bruh you fucking troglodyte
gameofthrones,removed,everyone can stop reminding me that its only a tv show and not real life earth doesnt change the fact that myself like most normal people would never be able to unsee that disgusting blemish of fucking your aunt on one of the best characters of all time in one of the best stories of all time nobody liked vincent and mary in godfather because they were incestuous in fact nobody liked the movie as a whole because of the incest jon and dany getting together is going to turn a lot of people off in the end and i cant see how anyone can disagree with that
gameofthrones,removed,i found it gross and cheesy luke and leia but hey im a fucked up closed minded person for being grossed out by incest right
gameofthrones,removed,now your creating arguments where they dont exist i have a problem when the main characters engage in incest thats not stannis way
gameofthrones,removed,you trying to troll i created trolling fuckouttahere amateur
gameofthrones,removed,this will answer most of your questions except ifwhy he would have died anyway
gameofthrones,removed,hes got a great right hand in this gif
gameofthrones,removed,bad pooosi are you suggesting she has a dry poosey
gameofthrones,removed,then his wife threw her titties in my hand
gameofthrones,removed,its near chicago
gameofthrones,removed,lord royce is not a northman though hes from the vale and its pretty much demonstrated that everyone south of the neck sees the wall mostly as that place to get rid of your criminals and lastborn sons and not really as a barrier against wilding raiding parties let alone walkers i think that is ops point lord royce would probably not have been so outspoken against the wildlings if his son hadnt died there
gameofthrones,removed,anyone else think the season ones were the best made her look the best fuck the symbolism or whatever
gameofthrones,removed,hodor
gameofthrones,removed,i liked daenerys better in season when she was a submissive pretty picture perfect targaryen princess now shes just like a manwoman barbarian with strong feminist agenda undertones especially in that scene with yara another manwoman
gameofthrones,removed,rofl okay matie kill yourself
gameofthrones,removed,chaos chaosh ish the ladda but seriously he may die before the ww come into play if you havent read the books there is a kind of foreshadowing regarding little finders death in winterfell i dont remember exactly but i think it was the ghost of high heart who foreshaded him killed by s
gameofthrones,removed,not at all cersei is an example of a well executed character who is literally sitting on the iron throne right now and has all the power in the world cersei is the perfect character her gender literally does not matter daenerys just feels like feminist pandering did you watch that speech with yara what the fuck was that
gameofthrones,removed,its not the lesbian thing at all i have no problems with that its that little quip something along the lines of its about time westeros has a female leader men suck its the new era women should be in charge which is almost as jarringly liberal as a jon oliver segment in addition it sounds awfully like a vote for hillary ad especially because of when the episode was released dany has never had much character she orders people and things around but never gets her own hands dirty the show keeps rehashing the emerge from fire unburnt scene because that is the only way dd can show her defeating enemies without the help of her dragons her moral compass is stupid oh i have to abolish slavery because thats sooooooooo bad but my dothraki army is going to rape and pillage half of westeros and idgaf
gameofthrones,removed,like omar on the wire
gameofthrones,removed,rnazisympathizer rmisunderstoodnazis rnaziscience
gameofthrones,removed,like the cotf they totally wanna bang jon too
gameofthrones,removed,therefore the fact that her last surviving son jumped from probably one of if not the highest window in the red keep makes it quite ironic to me so basically you dont understand the concept of irony and think it is just a synonym for any sort of interesting coincidence
gameofthrones,removed,it already came just like ur dad when i fucked his ass
gameofthrones,removed,i think so but its possible that she thought he did it but didnt have any evidence so she simply fabricated the evidence in a fit of rage similarly to how she did with joffrey and aryas wolf
gameofthrones,removed,davos is wellsuited to be hand im not sure if hed be a good king i think hed be a little too easy to disrespect hes got too much humility
gameofthrones,removed,it is probably one of the most popular shows in american history you shitwit do everyone who knows you a favor and drink a tall glass of undiluted bleach d
gameofthrones,removed,pics from set of show jaime with it
gameofthrones,removed,thats the thing you love to hate them and yeah tywin is a great character
gameofthrones,removed,lothar draws a knife and repeatedly stabs the pregnant talisa in the stomach killing her unborn child talisa collapses to the ground as chaos surrounds robb is shot by the musicians with crossbows several times and falls to the ground numerous other stark men are killed by the crossbow bolts catelyn is shot by one of the musicians in the back and falls to the ground
gameofthrones,removed,hes on my list of silver fox celebs i want to bang
gameofthrones,removed,aww i wanna sleep with him
gameofthrones,removed,this is soooo exciting except that sean bean will only be in it for the first season oh well i wish i had taken it that easily
gameofthrones,removed,post was dv but all the comments are uv i dont understand you guys
gameofthrones,removed,you are all nerds
gameofthrones,removed,well spoiler that is the exact ending of the game
gameofthrones,removed,kit harrington is so hot
gameofthrones,removed,i am so glad joel couldnt do it i loved that girl by the end human race be damned
gameofthrones,removed,you should have dressed as her from that scene when she gave birth to the shadow baby
gameofthrones,removed,the red wedding for obvious reasons the episodes featuring tyrions trial for tyrions speech oberyns visit to tyrions cell when he volunteers to be his champion the trial by combat
gameofthrones,removed,sigh its honestly kinda gross
gameofthrones,removed,nonbook reader here bold prediction tommen is executed by the high sparrow because of the tyrells invasion this leadsto no baratheon being able to take his spot on the throne rlj is actually reveled to be robert lyanna john baratheon
gameofthrones,removed,hold the doorhold the doorhold the doorhold the doorhold the doorhold the doorhold the doorhold the doorhold the doorhold the doorhold the door
gameofthrones,removed,i have the weirdest boner right now
gameofthrones,removed,mmh nice material for rconfusedboners

gameofthrones,removed,when you click on the image or the title it takes you directly to the full size image where you can zoom in instead of looking at the picture inside reddit where you cant zoom in
gameofthrones,removed,drinking from the skull of jeeeeoor fockin mormont
gameofthrones,removed,can you imagine him whispering in your ear a girl needs to yield to the many faced god and let no one gently kiss her most sensitive parts
gameofthrones,removed,im from portugal does anyone have a stream to watch
gameofthrones,removed,you know jorah would fap hard to this
gameofthrones,removed,i cant wait to see what happens and i hope that the tyrells kick some ass see flair my worst fear is that marg dies or gets her hair shorn off but natalie dormer naked mhrhrhhrmrmmr
gameofthrones,removed,not sure if dudes with nice figures or ladies with nice beards is confused
gameofthrones,removed,anybody know where i can find a good live stream
gameofthrones,removed,i think theres a difference between winter and the long night winter is seasonal and comes before spring and after fall as it does in our world except that in got seasons can last decades instead of months during the winter it snows in the north and gets colder in the other parts of westeros then theres the long night during the last long night there was near total darkness for years and it snowed as far southeast as the free cities in essos people believe that the white walkers were the cause of the long night when people refer to summer children and they say winter is coming they are talking in reference to regular winters which because they last for years bring hardship due to how harsh they can be also there are other wyrwood trees and back then there would have been a lot more i dont think it was implied that this is the exact same tree that the three eyed raven was hiding out under
gameofthrones,removed,if you were to track your eye movement over this photograph ironically it would look like a penis
gameofthrones,removed,i also dont visit as often as i did the years before i really dont like how some theories are now dogma in this sub for example jon being targaryen or any mention of the hound or the mountain will resullt in cleganebowl hype bs i really dont like the name aswell idk just sound silly to me why not trial of the faith or so but thats not the point
gameofthrones,removed,its a shame the enemies would poison such a small child
gameofthrones,removed,i will eat a spider if stoneheart appears
gameofthrones,removed,the last time i saw a cameltoe on a guy was when i went to the baths with varys
gameofthrones,removed,this better not awaken anything in me
gameofthrones,removed,no nudity warning meaning no walk of atonement for margery but more importantly no titties
gameofthrones,removed,i just came
gameofthrones,removed,what a milf
gameofthrones,removed,ayy we about to see some natalie in the nude

gameofthrones,removed,farewell tyrells you will be missed
gameofthrones,removed,they really just want to see margaery naked
gameofthrones,removed,damn we didnt even get margaery titties
gameofthrones,removed,you accepted being bi so easily way to be progressive
gameofthrones,removed,but they literally killed summer theres only winter thats coming
gameofthrones,removed,there was no nudity warning so in guessing we aint seeing no tyrell titties today
gameofthrones,removed,breaker of chains the unburnt the bitch with the nice titties so on and so forth
gameofthrones,removed,fak you dany haters
gameofthrones,removed,they are not necessary you just been programmed to repeat that by people like chris hardwick on talking dead
gameofthrones,removed,tumblr feminists
gameofthrones,removed,the mountain mentioned again cleganebowl fucking confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,so this all but confirms the theory that bran fucked with the mad king correct
gameofthrones,removed,samwells dad was that one racist uncle at the thanksgiving family dinner who just wont shut up about how he hates those damn illegals
gameofthrones,removed,if lady stoneheart doesnt appear by the end of this season ill eat my sock
gameofthrones,removed,no my massive boner is warming them up
gameofthrones,removed,boobs
gameofthrones,removed,in this episode correcting plotlines that were diverged upon earlier in the show starring jaime lannister actually going to the riverlands coldhands benjen stark holy shit eh kinda called this mention of the brotherhood without banners o lsh coming soon too bad dorne is fucked to all hell already but a noble sacrifice overall somewhat boring episode since it was mostly just build up and staging imo a good use of episode to ensure awesomeness in the final four episodes of the season its been a helluva ride
gameofthrones,removed,shes apologizing for her weak little girl arms
gameofthrones,removed,the tormund and brienne ship is not the best thing in fact i find it cringeworthy and i made a post explaining it all i said in the title was mention why i dont like the tormund and brienne dynamic i didnt post anything about relationships or nothing just mentioned them in the title together its not even clear in the title that they are necessarily around each other
gameofthrones,removed,should have binged watch to confirm rlj at least
gameofthrones,removed,the waif better back the fuck off
gameofthrones,removed,actually summer is no longer with us
gameofthrones,removed,i hope those are chicks otherwise oohhh nooo
gameofthrones,removed,apparently there are many people like you that dont realize that a every episode cant be get hype and b that while it may not be as exciting as bewbs or heads getting lopped off these slow moments are kind of important to the story as a whole
gameofthrones,removed,shes going to just put the horses on the boats dumbass
gameofthrones,removed,go watch a transformers film then
gameofthrones,removed,next weeks mean girls a westerosi theatre group adaptation starring a many faced bitch with nice titties an honest girl that spills more than just drinks a girl
gameofthrones,removed,she said that episodes ago whats not confirmed is sandor cle oh fuck it cleganebowl is happening holy ballshit
gameofthrones,removed,i really feel like this episode gives a lot of insight that bran might be the cause of the mad king having tried to burn everyone the episode literally opens up showing clips of him yelling about burning them all and given what we know about the mad kings end he kept screaming burn them all as he was killed making me think bran messed up again
gameofthrones,removed,thats why i put or something like that because i dont remember everything word for word and thats close enough
gameofthrones,removed,technically youre supposed to count catelyn
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think he will have to the hound will defeat the mountain in a trial by combat
gameofthrones,removed,welp runexpectedboners
gameofthrones,removed,dont worry he is gonna jump a window
gameofthrones,removed,young ned is in that episode more than this one
gameofthrones,removed,anyone else notice the brothers without banners get mentioned lady stoneheart anyone
gameofthrones,removed,samwells mom milf of the year
gameofthrones,removed,benjen mad king cleganebowl blackfish frey edmure sam and heartsbane arya and needle my god oh yes also lol gtfo dany danys plot is turning into the new dorne
gameofthrones,removed,anyone else get an absolute boner from this httpimgurcomnloxpnx
gameofthrones,removed,wait so jaime is leaving kl right before cersei trial its either tommen or the hound cleganebowl confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,it was a set up episode that we much needed to move the story along jaimie is finally heading to the riverlands he mentioned bronn we got the freys and the tullys again dany is finally heading to westeros always happy to see drogon although i guess danys horse wasnt happy with it margeary is out and cercei is getting us ready for cleaganebowl also we got coldhandsbenjen finally and we saw the mad king for the first time all in all it was a pretty good episode
gameofthrones,removed,you could say the same thing about this years election
gameofthrones,removed,no naked natalie dormer soul crushing
gameofthrones,removed,the hound vs the mountain in the trial by combat
gameofthrones,removed,i corresponded with before i posted so i think i should be good
gameofthrones,removed,my penis is so confused right now
gameofthrones,removed,book spoliers brienne and pod come across a camp of priest of the seven they find a horse that is described in a similar way to the hounds horse they also mention seeing a large priest their digging a grave people have thought that this might be the hound
gameofthrones,removed,well whatever dude i was just telling you what ive heard the theories are inherently similar because it is just a different group of people so yes it is similar im done here
gameofthrones,removed,no he was living with some ascetic group of monks but not named monks but thats the best way to describe them i can remember somewhere just south of kl some middleofnowhere place in that peninsula that juts out into the sea or at least it was made to seem that way there was a brother who took a vow of silence a fightersoldier who had been found close to death by the head clergymana story that alluded to possibly being the hound but wasnt specific that sort of thing
gameofthrones,removed,i think that actress arya saved is hotter got milf episode
gameofthrones,removed,i have a confused erection
gameofthrones,removed,i think everyone is assuming the hound will win cleganebowl but i dont think it will happen i am assuming zombie mountain will win so that everyone gets to see the hound die again and it sets the mountain up to kill tommen by some cersei misstep which then will drive her mad and lead to jamie killing her as she attempts to burn everyone in kings landing like the mad king and only then do we get to see the qyburn wasnt her guy at all but was secretly plotting to undo the lannisters for what happened to him at harrenhal or i might just have too much tinfoil
gameofthrones,removed,lady stoneheart is catelyn stark
gameofthrones,removed,even more intetesting is that the mirror shot looked deliberate dd mention it in the interview after the show the implication for her mercy chapter cleared one thing up
gameofthrones,removed,plus grrm said its not just any sword theres something more about it she cant change it
gameofthrones,removed,eh if youre american then this is pretty sad did you just drop out of middle school or something
gameofthrones,removed,lady stoneheart is basically a revivedstill alive catelyn whos extremely disfigured in the books she goes nuts killing anyone who hurt starks including brienne and pod because of their association with renly i may have gotten details wrong that but thats the gist
gameofthrones,removed,im so confused
gameofthrones,removed,omg possibility of lady stoneheart
gameofthrones,removed,i hate the moderators on this sub you delete my screen grab of aryajagen foreshadowing in season but allow this to stay i got upvotes in the seconds it was up before you deleted it wtf
gameofthrones,removed,frankly the reason the posting quality is so low is that the well informed people have so tired of the moderation here that theyve left for other places where they can hold actual conversations instead of posting memes of doorstops and the same honestly inane questions over and over and over again im sure ill get downvoted for this but if you cultivated this garden if all youre growing is weeds you might want to change your gardening technique
gameofthrones,removed,uncle benjen is back get hype now we need the hound to be back for cleganebowl
gameofthrones,removed,the mods on this sub are nazis
gameofthrones,removed,samwells mom is a fucking milf who knew
gameofthrones,removed,revivedundead catelyn stark who takes over the brotherhood without banners on a vengeance mission to kill anyone who harmed house stark
gameofthrones,removed,what is gots thoughts about this picture from the flashback looks like its ned with possibly lyanna in a bed of blood theres also a large wound which makes me think maybe ned had to perform a csection to get the babybabies out
gameofthrones,removed,i got major blue balls after that scene i was hoping there would be a slaughter of the faith militant and high sparrow
gameofthrones,removed,or you know d and d are incompetent and did not think it through
gameofthrones,removed,rfuckolly
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think game of thrones is the type of story that is good for bottle episodes dont put words in mouth you fucking moron i never said or implied bottle episodes were a good thing just that this type of episode embodies the opposite extreme
gameofthrones,removed,so cersei confirmed trial by combatand the mountain is her champion next weeks episode is titled the broken man cleganebowl incoming i hate the sparrows but i guess im rooting for them now
gameofthrones,removed,did you not even watch the episode fuck me people like you piss me off
gameofthrones,removed,if you go by the books catlyn is alive as well
gameofthrones,removed,it was shit starting with the gay trial
gameofthrones,removed,i hope this doesnt awaken anything in me
gameofthrones,removed,im just waiting for khaleesi to start yelling about the millyunayahs and the billyunayahs we get it lady your speechwriter is asleep at the wheel
gameofthrones,removed,what is the probability of the cleagan bowl being cercies trial
gameofthrones,removed,you watch a pony show
gameofthrones,removed,not everything has a super complex meaning to it it bothers me if you are actually serious about this
gameofthrones,removed,no boobs either
gameofthrones,removed,see this is why i dont like liberals they cant comprehend what discipline is like they see disciplined people as being personally offended when they trying to whip people into a specific thing people can have doubts about people in facct waif simply was proven right arya will never be no one she knew they were wasting their time on arya
gameofthrones,removed,i think we all know how marg got out of the walk of atonement she gave up some good poosey
gameofthrones,removed,jaime was only mad about being sent to the riverlands because hes going to miss cleganebowl
gameofthrones,removed,i was hoping for margaery to march along with her atonmentok i just wanted to see natalie dormer naked shrugs
gameofthrones,removed,book spoilers at the end of the book varys kills kevan and pycelle specifically because things have become too stable he requires instability in the kingdoms in order for a targaryan takeover to work properly im not sure how theyll make that work for the show but i assume theyll have some version of it
gameofthrones,removed,seriously though i wanted margaery to atone her sins
gameofthrones,removed,better make it starks for episode lady stoneheart confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,anyone care to share a link
gameofthrones,removed,im bi too thats the great thing even if im not quite sure i know i can appreciate it
gameofthrones,removed,b in the books the brotherhood finds catelyn starks decomposing corpse lying in the river and beric dondarrion resurrects her by trading his life for hers after catelyn wakes up she takes the name lady stoneheart and takes control of the brotherhood however since lady stoneheart is not in her right mind and promptly goes on a murderous rampage to punish those who betrayed the stark cause turning the brotherhood into a vicious band of murders who wander the riverlands when brienne finds catelyn by accident since shes currently looking for sansa in the riverlands catelyn immediately demands that brienne repent for her failure to protect the starks and kill jamie for breaking his oaths to catelyn unfortunately the scene functionally ends there and the scene where lady stoneheart is introduced basically ends on a cliff hanger its that stoneheart is that amazing yet its that we all really want to know how that scene is going to end and dd have repeatedly teased about revealing lady stoneheart throughout the series
gameofthrones,removed,grrm basically just set the stage for clegeanbowl get jamie out of kings landing then pop have the hound kill the mountain in trial by combat which kills cersei marg has tom enough under control with the help of the faith and high sparrow that he thinks its the right thing to do and stands aside while she is killed fucking revenge for ned holy shit the parallels would be so juicy then you have a pissed off jamie who just happens to be near the starksnow frontline with a lannister army and is pissed at his son and wants revenge for cersei starksnowlannister team up kind of makes sense too jamie is the flattest of characters when around cersei and basically just becomes her bitch but then he always experiences huge character development away from her
gameofthrones,removed,this whole sub has turned into nothing but horrible overused jokes i come here after each episode hoping to see some discussion about what happened and its nothing but clegane bowl get hype and other jokes that havent been funny for two years i guess its my own fault for being stupid enough to think its going to change at some point
gameofthrones,removed,why why would anyone do a shot by shot breakdown of visions like this just a waste of time get a life dude get a girlfriend
gameofthrones,removed,bahd poosay
gameofthrones,removed,he is so many people at once hes literally no one in particular
gameofthrones,removed,wait what
gameofthrones,removed,snuff porn actually
gameofthrones,removed,the show sucks shit
gameofthrones,removed,titties
gameofthrones,removed,rconfusedboners
gameofthrones,removed,shes naive like sam
gameofthrones,removed,well tony stark is a ceo who has failed at predictions and tony stark is more of a stark than jon snow so tony stark azor ahai that means melisandres true identity is pepper potts rshittygottheory
gameofthrones,removed,as complaining about it here isnt likely to do much good obviously it did because you saw it and responded though i wasnt really complaining just sharing my opinion on the state of things based on my own observations both here and elsewhere i also wasnt concerned with getting a response i was just sharing my two cents with the community its of no consequence to me how you run this sub but i suppose its of consequence to you since youd probably rather not be a mod of a dead or dying sub so it may be of interest to you that the state of this sub has garnered enough dissatisfaction to be the subject of threads on other boards in the last couple weeks maybe you care maybe you dont but there you have it best wishes
gameofthrones,removed,i agree plus do you remember that odd look the waif had when arya recited her list and came to walder frey now remember when arya played the lying game the waif told her that story about a girletc and asked arya if she was lying or not maybe the whole story wasnt a lie after all
gameofthrones,removed,douchechills
gameofthrones,removed,im screaming right now we have set pics of arya wearing a water dancing outfit like syrio for which happens to be entitled no one my nerves if this happens like you said i just cant its too awesome
gameofthrones,removed,fucking casual
gameofthrones,removed,no summer died he was killed by a hoard of undead
gameofthrones,removed,everyone is talking about the girl on the right but i thought the one on the left was a girl after i saw the first girl but then i looked at the crotch and saw an outline of something and thought what an idiot i was thinking she was a girl then i looked at her cleavage and realized how dumb i am
gameofthrones,removed,same i was thinking if the clegane bowl never happened itd be cool to see a brainwashed loras fueled by his devotion to the seven take on the zombie mountain
gameofthrones,removed,seeing the mad king come to life was the highlight of this episode to me
gameofthrones,removed,cleganebowl hype 🔥
gameofthrones,removed,mountain trial by combat cleganebowl confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,whats that hand covered in blood is it tommen
gameofthrones,removed,arthur dayne and aemon the dragonknight rolling in their graves
gameofthrones,removed,cercei is going to stand trail by combat cleganebowl anytime soon
gameofthrones,removed,dickhead
gameofthrones,removed,hes a godly man
gameofthrones,removed,ok you asked for itarya leaves the hound in the river lands to die he even makes a joke about how he will die unless theres a maester hiding behind that rock speculation so while arya is gone stick fighting these nice dudes from this place called the quiet isle show up and nurse him back to health reasons in the books brienne of tarth makes a trip to the quiet isle and sees a horse which looks remarkably like sandors and also glimpses a gravediggeracolyte of the faith a dog walks up to him and he pets it eh eh
gameofthrones,removed,filmed in belfast
gameofthrones,removed,seriously guys theres better porn out there actual porn you dont need a sad and horrible scene of a young woman being torn down as a human being and ripped to shreds from the inside out tbh if the walk of shame is your kink you kind of worry me
gameofthrones,removed,whats not to say that theyre cousins who was with ned at the tower of joy howland reed what if lyanna actually gave birth to twins jon snow and meera and ned and howland each took one to keep safe
gameofthrones,removed,nah
gameofthrones,removed,this talk of daenerys conquering and destroying the wheel lets not forget she keeps being saved by her followers and bad writing noone in westeros will support her i cant wait until she dies
gameofthrones,removed,clegane bowl was confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,thank god someone said it my patience for those scenes is lower and lower its kinda parallel with with my boner that started falling off from her first bow to me scene when she hatches the dragons
gameofthrones,removed,its because sam is fat and physically worthless the wight did not acknowledge him
gameofthrones,removed,nah the mad king was mad and wanted to burn his entire kingdom because he knew the war was lost and he didnt want the rebel forces to have his legacy stop theorizing everything
gameofthrones,removed,crazy theory i read in the sub but i feel like reposting created over and over and over and over again relevant httpimgurcomgallerysnlplqq i know a person that legitimately claims to be the person behind rl j despite having never read any of the books
gameofthrones,removed,benjen is half death atleast
gameofthrones,removed,you realise this is dimensional he is closer to the screen not even half of what those red lines
gameofthrones,removed,i doubt the hound is going to physically choke cersei
gameofthrones,removed,im not sure if this is gona happen or not but the shadow we see in the clouds far back on hardhome hoping its an ice drake
gameofthrones,removed,honestly stop whining if its game of thrones related it should be able to be talked about here mods quit your bitching subs too i really dont want a censored specialty sub because someone is too bored and uptight to visit another interest
gameofthrones,removed,this is hugely overkill for a fan based site for a show about as a good man has said s dragons you all make first time posters feel wholly unwelcome mods please go do something in the real world to make someones life a little better
gameofthrones,removed,yeah the endings in each episode with daenerys is such a cheesefest someone hold me all she does is yell at foreigners about how shes gona conquer westeros bad luck dany the nights king is on the march
gameofthrones,removed,or what about ice and fire being embodied in one person rlj
gameofthrones,removed,fucking cleganebowl
gameofthrones,removed,on an unrelated note i had a hunch that the actress who plays the waif has a perfect set of breasts i was not mistaken
gameofthrones,removed,visual dna on the cum stains found in the crevice of the bracers leads back to a one eddard stark
gameofthrones,removed,bastardbowl cleganebowl noonebowl tarlybowl did i miss any i dont care which we get im hype
gameofthrones,removed,if this bit is true its been foreshadowed since episode when after the mountain lost to loras in the joust the mountain went to attack him and the hound stepped in and held the mountain at baysaved loras life
gameofthrones,removed,azor ahype
gameofthrones,removed,my predictions for the next episodes the return of the brotherhood without banners bran learning to change the past dany walking around sansa failing at being badass small council meetings with the tyrells in the finale arya using mad syrio skills to fight waif in the dark thats why she blew the candle because she can since she trained when blind
gameofthrones,removed,my earlier claim came from younger dragons being weaker balerion being older at the time is stronger than drogon from whatever age a dragons egg comes from doesnt mean shit in terms of how strong they are its their size and age valyrian dragons were huge as fuck hence my regarding balerion as valyrian alongside fact that he came the age of valyria and do you honestly think that these eggs came from before valyria theyre obviously not actual fossils otherwise they would not have birthed dragons it seems i need to clarify my original message my point in case you havent figured it out is that drogon is still susceptible to weaponry and cannot be used as a instantly win any siege or battle card unlike balerion who being as large and powerful as he is from his growth due to being old as fuck is practically invincible do you think that the asoiaf wikia is some unique and secretive site that you blessed me with did you not read how i pointed out that it footnotes the chapters its information comes from thats why i and presumably you used it because the information can be looked up in the books by its citation links clearly you dont know how size works or growing for that matter if you think that drogon has grown so significantly that he somehow matches up to balerion oh man drogon has aged a couple weeks from his days since the end of adod i mean just look at the size of him at the end of the episode when dany was riding him thats nice no longer just twenty feet in wingspan now he is actually the size of a small plane instead of being smaller than one hes still jack shit compared to someone whose wingspan covers fucking towns by the time dany reaches westeros say in about a year or two drogon will still be a pipsqueak compared to balerion he will grow larger yes but not nearly enough to match hundreds of years of growth my quotes by the way are cited if you checked the very wikia that you used here lemme help you out httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpbalerion his fire was as black as his scales his wingspan so vast that entire towns would fall under his shadow when he passed overhead his teeth were as long as swords and his jaws were large enough to swallow an aurochs whole or even one of the hairy mammoths that are said to roam the cold wastes beyond the port of ibben a clash of kings chapter daenerys i a game of thrones chapter tyrion ii httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpdrogon as of a dance with dragons drogons wings stretch twenty feet from tiptotip black as jet a dance with dragons chapter daenerys ix
gameofthrones,removed,i was honestly hoping itd be a remix to beamer benz or bentley but instead with oysters clams or cockles
gameofthrones,removed,someones a dickhead
gameofthrones,removed,why not just get rid of titles altogether require every post to have the same title then title spoilers are gone like me irl call it meera irl
gameofthrones,removed,did anyone notice a fist closing with the background having a pool of blood the scene comes right after ned asks wheres my sister lyannas fist maybe tower of joy sequence rl j
gameofthrones,removed,no way the hound is in the ground i hope you are right
gameofthrones,removed,wow that was beautiful i think when we look back dd worked really hard to give arya the character depth and nuance that most characters never get
gameofthrones,removed,the question is supposed to accomplish the introduction of the concept that real people who are angry about a fictional characters decisions and taking time on the internet to express this anger of which you are just one of many may perhaps have their own failures to consider i thought my question form was a briefer b a widely recognised response to such attacks as shes fucking useless my personal opinion is that sansa is significantly more useful to the real world that anything you or i might have done in our own real lives certainly with that mouth the only troops you could rally would be a small swarm of angry young men who feel better knowing they are not the only ones with butt hurt at not being better than a fictional ginger girl good luck with your exams
gameofthrones,removed,this is correct ned dying made the war of the five kings red wedding made sansa the heir to winterfell put the boltons into power and eliminated a king oberyns death advanced the dorne plot and gave us zombie mountain for cleganebowl jon dying gave us the lord of light and jon finding a small loophole in the nights watch contract that now lets him advance the plot even beyond arya dying though shes alone at the house of black and white and everyone already thinks shes dead or most do anyway so nothing will come of her death she still has a way to go before her death which will probably be her clutching needle freezing to death after shes done what she had to
gameofthrones,removed,mad dont cry on reddit if you havent seen the series
gameofthrones,removed,nah fatty is just a weeb at heart that wants to use that sweet sword to defend his cuck wife
gameofthrones,removed,it it had been more realistic it would have just been pair after pair of titties flashing across the screen in order of reveal why hasnt someone made this
gameofthrones,removed,season had basically porn half the episodes and season all we get is some granny tits and dany tits which weve already seen hbo pls
gameofthrones,removed,this was made clear when arya was the first to clap she understood cerseis loss and for arya that is such a huge step to healing herself
gameofthrones,removed,this submission was removed for the reasons listed below general episode reaction topics like this should be in rgameofthrones thats stickied at the top of the sub homepage please use the provided discussion threads for this topic to consolidate comments here please review the subreddits rgameofthroneswpostingpolicy and rgameofthroneswspoilerguide to better understand the content scope if you have a question or concern about this action please
gameofthrones,removed,tyrells and lannisters going up against the high sparrow white walkers heading down sansa and jon rallying to take back the north iron lands giving their ships to dany for some reason seriously this isnt a very ironborn thing to do but whatever also hopefully cleganebowl at this rate theres gonna be a full fucking westerosbowl
gameofthrones,removed,you are complaining about not seeing a particular pair of titties in a tv show godfuckingdammit you have access to millions of boobs on the internet

gameofthrones,removed,in the books they can easily field an army of at a stretch giving them the biggest army in westeros the show makes the lannister army much bigger even though something like of it was destroyed by the starks tywin had about left at the time of the red wedding the starks had thats why the tyrell alliance was pretty much the end of the northern rebellion they would have lost regardless of the red wedding
gameofthrones,removed,is it possible that tommen might represent the faith against assumably the mountain in the trial by combat i know there has been speculation of the clegane bowl but this seems like a great grrm twist i suspect it would be the ultimate test for cersei and also a true test of tommens faith will cersei fall on her sword for your child or will she be selfish and chose her life over that of her children does tommen trust the gods with his life admittedly it would be awful shame not to see the zombie mountain at full throttle but this would be quite the situation i see this being a situation at this point with the possible outcome i note jaime will not be there to council his sister or son and will just have to come back to the consequences
gameofthrones,removed,for the same reason people in texas hate muslims even though theyve probably never met one
gameofthrones,removed,not to be a dick but weve known this since the season trailer kudos on the free karma
gameofthrones,removed,i went into that scene thinking well either get titties or decent combat i wasnt even disappointed to an extent titties no titties the high sparrow made an awesome play
gameofthrones,removed,i think cersei has suffered enough now i feel like high sparrow is an asshole unless his god is real im a little confused on that if his god isnt real then hes a religiously intolerant asshole cult leader if his god is real then everybody otta listen to him
gameofthrones,removed,but theyve all got massive battle boners now not sure if their horses wouldve been into that
gameofthrones,removed,and her connection to her stark identity the one thing she couldnt chuck away in the lake needle was jon snows smile
gameofthrones,removed,a painting can be beautiful but i dont want to bang a painting
gameofthrones,removed,my point is that people are saying confirmed things are not confirmed until they are blatantly revealed as truth ie in this case benjen wasnt confirmed until he showed up in the show again my point is the word confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,that bitch has some nice titties though
gameofthrones,removed,pretty sure that this is the case from previous screenshots of the trailer mountains armor had the spike holes that match the spiked club that lancel was carrying in this episode
gameofthrones,removed,i would see that going down similar to the fat guy dying in shawshank redemption im not supposed to be here i want my mother i had your mother she wasnt that good
gameofthrones,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjtipqdllkta
gameofthrones,removed,you deserve to know youre wrong and unintelligible
gameofthrones,removed,i wasnt sure if my mention that coldhands wasnt revealed as benjen in the books counted as book spoilers or not if they did count how would i mark it on my post i went for the square brackets deal at the top but i wasnt sure if there was a proper way of tagging the post
gameofthrones,removed,you guys shouldnt worry too much about that imo downvotes should take care of most of it
gameofthrones,removed,is chubby fat is like murica
gameofthrones,removed,yup arya is hiding under the streets of braavos planning her way out of the cityfm she is wearing different clotheshair judging from the set pics the waif is honing in on her and chase kicks off personally i think lady crane will find arya after she kills the waif only to be revealed that lady crane is actually jaqen wearing a face nit killing lady crane killing the waif were parts of the test and arya passes the way lc spoke to arya really felt very fmesque asking arya if she likes being other people complimenting her face telling her bg story even the direct eye contact feels very km
gameofthrones,removed,sooo cleganebowl confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,like who gives a shit if a kid sees some nudity in the context that the show provides it almost all of western civilization for the past thousand years barring the last years or so with some variance here and there and also all of the middle eastern civilizations for the past and about half the southeast for the same time parents who arent flippant about their responsibilities hell im and married and even i find the nudity to often be pointless gratuitous and annoying half the time a lot of the time its only there to indicate that this is a gritty story that shows reality like it is but frankly i don t think the shows hedonistic representation of sexuality looks very much like what i choose for my life or most of us choose for ours or something that i would want my sonother kids to choose for theirs and to expose that to a child who is simply lacking the experience and maturity to understand what a proper sexual relationship looks like seems like it might reasonably be cause for concern to a sane parent
gameofthrones,removed,theres always
gameofthrones,removed,well if you want tits you should watch porn
gameofthrones,removed,yes but they could be used in future
gameofthrones,removed,cumming

gameofthrones,removed,cant tell you if our characters meet or not this season i mean theyre both in winterfell right i think its a pretty safe assumption they meet maybe he means personal interactions on screen
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,do you think these showwatchers in this sub care lol you should post this to rasoiaf or rpureasoiaf tbh
gameofthrones,removed,reminds me of when me and james talked about having kids the passion in his eyes is something i will never forget oh james you were ahead of your time if only things were simpler for us back then if only they were simpler now

gameofthrones,removed,how is it bait
gameofthrones,removed,yes im but what
gameofthrones,removed,yeah its not like he gave someone a valyrian steel weapon and set them off on a mission to findprotect the person who is being accused of killing his son dont get me wrong jaime is definitely a character with some huge flaws but cmon now
gameofthrones,removed,what the fuck are you talking about bitch
gameofthrones,removed,the hound little brothersibling to the mountain twofer the hound and the mountain battle in the long desired clegenge sp bowl hound wins and mercs cersi because shes mean
gameofthrones,removed,theres a theory that hes her father
gameofthrones,removed,no one in winterfell didnt want theon he got treated better than jon snowhe is pretty dumb for randomly wanting to conquer winterfel
gameofthrones,removed,and now my watch has ended
gameofthrones,removed,she should have moderated the presidential debate
gameofthrones,removed,boner slayer
gameofthrones,removed,because he wants sansas ginger minge
gameofthrones,removed,actually it was revealed that hes gonna die to hearth attack in the first seconds of the next episode but it was nice to see him back
gameofthrones,removed,ooooh
gameofthrones,removed,why
gameofthrones,removed,but sparrows can fly
gameofthrones,removed,oh my bad i could have sworn she had him after he already had his hand cut off guess its time for another rewatch
gameofthrones,removed,today is not the day i die oberyn martell
gameofthrones,removed,i highly doubt that the usage of the phrase no one in the context of this scene is referring to the faceless men its much more likely that arya was just trying to sound badass in response to the hounds provocations
gameofthrones,removed,no shit its reddit of reddit is year old boys with low level autism its not like im some tough guy either my only hope is that everyone is built like actual medieval europeans and are all
gameofthrones,removed,i hope its true shed better not die
gameofthrones,removed,what about that big scary nun
gameofthrones,removed,i feel like we didnt get to see loras really fight outside of tournaments i think he might have a few tricks up his sleeves he seemed to have a good reputation for his skills then again its valid to say that he has been broken and in captivity for quite some time
gameofthrones,removed,i hope melisandre burns him to death no homo
gameofthrones,removed,who woulda thought
gameofthrones,removed,so much hype
gameofthrones,removed,what do we say to death all day err day mah man im lsh now biatch deaths my life now
gameofthrones,removed,it would honestly be pretty retarded he cant be that stupid right
gameofthrones,removed,i make that mistake quite a bit my bad
gameofthrones,removed,but for now were going with my theory melisandre and jaqen both serve the red godmany faced godlord of light melisandre is not no one though shes a fire priestess she borrows the face and titties of the young melisandre but shes actually just a super old person who can also cast spells and shit
gameofthrones,removed,lol here is the link httpsthepiratebayorguserflameleg
gameofthrones,removed,ever since i saw yara do the breast grab im thinking dany will be intoxicated with all those ships i cannot lie and say im not hoping for danyara to be a thing they must bang the gong
gameofthrones,removed,you dont know how to overthrow a medieval monarchy do you roberts claim came from his targaryn blood but he beat the targaryn army after he won the war who gives a fuck is the old heirs have more blood than he does he won the fucking war the people didnt over throw aerys with robert because robert was the proper king they did it because aerys was an asshole why would robert get the support of the kingdoms overthrow the king kill so many peoplejust to have dany or her brother take the throne if that was what he wanted they could have just assassinated the mad long
gameofthrones,removed,how else will he become the gravedigger
gameofthrones,removed,wait were they not in a cage and about to be burnt to death when jaqen pleaded and she threw them an ax was that not in the show am i being retarded
gameofthrones,removed,alert danyfag spotted
gameofthrones,removed,top notch post
gameofthrones,removed,eurons whole plan consisted in marrying her and bang her danys gonna roast him is what im saying
gameofthrones,removed,bewbs
gameofthrones,removed,its like asking a farmer in iraq what they think of ted cruz
gameofthrones,removed,that or the freys are simply too stingy to buy their soldiers helmets so they simply have them wear the skull caps hell look at i think i can count two helmets on in that entire crowd of soldiers it may just be a thing for the freys to wear skullcaps just like every other house with their specific helms or lack there of as for the two that have helmets and the few other freys with helmets we have seen in the past they may have bought them themselves or acquired them through battle
gameofthrones,removed,rob clarifies his succession as the army heads for edmures wedding
gameofthrones,removed,the peshmerga of westeros
gameofthrones,removed,white walkers the jews
gameofthrones,removed,youre also gay as fuck for using the word thoroughly
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think its tommen that the mounting grabs in the preview for the next episode it looks more like that cousin that cersei use to bang who testified against her and who is part of the sparrows
gameofthrones,removed,moody
gameofthrones,removed,lf prolly just wants some of that sansa puss but he wants her to be smart and not naive
gameofthrones,removed,because the hype gave me a boner
gameofthrones,removed,in the books doesnt arya marry bolton but only its a copy of her and not the real arya maybe theyre using that type of plot in this show but only without the bolton marrying
gameofthrones,removed,youre grasping that straw mighty vigorously
gameofthrones,removed,it would make her lyanna stark
gameofthrones,removed,are his children allowed to have children its my understanding that he just picks a new daughter to impregnate when his current one gets too old which is to say not very or dies from some inbreeding disease
gameofthrones,removed,i fucking hate that sue perkins freak
gameofthrones,removed,g blackfish gets killed flees with brienne to help his niece at battle of winterfell the remaining tully army rides to help the remaining stark army consisting of wildlings mormont tully so the sizes will be about men on starks side vs men on boltons side guess that was the number being remembered by sansa on the first episodes this season thats why ramsay bolton gets cocky again as happened before in the battle against the baratheon army led by stannis and rides to battle outside of winterfell instead of staying in the doublewalled winterfell which could hold a siege means man inside winterfell would be enough to battle men outside i guess hed win that battle easily again wouldnt it be for the knights of the vale led by baelish those should be around so it would even out the numbers on both sides i guess the bolton army loses at this point due to the surprise effect bow would still be an easy win if the bolton army were to defend inside winterfell sorry if my english sucks
gameofthrones,removed,the opening and ending scene i could fap to it
gameofthrones,removed,oh well thats just silly of course she didnt slip up
gameofthrones,removed,house frey walder is coming

gameofthrones,removed,not likely call me crazy but i wouldnt openly post about pirating here
gameofthrones,removed,the number of seeders makes it seem legit however i downloaded the first episode after it aired and got a cease and desist from hbo via google fiber so i signed up for hbo now fuck it
gameofthrones,removed,no
gameofthrones,removed,nope theyre viruses i downloaded one and had to reformat i usually go off by the amount of seeders but in this case i got fucked i check comments now before i download
gameofthrones,removed,it dependswhose titties we talking here
gameofthrones,removed,look at the size of all three uploads all are mb that probably isnt coincidence but the exact same virus
gameofthrones,removed,it is highly unlikely more likely a virus just get hbo it will make your life much easier
gameofthrones,removed,robb was really into silent film and wanted to bang a chaplin any chaplin
gameofthrones,removed,many faced god bless those titties
gameofthrones,removed,eh doesnt seem that threatening if it missed important stuff in the neck and spine looks brutal but thats it i think infection from dirty river water into wound would be way worse

gameofthrones,removed,now take that necklace off and lets see how much you went into detail
gameofthrones,removed,call me
gameofthrones,removed,its not the necklace that makes her appear young thats not canon just a visual trick used in the tv series
gameofthrones,removed,just for clarity are we sold on the necklace being the cause of her appearance because shes seen not wearing it and looks fine
gameofthrones,removed,hint its a cumbox
gameofthrones,removed,why do i look at you and want to be your lord of due but also want you to make me milk and cookies
gameofthrones,removed,but your face just looks the same as carice if not for the reveal about the characters unnatural nonaging you would have easily passed as a young melisandre in a prequel
gameofthrones,removed,nope ive seen what happens when the necklace comes off

gameofthrones,removed,any links to those
gameofthrones,removed,the rlj reveal arguably the biggest reveal of the entire series was so poorly executed if i wasnt already familiar with the theory i dont think i would have even understood what was happening or what the implication was what a disappointment
gameofthrones,removed,yeah they have to do more for casual and normal fans who are clueless
gameofthrones,removed,you said it would be boring if every character strictly wore their house colours shrugs i said that it would be boring to only wear dothraki colors too using your own logic that too much of anything gets stale wearing targaryean colors would raise morale and help connect with her westerosi supporters like how people identify with the flag of their country westeros doesnt have a flag just the houses they are loyal to if you disagree with that then i dont have any more to add to the discussion
gameofthrones,removed,i talked to some casual watchers who knew that the babys was jon but thought that lyanna was just neds mistress or something i dont think i would have put that all together if i wasnt familiar with the theory
gameofthrones,removed,as several people have already stated im not a fan of actual spoilers as it takes away from the essence of the show incoming season spoiler imagine if it had been spoiled cercei blows up the great scept that season finale wouldnt have been as holy shit as it was on the side though i do love discussing and theorizing as its a lot of fun when one of your theories proves to be true
gameofthrones,removed,i cant tell if you are a boy or girl
gameofthrones,removed,colorizebot
gameofthrones,removed,i mean we did get to se her tits way back in season but walking down the rough streets eyes on all sides feet bloodied and bruised her body covered in dirt and rotted fruit as the peasants overwhelm her with their thunderous cries and insults im getting hot just thinking about it
gameofthrones,removed,i cant say i ever felt a desire to be turned on by the books so i havent felt thwarted i guess the ariannearys thing was kind of hotbut there are such explicit sex scenes in so much other literature that asoiaf doesnt even register for me
gameofthrones,removed,disgusting chuck it in the trash plz
gameofthrones,removed,i forgot how much i wanted to bang theon when i first started to watch this show now i remember why
gameofthrones,removed,this is the first time ever i deemed her attractive but i dont think its just the hair
gameofthrones,removed,hotter than ever cant wait to give birth to her hnghhhh

gameofthrones,removed,probably the cum box
gameofthrones,removed,we need jon and dany to auntnephew fuck to preserve the purity of the targ blood line duty before cousin fucking

gameofthrones,removed,kiss my ass professor
gameofthrones,removed,you can use other words in search thats how search works you type words youre looking for or lets start from asking a question like dear google please tell me why grey wind named grey wind or whtaever you want to ask in any form and youd be amazed how many people have already shared their opinions you have something new to say great you free to share you want to discuss old theories great you have your own point of view please share your arguments but what if you have nothing to contribute you have tons of materials that already publically shared and discussed what a great time to be alive you can find whatever info you want without waiting for someones response all you have to do is to spend a minute to find this info instead of asking a question on forumsubredditwhatever and hope that someone googles for you that doesnt change anything but out of interest did you change relevance to the last month nada and those results doesnt all deal with the naming convention httpswwwredditcomrgameofthronessearchqdirewolvesrestrictsrontmonth please use your own head if you have one do i have to read it for you too year old can use google this days even if they cant read or write yet

gameofthrones,removed,my favourite one is the episode with all the tits
gameofthrones,removed,nothing in this subreddit posted has high value you are just pissing on my post on purpose
gameofthrones,removed,it should end with a flashback to donald the builder building the wall then a corny sitcom laugh track while the world falls to shit outside
gameofthrones,removed,really dont mean to sound rude but is this serious
gameofthrones,removed,before america does
gameofthrones,removed,guilty
gameofthrones,removed,also grrm was prohillary so badly i wonder if the result will get in the way of this work
gameofthrones,removed,jon should pump dany with that sweet undead semen hell probably die but theyll have a heir and dragons to kick ass in westeros cersei should die but she should get raped by the people of kings landing one rape for every life shes killed or made a living hell then the mountain can rape her last which will probably result in her death jamie is forced to watch tied up and someone jerking him off to it while he watches and cant do anything about it then kill him afterwards tyrion can go out with a bang riding a dragon into westeros till he gets shot with an arrow to the knee and falls off the dragon from high up in the sky but drinking a cup of wine on his way down like a motherfuckin boss he gets to go out in such a badass way the white walker army will take many numbers but they will be stomped by danys dragons and a mass production of valerian steel swords ships and canons finally the throne will be left to dany and this is after jon snows heir is born she will eventually die but the kid will rule the seven kingdoms forever and ever but then he gets killed too by the ghost of ramsay snow and he takes over because fuck happy endings hi im ramsay snow and i wrote this
gameofthrones,removed,baelish wins then he can finally make the seven kingdoms great again
gameofthrones,removed,censorship often is and thats what this is it starts with a warning dont discuss certain topics stay in your lane condition in control
gameofthrones,removed,so can we have a discussion about the leaks or do we have to go to r f r e e f o l k
gameofthrones,removed,as if this election season couldnt get any worse i thought the insanity was over but it seems to refuse to die
gameofthrones,removed,freefolk on both this and asoiaf subreddit users didnt spoil anything on not allowed threads great community and moderation
gameofthrones,removed,its a sub dedicated to this stuff trust me you wont end up there unless youre looking for it contains the word free
gameofthrones,removed,could you please inbox me the link or subreddit please
gameofthrones,removed,i have no interest in seeing the spoilers but are they legitamete like verified to be true that its what is going to happen
gameofthrones,removed,would you mind inboxing me as well thank you
gameofthrones,removed,me too pls
gameofthrones,removed,me too
gameofthrones,removed,please can you show me where ive been immature with my post ive not insulted anyone or created drama

gameofthrones,removed,im a bit late but could you inbox them to me as well thanks
gameofthrones,removed,well now that you know what happens are we in for something incredible this season
gameofthrones,removed,is a pretty logical follow up to the story but the will blow your mind there is a major and really unsurprising death coming up dont spoil that to yourself it will be greater to learn about it while watching the show
gameofthrones,removed,same please
gameofthrones,removed,oh shut up plenty of other things to worry about
gameofthrones,removed,i wouldnt mind the link either
gameofthrones,removed,thats a really shitty thing to do i wonder if it has anything to do with grrms outspoken political stance whether or not you disagree with someones politics you should still show them some basic respect
gameofthrones,removed,theres a ton of filming spoilers out there i dont know about scripts or anything but theres for real legit leaks out there ive watched the videos
gameofthrones,removed,id rather got spoilers than be reminded of that fucking coup election tbh
gameofthrones,removed,ummmmm bullshit i demand a forum on cerseis emails
gameofthrones,removed,any way i could get that spoiler
gameofthrones,removed,bienvenidos a la iglesia illuminati de satan ¿es usted un hombre de negocios un músico un estudiante y quiere ser rico y famoso en la búsqueda de la sociedad no sabe más esto es una oportunidad para ser un miembro puede ponerse en contacto con la gran orden en esta dirección de correo electrónico o llámame en mi número de teléfono nota si no estás listo para unirse no sumes si estás en whatsapp puedes whatsapp en ese número
gameofthrones,removed,how do you call something like this a theory
gameofthrones,removed,if you have seen the spoilers we have saw who she is allying withand its very strangei personally believe it will be a show only deal i suspect that dany will land at dragonstone and marshal the south and dorne before she marches on kings landingi also believe that cersei will survive to the last season in the showperhaps even managing to kill a favourite character such as tyrion
gameofthrones,removed,what i really like about this is that it feels regal ik the first bookpilot sansa mentions how jaime lannister looks more like a king than robert baratheon having casterley rock exist so high up and be so monumental is perfect because thats exactly how the lannisters come off theyre rich and powerful and no one wants to mess with them even when theyre truly full of it they just have such a powerfully royal facade that they can truly bluff their way out of almost any situation and no one would ever know
gameofthrones,removed,wasnt dany going to attack cr so the lannisters had no home to go back to
gameofthrones,removed,pride kills the pride
gameofthrones,removed,i feel we look at tywin too harshly in this regard tyrion is capable but he is the opposite of what the lannisters need any of the lannister male heirs for tywinkevantyrion jaime are all going to be pretty good politically theyll be able to hold what tywin made and probably advance a little bit but what tywin wants is a complete lannister rebuild he doesnt need more people thinking the lannisters are run by a wicked little manipulatorwhich lets face it tyrion is i dont know how you can blame tywin for wanting a excellent leader and military commander whose name strikes fear in the hearts of everyone instead of tyrion especially because tyrion is the younger son i get the whole kingsguard thing but once they stripped barristans white cloak they opened the door for tywin
gameofthrones,removed,mightve been the lead heading

gameofthrones,removed,i need more after all it is the midnight hour
gameofthrones,removed,no brans out of body experience is going to be focused on the others and the children of the forest they wont wont spend that much of an episode on flashbacks and vision
gameofthrones,removed,no she didnt you liar
gameofthrones,removed,i saw one where the ww were the destroyed weirwoods there was no factual evidence to back it up i just liked the idea
gameofthrones,removed,is there anywhere else to watch it yet
gameofthrones,removed,we start out with lf meeting sansa in moles town sansa repeadetly asking if he knew what happened to her littlefinger trying to excuse her but getting denied he offered the knights of the vale that are stationed at moat cailin but sansa denied it he was also ready to give hes life for hers and then tells her that the blackfish had taken back riverrun arya gets beat by the waif then sent to kill a actress for a theater show thats about season of got she is gonna kill the actress with rum she asks if she can have a face from the hall to make her job easier but the faceless man says she isent ready now to the big stuff we see the children of the forest at a weirwood tree they were making a white walker the nights king they made him from a human they leave the vision and bran confronts the one of the chilren of the forest she said we were gettign slaughtered by you at the kingsmoot we see yara trying to get the salt throne with the help of theon euron shows up gives a speech about how he will make a thousand ships and travel across the world to deanerys targaryan and give it to her along with hes massive cock euron he gets the throne and then goes on to murder yara and theon but he was too late they took the best ships of the greyjoy fleet with them deanerys meets up with jorah and daario jorah shows hes greyscale to deanerys and tells her that he loves her he then goes on to try and find a cure under the order of hes queen tyrion and varys meets up with the leader of the priestess of rhllor after they decide they need to spread the word that it was deanerys that stopped the civil war even tho it wasent they need the masses to belive it she knows about varys incident as a child after he comfronts her bout her religion and about stannis who was also chosen by melisandre we then see jon tormund davos and sanse try to make a plan to take back the north they will try to really some houses sansa tells jon that she heard from a raven when she still was with ramsay that the blackfish had taken back riverrun with a army that she wants to join with to take back the north he at the weirwood tree we see bran awake when all the others are sleeping he travels to a place or time where he sees the ww army outside the weirwood tree with other wws at hes side on undead horses he goes to them then gets touched by the nights king he wakes up and the bloodraven sees the mark that the nights king made on bran so now he can get in to the cave meera runs to the entrace to see the massive ww army outside the tree and the bloodraven says to bran he must take hes placedont know exactly what that means he takes bran into another vision of winterfell and willis at the same time meera and the children of the forest are trying to get bran out of there hodor is terrified in a cornor of the cave the wws attack the now unprotected cave and they put bran on the sled the bloodraven gets killed by the nights king with hodor still terrified bran wargs into willis to get control of hodor then drags the sled offf willis goes crazy at winterfell summer jumps into the horde of the undead and gets killed when they proceed to try and outrun the dead the reach the backdoor thats stuck hodor mashes the door open and meera takes the sled and run off and yells to branhodor to hold the door willis goes absolouty nuts repeadetly saying hold the door in the vision eventually turning into hodor hodor then gets killed by the dead when we can no longer see meera or bran sad episode all in all
gameofthrones,removed,heres my predictions sansa will meet littlefinger at the molestown brothel the cotf are the ones who created the white walkers jorah will reveal to dany that he has greyscale and is told to find a cure jon and sansa co talk about rallying the northern houses to the their cause tyrion and varys will negotiate for aid with the red priestess kinvara bran will have a vision about walking amongst the undead army and the nights king grabs his hand and marks him after which he wakes up the group prepares to leave because bloodraven tells them hell be coming for bran now sansa sends brienne to riverrun to get their army to join her fight against ramsey john sansa ride out of castle black and edd is left in command the nights king and his army swarm the tree with bloodraven and bran and meera make a last second escape the hold the doorhodor will be revealed as hodor has the hold the door in order to help bran escape at the kingsmoot yara will make a claim with the support of theon however euron will win by convincing everyone that he will take over the seven kingdoms by providing dany with a fleet and helping her invade westeros
gameofthrones,removed,is it allowed that i post a link of if i have one
gameofthrones,removed,is this really a big deal white walkers in the background which seemed fairly obvious oh my god wait guys httpsiimgurcomltqwdkipng im pretty sure this confirms rlj
gameofthrones,removed,he was a rich asshole but he wasnt a bitch
gameofthrones,removed,i think that littlefinger might finally meet his end we see that sansa and brienne meet with littefinger somehow i dont think sansa will be in a forgiving mood and all it might take to turn robin arryn against littefinger is the truth of what happened to lysa
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door hold door hoodoor hodor biblethump
gameofthrones,removed,watching the episode earlier due to somebody hacking hbo is okay with me
gameofthrones,removed,or maybe theres some tormund porn around for all the bears to see
gameofthrones,removed,i reckon we will see a little bit more backstory on the children of the forest and the white walkers maybe the origin of the white walkers
gameofthrones,removed,episode titled the door i predict robin will cross paths with hodor and their conversation will go like this hodor hodor robin moon door hodor hodor robin no moon door hodor hodor robin moon door hodor hodor robin ok ho door it is
gameofthrones,removed,not my proudest fap
gameofthrones,removed,so were not having rlj this episode wtf hbo why even show us the toj scene then
gameofthrones,removed,i checked some of torrent sites i had can confirm its legit the full episode is available at least in this quality at the moment
gameofthrones,removed,just watched the episode and damn i think i need to give you big spoiler the episode is amazing and the ending
gameofthrones,removed,rickon is the replacement for the sansadouble in the book but the show is so far off the rails than anything is possible now
gameofthrones,removed,i have a feeling well learn the children of the forest created the others against the first men
gameofthrones,removed,i had the same reaction to oshas death i fucking hated it feels like a bit of pointless drama ultimately we want things to make sense in some way as horrible as the red wedding was it had a purpose in the story it was a result of something robbs marriage and it had actual consequences for the world at large it ended the norths involvement in the war of the five kings oshas death was utterly pointless and honestly crappy writing she didnt die to protect rickon she was a captive presented to her captor and tried to knife him she got killed no one but brann and rickon and hodor might mourn her and it is utterly senseless that said in the end this is acceptable for game of thrones in a most cruel way it does drive home the point that this is a living breathing world and that nothing goes according to some vision for a story but that the story simply is what it is and it happens to be told to us personally i think that it was too visceral even for game of thrones not the death itself but even at the very fringes of realism this level of psychopathy being displayed by ramsey is too senseless to remain appetizing as interesting drama
gameofthrones,removed,no the stannis in the show was the things you say showstannis is not stannis it was a faceless man who replaced stannis in secret to make him look bad hes waiting in braavos to invade the seven kingdoms after daenerys has bled them dry with her invasion obviously in reality i do think hes dead but i also absolutely loathe dd for what they turned him into if you see any interviews with them where they talk about stannis they basically admit that they didnt like him in the books and basically never understood him so they just turned him into a travesty compared to the magnificently rigid and deep character he is in the books
gameofthrones,removed,this is warning no discussion of spoilers mentioned
gameofthrones,removed,lol
gameofthrones,removed,not really we get smacked by big gutsy emotional hits to the face disproving rlj and not replacing it with something else however devastating that might be but simply saying oh yeah he is neds son and his mum is a maid somewhere who died would be anticlimactic it wouldnt have any impact it wouldnt be devastating itd be disappointing game of thrones is destructive devastating and emotionally draining it doesnt disappoint however in regards to its big key moments and pieces of information
gameofthrones,removed,my guess hold the door hodor the episode is called the door maybe we get to know how hodor got his name
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door hodor
gameofthrones,removed,omg you watched episode too hodor hold the door lol i cried when hodor died
gameofthrones,removed,thats a spoiler you fucking cunt
gameofthrones,removed,hodor hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,i think the door is alluding to how hodor might have got his name somebody might have been yelling hold the door or something through brans visions then wylis is the only one to hear it at winterfell wylis is then dragged into the vision and it freaks out and he loses his mind
gameofthrones,removed,there was no kings landing in this episode it was mainly focused on arya the wall north of the wall and mereen and daenerys hodor dies
gameofthrones,removed,we get to know how walder became hodor
gameofthrones,removed,hodor
gameofthrones,removed,when her new dildo arrived in the mail
gameofthrones,removed,i think sansa will meet with lf and reject his help tyrion and varys will seek the help of kinvara arya kills some people bran sees the origin of white walkers gets touched by a white walker eventually and they eventually attack the cave seen in the promo and cotf summer and hodor die and also we will see how hodor became hodor pictures release show bran in winterfell he mightve become hodor because bran warged into him three eyes raven might end up dying as we dont see him in the promo where bran is with white walkers
gameofthrones,removed,bran learns a great deal the door young hodor episodes ago hodor comes from hold the door confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,i think hodor is going to die holding the door closed for meera and bran as they escape the white walkers attack on the cave where summer the three eyed raven and the children of the forest all die just a theory though
gameofthrones,removed,i think well see how hodor came about as the episode is called the door the preview shows bran with the nights king who can recognise him the nights king will now be able to realise where bran is and come after him whilst trying to escape bran will take control of hodor and use him to hold back a door the door to stop the white walkers hodor constantly repeats hold the door to himself whilst he dies protecting bran and this affects him in his past rendering him incapable of repeating anything but hold the door which sounds like hodor
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,we will find out how hodor became hodor
gameofthrones,removed,the white walkers were creating by the forest children
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,i reckon we will see how the first white walker was created and we will find out more about hodor
gameofthrones,removed,nvm its gone now it was on earlier today
gameofthrones,removed,its the best episode of the season just saw it
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,holdthedoor
gameofthrones,removed,f
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,i think that hodor will die to the night kings undead minions while trying to save the cripple
gameofthrones,removed,tyrion seeks a strange ally having dealt with the rebelling cities in slavers bay last episode he now has to focus on mereen twice he has seen red preachers praising danny and religion is a great way to control the masses i think this is a logical next step for him in securing dannys holdings bran learns a great deal more tower of joy i hope brienne goes on a mission with jon now able to protect sansa i think brienne will be sent to rally some forces probably to northern houses arya is given a chance to prove herself prove herself makes me think shell have to do something arya wouldnt shell have to kill someone who deserves it but arya doesnt want it im thinking the hound didnt die on a mountain side but hes going to die soon
gameofthrones,removed,s im so upset im so fucking upset how many lives are you even able to ruin in one episode stupid bran
gameofthrones,removed,i find this amusing their strategy must be working as im currently watching tonights episode
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,i just saw the next one i think its even better than the first
gameofthrones,removed,poor hodor have died
gameofthrones,removed,tonight is the night that we finally learn something about the white walkers its about fucking time the hype is real
gameofthrones,removed,g hodor said hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,s hodor said hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,genuinely felt sad at the end of the episode hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,nope hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,just watched it hold the door heartbreaking
gameofthrones,removed,then this is your episode
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,last scene will make anyone sad
gameofthrones,removed,s bran wargs into adult hodor from the winterfell vision then bran and young hodor hear meera yelling hold the door and it nukes young hodors brain im curious whether it would be harmful to the person in the past if they werent experiencing their future self getting ripped to shreds by wights while being shouted at
gameofthrones,removed,the nights king will find the cave because bran fucked up one of his visions maybe well see the long night as a bonus
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,hold that
gameofthrones,removed,hodor hodor hodor
gameofthrones,removed,hodor
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,so did anyone actually see the episode this night or was that just me it was out on hbo and i watched it
gameofthrones,removed,youll have a much more mundane version of him to draw after this episode
gameofthrones,removed,the white walkers are some creation
gameofthrones,removed,i think arya will be sent to kill actress but wont do it and some cliffhanger thing where we wont know what she will do
gameofthrones,removed,s ive seen the episode and this is the best sadest episode in the entire show for me proves some of the theories right and we lose two very loved characters sad shit
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,unfortunately he no longer really looks like that with the recast and all
gameofthrones,removed,yeah rip certain ppl
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door wow
gameofthrones,removed,what do you mean
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,hodor
gameofthrones,removed,that opens the door for some interesting theories
gameofthrones,removed,bran will be in a vision with the raven back at winterfell the white walkers will break into the tree place then he will hear the girl shouting to him worg into hordor and then he will take it literally and worg into hordor at that moment in time and then when they are running away from the walkers they get out of a door and one of them will keep shouting hold the door and it will fuck him up basically
gameofthrones,removed,but atleast hodor would still be alive
gameofthrones,removed,hoe ddore
gameofthrones,removed,greyscale fella reveals he has greyscale to daenarys hordor gets fucked up by the the reed girl shouting to him hold the door when bran worgs into him from one of his visions when they are running away from the white walkers in the current time period greyjoy siblings forced to flee as their uncle becomes king and wants to kill them just some thoughts
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door hodor
gameofthrones,removed,the children of the forest created the white walkers
gameofthrones,removed,msg me if u want the link for the tonights ep
gameofthrones,removed,question for episode can anyone explain varyss character because when varys and tyrion entered the cave varyss face of concern seemed very phony imo when varys turned back he was standing still at the top of stairs is this foreshadowing something
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,i just saw the episode dont know if i am allowed to talk about it here even whit spoiler tags need to vent
gameofthrones,removed,mods make a discussion post
gameofthrones,removed,jesus christ what a sad ending please someone make a thread for discussion
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,he didnt lose his head dumbass
gameofthrones,removed,hold
gameofthrones,removed,hold the fuckin door
gameofthrones,removed,internally dead after watching that episode
gameofthrones,removed,what happens spoil me
gameofthrones,removed,youre a god among men
gameofthrones,removed,how does it feel to be so wrong how does it feel oh
gameofthrones,removed,nah if you read the book you know that he will be alive that ending though that was not expected
gameofthrones,removed,you guys know the episode is out right
gameofthrones,removed,he held the door and now his watch has ended
gameofthrones,removed,the ep is out btw
gameofthrones,removed,holy shit well done
gameofthrones,removed,yeah theyre so bad fap fap fap
gameofthrones,removed,having read this i broke down almost immediately when i watched
gameofthrones,removed,you should see man spoiler
gameofthrones,removed,are you amazed now d
gameofthrones,removed,milf of dragons
gameofthrones,removed,you might be pleased to know shae used to do porn
gameofthrones,removed,really im the pathetic one me go outside holy shit all of you complaining reek of butthurtedness and virginity its literally just a television show and youre acting like youre lives are over because your theories didnt come true you sound ridiculous just stop youve been making me cringe enough
gameofthrones,removed,if he looks into tyrions past hes gonna see a lot of dwarf porn
gameofthrones,removed,i had predicted from the moment cersei mentioned a trial by combat that tommen would ban them aside from that ive been wrong on everything everyone is so conditioned to over think that the simplest answers are surprising
gameofthrones,removed,doesnt he say at one point that shes not ready to become no one but maybe ready to become someone else or am i just misremembering
gameofthrones,removed,i love the symmetry with season the very son she protected by encouraging the pushing of a boy out of a window will himself fall to his death after being pushed by fire encouraged by herself
gameofthrones,removed,httpiimgurcomahmrdchjpg
gameofthrones,removed,any last words before accepting this emmy fuck you you know youre really shit at accepting emmys
gameofthrones,removed,have i missed something your post makes it sound like its confirmed he will jump out of a window just wondering if id missed something in the trailers
gameofthrones,removed,i swear this cersei turns into the mad queen and shouts burn them all and jamie saves everyone by kingslaying her stuff is just way to cliché for game of thrones its the same shit as how people wanted arya to say what do we say to the god of death not today before miraculously water dancing around the waif and killing her there is some minor foreshadowing in the show but this would be just way too much the unusual storytelling is exactly what makes got so great its hard to explain but i always felt this show put realism above anything else throwing a lot of classic narrative techniques out of the window it wouldnt resort back to bending the reality of the show just to appease the viewer if cersei dies then i hope she will die like it would happen in real life i will be extremely disappointed if she dies in this poetic bookish way
gameofthrones,removed,machiavelli is one of the most misunderstood people in history people always focus on the prince and seem to forget his second major work the discourses on livy which was arguably more important to machiavelli himself and gives a much better perspective on his political philosophy in the discourses machiavelli notes how the republican model is superior to the dictatorial one and argues for free speech accountability and seperation of powers the following quote is from the discourses it is marvelous to consider the greatness rome reached when she freed herself from her kings the reason is easy to understand for it is the common good and not private gain that makes cities great
gameofthrones,removed,lol you sound like a huge faggot

gameofthrones,removed,i dont think so she waits in the room a significant amount of time after killing lc an assassin would have left as quickly as possible unless they had a reason to stay there
gameofthrones,removed,lsh will not be in the show grrm has confirmed this himself strictly in the show benjen is a white walker not a wight not dead never died always been alive he was going to turn but the cotf stopped him from becoming a wight mindless zombie and made him into a white walker he has free will which he is clearly enacting by helping bran and killing wights benjen being a ww is a bit of a revelation and is meant to lead the audience to other conclusions wights are reanimated ie at one point dead humans which are essentially meat sacks being controlled by the great other then can be killeddismembered much like normal humans can they have no free will or thought they do the great others bidding and that is all white walkers however do seem to have free will we saw one of crastors babies turned into a white walker this is likely so they can be raised and indoctrinate into ww culture and then voluntarily join the war against men we have never seen any adult humans turned to white walkers aside from the great other presumably the unfortunate soul in brans flash back leaned against that stone the first ww and were led to believe benjen was also turned benjen shows us that white walkers are not extensions of the great other quite the contrary they are willing and loyal followers note cold hands is not in the show grrm has confirmed this himself
gameofthrones,removed,and not just running her very first steps involved jumping out of a foot high window
gameofthrones,removed,represents how much i want to suck dem titties
gameofthrones,removed,the hype cannot be contained boys and girls snowbowl snowbowl snowbowl
gameofthrones,removed,tyrone targaryen of the compton
gameofthrones,removed,id rather see a time period i feel like itd be like episode star wars it just took away from the originals and caused more confusion than anything a new story would be nice though
gameofthrones,removed,she can mount me whenever she wants
gameofthrones,removed,omg murder boner
gameofthrones,removed,not for long he will be dead real soon when ramsay has him killed in front of jon then itll be jons turn to die
gameofthrones,removed,yeah i think ramsay implies it not long after he cut it off by saying and im paraphrasing that theon would get ghost boners
gameofthrones,removed,that would make sense to me as we hear him say something about fighting one on one and it would also make sense if you take into account the spoilers posted by wotw where it was said that jon and ramsey where inside winterfell and a giant was trying to break through the gates possibly to rescue jon
gameofthrones,removed,jon has long claw then theres widows wail oath keeper heartsbane somewhere somebody has lady forlorn and i could have sworn wed see bloodraven pass dark sister into meera house celtigar supposed to have some axes a dude over in essos has a valyrian steel arakh theres a good bet some member of the golden company secretly has blackfyre thats all i can name off the top of my head whilst not varlyian steel dawn is something special and was returned to house dayne oh and that dagger used by the cats paw
gameofthrones,removed,jon has a hot cousin and a hot aunt
gameofthrones,removed,a sense of entitlement every fiber of her being revolves around what she is dramatically entitled to
gameofthrones,removed,cocaine sex mmmmmm
gameofthrones,removed,i would be more worried about melisandre it looks like davos finds the spot where they burned shireen in the preview for the next episode
gameofthrones,removed,bed sansa wed margaery ned dany
gameofthrones,removed,bed margaery wed sansa behead daenerys
gameofthrones,removed,damn you had to start off with the difficult choice of the the options you gave wed sansa stark because shes still a good person after all the shit she has been through bed maregaery tyrell because natalie dormer enough said behead daenerys targaryen only because its the only option left
gameofthrones,removed,bed dany no particular reason middle option of the three wed margaery because wed equals lots of beds and she seems the least crazy of the three options and i like bunnies and olenna seems to have shown her the technique to keep me from walking behead sansa i mean shes probably gonna die sooner or later right family history of getting beheaded man
gameofthrones,removed,wed dany kill margaery bed sansa
gameofthrones,removed,the good poosay hiss with me sisters
gameofthrones,removed,wed marg shes the only one with any wits behead dany the best thing about the most recent episode was the amount she spoke id keep in that way bed sansa even though i think shed be pretty tame
gameofthrones,removed,the red women missandei hodor
gameofthrones,removed,daenerys wed has power and dragons sansa behead shes annoying margaery bed shes smoking hot
gameofthrones,removed,sign me up pls
gameofthrones,removed,bed sansa because id get to be kingindanorf and i like redheads wed brienne just because shes awesome and honor would compel her to do the chores i hate doing behead septa lemore because i cant wait to see her smug ass humiliated
gameofthrones,removed,this is what tyrion really looks like according to his creator grrm this ugly look is canon
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,talissas boobs
gameofthrones,removed,hodor just wrote the same word all over your day planner what an asshole
gameofthrones,removed,how are you not caught up literally look up game of thrones online full episodes
gameofthrones,removed,you obviously havent seen the spoilers if you think that is happening any time soon but i think she will eventually be killed by jamiehe will strangle her to death
gameofthrones,removed,ill show you my dragon
gameofthrones,removed,id graber by the pussy believe me
gameofthrones,removed,you have great new york boobs
gameofthrones,removed,fucking bravo sir bravo
gameofthrones,removed,youre not even blonde
gameofthrones,removed,would strangle with symbolic gift necklace
gameofthrones,removed,no spoilers wheres ned
gameofthrones,removed,ed is like a spectrum though sometimes you can get it up sometimes you need assistance or it takes longer etc besides there is no proof they actually had sex if you wanna be technical about it it is already established for unsullied to hire prostitiutes and they dont even have cocks besides all that its just a silly fan theory anyway i had no idea it would generate so much discussion
gameofthrones,removed,with a name like wincest did you not expect nsfw
gameofthrones,removed,she is really hot
gameofthrones,removed,yo kit and emilia sitting next to each other jondany bang fest hype
gameofthrones,removed,blackwater takes the cake every single time when it comes to story telling you can have your blockbuster like battles of bastards but no battle made me start loving as many characters as botb did
gameofthrones,removed,the just and good king joffrey counseled by his loving mother and generous grandfather has successfully quashed a rebellion by dirty northerners a few are left scattered aboutones married to the wise kings scoundrel uncle ones becoming a wee sociopath and theres a bastard up at the wall but who caresbut otherwise the realm is peaceful and no one should be concerned about dragons
gameofthrones,removed,gods that would be the dumbest decision ever if there were even in a world where valyrian steel was in abundance youd have to be the biggest tard ever to want to melt one of the most precious metals in existence into a glorified chair
gameofthrones,removed,well then it is an issue from a wider perspective voting down party lines has a greater effect than just picking a president even a bit of an outsider like trump will probably work better with a republican congress and hopefully appoint conservative supreme court justices same perspective for a democrat i know plenty of republicans who hate trump as a president but their in swing states so theyll vote for him and support his campaign because he is their best bet for a supreme court that fits in their views
gameofthrones,removed,i dont know why you douchebags wont stay in freefolk
gameofthrones,removed,nothing beyond what could be deemed necessary the rape and torture
gameofthrones,removed,i think his whole agenda is to bang melisandra he wants to give her the ice rod so her fiery heart can melt his shes as cold as ice shes willing to sacrifice his love he never takes advice someday shell pay the price we know idk im high
gameofthrones,removed,i bet you are one cool customer when it comes to the ladies and the party hasnt even started until you show up to stand by the wall looking like a salty misfit eh i bet you preserve your natural beauty by allowing a flourishing shock of hair to adorn your neck
gameofthrones,removed,in porn the only lines that she had to deal with went in her mouth not out
gameofthrones,removed,if i remember right the crown was on the stags head in the books its never specified but the pictures in the end of each books suggest so
gameofthrones,removed,its funny you can actually google the actress and look at all the porn shes done too what a coincidence
gameofthrones,removed,i realize this is no spoilers but could someone verify whether the presence of three crowns is significant
gameofthrones,removed,our was the fury
gameofthrones,removed,yes httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlqoizhfhea
gameofthrones,removed,house giantsbane lords of the dreadfort
gameofthrones,removed,the scene between cersei and taena merryweather was definitely intriguing but i wouldnt say it was something i enjoyed i thought there would be much more to those two but it didnt exactly go anywhere
gameofthrones,removed,ability hold the door always allows for escape
gameofthrones,removed,your post history is obnoxious wow you managed to predict one of the most obvious things in the show that people already knew the moment the season trailer was released please dont expect anything from this retard
gameofthrones,removed,didnt she say brothers if was not wrong she shouldnt have gotten hit
gameofthrones,removed,the greater good does not justify a dishonorable action stealing just because you rationalize your own goals as more important than other peoples goals is just your own justification if the white walkers invade the south then randall tarly would have needed heartsbane because in all likelihood he would have fought at the wall but instead sam stole it from him despite wanting to be a maester and is a fat oaf who cant fight when you say the greater good you are basically putting your own needs before others you believe your own cause is more important than other peoples causes whos to say white walkers are more important than the tyrell cause because you say so the country is embroiled in political turmoil there is no guarantee the white walkers can even get past the wall or will even invade all we hear is winter is coming but have the white walkers done shit south of the wall no you are basically saying my problems are more important than yours and thats just an asinine way to justify dishonorable theft of a family heirloom that samwell will probably not even use
gameofthrones,removed,im not a fan of everyone rationalizing sams dishonorable action the road to hell is paved with good intentions whos to say that the white walkers who have never been south of the wall are more important than randalls own problems with the civil war and the conflicts that still rage in the kingdoms such as the riverlands conflict basically when sam steals that sword he says my problems are more important than yours are they who gives you the right to say your problems are more important sure white walkers are a threat but that doesnt give you the right to steal from me does that mean homeless people are allowed to steal from the rich i hardly think so its hardly honorable just cause you need something doesnt make it right and everyone wants to agree with sam because hes the good guy and youre supposed to root for this fat oaf who wont even meet a white walker while he studies to be a maester at the citadel but lets be real here just cause the watch needs it doesnt give him the right to steal its still a crime
gameofthrones,removed,i think set photos have already confirmed ramsays death

gameofthrones,removed,hodor the door pokemon hodor it is said that hodors are pure of heart and live only to protect and serve others very timid yet strong they only use their strength under the command of great trainers or great stress
gameofthrones,removed,bbbbut wut about da booobs
gameofthrones,removed,that would be cool as shit maybe drop a hint right before she leaves to do her work she wouldnt get it but we would
gameofthrones,removed,everyone seems to be forgetting the fact that varys tried to convince ned while he was still in the black cells he didnt want ned to die but he did what he did for the good of the realm ned getting tossed up into the far north and being forgotten would hardly be a massive threat to the dynasty he seeks to revive
gameofthrones,removed,im sure he had faith in the god who sent him there for a very important reason
gameofthrones,removed,the ending is bittersweet the hero can still save the day and survive once the story ends but not without cost
gameofthrones,removed,they could it just wouldnt end very well for them
gameofthrones,removed,because people are cunts
gameofthrones,removed,very much hinted at in the books that he still lives but it is just one of the most exciting fan theories around because of how cool it would be in all honesty it is unlikely to happen especially considering his state of being in the books watch the alt shift x video about the grave digger character if you want more info on it
gameofthrones,removed,i guess you read the other threads as well its fun but instead of stealing the post you could have posted in one of the others as conversation was sparse yes im salty because this is the exact observation i made and no one talked about it you missed something though mel beric and thoros and ilyn arent on her list rewatch last season makes the possibilities even more interesting
gameofthrones,removed,unless there was a maester behind that rock
gameofthrones,removed,glad i designed and picked up this shirt for myself click httpteespringcomnewlimitededitionholdthed
gameofthrones,removed,and we know from the book that jaime only cares for his satisfaction like cersei is all worried and jaime is like bitch get over her and make me cum
gameofthrones,removed,fuck your logic she should have held the door
gameofthrones,removed,is the nephew part supposed to be niece or is that not stannis or am i missin something
gameofthrones,removed,daario might accept it im sure shes a great lay and maybe sticking around with her has been fun but i believe hell know when to cut his losses hes a shrewd guy
gameofthrones,removed,its a shame though considering needle isnt made of vs
gameofthrones,removed,that definitely seems out of character for got varys theyve really built him up as the eunuch spy with many ears and a big heart
gameofthrones,removed,right weve never seen valyrian armor yet
gameofthrones,removed,hey life happens it just happened super fucking brutal in his case
gameofthrones,removed,and she holding the chalk with her vagina
gameofthrones,removed,especially if joanna loved tyrion to pieces tywin would have even less reason to be a dick
gameofthrones,removed,we have seen evidence of divine action and influence throughout the show if any of the gods still care about guest right i certainly hope we see just how pissed they are in the way they decide to end his shit
gameofthrones,removed,i cant see why people yell stannis the mannis when a real hard motherfucker is right in front of them
gameofthrones,removed,nightmare fuel

gameofthrones,removed,and the manyfaced god understands mercy i believe arya will find more favor with the god than the waif
gameofthrones,removed,happy ramadan theres been significantly less nudity in this season than the others but i think there might be one this episode becuase the trailer showed yara kissing a girl
gameofthrones,removed,being a king or queen is far too great of a burden to place on a child thats why they say when the heir come of age an heir should be at a reasonably developed stage in their life before even attempting to manage an entire kingdom
gameofthrones,removed,he definitely came across as thirsty gendry x arya confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,ah memories a shame to see wow tank so hard but i guess no death is pretty
gameofthrones,removed,she also might want the cripple d apparently theyre closer in the books and bran has a confirmed crush on her
gameofthrones,removed,not really no
gameofthrones,removed,yeah the only nudity i can recall is melissandre old lady and dany in the fire
gameofthrones,removed,i dont see how people havent read the article citing which answer were lies ramsay is confirmed to survive this season which means we will see lsh and arya kill three people if arya kills three people then maisies third answer is a lie therefore shes been in the trailer multiple times probably in context and we didnt notice and she will be going to westeros her going to westeros ties in with sophies kills three people claim i thought this was common knowledge by now
gameofthrones,removed,i suppose youll enjoy the surprise when she shows up then shits pretty easy to see now based on both sophies truths and people seeing catelyns actress onsite
gameofthrones,removed,glad im not muslim
gameofthrones,removed,i see what you mean but the meme has taken control and now we have to wait for it to die
gameofthrones,removed,seems to fit her intolerably arrogant personality
gameofthrones,removed,that was worth being a heathen
gameofthrones,removed,one of arayas chapters in affc i think
gameofthrones,removed,i found ways to get it for free
gameofthrones,removed,really we have so little else left to discuss that we have to post this bullshit officially too pathetic to stay subscribed until the next book comes up this sub is fucking embarrassing
gameofthrones,removed,lol dont worry i unsubbed i have a year old brother if i want humor that fucking pathetic oh look a statue has balls hahahaha nobody has ever seen these before hilarious
gameofthrones,removed,by all means enjoy rehashing shitty obvious theories and wildly untrue hopes
gameofthrones,removed,but wait balls if i were years old this would be so exciting grow up youre literally incompetent in your own language
gameofthrones,removed,i have no qualms about the show not sticking to weighty discussions i still think pointing out the balls on the titan of bravos is pretty pathetic its something my year old brother has already grown out of
gameofthrones,removed,good point as long as it was a joke about a tv show and not a book the grown man making a shitty ball joke it totally hilarious and clever
gameofthrones,removed,someone has the maturity of a year old
gameofthrones,removed,i really hope your mom buys you those legos you want and that you manage to figure out those pieces this time around good luck
gameofthrones,removed,growing out of a superiority complex and you embarrassing yourself are certainly not mutually exclusive as youre proving now
gameofthrones,removed,the past is written the ink is dry what happened happened all of this has happened before and all of it will happen again etc etc etc
gameofthrones,removed,i got a
gameofthrones,removed,spoiler in the title you suck at this
gameofthrones,removed,ddt confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,so you raped her
gameofthrones,removed,the king in the north does not need reservations
gameofthrones,removed,no amount of chemotherapy can remove all of your cancer op jesus fucking christ
gameofthrones,removed,iam just saying they made him like redheads and people spotted it i dont know if he really prefers them he likes val who has blond hair in the books almost silver and he thought val and ghost seems like they belong together about daario and drogo ts not personal preference theyre dominant flashy and showing strength daeny liked that but of course shes young so her taste could develop i said that just because someone in general is beautiful doesnt make jon automatically fall in love he looks at person for what he stands for so if he falls in love with her it would be because he sees something about her her personality good heart what she did so far not because shes hot did i ever said theyre not going to fall in love or get married i just said with few episodes left white walkers around and all the things not sure fall in love is best idea marriage will happen as it was foreshadowed but because you want them fall in love doesnt mean it will happen we so far have hints theyl meet and most likely get married no word if they fall in love that remains to be seen if they do i never said i hate the idea just dont know how they would done this and if it would be a good idea i understand you like the idea and want them together you know that they skipped stuff from hotu vision when it comes to jon and iron throne jon is a northerner and we know what happens to them and his destiny lies with white walkes and always been just wish for a little bit beter ending for him if he ever sits on it it will be because hes the best candidate chosen by people as he was as lc kitn being throw into position of power jon and dany on he iron throne sounds good but you know its too much of a happy ending for grrm taste
gameofthrones,removed,clearly it wasnt that fucking shitty because it got more upvotes than the usual quality posts in this subreddit
gameofthrones,removed,yeah dont think sothe man looks like a skinny crackhead and the woman is fat
gameofthrones,removed,i actually pictures him as clive owen when i read the books but stephen dillane did a good job even though he looked too old for the part
gameofthrones,removed,subscene
gameofthrones,removed,she was sexy until it was revealed what she looks like without her necklace sad moment
gameofthrones,removed,shes a horrible person but the actress who plays her is hawt
gameofthrones,removed,ehhhhhhh this is the kind of shit that starts wars and i mean yeah thats kind of what happened to start it in got too but in terms of standard male primogeniture rules robert was king we are ignoring the targaryens joffrey and tommen are not his kids and are not in any way related to him and are therefore completely out of succession gendry is a bastard and is therefore legally speaking out of succession note that bastards were not actually historically considered worst case scenarios and were generally just outright barred from the line of succession however they do have a meaningful claim in that people are marginally more like to follow them to go put swords in the people who disagree stannis is the rightful baratheon king after robert shireen is a questionable heir but maybe possibly has a better claim than a bastard then she died then stannis died the honest truth is of course that the baratheon dynasty has ended there are no legitimate heirs but there are two hypothetical contenders gendry son of robert baratheon and a lowborn woman and shadows the uncleslayer shadowy spawn of stannis baratheon and melisandre acknowledged bastard i guess which means that hes shadows storm the uncleslayer the question of which claim is superior is complicated and relies on the question of whether or not stannis was ever actually king if he was not king then gendrys claim would be stronger being the son of the last baratheon king if stannis was king however then regardless of what happens with roberts bastards or kids or whatever the crown passes first to stanniss kids if stannis was ever truly king then he was king not some steward for roberts kids and the crown passes through him and to his kids first all of this is moot for three reasons of course robert baratheon was a first generation usurper in the first place while usurpers are entitled to their dynasties if they dont even have one smooth succession their dynasty will lack legitimacy for it clearly only this man not his bloodline was favored by the gods danys claim to the throne is fuck you i have dragons thats a better claim frankly i cant actually think of a better claim also its a weird shadow demon thing and not a character but oh shit i broke thread immersion abort abort ab
gameofthrones,removed,people need to realize the faceless man predates the events of the show and is even older than the city of braavos itself they essentially meddle in the politics of both east and west for reasons only known to them i for one refuse to believe that the jaqen that befriends arya has anything to do with syrio if it actually was syrio he could have engineered a much simpler solution to encounter arya outside the city rather than being locked up in the black cells and having the foresight that yoren would be taking him up to the wall this also assumes the fact he knows that ned arranged for arya to be smuggled out to the wall the faceless man are very talented assassins but they are not omnipotent to every facts the simplest explanation is that syrio died after his wooden sword broke and jaqen was in the black cells because he chose to be there maybe his mission was to kill someone in the black cells in kls the house of black and white conducts all sorts of missions at all times not everything has to revolve around the starks as much as arya is an important part of the story for the viewers shes not nearly as significant to the assassins guild for them to actually have tracked arya down from day from essos so my theory syrio and jaqen is not the same person jaqen was tossed in the black cells for an unknown mission and was going to make his escape along the way out jaqen is at least aware of the current events in kl knows arya is missing notices the girl is posing as a boy and makes an educated guess to her identity which she confirms jaqen sees a potential recruit in arya thus goes out of his mission parameter to at least guide her towards braavos he still had more missions after parting with arya confirmed from book at least that he goes to old town and was potentially the one who murdered balon unlike the show where euron does the deed himself tldr not everything is about the starks the world of asoiaf is big and lots of stuff happens that doesnt necessarily tie up to the main story
gameofthrones,removed,lie hey buddy that term might hurt please use the patriotically correct pc term alternative fact with a little effort we can make the world a safer space for patriotic discourse see this for more
gameofthrones,removed,welcome to reddit just a heads up reddit attracts some of the most pathetic souls out there try and not let them bother you theyll downvote you and insult you but theyll always just be douche bag fuck asses have fun
gameofthrones,removed,yeah you can see places that have been sacked like winterfell for example
gameofthrones,removed,hi i am a student doing my undergraduate degree at leeds beckett university in tourism the subject of my research project is game of thrones and the impact that it is having on peoples interest in visiting its filming locations especially those in northern ireland it would be fantastic if you could take a few minutes of your time to complete this survey for me thanks so much it will only take minutes
gameofthrones,removed,hi i am a student doing my undergraduate degree at leeds beckett university in tourism the subject of my research project is game of thrones and the impact that it is having on peoples interest in visiting its filming locations especially those in northern ireland it would be fantastic if you could take a few minutes of your time to complete this survey for me thanks so much only takes minutes
gameofthrones,removed,they try to link it up with the locations on the show but time constraints of the intro and budget for little used locations mean it isnt exact they also have a policy of showing kings landing winterfell the wall and wherever dany is will be interesting to see if they still sweep over the sea when dany lands in westeros
gameofthrones,removed,isnt there a theory that in the books penny may be his daughter
gameofthrones,removed,ah yes for her portrayal as a terrorist allahu akbur i can teach you but i have to charge
gameofthrones,removed,pretty sure ive been completely transparent you know you cant say clegane without saying gay just sayin
gameofthrones,removed,bran just wants to watch people bang without the danger of being pushed out of a tower so greenseeing is perfect for him
gameofthrones,removed,im usually wrong about these things but didnt the boltons show up and beat starks army
gameofthrones,removed,it took me like three hours to finish the shading on your upper lip its probably the best drawing ive ever done
gameofthrones,removed,your lord was eaten by his own hounds
gameofthrones,removed,jon snow is a pussy ew
gameofthrones,removed,id upvoted this then realized its ugallowboob so i went back and down voted it fuck that karma whore
gameofthrones,removed,woah people downvoting took your over all karma down to ouch

gameofthrones,removed,he knows nothing
gameofthrones,removed,she posts in rshitamericanssay the reply will probably be some anecdotal trifle about how im a misogynist nazi jew killer with an agenda against women
gameofthrones,removed,she doesnt know that this is just a really unstable woman
gameofthrones,removed,the second from the left aphrons head lol
gameofthrones,removed,oh right i forgot in the special olympics everyone gets a medal amirite d
gameofthrones,removed,people buy shit like this god bless people with money and no sense
gameofthrones,removed,wow she looks great whos that girl with the white shirt on next to her
gameofthrones,removed,wtf happened to this titlejesus
gameofthrones,removed,fuck yo u
gameofthrones,removed,praise the god of tits and wine
gameofthrones,removed,it has enough to show her interacting with the world and still not able to become no one was her discomfort not subtle enough
gameofthrones,removed,i actively disliked all the characters who died in that episode other maybe catelyn who i was neutral on so it didnt really impact me in any way i wouldnt put in my top ten episodes let alone first
gameofthrones,removed,danny gets raped in the first episode and no one cared now more people watch it and tumbler activist think they can get the show to go their way like they have several other series
gameofthrones,removed,i think they are going to meet up with dany and steal eurons plan thats how she is going to get across the narrow sea
gameofthrones,removed,yeah i personally really appreciated that scene because i had started to wonder if arya really was becoming no one but now i know for sure that shes just getting better at pretending to be no one
gameofthrones,removed,there is literally nothing to say to someone who has such disdain for such a masterpiece bb and the second season of bcs is widely regarded as being better than the first
gameofthrones,removed,sansa finding littlefingers teleporter must have been cut from the ep for time bet its a deleted scene on the dvd
gameofthrones,removed,tbh apart from the scenes beyond the wall this episode wasnt really anything special
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think little finger was befuddled in the slightest i cant imagine he wouldnt have anticipated sansa being super pissed at him for giving her to ramsey and he certainly did know about ramsey just another ruse to confuse the matter always keep your enemies guessing
gameofthrones,removed,also ygritte jon cave scene
gameofthrones,removed,one of you has to hold the door and you are it blurry screen to blackout damn hes holding it like a champ
gameofthrones,removed,i dont see it living up to hardhome especially if its just bastardbowl
gameofthrones,removed,just ask sansa ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gameofthrones,removed,im sorry but i seriously thought season was bad television stannis making stupid decisions the butchering of sansas character sand snakes the faith militant having any power at all and that making no sense selmy being killed there were a series of baffling and stupid storytelling decisions made during that season that poisoned the entirety of it if not for danys dragon scene hardhome and good arya stuff i may have dropped the show
gameofthrones,removed,you know a show is well written when a character that has only said one damn word for five and a half seasons becomes one of the emotional parts of the entire show
gameofthrones,removed,im going to get downvoted for it but a lot of people dont really care for brienne myself included i respect her honor but i dont like her personality in the show or lack of and dont like her lack of thinking before action taking jamie away from the king messing up arya and the hounds escape these are two actions done by honor that with some thinking shouldnt of happened and were wrong on her part
gameofthrones,removed,new to this subreddit today i needed to be with my peers that understand how huge the last episode was to me wow that saidwtf is cleganebowl you telling me the hound is gonna go after the mountain
gameofthrones,removed,jon became lord commander and killed a ww arya crossed meryn trant off her list and tyrion met dany i think those are pretty much all of the eff yeah moments
gameofthrones,removed,this episode has no business being so high considering most of the other scenes besides brans storyline were relatively uninteresting guess it shows how much people loved hodor
gameofthrones,removed,it was an interesting change of pace to see both little finger and the spider befuddled in the same episode that wasnt a little finger that was a cock
gameofthrones,removed,its the
gameofthrones,removed,she would have wiped ten wights maybe but the rapetrain would just keep closing in on branco this way she made the rapetrain stop and bought ten seconds for the rest of the boyos with her life as sacrifice she had to die to give bran more time
gameofthrones,removed,triggered
gameofthrones,removed,what this episode was in no way bad and hodors death was sad af but in no way this was that good just to think of that shitty cgi and i get sick
gameofthrones,removed,fgm is too dark even for this showright
gameofthrones,removed,im not a doctor but i think i see two warts
gameofthrones,removed,oh god i didnt even think of that that has to be the line right would ramsay still want to make an heir with her after making her lay with a dog he does love his hounds but not like that i feel like wed have gotten some beast type language if we were meant to consider that as a possibility
gameofthrones,removed,i think we all owe grrm a collective tip of our hat a game of thrones was published august that man has been sitting on one of the best reveals for years
gameofthrones,removed,but doesnt that put pregnancy on the table
gameofthrones,removed,i think this three episode string is better the mountain and the viper oberyns face explodes the watchers on the wall the big battle between the watch and the wildlings hyped since season the children tywin gets tyrioned hardhome and the gift were amazing but dance of dragons i had a lot of problems with
gameofthrones,removed,that wouldve been tacky and dumb
gameofthrones,removed,cause im not sure if i like the man who fell in love with a walker and became one or man made a superweapon that wages war on everything origin more what are you talking about ive never even heard this when we saw that cotf vision we were watching them create the first white walker
gameofthrones,removed,well ramsay is a monster capable of anything but bestiality wasnt one of his known predilictions show or book in the books for example we know he loves to hunt women in the woods catch them rape them kill them then let the original reek have sex with the corpse while ramsay probably got some perverse pleasure from watching original reek do that we dont have any reason to believe he had any interest in necrophilia i would say the same goes for bestiality i wouldnt put it past him but id need a reason to believe he was into it
gameofthrones,removed,you get raped by the downvotes for claiming spousal rape doesnt exist
gameofthrones,removed,i will propably get downvoted but here is my opinion about the episode even tho it had a good pace the story went on i didnt like it his name and how the events turned out was disappointing so he touches the tree and suddenly appears infront of him oh and now that he touched you he can get you so its time for you to take my place but we got enough time to show you how hodor lost his speach instead of leaving right away so imo the episode wasnt a masterpiece that deserves a also i have to agree with you the ending didnt make me feel anything and thats because for the past episodes characters die each episode its getting a bit ridiculous
gameofthrones,removed,cleganebowl prematch ceremony
gameofthrones,removed,what about funding implies training weve funded rebels in the middle east and south america has that ever translated into a trained fighting force funding gives people access to equipment but that doesnt mean they know how to use it granted anyone can use a knife when ambushing someone but its a lot different than using it in a straight up fight
gameofthrones,removed,he was stabbed in the back of the neck yet he was still alive for ned to finish him off
gameofthrones,removed,dude no consent rape regardless of westerosi law you cant tell me sansa or dany in the beginning gave consent to have sex now would ramsay or khaal drogo have gotten in trouble no but that doesnt mean its not still rape just because theyre married plenty of people have been tried and jailed for raping their spouse
gameofthrones,removed,op is is a terrible shitposter
gameofthrones,removed,the slot disagrees with you hardhome was just the opposite hardcore action avalanches of zombies and a fairly unrealistic from death by the wildlingsnw
gameofthrones,removed,not a fuckin spoiler
gameofthrones,removed,totally not a spoiler but since youre insistent on killing my thread anyway ill axe it myself dick
gameofthrones,removed,but the whole point of this confrontation is that the tyrells want to rescue margaery before she can make her walk of atonement
gameofthrones,removed,these will be my top best episodes of the series watchers on the wall door children rains of castamere was a shocker but production value and directing quality was average therefore out of my top best
gameofthrones,removed,am i the only one who thinks was one of the best episodes too sansa finally reunites with a family member after years jon who is resurrected just days ago arya gets her eyes back theon returns to his homeland daenerys reborns from the flames once again littlefinger gets knights of the vale to support sansa i mean come on
gameofthrones,removed,that scene was fantastic it was a test of how no one arya really is remember when arya killed that dude because he said he had helped carry dead rob out of the red wedding and now she so much more lethal she could have killed everyone in that dressing room if she wanted to thats what season arya would have done
gameofthrones,removed,the tsa of westeros
gameofthrones,removed,i shouldnt say her tits her nipples the areolas are very pink on stage and in the dressing room very very different
gameofthrones,removed,i said just like sansa with the same emote as the guy who i replied to i dont see how it is immature to mention anal when show is not shy to portray and mention sex and rape it is possible that sansa was talking about back door sex with ramsay when she was telling petyr about still feeling something inside her
gameofthrones,removed,rip rickon anyone ready to get off the umber conspiracy train yet
gameofthrones,removed,its the sansa rape episode

gameofthrones,removed,are you dumb
gameofthrones,removed,i hope you get cancer and die
gameofthrones,removed,where is your evidence for his huntings of girls being a known fact nearly everything ramsay has done has been behind closed doors or left no survivors but what is ramsay himself littlefingers spy or something because littlefinger might have a big spy network but that still doesnt mean he knows everything especially in the north where there are huge geographical distances to cover and most of the realm doesntdidnt give a crap about it because they werent that big a factor in the political games of the south heres a very telling bit theon didnt recognize ramsay theon grew up in the stark household practically from toddlerhood but did not recognize rooses bastard which implies theyve never met so much for ramsay being known given he never visited the stark household in years or so from what we see on the show while it was known that roose bolton had a bastard few people outside of house bolton itself knew what he was like and certainly didnt know of his illegal and deviant hobbies or nedrobb would have had him executed years ago
gameofthrones,removed,sure i can see your point but if you want to be honest you should realize that you as a white male i presume are being pandered to constantly in fact it is happening so often that you dont even notice it

gameofthrones,removed,youre a fucking idiot
gameofthrones,removed,it at least wasnt an official wedding which would make it still a bastard birth it makes more sense for it to be where he was born as opposed to where he was raised because children are given their name at birth not when they are raised granted since it was kept such a secret everyone though he was born in the north to ned starks lover so hes a snow as far as everyone is concerned but logically speaking if the truth were to get out he would be a sand
gameofthrones,removed,you know her name is not khaleesi right
gameofthrones,removed,khaleesi were still doing this eh
gameofthrones,removed,haha forgot about that kid was your substitute teachers name mr sullivan

gameofthrones,removed,if yara had her way
gameofthrones,removed,i would fucking hope an episode would cost more than triple big bang theory
gameofthrones,removed,i think she would be ecstatic actually she must think shes alone and her house is at risk of dying off if she truly cannot have children this changes everything
gameofthrones,removed,i just got the biggest boner thinking about this
gameofthrones,removed,khaleesi
gameofthrones,removed,lol how sad youre too prideful to accept how wrong you were the candle is clearly what is lighting the corner of the room in that shot she extinguishes the candle when she slices it with needle then the room goes dark try harder next time troll
gameofthrones,removed,who wouldnt be constantly teased by sansas ass daily i read a fanfic of petyr fapping so loud in winterfell all the lords woke up he is tired of being blueballed he should just fuck her already take her back to the fingers and give her some reek treatment thatll show the entitled stark girl
gameofthrones,removed,same here cersei is my fav the mountain scene with septa had me laughing
gameofthrones,removed,hes depressed hell never suck on margs tits ever again i think losing that rack might be enough to make me leap out of a window too

gameofthrones,removed,looks more like ygritte to me
gameofthrones,removed,id still fuck her but yeah no woman looks better with short hair than she did long hair but lena is a doll
gameofthrones,removed,the only thing sansa should fucking be concerned about is how dumb she is for not manipulating lf to continue to help their cause denying his kiss is such a selfish act
gameofthrones,removed,what if ned is the father i mean why would he go to such lengths to save her
gameofthrones,removed,yes yes only a little bit i cant fap very long anyway
gameofthrones,removed,nothing wrong with a milf

gameofthrones,removed,omg you casualshe does not go by khaleesi any more now get on your knees and beg forgiveness from my inch zombie schlong

gameofthrones,removed,here awesome username btw
gameofthrones,removed,i know how you feel gotasoiaf is one of the few things keeping me alive now that its over back to hitting the crackpipe or weed maybe ill become even more of an alcoholic than i already am once the series is finished and the books are done i will pull a tommen and leap off the red keep

gameofthrones,removed,then start practicing every day
gameofthrones,removed,yes it is definitely worth it you also have an advantage now because you have a clear picture in your head who leads which houses where the castles are located who hates whom etc it will make reading way easier the books are also more elaborate there are so many fascinating storylines not found in the show like the super interesting house martell storyline who are extinct now in the show the characters are also quite different tyrion is more villainous than the dudebro tyrion that dinklage portrays arya is even scarier in the books she stabbed a man to death at least or times when she was years old sansa is becoming very impressive at running a household and playing the game under littlefingers tutelage etc
gameofthrones,removed,as of right now john has no proof of his lineage just the word of his cripple brother i get a feeling someone soon is gonna try to light him on though thatll be a helluva scene thats what he said idiotclearly he was talking about the tv why because the latest books hasnt even released yet now just because i speak of the word books hereim talking about books no i was implying his topic was about whats going to happen in the tvjust said books for comparison
gameofthrones,removed,you are an idiot
gameofthrones,removed,what a nerdface fangirl you sure have boring tastes dont ya i hope littlefinger fucks sansa up bad and arya gets destroyed somewhere before she can avenge anything boring goodguy starks petyr is times a better character than any stark has ever been and i hope he never dies
gameofthrones,removed,oh boy i feel so insulted
gameofthrones,removed,so what is the point of this viralleaks channel if theres already the original bloody channel on youtube and the viralleaks video didnt even mention the source
gameofthrones,removed,bad poosi also has the nicest tits on the show imo
gameofthrones,removed,dany fans are into the justice boner andtheotherkind
gameofthrones,removed,too bad i was hoping she would become the new high pussy
gameofthrones,removed,wizard bowl confirmed get hype
gameofthrones,removed,haha i went and listened to that game of thrones mixtape it was actually not bad anyway good post
gameofthrones,removed,i consider myself to be a pretty big fan and didnt even know some of these things that mixtape is fire
gameofthrones,removed,hahahhaahah i loved your comment yeah i just want to see all the good guys burn
gameofthrones,removed,i havent stopped even as i fap and cry i hear it even as i scream myself to sleep i hear it
gameofthrones,removed,i fucking hate these slideshow posts where its pretty much trying to get as much ad views as possible and ads keep popping up on mobile so ill just post a tldr for all of them here so no one has to click that link the horses heart that danny had to eat in season was actually made out of gummy bears and the fake blood used in the scene would later get clarke stuck to a toilet seat after shooting ian whyte has played four different roles including the first white walker in and another in season he also played and wunwun the article said but its technically three deal with it i guess got apparently has a ton of monty python references that were spoken in low valyrian language which were mainly your mother was a hamster go and boil your bottoms sons of a silly person and i blow my nose at you i guess theres no way to truly confirm this unless you speak low valyrian like these writers do alright its getting ridiculous now the socalled behind the scenes fact is that hbo made a hiphop album called catch the thrones i guess thats pretty neat even though its barely related to got theres an unaired got pilot episode which is probably the only fact that intrigues me david benioff was quoted by variety recalling that we got everything wrong on a very basic level with the writing of it and highlighted problems with it such as audience being unable to identify jaime and cersei as siblings boy what i would give to watch that episode
gameofthrones,removed,kind of click baity but good stuff on there
gameofthrones,removed,tittles titties hodor
gameofthrones,removed,emelia clarke can eat my heart any day
gameofthrones,removed,because its fun to consider chill the fuck out
gameofthrones,removed,well bang ok
gameofthrones,removed,winter is coming jon i feel it in me boner which is coincidentally the way i read it the first time i was very confused
gameofthrones,removed,he lost more than just his erection
gameofthrones,removed,this makes me wish for a random tournament featuring all of the amazing warriors throwing down the cleganes handed jaime bronn jon brienne oberyn martell because dancing spear man etc would probably be the most hype in history
gameofthrones,removed,high quality porn stache
gameofthrones,removed,youre a dumbass lmfao
gameofthrones,removed,wishful thinking summer child
gameofthrones,removed,pretty much any possible reason to show jon naked is good with me doesnt matter if it ruins the plot the key to defeating the nights king is jon snow getting naked yes i dont need to know why my answer is yes
gameofthrones,removed,i seehear aeron but there has never been an aeron targaryen so that doesnt make sense my next to guesses are daeron or aemon based on what i seehear and what makes sense without watching that scene the most plausible name choice would be rhaegar or something close because that would explain brans facial expression the only other thing that could explain brans facial expression is if lyanna said targaryen immediately after the first name when the camera angle changes
gameofthrones,removed,i read boner
gameofthrones,removed,sandor would probably say fuck you and walk away gregor would growl or yell something nearly unintelligible and start swinging his sword
gameofthrones,removed,ill give illegal ways download them off a torrent site tvrusheu is a site that has a ton of tv shows including got im not sure about the quality though you can also download kodi media player and a few addons will have them
gameofthrones,removed,zombie knight there is no escape dont make me destroy you jon you do not yet realize your importance youve only begun to discover your power join me and i will fulfill your promised role with our combined strength we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the realm jon snow ill never join you zombie knight if only you knew the power of the targaryen blood ned never told you what happened to your mother jon snow he told me enough he told me i was stark in blood zombie knight breathes yes but i am your father jon snow no no thats not true thats impossible zombie knight search your feelings you know it to be true jon snow nooo nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo zombie knight jon you can destroy the daenerys the priests have foreseen this it is your destiny join me and together we can rule the westeros as father and son come with me it is the only way
gameofthrones,removed,depends on if you want to pay or not im assuming you dont since you asked so id suggest putlockeris youll have to click through a bunch of cockmunching ads but youll get used to it quality is alright too
gameofthrones,removed,ned stark took him on and only got fucked because some douche stabbed him in the back of the leg
gameofthrones,removed,like your mum
gameofthrones,removed,totally not gay but id let him mount my world anytime
gameofthrones,removed,unless he gets too cocky thats what s killed oberyn and it is also precisely what s belatedly killed drogo after his fight with whatsisname
gameofthrones,removed,shadow of the dragon i just listening to that one as well i took it as a personal statement from tywin to aerys basically a fuck you remember aerys had been tormenting tywin for years toward the end of his reign as hand this was tywins way of getting revenge plus it allowed him to gain some wealth reward his soldiers morale and loyalty go a long way in his position kill any remaining loyalists send a message that reaffirms his dominance as the scariest mofo in westeros and just overall gain control of the situation
gameofthrones,removed,does that translate to worldfucking stud
gameofthrones,removed,what will probably happen is this tyrion says something about his wife returning after so long sansa says something vaguely feminist about not needing no man the show plebsoh my god sansa is a slay queen rightful queen of the slays
gameofthrones,removed,pretty sure the boy got his back broken sci messes up nerve impulses and can torpedo erection unless the lol has viagra powers not much is happening
gameofthrones,removed,the eu is something negative not positive germany is advertising for immigrants to come and overwelm the west with uncontrolled unwanted and proventobedangerous massimmigration
gameofthrones,removed,you should stop watching the show if you dont like the main character how can you enjoy the show if you dont like the most important character maybe you should watch my little pony instead something more appropriate for your unmatched level of stupidity seriously if you dont like jon i dont think youre going to like the rest of the show considering it pretty much revolves around him quit trolling yo can we ban this asshole yet seriously hate it when people just try and stir up shit
gameofthrones,removed,and to be clear he didnt regret making the characters as young as he did because of the content of the stories he regretted it because his original plan was to have a fiveyear timeskip in the middle of the series but when he reached that point he realized he was spending too much time flashing back to what happened in the intervening five years so he scrapped that idea and had to rewrite this is partially responsible for some of the long delays between books so basically there was going to be a gap where dany would have ruled in mereen for years jon would have been lordcommander of the watch for years bran wouldve been training with the threeeyed raven for years arya wouldve been training with the faceless men for five years sansa wouldve been hiding out in the vale with littlefinger for years tyrion is a slave for years tommen is king for years etc it would have justified all the stark kids leveling up in the interim as they grew to full adulthood given dany more ruling experience etc etc would have been interesting to see but i can easily imagine that the flashing back to the interim would have gotten overwhelming in a series this detailoriented
gameofthrones,removed,love is a strong word but he was clearly tempted by melisandre shes about as red as you can get he turned her down but and he had a difficult time resisting the temptation too get ithard like an erection
gameofthrones,removed,what are you a year old tumblr brat

gameofthrones,removed,if they dont reveal rlj this sunday im gonna have to eat every fucking tinfoil in this room
gameofthrones,removed,jon said in he is going to the crypts to put rickon to rest while hes down there something in another tomb will confirm rlj it will also be hard evidence for the rest of westerns as opposed to brand visions which would only really matter to jon
gameofthrones,removed,i bet a window kills him

gameofthrones,removed,having only seen the show literally all i know about him is that he banged renly hes not much of a knight and hes probably pretty smells pretty terrible from wallowing in the filth of his sparrow cagetm
gameofthrones,removed,last one killed my boner
gameofthrones,removed,you just proved my point about the attitudes thanks
gameofthrones,removed,i think she might reveal tommens true lineage and he will commit suicide because he wont be able to handle it cersei wont expect tommen to die so she will be enormously upset shell go after everyone who interfered with the lannister legacy starting with the high sparrow
gameofthrones,removed,he jumps off a window

gameofthrones,removed,ive been predicting it all season tommen falls out a window surely this episode is the day
gameofthrones,removed,kids with cancer
gameofthrones,removed,mainly because in the book it wasnt rape it was consensual book jaime and show jaime are quite different with it not being rape in the source material i think a lot of people felt it was just put in for shock value only plus it made jaime out to be a bit of a tool for doing something so awful
gameofthrones,removed,check out the rest at
gameofthrones,removed,the shit chatting would only be outdone by the banggetting

gameofthrones,removed,itt ran out of budget you cant honestly believe that
gameofthrones,removed,some time after season i saw picture of boobs on since i am a simple man i pressed like then i checked comments to see where it is from then i binge watched first seasons
gameofthrones,removed,where does this tommen will jump theory come from i see it around a lot
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,i would however be up for her being the downfall of littlefinger and her killing him in the end i have mixed feelings about this on the one hand this would totally be a kickass moment for sansa but on the other hand i want to know just how far the rabbit hole goes with littlefinger i would almost feel gyped if sansa killed him that all of his grand and scheming plans would be over in an instant but then the time for scheming plans is over and the others are coming but then it would be a terrible way to end his story but then it would be so satisfying to see him get outsmarted by sansa its very confusing i hate this show sometimes
gameofthrones,removed,two simultaneous pincer attacks had me cumming
gameofthrones,removed,im
gameofthrones,removed,aerys was just sick of all the jewish lies
gameofthrones,removed,in winter santo cum began gradually ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gameofthrones,removed,probably a bit of both although he crossed said line he isnt stupid in general a tv show has only so much air time to tell the whole story and in that compressed time frame he simply makes hefty decissions that could be seen as dumb i said in hindsight deliberately because cerseis actions later in the show and the ones of her kids that he wanted to protect are psyochopathic so when rewatching you just have to facepalm because you already know his kindness is leading to
gameofthrones,removed,everything syrio said everything game of thrones lord snow syrio forel all men are made of water do you know this if you pierce them the water leaks out and they die arya stark im a girl syrio forel boy girl you are a sword that is all that is the grip you are not holding a battleaxe you are holding arya stark a needle game of thrones the pointy end syrio forel what do we say to the god of death arya stark not today syrio forel go game of thrones a golden crown syrio florel do you pray to the gods arya stark the old and the new syrio florel there is only one god and his name is death and there is only one thing we say to death not today

gameofthrones,removed,remindme hours ask op a question
gameofthrones,removed,i predict this will be a bran heavy episode like well likely learn a lot of information all through brans greensight maybe even the toj and hodors past revealed
gameofthrones,removed,i feel very disappointed after just watching episode this season has definitely been strange and its making me sad what are they doing
gameofthrones,removed,the episode is amazing and definitely the best of the season imo
gameofthrones,removed,why are you bothering to make predictions the episode has been out online all day and most of the world has likely already seen it
gameofthrones,removed,only on game of thrones do we want an aunt and nephew to hook up and get married and produce heirs and live happily ever after
gameofthrones,removed,couldnt you wait a few hours and not post stuff about the new episode before it airs
gameofthrones,removed,killing honor
gameofthrones,removed,just finished watching the new episode prepare to shit your pants
gameofthrones,removed,grrm has reiterated how deeply connected these wolves and their masters are everything from personality temperament and a deeper almost spiritual connection to the true stark blood heritage ghost played a part in carrying jons ghost while he was dead his name foreshadowing his impact on jons arc well almost certainly get more reasoning on how ghost was involved in jons resurrection in the next book of course greywind died like robb sharing the same fate they were also very alike in life kindred spirits on the battlefield summer was a protector and did that for bran right to the end bran will do the same and protect the realm shaggydog murdered by traitors cruelly like rikkon eventually will lady was the least wolflike and died in nymerias place for a crime she did not commit ominous foreshadowing for sansa that leaves nymeria named after a queen ruling a super pack using strategy leadership and ruthlessness she would kill any male wolf who tried to mate with her dominating both man and beast although its intetesting to note the only wolf nymeria ever followed was ghost
gameofthrones,removed,i suggest looking for it at a place like the piratesbay be wary of people submitting wrong episodes though
gameofthrones,removed,dragonfire and the lord of light could cure it the new red priestess may save jorah to prove her worth to varys and co

gameofthrones,removed,i have the weirdest boner
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,and the door was held
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,hold the dooooor hodorr
gameofthrones,removed,bewbs
gameofthrones,removed,red priest breasts please
gameofthrones,removed,summer
gameofthrones,removed,did i watch this episode before everyone how have i seen the full episode while youre all still commenting on the ep im confused spoilers for legitimacy hold that door
gameofthrones,removed,every red woman is hot as fuck all hail the lord of light
gameofthrones,removed,this new red woman is fine as fuck
gameofthrones,removed,jeez is the requirement for being a red priestess having an amazing rack
gameofthrones,removed,red woman has a fantastic pair of tits in that dress
gameofthrones,removed,youll see
gameofthrones,removed,brienne jon seems trustworthy depressed for sure but trustworthy
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,she is ready for his stick ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gameofthrones,removed,oh damn
gameofthrones,removed,requirements for a red priestess magic shit big ol titties
gameofthrones,removed,ho do dor
gameofthrones,removed,hold the doooooor
gameofthrones,removed,what is fake sansas actress name
gameofthrones,removed,im just sitting here waiting for people to get the title of the episode
gameofthrones,removed,hoold the door
gameofthrones,removed,aaaaaand now we know how hodor became hodor
gameofthrones,removed,jesus titties
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,holy shit that guy was right it was hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,holy hell that hold the door scene was intense but how far is bran able to be dragged it looks like hodor will be killed soon i really thought that scene was intense and cant wait to read how grrm writes it
gameofthrones,removed,change the title you fucking prick
gameofthrones,removed,absolutely needed to balance out dem titties air time
gameofthrones,removed,rip hodor but that episode left a lot to be desired actress sansa stark got them titties tho
gameofthrones,removed,hopefully nymeria is still running around too
gameofthrones,removed,you guys think this red priestess got some saggy titties too
gameofthrones,removed,thats some rick and morty time travel shit right there
gameofthrones,removed,that is so horrible
gameofthrones,removed,had her bang a dog
gameofthrones,removed,only if its the white one
gameofthrones,removed,but those titties
gameofthrones,removed,if the show is willing to touch on it she might be running around with a massive pack of wolves
gameofthrones,removed,in the books she is the apha of a super pack of over wolves and shes running round the river lands causing havoc
gameofthrones,removed,the lord of cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think he got fucked up directly from bran i think he got fucked up from witnessing his own death like bruce willis in monkeys
gameofthrones,removed,im pretty numb to any deaths that happen at this point tbh
gameofthrones,removed,most probably watched the leaked episode p
gameofthrones,removed,thats your machine both mods are on my ssd and i load in like seconds
gameofthrones,removed,everyones saying hodor but all i can think about is naked natalie dormer next episode
gameofthrones,removed,in the bok arya controlls her instead of sleeping at night
gameofthrones,removed,this is a theory so take this with a grain of salt but sthe third eye raven is actually old bran because bran stays in the past travels to the tree to find the old man again but only finds summer and the others so he becomes the third eye raven note that at the time he stays in the past in this chapter with his father a little kid he will become an old man in the present and knows everything using the actual third eye raven we saw in the first seasonsnoweverything that happened in the final section of this episode the third eye raven old bran already knows what will happen because he already lived this as young bran soold bran knows hes going to die thats why the last thing he sees before dying is his father as a kid for the last timeif old bran did something different in the present young bran would die so he know summer must sacrifice in the middle of the tunnel for them to have a chance to scape and old bran told her so also he tells young bran listen to your friendsif young bran didnt use hodor in the present he wouldnt become hodorthus never carry bran to the tree and meeting himself as an old man thus never completing the cycle
gameofthrones,removed,wait til we see this one i got that those titties hitting the floor
gameofthrones,removed,but they are related so
gameofthrones,removed,fuckolly
gameofthrones,removed,penis
gameofthrones,removed,that red head had some great boobies
gameofthrones,removed,prince that was promised will probably be the son of snow and dragon titties
gameofthrones,removed,sending brienne to the riverlands seems like a bad choice regardless of littlefingers potential trap because last time she was there she sprung jaime lannister from their prison i dont think shes loved around there also sets up a potential stoneheart meeting i have never been a stoneheart truther but this does seem like an opportunity
gameofthrones,removed,never imagined something so big to happen marty
gameofthrones,removed,but them titties
gameofthrones,removed,the d that was promised only it was sad and had two warts on it cmon show runners
gameofthrones,removed,this weeks pair of boobs was topnotch id say could have dealt without the foreskin outta nowhere

gameofthrones,removed,i could tell you the story about brandon the builder old nan said that was always your favorite thousands and thousands of years ago brandon the builder had raised winterfell and some said the wall bran knew the story but it had never been his favorite maybe one of the other brandons had liked that story sometimes nan would talk to him as if he were her brandon the baby she had nursed all those years ago and sometimes she confused him with his uncle brandon who was killed by the mad king before bran was even born she had lived so long mother had told him once that all the brandon starks had become one person in her head
gameofthrones,removed,what youre saying you wouldnt bang melisande just make sure the the necklace doesnt fall off and youre good to go
gameofthrones,removed,holdthedoor aside can we talk about how none of us were expecting to see full peen action
gameofthrones,removed,never imagined something so big to happen marty
gameofthrones,removed,did you watch a directors cut the episode i watched didnt show a cum shot on screen
gameofthrones,removed,nights king has attack at the least confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,scandinavian hbo i think theres been a stream up in another sub for nearly hours
gameofthrones,removed,i know bran didnt mean it but seriously fuck you bran
gameofthrones,removed,i also dont agree with people calling him a hero it wasnt the actions of hodor that held that door shut and saved them it was bran using him to keep that door shut which for me makes it so much worse i should inform you that when hodor is mind controlled by bran his eyes are rolled up in the back of his head the hodor that was holding the door at the end was completely competent hodor fulfilling his lifes mission
gameofthrones,removed,not really it just told the king where bran was i think the king could have broken the spell anytime but didnt really need to
gameofthrones,removed,im a greenseer
gameofthrones,removed,im starting to wonder if the faces are carved at all
gameofthrones,removed,at least shes hot if she shows bewbs not year old bewbs then i say we call it a fair trade
gameofthrones,removed,they love her tits tho
gameofthrones,removed,he is another uncle of theon the brother of euron and balon greyjoy and the damphair in the books when eurons fleet is sailing around westeros to get to dany he takes a hand wound that festers also along their journey to dany the come across a red priest like melissandre and the new red chick who heals the hand with fire blood magic victorians hand is healed but is charred and burnt from then on
gameofthrones,removed,i think they mean httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpvictariongreyjoy who is sailing to daenerys with the iron fleet in the books his arm gets wounded and has a sickness that isnt greyscale but they come across fire priest that cures it with what is assumed as fire
gameofthrones,removed,i command you to find a cure i lost it after that it was ridiculous i like jorah and dont want to see him go but got kills everyone eventually
gameofthrones,removed,its only cosmetic because people in the us at least are accustomed to seeing guys circumcised it makes sense that porn is going to favor the look that most people find normal the problem is why it got to look normal in the first place thats largely rooted in religious bs
gameofthrones,removed,well thats interesting i want jon snow to ride into winterfell on an ice dragon now

gameofthrones,removed,hodor
gameofthrones,removed,hodor
gameofthrones,removed,hodick hodor
gameofthrones,removed,hodor
gameofthrones,removed,well considering the show aired last night i think hours is a decent grace period
gameofthrones,removed,every one of these predictions where people think his ability is so interactive literally kills years of character development they are not going to do that grrm and dd dont care about your character development they have no problem killing characters you care about in other words if you think this has a heppy ending you havent been paying attention the story thrives on bitter but compelling twists and brans ability as a greenseer is one of these twists that is going to tie many of the series happenings together youre right that bran probably wont warg into anybody anymore i think he will warg into dead jon though a dead man cant be screwed up like how he screwed up hodor you are wrong that this scene isnt important and bran warging back in time wont be relevant it is a huge precedent and will be very important if you are interested i can go in to more detail but i wont waste time talking about it more if you are going to be so dismissive
gameofthrones,removed,those sansa actress titties tho
gameofthrones,removed,thanks for dem pseudo sansa titties
gameofthrones,removed,its definitely the same place i think the writers made it pretty obvious by having the rocks set up the way they were the lands of always winter werent always winter the white walkers are the probably the source of westeross weird climate
gameofthrones,removed,because most porn is shot in the us
gameofthrones,removed,i think its just mostly a lot of reluctance to elect a female
gameofthrones,removed,step bang her step step become king of the north step profit
gameofthrones,removed,lolyou dont pay attention well at all
gameofthrones,removed,sees summer die man they really need to make these deaths more impactful this season has been lame hold the door oh goddammit it
gameofthrones,removed,please dont g no more incest
gameofthrones,removed,who cares
gameofthrones,removed,b if ian mcshane is playing moqorro for jorah plot instead of the abbot for cleganbowl shenanigans id be okay with it
gameofthrones,removed,asking the hard questions
gameofthrones,removed,this is a thread about an easter egg from game of thrones it is not about a bruce willis movie please dont delete it there were threads a few years ago about how oberyns repeated you killed her children speeches to the mountain were a princess bride reference
gameofthrones,removed,did you see all that retarded cgi in that episode
gameofthrones,removed,i have nothing to add to this discussion but you are doing gods work
gameofthrones,removed,i know right like i thought maybe her and the kingslayer would hook up but that didnt happen she needs some good wilding d
gameofthrones,removed,the on stage nipples are the backstage are

gameofthrones,removed,sansa is his weak spot well cat is his weak spot and sansa is a proxy for cat sansa senses this and has been subtly manipulating him by telling him what he wants to hear i really dont think he was expecting her to be that unforgiving he thinks shes very fond of him he always shows his hand to vulnerable women because hes so confident in his superiority over them but he has underestimated sansa
gameofthrones,removed,would have loved if they had hired the actors who made the porn parody to play it heuheuheuhe
gameofthrones,removed,its not every day you get to see natalie dormer naked seriously though these scenes in the promo have me convinced that the walk of shame is all a setup on the high sparrows part they havent prepared margery in the same way that they did cersei by cutting off her hair therefore i dont think the walk is real he knew that tommen would tell cersei and hes laying a trap
gameofthrones,removed,who wouldnt want to see margaerys titties
gameofthrones,removed,dumb and dumber
gameofthrones,removed,would you bang her would you bang me
gameofthrones,removed,well there is always gonna be niche porn that does that stuff and japan doesnt care but the major na porn companies that would distribute parodys of stuff dont do incest at all yeah
gameofthrones,removed,i didnt name the episode so this isnt a spoiler your removal is bogus
gameofthrones,removed,lol its funny youre shitting on everyone for having a different opinion than you but than complaining about people downvoting you because you have a different opinion derp
gameofthrones,removed,someones being watching a little too much porn
gameofthrones,removed,how the fuck did you know hours ago is got released in other places before murica i wouldnt be able to comprehend that
gameofthrones,removed,you care about downvoting a lot man
gameofthrones,removed,what a joke i forgot that editing a ms paint down arrow over a knife was creative have fun being a keyboard warrior my friend
gameofthrones,removed,he is implying grrm is a sadistical piece of shit for what he did to hodor and as such ramsay is a biography of himself
gameofthrones,removed,when bran first meets jojen jojen tells bran that he cant kill the raven because the raven is bran hmmmmm i think the knowledge of the raven once transferred to him means he has become the raven
gameofthrones,removed,doors were open doors were closed some doors were completely destroyed episode this week pros finally observing the origins of the white walkers did not expect the children of the forest to have created them so can we assume that their creation gave them an advantage until the prince that was promised vanquished them and then bran the builder created the wall sansa has quickly become the character its easiest to root for her giving baelish the business was an exceptional scene and i can only hope for more badassness from her tormund staring at brienne again jon davos sansa and crew planning the battle strategy just seeing them all together was great dany jorah scene was very heart warming even though daario was just standing there wondering when he was going to get to smash again euron is crazy af i felt that the kingsmoot lived up to my expectations and even surpassed them when theon came into his own again euron basically countering every argument by saying haha shes a woman and he doesnt even have a penis was just a testament to how dumb the iron born are arya training never ceases but the faceless men are testing her and having her remove the connections to her list by targeting the cersei actress bewbs cons moar kings landing so thirsty for right now other thoughts i feel that the show is wanting the audience to forget about the sand snakes until they pop back up in kings landing potentially killing tommen kevan whomevver more thoughts here

gameofthrones,removed,episode leaked online
gameofthrones,removed,he held the door but who will hold bran now when hodor is dead he isnt going to get very far but what upsets me more than hodors death is that weve never seen the end of the toj sequence i was really hoping they would confirm g that jon snow is rhaegars and lyannas son this season
gameofthrones,removed,their fault for not speaking murican
gameofthrones,removed,he also said that hodor didnt mean hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,i know everyone will be talking about the end of last nights episode however this caught my attention the most
gameofthrones,removed,she and her proclivity to hold her stupid mouth in a myriad of odd positions annoys me more than i previously thought possible her sanctimonious bullshit about got lore doesnt help matters
gameofthrones,removed,g i wonder if brienne leaving sansa to head south will lead to her meeting the brotherhood without banners holy shit if thats true
gameofthrones,removed,grrm wrote a page summary of the entire story and submitted it to the publishers he has said he will release it soon after the final book is published
gameofthrones,removed,this is the only place i have posted to avoid spamming so if you guys could share i would appreciate it
gameofthrones,removed,im sure hell show up again at some point what is literally hitler may never die
gameofthrones,removed,youre right he is the night king the leader of the white walkers what was talking about is a different character though he was a lord commander of the nights watch who supposedly had sex with a female white walker
gameofthrones,removed,who was that girl that was showing the titties back stage saying i only had two lines the sansa actress had soft pink nipples and the one back stage had darker small nipples where they the same so confused
gameofthrones,removed,who was that girl that was showing the titties back stage saying i only had two lines the sansa actress had soft pink nipples and the one back stage had darker small nipples where they the same so confused
gameofthrones,removed,some of it maybe fan fictionish however history does repeat itself maybe some of it will come true
gameofthrones,removed,do people not care about tossing book spoilers in threads marked as show only anymore
gameofthrones,removed,kill all the japanese
gameofthrones,removed,cause titties
gameofthrones,removed,personally i felt like she lied to jon because she didnt want him to get cross with her for letting the knights of the veil go
gameofthrones,removed,think back to season when petyr talks about lysa and rhaegar sansa comments on how he kidnapped her and raped her as most people believe is the case but petyr gave her a look afterwards that implied that he knew the truth
gameofthrones,removed,bewbs
gameofthrones,removed,lord brynden rivers called lord bloodraven was a legitimized great bastard of aegon iv targaryen and melissa blackwood his sixth mistress
gameofthrones,removed,my head hurts i just wanna watch knights fight each other and titties and stuff i just hope they dont make a mess of the ending and it doesnt get to crazy or it becomes just a story of whats meant to happen will always happens sort of poops on the story i hope youre right about things changing to brans actions
gameofthrones,removed,please remember to use spoiler tags for book spoilers this thread is marked which doesnt include any of the books thanks
gameofthrones,removed,s dupa
gameofthrones,removed,if my sister was as hot as sansa i wouldnt care
gameofthrones,removed,i dont read anything you write lol because its not harassment if i ask you to leave me alone and you dont what is that oh so its not rape when a woman does it typical
gameofthrones,removed,i think ill have to see them displayed side by side a red priestess cat fight if you will i can only truly make a judgement when their pressed against each other in honor of the red god ill be in my bunk
gameofthrones,removed,gross
gameofthrones,removed,a man has googled
gameofthrones,removed,but there is no evidence to suggest the opposite l and r just disappeared it was assumed he kidnapped her but no one proved it its more like history is written by the winners r died l died and it was easy for robert to believe she was kidnapped if im not mistaken we only get the story from his pov all other character in the books speak highly on r and theres really no reason to believe he would do such a thing
gameofthrones,removed,grrm is a fat old moron who cant write good books and loves to insult longdead writers who are much above his level and who cant defend themselves
gameofthrones,removed,lmao she looks like hodor himself
gameofthrones,removed,thanks for the explanation
gameofthrones,removed,oh so your telling me she fell for the sexiest and most powerful guy on the planet shades of grey right there
gameofthrones,removed,the theory has been going around since the first book came out long before reddit even began
gameofthrones,removed,the titties on them sansa actress though so unexpected yet so welcome
gameofthrones,removed,i have no idea about this really i just binged and watched all the episodes in about weeks im still trying to find my way through the lore of everything i know the basis of rlj but no details
gameofthrones,removed,yeah she takes what she wants she takes this dick every night bazinga
gameofthrones,removed,use your friggin brain
gameofthrones,removed,yea im trying to seem dem titties
gameofthrones,removed,someone already updated recent posts related to her with great set of tits
gameofthrones,removed,i am but not to the point of crying sounds like some of you guys cant function if your favorite character gets a splinter
gameofthrones,removed,yeah its pretty safe to say we know lyanna was not happy about the prospect of marrying robert she knew he would never be faithful to her and for her that was a dealbreaker then the tower of joy hes fighting for his life and familys dynasty on the trident and he sends half his most trusted and valuable kingsguard soldiers to guard some woman he raped including arthur daynes lethal ass im not buying it protecting the woman he loved and his unborn child at the likely cost of his life much more plausible
gameofthrones,removed,found this online from years ago where a guy at a convention shared an elevator with grrm heres the source
gameofthrones,removed,i have come to fap to you again
gameofthrones,removed,not just any tits natalie dormer tits
gameofthrones,removed,fuck i thought i was alone when i got a boner watching her
gameofthrones,removed,ill just leave this here
gameofthrones,removed,marco roboto
gameofthrones,removed,in the book she goes to her other uncles but they havent established any other noble houses in the iron islands as characters in the show
gameofthrones,removed,if you just watch the show it is probably not readily apparent
gameofthrones,removed,im afraid that power vacuum in dorne needs to be adressed unfortunately that means sand snakes maybe there will be bewbs at least
gameofthrones,removed,there was an article stating that no spoiler tag because mobile so spoilers next few episodes nothing plot related though young ned wilk make a brief appearance in and a major appearance in i think bran is still going to go back despite his mistake
gameofthrones,removed,hey thanks for the spoilers cunt
gameofthrones,removed,because the lady stoneheart storyline is quite sad
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think arya will follow her orders and will realize she cant truly become faceless i just dont see a stark going that direction at the end of the day that might not end well since she knows so much about their secrets but i dont think she will die or anything as she just feels too important though thats proven to not mean much i do think rickon will die though just because theres nothing particularly outstanding about him in the show and its feeling a bit late to bring him back and have him do much other than stand around while jon and sansa do real things lol the hound will be back thanks ian mcshane but i dont think we get the cleganebowl at least not this season i assume he is the broken man in episode title because he was pretty fuckin broken last we saw of him perhaps daavos or something too if he dies out about shireen burning since it looks like he finds the pire in one of the previews i assume dany will begin her way towards westeros with an army if yara and theon get there this season i dont know how quickly euron can build a new fleet but realistically they have such a jump on him id think they beat him to her gonna be pissed if he catches up out at sea previews showed them on the ships weathering one hell of a storm so im guessing that will delay them and he might catch up
gameofthrones,removed,i mean i just wanna see some more titties
gameofthrones,removed,considering he told d and d this years ago im going to assume hes just alot smarter than you
gameofthrones,removed,and even faster than littlefingerbangs bang banging all through the night
gameofthrones,removed,how will bran be able to see into the past without the tree how will rlj be explained to us without his visions
gameofthrones,removed,hey not my proudest fap but sad tits are still tits
gameofthrones,removed,a man gives his faps
gameofthrones,removed,nah look at the mountains helm his ridges would create a shadow like a dorsal fin from the lateral perspective the person in the visions head shadow has broken pieces like the ridges on a crown also theres a shadow of hair in the back and a goatee in the front def not the mountain and the mountain is expected to survive this season based on spoiler reports
gameofthrones,removed,david and danthe producers of game of thrones
gameofthrones,removed,oh well thats fucked up
gameofthrones,removed,varys looked like he was growing a boner while talking with the red priestess
gameofthrones,removed,deytookitder
gameofthrones,removed,named brother beyond the wall interesting i think this is a definite possibility benjen taking on the role of coldhands would help show watchers understand whats going on
gameofthrones,removed,fyi this is from an actual leak from somebody who has seen all of season episodes and posted detailed descriptions of major plot points so this guy didnt predict anything he just repeated the leak which has been accurate so far source mods please tell me if this link isnt allowed im not clear on the policy
gameofthrones,removed,yeah i know any show involving time travel and interacting past event will just make things weird
gameofthrones,removed,maybe hes a grower
gameofthrones,removed,in their meeting in mole town sansa had the upper hand because of her reunion with jon and her supposed access to support from northern houses such as the hornwoods mormonts manderlys him pointing towards the tullys is a strategic move on lfs behalf imo he knows theres no way brynden tully blackfish can raise an army to battle for winterfell as he is currently under siege by the freys and lannisters hes giving sansa hopeconfidence to bring her down and put her in a weaker position and make her come back to him asking for the help of his vale army then littlefinger comes in as the saviourhero and reclaims consideration from the starks the starks will be in debt towards littlefinger the whole for lf is to show that the tully side for sansa is not there to help and that jon doesnt have the men
gameofthrones,removed,he wasnt killed in the episode though he was in deep deep shit but he wasnt actually killed
gameofthrones,removed,in the books one of the prologueepilogue chapters shows us that spoiler
gameofthrones,removed,what were the other lessons he taught bran im not entirely sure what was being taught your dad isnt as honorable a fighter as you thought your aunt was hot a bunch of savage woman with a tied up man doesnt always lead to sexy fun times
gameofthrones,removed,nice boobs tho
gameofthrones,removed,oysters clams and cockles
gameofthrones,removed,yeah i really dont think hodor knew all along what his fate would be bran just timewarged into him and it fucked him up in the head hes a simpleton from then on because of it he wasnt going through his entire life knowing how he would one day have to hold the door his brain was just damaged from brans interference
gameofthrones,removed,could ian mcshane be benjen stark i dont know if they actually said who he is playing this season
gameofthrones,removed,aryas entire motivation since season is getting revenge on kill those who have wronged killed her family how are the skills that she is currently attaining going to help her whenif she returns to the north assassin skills would seem very helpful if your goal is to kill people im guessing at some point she will break with the fm and carry out revenge on whoever is left on her list
gameofthrones,removed,people are just bummed you didnt actually link to porn ¯ツ¯
gameofthrones,removed,there are no implications hes mad from generations on inbreeding this shit is explicitly stated in the books and show rshitpost
gameofthrones,removed,danish is like the sand snakes there is nothing good about it
gameofthrones,removed,mwaifu
gameofthrones,removed,why theres been zero information of this theory on the show and rhaegar and lyanna have barely even been mentioned
gameofthrones,removed,idk im up for more sand snake titties that girl had some excellent boobs
gameofthrones,removed,read this excellent background about events that happen before where the series starts httpimgurcomaccountfavoritesywtjw theres a lot of characters and stuff going on right from the getgo so knowing some historical context is definitely helpful
gameofthrones,removed,well now i want to know about their reproductive details
gameofthrones,removed,because they are controlled by a stark bran the builder the nights king ned seemed to get a sense of him im also guessing this is how they introduce lady stoneheart bran wargs back to after the red wedding just as shes getting resurrected by dondarion and sees him lol im stoned a right now
gameofthrones,removed,we dont know theyre reproductive details i volunteer for this mission
gameofthrones,removed,my interpretation is that they realized how badly they fucked up the dorne storyline and how much the fans hated it so they just cut their losses and killed it off completely rather than attempting to steer a sinking ship in the right direction
gameofthrones,removed,pakihawakan ang pinto pakiwakan pinto paki pinto pakito hodor
gameofthrones,removed,uhoh stun me and pun me d
gameofthrones,removed,i think at this point most agrees that those who reply with a mere troll is well a hodor cursed to speak only their own name
gameofthrones,removed,bait what you strongly disagree and think sansa is a fantastic character that you deeply admire and enjoy
gameofthrones,removed,my fellow americans im pleased to tell you today that ive signed legislation that will outlaw polish forever httpswwwlingupennedubeatricehumorclintondeploysvowelshtml
gameofthrones,removed,hey i was just there
gameofthrones,removed,theres an interview with grrm where he basically says the prince that was promised and azoh ahai are the same prophecy referring to the same person the fact that one priestess says its dany and one priestess says its jon just means they arent in agreement and dont really know who is supposed to be the prince that was promised remember before jon melisandre thought stannis was tptwp and ended up being wrong about him im guessing theres no way mel or any other priestess can be about who is the prince that was promised until someone actually fulfills the prophecy for it before that its just kind of like trying to put a puzzle together to see the final result without having all the pieces available
gameofthrones,removed,lets not
gameofthrones,removed,this this is a shot post
gameofthrones,removed,bran made him retarded through temporal projection and then led him to his death chasing a greedy vision what a noble friend
gameofthrones,removed,it was worse because the titties were not long before that i was like woah top shelf titties them borderline aroused as aroused as second of titty flash can make a man at least then bam balls right in my retina
gameofthrones,removed,how long until we see her boobs
gameofthrones,removed,yeah i have a friend wondering whats in the tower of joy like a kid waiting to open presents on christmas and im just sitting here waiting
gameofthrones,removed,i hope jon kills her and he dragons
gameofthrones,removed,lady stoneheart while interesting is something that so far is not very common in the books in the third book she was revealed at the end and in the fourth only once in the fifth she isnt in it at all so while interesting she isnt the biggest thing missing from the books
gameofthrones,removed,yeah and in the show after blackwater they kind of make him seem like he doesnt have a chance in the books he had a lot more forces on his side even going into winterfell he had some of the north lords with him
gameofthrones,removed,sorry about removing a picture of your friend but because the large size of gots cast means there are a lot of pictures with them we had to stop allowing those posts
gameofthrones,removed,probably because its not really argon
gameofthrones,removed,i draw portraits and those unable to see the obvious similarities are not gifted in mental objective comparison abilityseasame street one of these things is not like the other one of these things are kinda of the same its ridiculous their facial feature near sameness hell actor playing mace tyrell has some face shape nose features to say hes maergerys dad ewan mcgregor had his face photo pulled over mcguiness face by george lucas and all the key points matched thus he was recruited for obiwan kenobi and make up hair styling merged him into young obi wan perfect all key points match with these women except due to dyes or natural their hair color
gameofthrones,removed,idk zombie boner
gameofthrones,removed,why the fuck would you choose daily motion
gameofthrones,removed,so how long have you hated blacks latinos and impoverished whites try making jokes about how firstcousin marriage is rampant in the muslim world or how inbreeding has been an issue in the orthodox jewish community both factually accurate and see where that gets you instead you chose to make a safe joke about american southerners not at all factually accurate its just a casual slur that people think they can throw out when they want to feel superior and malign an outgroup so youre basically a coward when it comes to which ethnic groups you chose to slander i have a better idea lets ban you and people like you
gameofthrones,removed,getting to the point where i want to just press charges against both of you youre annoying as fuck
gameofthrones,removed,nice job couple of arrows would crown that

gameofthrones,removed,dude you need to get better at reading comprehension do you actually read what people right before commenting im stating that the dialogue has fallen off and is worse now that there is no source material
gameofthrones,removed,the faceless men have a fouth supposedly
gameofthrones,removed,it doesnt matter the woman spent months on them but if op is lying they should go fuck themselves
gameofthrones,removed,i was rude right sorry are you watching season too ned was also my favorite back in
gameofthrones,removed,thinking of ned makes me really sad his death was completely undeserved he was the most genuinely good person on the show
gameofthrones,removed,i think like ros this is a character grrm likes so much that hes writing him into the books pretty sure varys takes the mans dick and gets qyburn to put in on him but its a flaming dick because the magic that keeps it working also keeps it on fire like eurons hand
gameofthrones,removed,everybody loves a soft porn
gameofthrones,removed,sure but how could the stark family line really have survived for thousands of years in the same castle and suddenly be all but extinguished in a few years there should be hundreds of cousins aunts and greatgreat uncles

gameofthrones,removed,ill be in my bunk
gameofthrones,removed,i dont want to be dark but tommen was faster at
gameofthrones,removed,who would you rather
gameofthrones,removed,it would be really interesting if they went for a super dark red wedding type ending to the season to subvert expectations of a great victory and ramsey finally getting killed how crazy would it be if johns forces are routed and they drag a screaming sansa to the middle of the field and ramsay says do what you will as he holds up johns head and forces him to watch it cuts out before actual gratuitous rape and just shows the anguish on johns face then black then the final shot is john brienne sansa podrick and tormunds flayed corpses then cut to credits and no music can you imagine how crazy the reaction would be
gameofthrones,removed,anaconda malt liquor gives you little dick

gameofthrones,removed,what kind of sub is this lol
gameofthrones,removed,sounds like a weird porn title where joffreytommen fucks tyrion
gameofthrones,removed,she lied to protect someone else and brought risk to herself doing so if this is as bad or worse crime then the gods high sparrow are idiots

gameofthrones,removed,hodor regains his sanity as a whitewalker overthrows the wk takes over westeros makes a throne out of doors credits roll as he pets his whitewalker direwolf
gameofthrones,removed,this serves as a nice contrast between god she treats jon now and how she treated him then but how does this remind you of the scene with littlefinger
gameofthrones,removed,couldnt mance have stormed one of the broken castles and got to safety that way instead of slaughtered at castle black
gameofthrones,removed,what post youd have to be fairly idiotic not to have realised what will probably happen why be a dickhead people like you ruin this sub reddit so negative so edgy
gameofthrones,removed,sam being fat really is the thing that makes the least sense in the entire series couldnt even diet for a little while smh

gameofthrones,removed,read titties instead of titles was expecting nudes
gameofthrones,removed,the wall just got ten feet higher
gameofthrones,removed,i hate to think that his plot line right now is entirely bc he had to go to dorne last season i know they streamline for the show but in the books he has already written cercei off and his arc towards redemption is moving forward for some unknown reason he remains at cerceis side in the show i think it would be better if she was suffering her decent into madness all alone while jaime fought in the riverlands maybe grrm knows that ultimately he decides that there is no redemption for him and so eventually he goes back to kings landing and is destroyed aside his true love if grrm plans on doing this in the books i guess it would explain why they skipped his time in riverrun
gameofthrones,removed,thats where i break into keemstars house torture him into screaming lets get right into the nooooooose and kill myself by hanging and him when im at it

gameofthrones,removed,the necklace just needs to make physical contact with the skin in order to work you dont want to know where she kept it when she was in the bath trust me
gameofthrones,removed,maybe they just needed a little more tit to balance the tittodragon ratio ideally you want a ratio of that number tested best with focus groups

gameofthrones,removed,stannis was far from a terrible leader he held storms end against the tyrells while rob and ned where out fighting only for ned to come by and get the credit for winning the siege by beating the tyrell force he defeated the iron fleet he never lost a single battle he was the only one willing to help fight the nights king once he won the throne he even had his men back at dragonstone start mining obsidian to send to the nights watch he was far from a terrible leader people hate stannis for killing his daughter yet they liked tywin despite everything he did people like to forget that stannis genuinely loved his daughter he knows what he did what horrible and im sure if he could go back he wouldnt do it
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,since stannis is gone ill guess this will do
gameofthrones,removed,those are actual reasons that have been mentioned repeatedly by people involved in the show on another topic the fuck is your problem though you just enjoy being rude to people online for absolutely no reason while contributing nothing to the discussion or something
gameofthrones,removed,with white hair he would make a good rhaeghar he somewhat resembles jon
gameofthrones,removed,the classic implying you know much better and making vague references without going through the tedious work of providing a source and enlightening us foolish mortals

gameofthrones,removed,his name was aemon targaryean he came to us from kings landing a maester of the citadel chained and sworn and swornbrother of the nights watch ever faithful no man was wiser or gentler or kinder at the wall a dozen lordcommanders came and went because he was always there to counsel them he was the blood of the dragon but now his fire has gone out and now his watch has ended
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,sansa has made the most mistakes i think she lied about joffery getting hurt which killed her dog she told cercei of her fathers intent to leave she agreed to follow little finger she refused to leave with brienne theres probably more but i dont want this to be an essay although her decisions mostly affected just her besides first two arya has still made some incredible decisions and is always prepared for the worst
gameofthrones,removed,hanging around actually thats precisely what hell be doing
gameofthrones,removed,at that point jon had taken grenn and the gang to save the wildlings and then aemon died that left sam without anybody to really protect him from thorne
gameofthrones,removed,unless im mistaken aemon is still the only character to die of natural causes in the show and now his watch is ended
gameofthrones,removed,now his watch is ended was the title of the fourth episode of season three and was used mockingly by those who turned on lord mormont at crasters keep it is symbolizing that lord mormont was killed rather than just dead
gameofthrones,removed,with all due respect grow a pair its a realistic depiction of people and their desires in a fantasy world either watch it or dont
gameofthrones,removed,theyre two completely different things and the analogy makes no sense its because you and everyone else on this sub are too pridefulelitist food can be art just like paintings books tv shows and movies anyone can consume art anyway they like if i a chef serve you a filet mignon topped with mushrooms and you dont like mushrooms you are free to pick them off and enjoy my art differently than i intended if i an artist paint a beautiful picture of a mountainside with a kkk member flaying a black man in the corner you are free to crop out the corner and frame the part you find beautiful if i an author write an incredibly brilliant story about murder and intrigue httpsenwikipediaorgwikiandthentherewerenone you are free to change the poem to something less offensive for your consumption and millions would still enjoy it the mere fact that im trying to consume a derivative of the artists work should be flattering and a testament to the skill of the creators not an insult im not sure why every time i come here people are so adamant that watching game of thrones means i must watch with hungry eyes as men get decapitated or tortured in order to not disrespect the show creators
gameofthrones,removed,considering his age i wondered how he felt having to play his own death on the show one thing is doing it when youre young and spry and get stabbed to death its another to play someone who dies of old age when you really are that old
gameofthrones,removed,eh kind of spoilers
gameofthrones,removed,do you think his corpses butthole is still moist anyone know how i could find it so i can make sweet love to it

gameofthrones,removed,i just got to the part last night in feast for crows where he passes away kinda trippy a lot of the characters in game of thrones i picture a little differently than in the show but everything about him is exact brilliant actor its too bad he couldnt make it to but nice he lived so long
gameofthrones,removed,out of every death in the series before the most recent season his affected me the most all the beheading and crossbows and skull crushing a man dying of old age got me
gameofthrones,removed,its only fitting if you burn it alive tt fuckin stannis
gameofthrones,removed,shut up
gameofthrones,removed,bewbs
gameofthrones,removed,make westeros great again
gameofthrones,removed,theres a few shaggydog doesnt like chains foreshadowing shaggydog and rickons capture by house umber their sigil is a chained giant theres also the fact that rickon is introduced in laughing at bran missing a shot with his bow and arrow again in when robert is greeting the stark children he asks arya what is your name foreshadowing her noone storyline theres no point in trying to hide behind that face i know fear when i see it the hound says the above to arya during their travels not long before she leaves for braavos rhaegar fought valiantly rhaegar fought nobly rhaegar fought honorably and rhaegar died it could be argued that this is foreshadowing jons fate jon did all of these things before his death at the hands of ollies band

gameofthrones,removed,the point of bloodline succession birthright is so that when a monarch dies if everyone can use bloodline successoin rules to determine a succesor or at least narrow the field the bloodshed can be minimized when everyone decides who the next king is they raise their swords shout the king or queen and then kneel once that happens it is done there is a monarch everyone can move on until the king or queen dies they are that and it will take assasination coup or war to change it my point is that having the bloodline successor is not the point having a king is the point if everyone is willing to raise their swords shout and kneel it doesnt matter how they came to that conclusion and only the kings death not better information undoes it so the fact that bran turns up who has a better claim unless bran or others are willing to fight for that claim it doesnt matter there are no backsies on this as for sansa the north like most of westeros dorne and bear island are exceptions has been male line only monarchy so sansas standing is similar to jons hes not quite qualified because hes a bastard she because she is female not right but its the case but your and my legalgeneticforensic opinions dont matter if the assembled lords characters raise their swords and shout and kneel thats the point thats what makes a king
gameofthrones,removed,this could be remedied so easily if they had included robb naming jon as his successor like in the books but this time it was actually uncovered by house mormont who helped cement jons claim unfortunately dd used all the time for those scenes for daenerys to say the titles she goes by for the millionth time
gameofthrones,removed,lol sansas attack if she would have told jon everything could have been easier she gets easily manipulated by lf all the time
gameofthrones,removed,he completely ignored the battle plan rushed right in terrible commander would have lost if it werent for sansalittlefinger it should be hers since he won no one is going to call him a bad commander he has a reputation as an unkillable swordsman hes a northerner he won now everyone loves him littlefinger hasnt exerted his political capital yet he hasnt gone around saying i won the fight jon is useless presumably neither have the knights of the vale littlefinger is holding onto that card for now so what is the north going to think a son of eddard stark takes back winterfell hes a hero without serious reason theyre going to assume the victory was theirs the idea of strong north men triumphing against unbeatable odds plays right to their pride and what about the vale theyre sworn to winterfell so their army was jons army as far as anyone in the north is concerned and what about him being a bastard neds other sons are all dead jon is a son and the eldest he took back winterfell and wants to go hold the wall hes much like ned and hes everything they want if theyre brazen enough to declare a king in the north then i doubt they care about some southern laws regarding bastard inheritance
gameofthrones,removed,hes still a bastard regardless of what lyanna mormont thinks of him meaning he cannot inherit or rule over anything the northmen dont care about that they want jon as their king so he is going to be their king he completely ignored the battle plan and rushed right into the battle due to letting his emotions get a hold of him most men would have done the same in his position hes a terrible commander as his ignorance and emotions caused his army to get surrounded and slaughtered he is not a terrible commander he may not be the best strategist but he is an excellent leader he inspires people to follow him something that even stannis wasnt very good at they would have lost if it werent for sansalittlefingers ex machina of the knights of the vale if sansa had told jon about the vale army then perhaps fewer people would have died jon did the best he could with what he had and could have done even better if she hadnt been so stupid as to not tell him sansas army won the battle and took the castle meaning that it should be hers actually the first men through the gate that actually took the castle were jon and the wildlings by all laws and rights sansa is the lady of winterfell and the last known person that is highborn and has stark bloodmeaning that she should be the ruler of winterfell just like how stannis should be king of westeros actually nothing says that she cant be lady of winterfell now jon is king in the north but that doesnt make her automatically not lady of winterfell the rules of succession governing the iron throne have nothing to do with being king in the north plus as said above the northerners dont care about birthright they want jon as king so hes king jon snow did not avenge the red wedding by any means tyrion killed tywin ramsay killed roose and arya killed walder freynone of the boltons were even at the red wedding or helped with the killings of robbs army and if its referring to ramsaysansa and the hounds killed him first of all there were boltons at the red wedding there was at least roose and probably a lot of bolton men as well there is no way the freys had enough men on their own to slaughter most of robbs army there had to have been boltons in on it as well furthermore jon avenged the red wedding by destroying the boltons for the northern houses the bolton treachery at the red wedding was more offensive than the actions of walder frey and tywin lannister frey is known for being a cunt and tywin is a southern lord that they already despise the boltons were northerners though they turned on their fellow countrymen which makes them far worse in the eyes of the northern lords than either the freys or the lannisters
gameofthrones,removed,roose bolton orchestrated the red wedding with tywin and he was present i dont remember who he cut but i think it was cat herself he put a knife to her throat and slashed her this is what they meant by him avenging the red wedding the wedding is the very event that made roose lord paramount of the north and then ramsay
gameofthrones,removed,we get you like sansa more than jonjon was vengeful bloody and fought in the battle sansa sat on a horse smilingthats why jons is kotn jon is a better commander than sansa will ever be jon has lead inspired and commanded people sansa has been spoiled brat stupid descion making embysol
gameofthrones,removed,in the coronation scene jon warns the north about the true enemy who brings the storm the north men are sitting together with the free folk and no doubt heard about hardhome they maybe thinking that jon is their only hope of survival as he knows the enemy and how to defeat him they are not rewarding jon for past deeds they make jon king so that they all have a chance to survive whats coming
gameofthrones,removed,shes gorgeous even despite having semiflapjacks
gameofthrones,removed,he said seriously so it wasnt sarcasm
gameofthrones,removed,true
gameofthrones,removed,he doesnt have black hair tho and a wig or dye would be kinda weird i think joe dempsie is the perfect gendry
gameofthrones,removed,the resurrected is better than the undead which isnt even true
gameofthrones,removed,i agree but the is the seventh image in the whole google for this query nsfw i still think shes obviously gorgeous
gameofthrones,removed,someone needs to give you gold
gameofthrones,removed,maybe the blood magic sex caused him to cum blood
gameofthrones,removed,wow congrats
gameofthrones,removed,self censorship cute you should do that more
gameofthrones,removed,pls no i love dayne and jordan is an asshole
gameofthrones,removed,equally evil and both are totally full of bs
gameofthrones,removed,ned i dont think planned for reed to stab the morning star the reeds or notorious for being survivors the dont live by the rest of the continents rules doesnt surprise me a man from the neck would stab a famous knight in the back and not think twice about honor
gameofthrones,removed,i think the trailers show him in the riverlands right
gameofthrones,removed,why is she so ugly holy shit
gameofthrones,removed,but i fuken ate pikeys
gameofthrones,removed,game of thrones doesnt appeal to vapid starfuckers or shallow dizzy bitches but its so successful it sucked that one in
gameofthrones,removed,she could literally be slowly crushed to death under construction vehicles causing her to die a horrible and agonizing death which will make her scream until she cant scream any more and my life wouldnt be affected one iota shes pretty much an npc as far as im concerned
gameofthrones,removed,it would never happen but it would be a hilarious fuck you to the audience if wylla is in that tower giving birth to jon
gameofthrones,removed,when he sat up it probably slipped off of his small pecker
gameofthrones,removed,it was sacrified for jons return
gameofthrones,removed,it wasnt a loincloth it was a sheet of cloth thats how tormund saw his little pecker
gameofthrones,removed,today we have this idea that if sexual activity is not intended for mutual enjoyment its rape but in the past and in westeros people who actually didnt enjoy the sex had it for the i know it is weird and unnatural purpose of procreation sansa agreed to the marriage with littlefinger before she went to winterfell she agreed again at the wedding ceremony she knew that sexual activity would be part of this not everyone is tyrion given that we know he is a sadist ramsay was relatively gentle and respectful and she may have cried out and shown some reluctance but she never said stop or pulled away sansas did not know ramsay was a monster and her goal was to be the mother of the next lord of winterfell the thing about theon watching was ill grant you weird but there is a good argument that what happened to sansa was not rape she consented even though it was not intended for her enjoyment i know this is controversial go ahead and unleash your fury of downvotes what happened to shireen by contrast was monstrous and unconscionable in any context of human beings burning children alive as a human sacrifice no consent no rational reason for it just awful and horrible
gameofthrones,removed,when no one was looking tormund took it off and kissed his little pecker
gameofthrones,removed,it was the end of a watch not the start of one
gameofthrones,removed,ramseys bloodhounds ate it
gameofthrones,removed,aerys chose fire as his champion what an asshole
gameofthrones,removed,maybe it fell when he gasped back to life but my sister was quick to notice too
gameofthrones,removed,abc bro put a spoiler alert on that
gameofthrones,removed,melisandra took it she was going to scrape the dried spunk off of it to make a spell
gameofthrones,removed,this one makes me feel high
gameofthrones,removed,wayyyyyy better
gameofthrones,removed,g there are leaked photos showing arya doing a scene where shes in a river in northern ireland probably the riverlands set
gameofthrones,removed,hes wearing plate armor do ypu know nothing about medieval combat
gameofthrones,removed,holy crap why didnt i ever think of this before such a goddamn obvious pun
gameofthrones,removed,jaime and brienne gotta bang before they die mandude even if both of them die right after but they gotta bang
gameofthrones,removed,it would be a terrible shame because her body is lovely
gameofthrones,removed,if you think this has a happy ending you havent been paying attention
gameofthrones,removed,im sure the lannisters will care a shit nah thrones are taken with fire and blood if hes a targaryen it will be clear when the dragons get to westeros
gameofthrones,removed,i think once rlj is confirmedkit haringtons sigil during the opening credits changes from a direwolf to the targaryen dragon
gameofthrones,removed,there was a semipopular theory several years ago that pretty much said the same thing people speculated that jon would find a memento of some sort like rhaegars silver harp buried with lyanna its probably not the most likely theory but its possible and its pretty cool
gameofthrones,removed,people think it will lead to cleganebowl and that the faith militant found the hound before he died and healed him and that when cersei names zombie mountain in the trial the sparrow will surprise her and name the hound
gameofthrones,removed,i think thats what they mean im thinking jons perception went straight from dying to being resurrected without experiencing anything in between but he knows he was gone for a matter of time and is startled that there was nothing in between despite knowing time had passed
gameofthrones,removed,how does the computer feel when you unplug it
gameofthrones,removed,i thought tor was basically dead now since the fbi raided all of the servers
gameofthrones,removed,from a show watcher only perspective the alien is kind of shocking we havent heard anything about them besides them being called children of the forest i thought the one looked alright the one creeps me out i think they should have settled at something in the middle of the two
gameofthrones,removed,sorry to break it to you but in americabritainaustraliawestern culture no its not normal at all its not common and it is incest
gameofthrones,removed,they searched for kits browsing history in porn sites they managed to find his preferences red heads and then they started looking to cast a red head some ex machina stuff
gameofthrones,removed,you will not be excused having a wrong opinion will mean you must shut up forever and lose your job for good measure
gameofthrones,removed,so its not even your work your plan is to just copy and paste for karma
gameofthrones,removed,why does he have a nose
gameofthrones,removed,a boner doesnt mean very much
gameofthrones,removed,wah wah
gameofthrones,removed,accounts with loads of karma and an overal good reputation sell for a lot of money
gameofthrones,removed,i know youre joking but were talking about the most desirable girl in westeros she might have a strong personality but she doesnt bring any political advantage and isnt fully grown and flourishing in the looks department like dany who is probably the most desirable lady in westeros or even cercei i would probably choose dany though cause of the titties
gameofthrones,removed,good job but who tells me that you didnt just photoshopped it backwards
gameofthrones,removed,its really quite good and can stand on its own merit theres no reason to embellish calling it photorealistic
gameofthrones,removed,cant wait till they use this for porn
gameofthrones,removed,this is the kind of shitposting i like to see between seasons
gameofthrones,removed,nice ad bro
gameofthrones,removed,wtf jaime is ugly as fuck
gameofthrones,removed,did you look at her ass
gameofthrones,removed,blondie is pretty hot great pic babe
gameofthrones,removed,the blonde looks very happy
gameofthrones,removed,that sweet summer child
gameofthrones,removed,calm yourself and listen to your own words before you lash out at people with hurr durr he claims dragons as a power source prevents progress thats false his logic explaining how cannons made progress possible is also false cannons made progress possible because it allowed kings to crush their feudal lords who hid behind their castles and establish absolute monarchies that same thing can very well be achieved by dragons its just that nobody used it for that purpose yet i acknowledged in my post that all those points are valid debatable but not outright coming from misunderstanding the video the point that is wrong is this one this is completely wrong dragons came to westeros only years ago westeros has been in stagnation for thousands of years nothing in the video contradicts this he didnt say that without dragons there wouldve been progress he just said that with dragons the same emergent phenomenon that happened with cannons wouldnt happen not to mention he still assumes only progress is one that replicates our own which is also false westeros and the world of ice and fire can develop in a different way given their different tools and different conditions all of this is addressed in the second to last paragraph of my original post however i again stress that this isnt the point thats not why youre daft
gameofthrones,removed,yeah but dat
gameofthrones,removed,i think the reason would be because tommen looks like hes on the same path of brainwash that theyve seemingly done to margaery people are also convinced the high sparrow is this master plotter that cant lose so if cersei cant win a trial by combat with the freaking zombie mountain the implication is it has to be a forfeit out of all the characters the high sparrow now has following him only tommen comes to mind as the best candidate to force her to concede i especially like that theory post above mine though is gregor really considered dead i was under the assumption he had survived just dramatically changed
gameofthrones,removed,benjen was combined with coldhands well this isnt necessarily correct either s i am one of the people who believe coldhand is benjen in the books we just never find out the only thing that is really changed is that coldhands is happening after the cave when in the books he got them to the cave but the reasons i dont think arya can fill that spot is number one she isnt even on the correct continent and number two she doesnt have the clout to pull that off s lsh gets a small army together and is planning to avenge the north not proven yet but we all know and she is only able to do that because she is who she is and people know cat and want revenge for the north i just dont see arya being able to pull that off as a zombie that isnt even on the correct continent naw lsh is just going to be left out i would imagine
gameofthrones,removed,mrs tarly is a total milf
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,he is a gentle and very loving guy he is not pushing her to anything he has good and powerful friends and hes an overachiever
gameofthrones,removed,totally alive members rickon bran area and sansa dead characters that came back stoneheart and jon and benjen who may or may not have been brought back from the dead
gameofthrones,removed,youre not actually its hard to ignore your smugness but yes i am do you see them as defeats or something
gameofthrones,removed,yeah even catelyn didnt trust bastardswasnt happy with robb marrying a randomer he slept with lady tarly sees her son rock up with a bastard with she probably assumed a random northern whorecommoner and all she cares about is how cute the baby is plus shes a ridiculous milf
gameofthrones,removed,the nights watch told jon they found his uncle benjen they did all i remembered was them saying that he has to check something out but that is extra assholeish
gameofthrones,removed,thats a great shot too bc you also get a nice view of cerseis cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,fucking bang on
gameofthrones,removed,ghost and shaggydog saying hi to ramsey
gameofthrones,removed,so he fucked a year old and she is now at most but most likely that makes no fucking sense we did not see year old titties we are not being raped in prison so we did not see underage titties
gameofthrones,removed,off topic but the quality of the pics are giving me a serious boner
gameofthrones,removed,triggered
gameofthrones,removed,youre right i am certain that there wont be one because the lazy fatass will die
gameofthrones,removed,cum and see
gameofthrones,removed,liz dont be an ignorant cunt
gameofthrones,removed,nah tommen kills himself after ceresi butchers the faith after shes denied trial by combat tommen wont be able to handle that on top of having been played by his wife the spoilers are already out thee

gameofthrones,removed,im getting way too obsessed with sophie turner
gameofthrones,removed,my boy sam rollin in pink
gameofthrones,removed,the shot in the show was not from nose almost pushed up against the wall and in any case i still havent gotten a source for the wall in the show
gameofthrones,removed,god i hate this response
gameofthrones,removed,i dont perform a search before i post discussion topics i find interesting i just post them so i can go on to discussing them if you think im here for karma youre fucking retarded
gameofthrones,removed,i was just rewatching misfits and it sucks he died in game of thrones too but when he dies it shows how no is safe you can die any moment
gameofthrones,removed,the guy on the left looks like locke the sellsword who amputated jaimes hand
gameofthrones,removed,arya gets her diploma and finds out the job market is shit and her student loans are going to be very difficult to pay back arya thinks like a typical redditor
gameofthrones,removed,bahahaha touché
gameofthrones,removed,you are indeed confusing them in the show hes a bolton captain of some sorts called locke whilst in the books he is of course vargo the goat hoat leader of the brave companions
gameofthrones,removed,i am no book reader but i have watched enough preston jacobs videos and lurked around here long enough to know that in the books its vargo hoat a sellsword of the brave companions while in the show hes called locke and hes apparently a bolton soldier
gameofthrones,removed,they will most likely introduce the hound and do cleganebowl in the same episode since we have to see jaimes reaction and its too late to have brienne see the gravedigger
gameofthrones,removed,so daario is going to go back to meereen bang danny and the gray scale is going to transfer to her tits stone tits well at least they will never sag
gameofthrones,removed,youre wrong
gameofthrones,removed,came her to say this op should have worn jamies hand
gameofthrones,removed,a khaleesi who does not fly is not true khaleesi
gameofthrones,removed,there was a scene where some brothers of the nights watch tried to rape her
gameofthrones,removed,i know one of the major theories about who was the leader of sons of the harpy was daario im now on board that its euron greyjoy i know theres another theory that they could be the same person so are they working together what link do they have together it seems far too coincidental that ships get burnt euron decides to build ships daario says they need ships and no one in the world has that many is daario eurons inside man
gameofthrones,removed,bronn your brother ever tell you how i came into his service jaime lannister you stood for him in his trial by combat at the eyrie bronn aye but only when lady arryn demanded the trial take place that day you were his first choice he named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him you gonna fight for him now jaime lannister dyou think he did it bronn nah he hated the little twat sure who didnt
gameofthrones,removed,was not preparedtoo soon i still grief this honorable ser he will always be one of the most loyal and gentle bolton bannermen
gameofthrones,removed,the night is dark and full of old titties
gameofthrones,removed,i wish i want a good show but we got bad writers
gameofthrones,removed,rematch this sunday on hbo
gameofthrones,removed,i understand why people want to see the hound as the faiths champion against gregor clegane but i just dont understand the reasoning behind it if the gravedigger theory is true and sandor is at peace with himself on the quiet isles then why would he want to step in for anyone such as the faith especially in a fight to the death theres no way he would get brainwashed into their religious armageddon hes much too strong minded to do so in my opinion sandors first motive after gaining his health would be to find arya stark unless the lannisters hold her hostage or she is involved somehow in his motive for fighting then i really dont want to see it happen would be way out of character for him to bounce in and risk his life like that again just to kill his brother especially when he is apparently at peace
gameofthrones,removed,not drinking from a historically accurate glass would not bang
gameofthrones,removed,well the actress who played shae was an porn star so that may explain it
gameofthrones,removed,she was actually a porn star before so i guess she learned her acting from a porn set they dont put much emphasis on acting so
gameofthrones,removed,did you know that the actress who played shae sibel kekilli was a port star
gameofthrones,removed,her best work is porn not a big leap to playing a whore but its hard to blend in with got class actors
gameofthrones,removed,marry arya become the lord of winterhell bang for the rest of my days
gameofthrones,removed,viserys i know most think he was whiny and annoying but i started to respect the way he saw khal drogo for the dumb savage he was when everyone else was super impressed with him also i think viserys would have made a lot more interesting character than danerys can you imagine how many arguments he would have had with jorah and barristan it would have made the whole essos plotline less boring
gameofthrones,removed,httpbetteridgeslawcom
gameofthrones,removed,i guess this is the news we have all been waiting for

gameofthrones,removed,two spots on
gameofthrones,removed,rickon doesnt die like that ramsay says something quite simple but memorable source extra on set
gameofthrones,removed,the extra stated that he rickon gets shot in the back with an arrow by ramsey after a choice is presented to him stay with ramsey or run to his brother jon
gameofthrones,removed,renly baratheon was really cute i loved the innocent yet serious thing he had definitely had me swooned
gameofthrones,removed,hands down tormund
gameofthrones,removed,it would have to be melisandre i cant get enough of those titty scenes bruh
gameofthrones,removed,missandei
gameofthrones,removed,youll get downvotes but i love these kinds of posts definitely jorah first and petyr second
gameofthrones,removed,instead of a walk of atonement it looks like sparrows gave her a breast enlargement of atonement
gameofthrones,removed,bad pusssssiiiiieeeeeeeee
gameofthrones,removed,aggo horse
gameofthrones,removed,very possible her character will be cgi
gameofthrones,removed,she doesnt really rape him with it more like shoves it in an inch or two and then kicks it in
gameofthrones,removed,iirc from rasoiaf someone said it wasnt
gameofthrones,removed,its from a post before the series even started saying that ramsay would have rickon the guy who posted it said spoiler that rickon gets shot with an arrow but he doesnt know if he dies or not
gameofthrones,removed,youre gay
gameofthrones,removed,im a simple man who likes simple things i see cleavage i click
gameofthrones,removed,is your dad for sale
gameofthrones,removed,like bewbs
gameofthrones,removed,i hope she was ground up wouldnt want the dogs to choke on her hip bones
gameofthrones,removed,arya jon snow i really felt a relationship between them that no other characters had even at such an early episode thats why theyre the ones im hoping for a reunion the most they really played their roles at the time well and showed how close their bond was between eachother even though jon is only her half brother
gameofthrones,removed,spoiler
gameofthrones,removed,in the breakdown for trailer there is a pic the guy had subtitled as arya running from waif only waif isnt in the picture and look at the people that is kings landing not bravos false set reports show that scene from all angles and it was clearly arya running from the waif the set photos are on twow and hilarious because theres a minivan just off frame also the same location is serving for kl and bravos this season do your homework man
gameofthrones,removed,not kl they are using same location to film them both but set reports have already confirmed it is bravos and the waif is chasing her see above
gameofthrones,removed,its not kl same set location confirmed in bravos check the set reports
gameofthrones,removed,why do you say this is there anything special about the book as a medium
gameofthrones,removed,also i think this ends with a fizzle and not a bang despite all the theory crafting here set reports show marg walking free lannisters will own the faith when they do ceresis trial confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,heh bigfest thats what gives it away
gameofthrones,removed,could be brienne since theres supposed to be a hanging scene with brienne could be lsh brienne jaime reunion in sparrow eyes another target means he defeats jaime in their confrontation since theyre both still alive jaime could be banished or some thing
gameofthrones,removed,you have a much much better rack than natalie dormer
gameofthrones,removed,we really need to ban female cosplays on this sub they complain about misogyny then they use there looks to gain an advantage i guarantee you this cosplay will hit thousands of upvotes and get to the top of the subreddit because of all the white knights here
gameofthrones,removed,now i understand the growing strong tyrell words
gameofthrones,removed,i wouldnt be either if it wasnt for the boobs
gameofthrones,removed,subtle nope that was very obvious
gameofthrones,removed,wasnt there a dialogue of jon saying that hed take her to winterfell one day
gameofthrones,removed,jon didnt really have much plot armor left at that point anyways the knights of the vale were coming to save them sansa would take over as lady of winterfell and jon would just be dead unless the writers want jon to find out about rlj but thats not overly obvious plot armor if he died it wouldnt be the end of the show or something
gameofthrones,removed,no way man this season is easily the worst one after season according to rasoiaf dont you remember they said bad poooosy in an episode dorne is the worst calamity to hit modern television even though it was a whopping minutes of the whole season that completely invalidates everything else that has been done in the show
gameofthrones,removed,he was running towards jons horse last time i checked a horse cant run at full speed in a zig zag formation so you would be the one to run in a zig zag formation and potentially miss the horse or worse have jon slow his horse down to make an easy target for ramsay the point was to get to the horse lets say ramsay couldnt shoot in a zig zag formation or at least it was harder for him to shoot rickon in a zig zag formation assuming rickon ran like that he would forget about rickons spastic zig zag running and wait for rickon to link up with the horse which he could easily pick out because horses run in straight lines and then kill both of them are you really that daft even if youre trolling thats pretty bad

gameofthrones,removed,you must be a dumbass teenager your grammar in all your posts is atrocious
gameofthrones,removed,all reasonable thoughts i would add though that considering how much the sand snakes hate the lannisters dorne might support the starks just for the fun of it i mean i could see ellaria declining to support the starks politically yet being emotionally supportive of the sand snakes joining the war independently
gameofthrones,removed,wouldnt work being dead for two days causes erectile dysfunction
gameofthrones,removed,nah ramsey bolton and his one lover who died were the real yanderes here and i wouldnt go as far to say that what was talking about would be kuudere kuudere tend to be very nonemotional on the outside i see lyanna as showing a ton of emotion
gameofthrones,removed,i think you forget what time does to the truth in westeros i just came across this quote from affc that perfectly encapsulates what im talking about the battle was a bloody thing the singers would have us believe it was all rhaegar and robert struggling in the stream for a woman both of them claimed to love but i assure you other men were fighting too and i was one
gameofthrones,removed,i just came across this quote from affc that perfectly encapsulates what im talking about the battle was a bloody thing the singers would have us believe it was all rhaegar and robert struggling in the stream for a woman both of them claimed to love but i assure you other men were fighting too and i was one
gameofthrones,removed,no theyre totally gonna bang
gameofthrones,removed,maybe sansa just wanted to wait until she heard back from littlefinger she probably felt like he would come rescue her but wasnt certain and she didnt want to tell jon that he might be coming and throw off his plan or something but instead just said wait until you have more she also probably did not want jon to rely on lf because she doesnt even trust him he sold her off to ramsay what i still dont understand is why she got so angry at jon for not asking her input when she didnt really have any
gameofthrones,removed,you know youd fap to it
gameofthrones,removed,yeah more parallels to daenarys since the two of them are naturally gifted at inspiring and uniting very people together it makes their ultimate union as king and queen more likely i just hope that george r r martin doesnt leave us with just that as an ending he needs to give us a taste of that happiness before tossing it all to the flames and making us hurt a la the red wedding he made it pretty clear from as early as killing off ned stark that ruthless people like ramsay snow are the ones who succeed
gameofthrones,removed,i know you were just making a turn of phrase but fun fact you can actually show hardcore porn on even basic cable its just that no mainstream advertiser would want to work with a porn channel
gameofthrones,removed,a
gameofthrones,removed,u wat gud gril bat u ned pad bosi
gameofthrones,removed,where was she at the end of the episode it was implied the mormonts led the vanguard after wun wun stormed the gates the shield jon picks up is from a fallen mormont i really hope we dont see her funeral pyre during the next episode
gameofthrones,removed,there is a difference between lets ned or robb dying vs jon with the first two both the audience were on board with the possibility of where they were heading and the audience understood the major shift in the story when they died if jon dies now there would be so many useless scenes set up im place that were just there to trick the audience the characters dont know about the rlj theory and what the possible ramifications are only the audience does jon dies then bram finally goes back into the tower to find out about jons parents then what nothing jons dead doesnt matter so why show the tower at all why show all the scenes about people questioning the history that the stark kids think they know it would all be pointless the first two deaths were good twists jons death and then revealing his parentage after it doesnt matter would just be bad writing
gameofthrones,removed,i would have sex with it
gameofthrones,removed,jons the key master cue up the porn music
gameofthrones,removed,have the characters been confirmed im not letting my justice boner fantasy be ruined by rumors s

gameofthrones,removed,ramsays actors name rheon is a letter away from theonhttpiimgurcombmgnssjgif
gameofthrones,removed,westeros dont heed another cunt queen westeros need a strong king
gameofthrones,removed,i think tommen will kill himself just after her mothers trial is over after that cersei will burn the city to the ground her last son is dead so fuck everything and kill everyone
gameofthrones,removed,they still could have pushed the rlj narrative by having jon die in subvert the audiences expectations then next ep burn his body where the theory is revealed and he emerges from the flames boom season closer id be cool with jon resurrections in one season if one was a fake out and another was the true rebirth
gameofthrones,removed,not the person youve been bickering with but jesus youre being immature
gameofthrones,removed,my my someone is irked
gameofthrones,removed,suicide thomen comeback jorah
gameofthrones,removed,yes we all know a woman would never lie to get her own way then immediately change her mind about it amirite
gameofthrones,removed,their storyline sucks but i would throw nymeria a bang
gameofthrones,removed,dont blame sansa its just one of the great female contradictions kind of like my wife who is starving but cant choose a restaurant
gameofthrones,removed,tommen dies next episode so thats no issue
gameofthrones,removed,elitists
gameofthrones,removed,yes just like the episode titles id imagine tyrions line about joining the game from the preview can be applied to multiple characters
gameofthrones,removed,or she open her legs so petyr help her gain the north for her
gameofthrones,removed,everyone here is blind at how much sansa is a cunt that wants jon to die so winterfell is for her just see her disappointment when she see jon alive running with wun wun
gameofthrones,removed,riamverystupid
gameofthrones,removed,is that how you justify child porn you sick fuck
gameofthrones,removed,if you think i ever implied or thought that youre the idiot here its clear why the episode is getting thats exactly what pisses me off the writing was shit and as a result it could never be a
gameofthrones,removed,first of all the writing was not shit it was if you didnt care about the characters involved maybe you just dont like this show that much or maybe i care more about them more than you do and as such i dislike a bastardization of what they are a does not have to be perfect nothing is perfect no one has ever seen anything like bob in film or tv that sets it apart a is literally perfection and if you actually think that no other battle scene in a film comes even close you really havent watched many films
gameofthrones,removed,i was going to waste my time typing a response to your post but here take my downvote and welcome to the negative
gameofthrones,removed,are you going to add the dress she wore in season episode
gameofthrones,removed,delete your fucking account
gameofthrones,removed,are you daft the problem wasnt jons original plan his original plan was fine the problem is that he deviated from it less than five minutes into the engagement sansa wasnt proposing an alternate plan she was warning him not to deviate from his plan he deviated from the plan anyway like an idiot man this subreddit is retarded i dont even like sansa and i have to defend her against the fanboys who think jon can do no wrong
gameofthrones,removed,g jon has to kill her to create lightbringer imo and grrm has already said the ending will make you cry
gameofthrones,removed,i dont know which i like better i was slightly disappointed with bob but only because a i just kind of didnt want it to go the way it did with jon fucking it all up and im disappointed rickons dead i dont like that there was ever a stark that wasnt a main character and b everyone predicted littlefingers army so there was no surprise also a little c i kind of think sansa was a piece of shit witholding the info about littlefinger from jon so many free folk tribes wiped from existence in a fight that wasnt theirs however none of those are the shows fault none of them are real reasons to dislike it i have issues with media like this a lot where i dislike something a little for reasons i know are unfair when i watch it a second time i know ill like it as much as is fair though but yeah hardhome was crazy in no small part because we had no idea we were about to get the first huge battle with the ww fuck that was a rad episode
gameofthrones,removed,to be fair game of thrones cant be held to the same standard in writing as breaking bad especially in episodes that focus on action like botb my gripe with this episode was the same i had since the last or seasons the level of omnipotence ramsey had is beyond my suspension of disbelief i know gots theme is about subverting the good guys win because of superpowersluckdestinygod tropes but in the show especially with ramsey its the reverse twenty goodmen always being two steps ahead killing everybody he pleases without repercussions getting handed all the trump cards just like that in botb his archery skills were ridiculous the farther rickon got away the less likely it would be for him to get shot but guess what an easy hit at metres the bolton armys strength was due to their superior numbers especially in horses sure lets sacrifice all of them the boltons suddenly have lots of archers too also they have a division of foot soldiers that are trained like roman soldiers moving in phalanx and using sarisas thats what the northerners surely are well known for but all that didnt help against failing to notice the army of knights riding through half the northern kingdom without ramsey learning about it still a episode in my book for the action alone
gameofthrones,removed,true but some things can be considered objective fact such as the fairly poor writing in this episode and the high quality cinematography
gameofthrones,removed,were guaranteed a shot of shae in god i hope not when you hire porn stars as actresses you get shitty acting like hers
gameofthrones,removed,yeah but the other kingdoms can tell her to fuck off and will not recognize her claim
gameofthrones,removed,youre reaching like crazy promise me ned take care of my baby and keep him safe also bury me next to rhaegar even though you dont have his body and burying me next to him would piss off everybody he mentions wanting to kill rhaegar again at this point ned wants to leave the crypt why rush if not because rhaegars remains are there because jon is rhaegars son and ned really wants to get away from that conversation
gameofthrones,removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikisexualityofadolfhitler yara looks like eva braun hitlers gf

gameofthrones,removed,and it still gets to me i had the best episode of my favorite show spoiled by rfreefolk must say i feel terrible for the book readers now that ive felt what its like firsthand
gameofthrones,removed,hes going to pop a phantom boner
gameofthrones,removed,okay i can see your point but im still judging mate
gameofthrones,removed,no tommen will jump out of a window
gameofthrones,removed,i really dont get why people would downvote you
gameofthrones,removed,im sorry you dont understand whats a joke and whats not but maybe one day your funny bone might find its way
gameofthrones,removed,theres always finger up the bumhole to coax some semen out and injecting it into a woman vaginally not sure if they know about prostate massaging in westeros though you never know given how male sodomy seems to be somewhat prevelant
gameofthrones,removed,im a straight dude and his hair gave me a boner
gameofthrones,removed,id just try to see tyrions dick i wanna know of its dwarf size or not
gameofthrones,removed,you know the kind was insane right
gameofthrones,removed,this needs to be in rladyboners
gameofthrones,removed,dude get a life i like this show just as much as the next person but come the fuck on
gameofthrones,removed,from the get go she is in a position where her benefit is in direct conflict with all the other characters in westeros this changes as the story progresses yet this time she turns into a revolutionary type of persona threatening to bring an end to the feudal westeros that many of the fandom loves she stands to change the world while a lot of people just want their favorite houses back in power and a glorious restoration for good old westeros they have been sold at the start of first novel also her arc in mereen through adwd is i love it by the way a slow story of how a person feels trapped and strangled in an impossibly complex situation rather than the same oldgood witty remark contests of kl so they find it boring besides quite a good number of people are for some reason still believing the antitargaryen propaganda they have been fed through the people who deposed targaryens and took that as bible and a large portion of the fandom finds it difficult to sympathize with a year old girl who is neither a tomboy nor a model of innocence but rather a complex woman with a complex sexuality and in an actual position of power
gameofthrones,removed,season has way too much cgi
gameofthrones,removed,wow amazing art joffrey looks a lot like cersei in getup please dont go back in time and give joff any wildfire bran
gameofthrones,removed,cunty the beast

gameofthrones,removed,kill yourself
gameofthrones,removed,absolutely not gorgeous drogon looks awesome too
gameofthrones,removed,lots of characters die so its better to not develop any attachment to them because before you know it they could be beheaded at the hands of the new cunty king or something like that
gameofthrones,removed,i meant the part where she holds the dragons and is naked
gameofthrones,removed,cersei was the one i was angriest about she is top for me
gameofthrones,removed,im not writing a transcript for you either pay attention to the show or dont watch why are you heading your time if you arent even following along
gameofthrones,removed,too old
gameofthrones,removed,hes a troll thats for sure
gameofthrones,removed,dont act like you dont want to see it too
gameofthrones,removed,i liked the last picture ill see my creepy ass out now
gameofthrones,removed,im a straight guy would still bang
gameofthrones,removed,eh shes pretty and i knew id get down votes no matter how i worded it its still a compliment to me if someone finds you attractive and while im not actually a creep its still inevitable that i will be assumed to be one so anyway here is another opportunity for you to down vote me
gameofthrones,removed,youre cousins hot
gameofthrones,removed,ans i also like the dragon
gameofthrones,removed,b isnt the hes had their tongues removed and kills them when they get too big part only in the books i dont remember that in the show at all

gameofthrones,removed,nice artwork but your man card is suspended for the next week
gameofthrones,removed,lol i tried to make this point myself but no one seemed interested then either the words pale white throat here are pretty gratuitous unless for some reason her throat will be unusually pale white it could have something to do with the others ww or it could be something to do with qyburns kl zombification program it might be something that wont happen in the show but only in the books but its a detail that seems to have some import
gameofthrones,removed,mi look kkilk mmmm
gameofthrones,removed,so for those on mobile who cant see the imgur explanation in season we see ned teaching benjen how to sword fight and he says that phrase back in season we saw jon and olly sparring and jon said the same thing to him the scenes are almost exactly alike in the characters movement and in the framing i love it though because it lets you know that ned taught jon to fight because jon says the same thing that ned must have said to him
gameofthrones,removed,do you honestly thing he doesnt know that you fucking dumb cunt
gameofthrones,removed,yeah i personally think she still looks about and am slightly concerned for people that call her hot and sexy
gameofthrones,removed,can we see sansas tits this season please
gameofthrones,removed,ok kill fuck and marry
gameofthrones,removed,those red heels turn me on
gameofthrones,removed,michelle fairley is a milf

gameofthrones,removed,the night is dark and full of cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,i know you know how to be a cunt
gameofthrones,removed,yeah if youve read the books this scene made more sense cersei more than once protests jaimes advances at first but then gives in and enjoys it and in this case she was protesting mostly because of as you said the venue heres an article on the scene that quotes grrm
gameofthrones,removed,lol im going to spell out game of thrones with cheetos and submit it as my snack for tonights episode and make it to the top
gameofthrones,removed,sexy hands sexy geek fandom want to go out
gameofthrones,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gameofthrones,removed,it doesnt really matter that mountain looked older because mountains face is covered by his helmet all the time due to being a zombie because of that its more important that his build is more appropriate to what grrm originally had in mind
gameofthrones,removed,id probably try to date sansa
gameofthrones,removed,because ramsay offers up rickon and as he rickon is running toward jon and his armies ramsay shoots an arrow and kills rickon as he is close to embracing jon dont think itll happen quite like that but i dont think rickon is dead yet despite the multiple offscreen deaths this season
gameofthrones,removed,and how did she stitch herself up after killing the waif
gameofthrones,removed,soyoure telling me well get a sophie turner nude scene yes pls
gameofthrones,removed,dont forget hillary
gameofthrones,removed,tormund has been my favorite character ever since he was first introduced oh how i long for the days when he was silently awesome a bit character now that he has been brought to the forefront i have no illusions he will be dead they brought back the hound which satisfies me just enough to not rage quit when tormubd dies not since the death of barriston selmy have i known such longevity in the characters i hold dear
gameofthrones,removed,exactly all the lannister actors are so on point their acting are so awesome except the tommen actor i dont know why but the fact that they used him on the show twice bothers me so much
gameofthrones,removed,ramsays fap sock is made out of flayed skin
gameofthrones,removed,once president trump is in office does that mean that the mexican president will be the king beyond the wall
gameofthrones,removed,well we saw jon naked hubba hubba
gameofthrones,removed,i hope your wife is hot at least
gameofthrones,removed,shoot arrows behind their back while they running
gameofthrones,removed,gsansa will become the grey lady while the reintroduction of the brotherhood without banners led by berric dondarrion precludes catelyn starks return it does put him in position to sacrifice himself for another lady stark who could potentially fall in battle that being sansa stark whether by sword or treachery sansa may fall victim to ramsay in the battle of the bastards leaving the catelyn storyline to continue with her
gameofthrones,removed,hopefully a twist other than the knights of the vale showing up to turn the tide of the bowl the ironborn show up at the siege of meereen to flank the masters the fleet doesnt burn and becomes danys rl j confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,its not porn its hbo
gameofthrones,removed,someone said they thought he was going to let rickon try and run actoss the battlefield to the otherside as he shot arrows at him do you like games little man
gameofthrones,removed,bronn or tyrion confessing his crimes or tormund trolling jons godlike pecker
gameofthrones,removed,in all seriousness though i seriously hope britain leaves and that the rest of europe follows
gameofthrones,removed,feminists have taken over this show and it sucks they even showed a flaccid dick on screen trying to make us believe its the same tging as showing boobs
gameofthrones,removed,i think he just fucked her really hard and maybe used some things as dildos that no one should use as dildos
gameofthrones,removed,they would have chased if he didnt fight them
gameofthrones,removed,hell likely just tell him he can go to his sisters army and then have his archers fire on him as soon as he gets close
gameofthrones,removed,til the titan of braavos has several dildos at his disposal in europe
gameofthrones,removed,i did what am i supposed to see
gameofthrones,removed,dont worry littlefinger wont die and you will most certainly get more littlefinger vs varys interaction ive said too much
gameofthrones,removed,some guy who worked on the set already spoiled most of the battle we can expect a wall of dead bodies made up of wildlings and bolten soldiers the battle is a disaster for both sides the difference is ramsay doesnt give a shit hell let his own archers shoot on his own men while they fight the wildlings the wildlings will hide behind the wall of dead bodies while they get surrounded by bolton shields also nobody should expect umbers or karstarks to change sides
gameofthrones,removed,you want this but u need the bad poosi
gameofthrones,removed,even if nothing else at least of them were hot
gameofthrones,removed,does it come with a built in fleshlight
gameofthrones,removed,if you get this worked out let me know been looking to set it as a text alert but im lazy fyi it also plays right before she burns all the great khals is season

gameofthrones,removed,mike pence confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,father figure vs meat dildo
gameofthrones,removed,yall are goddamn disgraceful comments so far and not a single one wondering if you can remove the clothing on the figurine
gameofthrones,removed,a lot of people would prefer to be a slave who is welltreated loved and lives in a good home than to be a free person living on the streets constantly at risk of starvation no this is a bunch of horseshit its the same horseshit excuse that the people of the american south used to justify a disgusting system that tore families apart and kept millions in forced servitude and it disgusts me when i see it used in a modern discussion about slavery some slaves were treated alright or theyre better off as slaves is never an excuse to support such an institution being a slaver isnt much different from being a lord its a different set of rules and laws neither of which we consider to be ethically valid under our own moral codes but under which good people can still be good people do you remember how the unsullied are created when they complete their training they are sent into the city where they are ordered to seize a slave infant from its mothers breast and then kill it to show that they know no fear for the trouble a silver is payed for the infant not to the mother but to the master now how many unsullied joined daenerys so just to create that batch of unsullied infants were slaughtered in the streets that is what a slave is worth to these people they arent seen as human beings theyre seen aslivestock the ghiscari have essentially created a system in which murdering a baby is about as morally abhorrant as slaughtering a chicken for your dinner anybody that can support and pay into such a system cannot be called a good person and it takes a shitload of cognitive dissonance to say that you can pay into this system and still be a good person westeros has roose boltons and eddard starks dany wants to rule a country by conquering it using three giant weapons of mass destruction which one is she closer to a roose or an eddard why are these the only two options why not sayaegon the conquerer her ancestor the guy who founded the kingdoms in the first place and used his dragons to instill a peace that the kingdoms had never seen before their being united
gameofthrones,removed,the more i watch the more i want to bang bring the downvotes
gameofthrones,removed,a slaver is a slaver is a ridiculous notion when even in the show they have a slave come up and say yo dany my master bought me nice things let me be a mentor to his children and kept a roof over my head but you went and crucified him along with hundreds and hundred of others so now im homeless which shows that slavery in this world isnt just people being forced to hard labor but had a wide variety of definitions just within this one city not sure what gave you that idea all the slaves in slavers bay were either captured and sold to the masters by corsairs and dothraki or were born to those already enslaved and torn from their mothers breasts to be sold like cattle those working in the households of masters such as the old man you mention are always castrated upon entry into their service just like in the middle east way back when obviously slavery is wrong but did the master who treated his slaves that well really deserve to be painfully crucified for the actions of other masters actions that his own slave after his masters death said his master fought against in mareens political system if one could openly fight against it its pretty easy to assume a decent amount of the people she had crucified really werent that bad just because this old dude is suffering from extreme stockholm syndrome doesnt mean his master was a good person do good people participate in a system that would castrate men like cattle or dogs a person who buys a slave is a person who does not see that person as a human being but as an animal and anybody capable of that does not deserve to be called good but thats just my opinion even when she takes the city by force she tears down a massive religious symbol of the city and is shocked people are pissed even commoners are pissed off at her the harpy is not a religious symbol its the symbol of the now dead ghiscari empire to which the upperclass of slavers bay once belonged it means nothing to the slaves and no they werent pissed at her for tearing down a conqueror tears down the symbol of the nation that they have conquered and replaces it with their own does this shock you did it shock you when jon tore down the bolton banners the entire time her soon to be husband is explain hey babe maybe you shouldnt crush my peoples culture youre making everyone angry how about baby steps and she refuses letting the resistance grow more until she does open the fighting pits anyway when its too little too late she didnt crush the culture of the majority she crushed the culture of the masters who make up a minority less than of mereens population and really the only aspect of their culture she tore down was slavery she allowed them to continue living in their pyramids and eating dogs as they did before on top of all of this where the hell does dany get off saying slavery and voluntary fighting pits are barbaric she fully believes in might makes right and has killed thousands of people conquering cities she doesnt even have a blood claim on while shes practicing to conquer more people and take more lives down the line for someone who doesnt believe in slavery she sure has no problem killing and conquering anyone who doesnt want to work for her so killing soldiers and slavers to conquer slave cities and free the slaves living therin makes you just as bad as slavers so what does that make eddard stark for starting a war that killed thousands just to avenge two people what does that make robb stark killing thousands to avenge one man and free two women hell abe lincoln must be the devil in your eyes huh
gameofthrones,removed,killing is her only accomplishment god id like to cut through people who comment this shit for the sake of comments like this i hope jon dies honestly hes been dislikeable from the first brooding and ignorant revenge driven shit like the rest of the starks dany is fierce and she has come so far if you want to slam the mad tag in someones face then i want at least good reasons dany frees people helps the innocent makes those who hurt good people pay for their actions shes a conquerer and a ruler a queen with a gentle heart but a firm hand that people can look up to sorry but shes not mad even producers have said so compared to cersei shes an innocent feather just because danys been final in her decisions and strict with what is allowed just because she answers justice with justice does not make her mad it makes her a firm ruler id have that any day over jons brooding and angst
gameofthrones,removed,wouldcouldshould of does not exist what youre thinking of is wouldcouldshouldve a contraction of the word and have please do not use would of could of or should of
gameofthrones,removed,as a book reader i am floored at how you could like such a terrible character
gameofthrones,removed,after reading about the spoilers this picture makes me so sad
gameofthrones,removed,not pictured is the raging boner he got after sitting on the throne
gameofthrones,removed,gendry is confirmed for season
gameofthrones,removed,its so funny having been a fan of the books for so long people had these types of quotes every time well sure ned died but everyone knows robb and renly are safe okay so robb and renly are dead but nobody would kill joffrey or tywin i doubt we see dany or jon die again until the series finale but wed be silly to assume that tyrion arya or bran are the same you could maybe make the case for tyrion he and dany and jon kind of have a weird thing going but bran or arya or varys or sansa or littlefinger could die at anytime
gameofthrones,removed,big characters are the characters who have chapters named after themthe starks daenerys tyrion none of them died yet in the books only ned one exception is that catelyn is dead in the tv series
gameofthrones,removed,i think robb stark and cat was huge too tbh
gameofthrones,removed,you can survive a knife in your stomach too wrapping it a nap and some medicine could be enough depends on where youre stabbed really
gameofthrones,removed,it wasnt shocking that he was winning to begin with he was renowned for his talent but he wasnt a main character type you would expect to have plot armor either
gameofthrones,removed,youre forgetting about the will to live
gameofthrones,removed,well obviously jon he already got killed and they brought him back to life like nothing happened ffs
gameofthrones,removed,jon snow was stabbed to death and left outside and literally brought back to life like nothing happened lol
gameofthrones,removed,its the wights that dont like fire white walkers just walk right through it
gameofthrones,removed,sweet summer child
gameofthrones,removed,no and go fuck yourself
gameofthrones,removed,nobody knows just how safe tyrion is because when we all first started watching if someone asked his about ned we wouldve said hes the main character theres no way they can kill him off and within the first season that happened its not something thats easy to predict
gameofthrones,removed,no i dont even think there were many flags at the kingsmoot also we only get to see yara and euron contest at the kingsmoot
gameofthrones,removed,they had the worst lines in the world and that doesnt change the fact they were all hot as fuck lmao
gameofthrones,removed,yes
gameofthrones,removed,yeah im pretty sure this will happen also in the promo jon breathes heavily and looks a bit shocked towards the ground which is prob rickons death killed by ramsays game of arrows
gameofthrones,removed,i really dont like dds plan to end the show in just more episodes broken up in to seasons i think hbo should tell them no to that plan and turn over the reigns to someone else if need be i think the show is going to get rushed and sloppy kind like this seasons seems to be at times it also worries me that the will leave the show open ended without much closure because there is talk of a movie
gameofthrones,removed,one of them is not hot imo but that still leaves im intrigued by dorne the way they killed the prince was just silly i really wanted to see his guard fight with that polearm but whats irritated me more is that they havent had a scene for dorne since the awful assassination isnt it a very powerful house they must be planning to incorporate it into the daenarys plot
gameofthrones,removed,obara is fugly
gameofthrones,removed,i must admit the one that had a thing for bronn did have nice bewbs
gameofthrones,removed,is leaking again
gameofthrones,removed,the entire reason beric is in the riverlands is to hunt and kill the mountain i could definitely see sandor falling in with them being the plot vehicle that brings on a reunion hype
gameofthrones,removed,whats her snatch smellin like ya gotta wonder
gameofthrones,removed,what the fuck is wrong with you
gameofthrones,removed,lame ass thread posted by lame ass
gameofthrones,removed,i dont recall anyone saying that this was one of the best seasons
gameofthrones,removed,edit i want someone to come up with a ridiculously detailed explanation of how theyd build it using only medieval tech and no magic why
gameofthrones,removed,as opposed to like aryas storyline or dany sitting around seasons
gameofthrones,removed,dd said they are planning only more episodes season having episodes and season having
gameofthrones,removed,this bothers me but the stabby stabby abdomen wound arya was got takes the gold how she was totally fine with doing acrobats and fighting a trained killer with that yehokay for some reason the otherworldly fantasy shit is a lot easier to take in than the more realistic and relevant things that happen
gameofthrones,removed,drink bleach you unfunny fuck
gameofthrones,removed,maybe he watched japanese porn and thinks all girls crymoan
gameofthrones,removed,except that the entire notion of age of consent is manufactured by our modern culture its not a law of nature or physics
gameofthrones,removed,cream pie
gameofthrones,removed,so theres this locker that people put stuff in
gameofthrones,removed,id love to be around lenas ass
gameofthrones,removed,if there was ever art that deserved to be supported it is game of thrones but i know things can be tough when you have little money
gameofthrones,removed,this what happens the boltons surround the starks and the wildlings with the shields as you see in the trailers then the vale come over the hill and save the day the bolton flee so jon snow chases them and kills ramsey the series ends with jon snow as king of the north and cersi blews up the high priest at the trial and becomes queen and margery tommen and the faith are killed
gameofthrones,removed,this what happens the boltons surround the starks and the wildlings with the shields as you see in the trailers then the vale come over the hill and save the day the bolton flee so jon snow chases them and kills ramsey the series ends with jon snow as king of the north and cersi blews up the high priest at the trial and becomes queen and margery tommen and the faith are killed from someone who was there
gameofthrones,removed,gay eminem and jon snow
gameofthrones,removed,whoa you have a terrific knowledge of battle
gameofthrones,removed,thats scary as fuck this dude needs to be the lead singer of a death metal band no one would ever fuck with that band they wouldnt even risk rushing up on stage to stagedive
gameofthrones,removed,then im expecting a sansa nude scene as she changes into her body armor equal rights equal rights
gameofthrones,removed,chance or there is no point to bring him back
gameofthrones,removed,wow thats a good question havent thought about it much id assume since i havent seen anything else that they just go by a month calendar like we do so even though a whole year may be winter or summer the time that passes stays the same always
gameofthrones,removed,she did porn look it up
gameofthrones,removed,for jon to have a legitimate claim to the iron throne rhaegar and lyanna wouldve had to been married otherwise jon is just a bastard and wouldnt have a claim to the throne just like he was never in line of succession for winterfell ironically they may have had a secret wedding though so it is still very possible hes the rightful heir
gameofthrones,removed,possible but seems a little to on the nose for george rr martin concerning with lord of the rings with jon being gandalf if he had to give up his life after his mission was accomplished also like europianist said dany cant bare anymore children
gameofthrones,removed,so is there a point to these bobblehead statue things or are they just for fun display
gameofthrones,removed,puss off i like the ending of lost
gameofthrones,removed,i have the most confused erection right now
gameofthrones,removed,it is funny how that is true but it is a very unique scenario bastards becoming kings almost never happens even if they are legitimized see the blackfrye rebellions
gameofthrones,removed,daenerys will not just randomly go mad your theory is shit your theory makes no sense and it is time to stop
gameofthrones,removed,op fishing for karma
gameofthrones,removed,i hear you that one struck me more than any death before or since
gameofthrones,removed,no
gameofthrones,removed,dakingindanorf
gameofthrones,removed,its because its the one stinging fate that you yourself will likely need to face in your own time on earth in that way its one of the more poignant demises
gameofthrones,removed,im sure you have the balls to be a completely irrelevant person on this sub
gameofthrones,removed,maybe you can keep your thoughts to yourself
gameofthrones,removed,thats what you wrote
gameofthrones,removed,asoiaf if you dont recognize the glaring logical issues with the shows writing and manipulative cinematography then you really are trash
gameofthrones,removed,for some reason i read that as and her self proclaimed titties and chuckled confusingly until i reread it
gameofthrones,removed,i think if jaime got the castle he didnt care about anything else he just wanted to end it now
gameofthrones,removed,im going to love all the crow eaten when it turns out theyre following the book story lines
gameofthrones,removed,he also tried to tell the same joke during his trial at the vale but was cut off thats the joke
gameofthrones,removed,this subreddit is really going to shit
gameofthrones,removed,beric is still alive lsh has long since decomposed this episode seemed to kill the hype of her for me
gameofthrones,removed,theyre both under an nda do you really think you can learn anything from those statements
gameofthrones,removed,i take automatically becomes king to mean who is the lawful heir in a simple birthright system where claims are made based on genealogical proximity the lawful heir is jaime lannister in practice of course birthright is only as good as its claimant the books and history both make it clear that anyone can be king if they have the capability and resources to seize the throne
gameofthrones,removed,casting but you get to be killed by the hound
gameofthrones,removed,oh my bad it was just a half rape so it doesnt really count and since it wasnt intended to be rape it cant be rape silly me thanks for explaining
gameofthrones,removed,just think of it as the greatest nut the north ever busted personally im not even going to fap this week
gameofthrones,removed,the tinfoilness of the season has seemed to come to an abrupt end she will be missed
gameofthrones,removed,if you break a stabbing down that much in a fantasy show you might be watching the wrong show go watch greys anatomy you lonely virgin
gameofthrones,removed,i guess you missed the discussion from the er doctor who said in if someone received her stab ones as depicted in a hospital while laying in the emergency room they would have a hard time saving her life also dragons arent real nobody could actually have revived jon snow that wall of ice is way too tall you cant really change your face with magic the hound should obviously be super dead from fighting brienne
gameofthrones,removed,isnt arya like or tho she cant make mistakes
gameofthrones,removed,i like it im also not a pompous millennial assclown who thinks they can write better than professionals who have spent their entire lives writing im perturbed by the lack of explicit explanation why arya acted severely out of character we can only assume it was meant to be a ruse the thing though is thats not bad writing bad writing would be a character who doesnt make mistakes blackfish dying isnt confirmed and edmure getting his kinsmen to lay down their arms isnt bad writing they didnt want to die dying for the castle was blackfishes quest not theirs and every single one of them would have died no argument
gameofthrones,removed,now if only you were giving that speech to your men it would be perfectly done that your two favorite things are semen and cumfuck the king get chicken youll do just fine its slim pickins oh what you did not know that valerian is regular steel mixed in with obsidian or that bear island mass produced it show me your face im sure i can fit it in seven hells huh sounds like the pot i last shitted in you sound like a jen or maybe an eric or maybe just a generic parrot with minuscule merit im absolutely certain that you will end up as bear shit
gameofthrones,removed,ive been saying this all day it blows my mind people on this sub acting like its greys anatomy
gameofthrones,removed,ok lets get something straight here all the people defending the episode and the idea that arya would receive fatal stab wounds to the abdomen and then beat the waif are missing the point those wounds are fatal in any world that doesnt have a surgeon who will repair the internal damage yes arya could live for days to a week maybe but perforated intestines will lead to sepsis stopping blood from leaking out doesnt mean you arent still bleeding internally there is no question she would die from those wounds sooner or later without a surgeon and antibiotics but the reason it is even more offensive is because the severity of the wound was to make the viewer think arya mightdie when she wasnt arya wasnt going to die in this story and they filmed this whole thing like she would definitely die but then at the end she doesnt
gameofthrones,removed,septa ulna is killed by the mountain tommen fallsjumps from a window which could possibly be from the fire according to leaks
gameofthrones,removed,i dont really feel that jaime would want to be king it seems more likely hed head home instead of rule
gameofthrones,removed,also arent the martells totally wiped out at this point i dont think there are any left standing or sitting in dorans case since team bad poosie went all michael corleone do you renounce satan on them
gameofthrones,removed,well need george to explain it
gameofthrones,removed,exactly thank god i hated the arya storyline so it feels awkward defending the writing but i loved the characterization of jamie it was so great people want good subtle writing but when they get it they miss it completely not only were both of those clear his conversation with edmure also set up another very crucial conflict if jamie sees himself as a good person which he does even if edmure doesnt see anything redeeming in him how can he come to terms with standing by as cersei burns down kl with wildfire which she undoubtedly will try they did such a great job of setting up his motivations for fulfilling the valonqar prophecy and making his eventual strangling of cersei that much more heartbreaking and then well truly see the jamie redemption arc that started in and got halted byyou guessed itbeing reunited with cersei its a different route than the books but its still a damn good storyline
gameofthrones,removed,people speculating about jaime or lf siding with ramsey are wrong from a tactical standpoint it doesnt make sense at all ramsey already has more men so why join him first of all hes a psychopath who is about as trustowrthy as a muslim in a gay bar if either jaime or lf do anything it would be to join jon snow to crush ramsey now with the more powerful army out of the way it would be a lot easier to route jons army and suffer far less casualties no one knows what danny is up to so pretty sure neither lf nor jaime would side with ramsey simply to combine forces to deal with her at a later time same goes for the night king as jons men are the only ones that know hes coming im pretty sure everything will end with danny vs night king because i dont see anything wiping out either army although hbo could give us giant middle fingers and have a convinient storm wipe out of her forces halfway to westeros
gameofthrones,removed,how do you know how closely theyre following the future book storylines
gameofthrones,removed,sucks not enough titties
gameofthrones,removed,meanwhile kal drogo dies from a scratch that get infected so is this why people are complaining they dont pay attention to the story or are too stupid to understand what even happens the witch intentionally made khal drogos wound worse you fucking retard lmao
gameofthrones,removed,lf would be okay with being the king of the ashes i think
gameofthrones,removed,wanting to kill arya is not the sudden inexplicable behavior im referring to but her being a stupid parkour street thug are you even paying attention dont other replying the answer is clearly no you arent reading or spending any time thinking about anything ive been writing unlike you im writing this for your benefit
gameofthrones,removed,you people really are the most unsatisfied group of virgins crawling around the internet the tears on this sub could hydrate me for life
gameofthrones,removed,thats too bad because at this point i was hoping the season would end with clegane gutting d and d and honestly the real villain grrm this is what happens when youre a lazy greedy fuck who cant just finish his goddamn books before you sell out to hbo
gameofthrones,removed,presumably so you dont know
gameofthrones,removed,actually that isnt true brienne wasnt running because she had to she was running because she failed
gameofthrones,removed,bin laden was right people want the strong horse
gameofthrones,removed,false literally anything is superior to cliche id rather have aids in real life then have to see one of my favorite characters of all fiction who i have waited nearly a decade to see what would happen to have things happen like this i mean it i would literally rather have aids than watch that episode again
gameofthrones,removed,guys guys chill shes not taking any chances on this well all get to bang her shell be banging all the blondies in sight for at least a week
gameofthrones,removed,considering that literally everyone on that list except for sandor will be dead by the time she gets back to westeros a man isnt a very good planner
gameofthrones,removed,for one moment i thought catelyn would show up in front of the hound among the brotherhood and that jaime was going to leave with brienne i guess books have absolutely no word in this show now lol
gameofthrones,removed,holy shit i just figured it out its said many times in the well written books not as often if ever in the garbage plotted show that the fm dont just kill for anyone or for any reason a person has to really want the death more than anything in the world and be willing to sacrifice and give up nearly anything to make it happen its the depth of the personal sacrifice that makes them willing to perform a contract not the sum of money or anything else though it often also costs a lot of money as a man has to eat arya caring so much about her list is the price the faceless god needed and she paid such a high price and has so many names plus she actually has the talent that rather than carry them out themselves as the faceless men they are having her do it on their behalf for her by training her to do it herself
gameofthrones,removed,the fuck are you talking about i grew up on these books on this story if dd cant have even a modicum of respect for the sanctity of this story and are going to ruin it for cheap shock value i can only wish greyscale leprosy and beheading by the mountain upon them and i will not only boycott this show i will boycott everything that they ever do for the rest of their lives
gameofthrones,removed,i love how the weir wood above him is not only wrapped around his neck it looks like which i find especially appropriate as thats the old one who is called the black goat of the wood with a thousand young which is essentially what whoever controls the worldwide weirweb is
gameofthrones,removed,if you havent read the arya chapters of the books at least its the opposite of this gobshite show her story arc in the books is really well written so dont judge how bad it has been in this show which is so bad i think im going to refer to it as that really long doritos commercial from now on because in the parts where they cant rely on grrm its filmed about as well as a doritos commercial
gameofthrones,removed,this exactly and the waif has to die thats what jaqen meant when he said that a girl had many talents the waif had proven that she was too filled with hate for even her own fellow teammate to really be trusted to stay in the fm guild you cant go around ruthlessly wanting to butcher people in your own guild and remain a member had the waif killed arya jaqen would have killed her as soon as she returned i think
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,never have i felt less guilty about pirating a show instead of paying for it
gameofthrones,removed,nearly as vacuous as a bad pun
gameofthrones,removed,vrays kills kevan and pycelle but he is probably going to find ships from dorne
gameofthrones,removed,you think i give a fuck about maise williams arya is who matters maise is just a face who gets paid way too much money to ruin my childhood dreams
gameofthrones,removed,not to mention how the fuck did three guys butcher like people i dont care how much armor or swords you have
gameofthrones,removed,goddamn youre an offensive idiot people are not mad because they were wrong about their predictions theyre mad because weve waited for so long to see this stage of her plot line end with shitty writing that belongs on the walking dead not game of thrones
gameofthrones,removed,just because one thing is straightforward doesnt mean everything is
gameofthrones,removed,this episode was so poorly written it had me wondering how dd ever even graduated from film school
gameofthrones,removed,no youre not going far enough it is pointless to watch this show the only reason it was better than other things on tv was that it was well written made sense and was genuinely very surprising now it is just the walking dead years ago
gameofthrones,removed,according to the books anyways your theory is definitely wrong
gameofthrones,removed,this is the only explanation that makes any sense other than that dnd are bad writers and i just rematched the ending scene with jaqen its also the only thing that makes sense with that scene because the trail of blood definitely ends at the pool meaning she used it to heal herself and it also explains why she brought the face back because as arya has previously learned for each contract the many faced god is owed a face so putting the waifs face in arya starks blank spot means that the contract on arya is done which means that to the mfg arya is now no one
gameofthrones,removed,not really but hes important nonetheless hes twins brother and hand of the king varys tells him what he expects the outcome of his murder will be its pretty amusing your niece will think the tyrells had you murdered mayhaps with the connivance of the imp the tyrells will suspect her someone somewhere will find a way to blame the dornishmen doubt division and mistrust will eat the very ground beneath your boy king whilst aegon raises his banner above storms end and the lords of the realm gather round him btw aegon is denaerys nephew that apparently still lives in the book varys doesnt support denaerys claim but aegons
gameofthrones,removed,yeah i do thats how being an audience to a storyteller works so get off your bullshit high horse ya mancy
gameofthrones,removed,i feel like the show skipped over some of the power plays between him and cersei after tywin dies she asks him to become the new hand of the king but he says hell only do it if she stands down as regent ultimately kevan becomes regent while cersei is locked up and names mace tyrell hand youre not missing much the books just have greater detail on cerseis downfall
gameofthrones,removed,perfect i just came
gameofthrones,removed,jaime wanted edmure to be scared into giving up the castle because jaime didnt want a violent siege he ramped up the sociopathic asshole act to be convincing
gameofthrones,removed,rladyboner lol but really this would be amaaaazing so outta left field too its great
gameofthrones,removed,ramsay will make it so if jon wants to attack jon will have to go through rickon killing him
gameofthrones,removed,hes gonna let rickon go and as rickon runs towards jon he will kill him with arrows
gameofthrones,removed,hell be target practice for ramsays arrows
gameofthrones,removed,im sorry to hear about your lack of sex
gameofthrones,removed,to be fair i dont feel like its his fault unless he tipped them off that dany was gone
gameofthrones,removed,good catch i dont see how tyrion is responsible for the siege at all then
gameofthrones,removed,downvote away but i had no problem it was pretty straight forward imo check my posts if you dont believes me with any of this when i watched the show the only thing that surprised and frustrated me about aryas story arc in episode and was the negative shit people said about it on reddit
gameofthrones,removed,what do you call a collection of erections that turn flaccid
gameofthrones,removed,there was an entire battle in season that we didnt see because tyrion was knocked out at the start of it its not like there isnt a precedent as far as i remember theres only one or two characters whos were implied to have died off screen only to come back more characters who have died off screen have stayed dead than not
gameofthrones,removed,as ggrm ejaculates hot pearls fueled by the cruelest murderporn ever written
gameofthrones,removed,sounds like it would be filled with tyrions cum so no
gameofthrones,removed,the things i do for love that was all jamie doing the pushing also in the books gcersei confesses to tyrion about it saying she would have wanted to find another way like scare him to silence
gameofthrones,removed,too bad wun wun dies in
gameofthrones,removed,i have a weird feeling you can be the judge but at the end it looks like jon is taking off his belt that holds his sword i am assuming ramsay says he will trade rickon for jon and jon thinks he must to save rickon or else ned will haunt him i also think davos leading the charge is because prior to the jon and rickon exchange i think they will both be seriously hurt maybe not killed but shot with arrows or something and davos will be overcome with anger and lead the front thoughts
gameofthrones,removed,ass creed sounds like the name of a porn site
gameofthrones,removed,thats dumb youre dumb theres arteries that feed blood supply to the testes too and unless you have a raging boner at the time of gelding youre not actively shunting blood to the penis any amputation is going to have blood loss the reason for castration is to prevent secondary sex characteristics not minimize blood loss
gameofthrones,removed,can we please stop with all of those bran screwing x mind so y happens
gameofthrones,removed,if you and youre friends remember this but still complain how arya survived a few stabs to the gut then just relax and reflect on the time jon took arrows and lived then remind yourself that it is a fantasy novel one it which people can come back from the dead they can warg into animalspeople and some can walk in fire if you and your friends are still bothered then follow my step solution grab a pen grab some paper write your own darn novel and do it the way you like it if you follow these steps you will be well on your way to solving this dilemma while the rest of us enjoy the novelsshow
gameofthrones,removed,the waif obviously didnt think the wound was fatal or she wouldnt have came for her after killing lady crane people take ages to die from infection and its not clear how much time passed in the episode for her
gameofthrones,removed,the war for briennes cunt

gameofthrones,removed,horse cum
gameofthrones,removed,dude get a fucking life seriously you out way to much time to try and prove something wasnt believable is a show about dragons and ice zombies get a fucking purpose in life that dos t require so much effort
gameofthrones,removed,heres the follow up to this post please comment there thanks
gameofthrones,removed,maybe tommen is inside the sept once it catches on fire this is what forces him to jump out the window trying to escape the fire i hope cersei is watching with glee as the sept burns only to see tommen scared and full of fear leap to his death to avoid the fire she created this might make her crazy enough with rage and loss to literally want to burn all of kings landing jamie will show up with a well placed volonqar strangle hold to save the day again and fulfill the prophecy
gameofthrones,removed,so you basically copied someone elses idea now youre using this subreddit to try and sell tshirts how long did it take to make this minutes or downvoted and on that note im getting kind of tired of seeing all this lame fanart especially when its such a transparent gimmick for upvotesattention and in your case making money sigh something about this just doesnt sit right on this end if people want to share their work and i mean legitimately want to share some piece of work theyve worked really hard on thats one thing whats happening in this post though is another thing entirely
gameofthrones,removed,definitely not basically platemail coat of plates was a good armor type used by higher ups but plate armor was vastly superior despite both being largely metal the curves of full plate is what provides a large portion of the protection that and it doesnt have nearly as many little chinks for blades to slip between as a coat of plates
gameofthrones,removed,not to take away from what the op did at all op actually delivered but for those interested in the map with the far reaches of essos included i found this
gameofthrones,removed,yes and yes we got a second flash inside the tower with neds hand with blood and a female hand next to him
gameofthrones,removed,of course i got your stupid reference it just made no sense like the rest of that half assed argument you have probably due to the fact that you havent seen the show

gameofthrones,removed,i have a very small penis
gameofthrones,removed,i dont hate him any kid of that age is smart to listen to mentors and elders advice rather than try to rule on his own intuition he did what he did at basically every turn based on what he thought was right and just he messed up at times but not out of ill intent but because hes a fkn kid i dont know where people get this hate boner towards him from is it just because people are so freaked out by hs that anything he touches becomes evil by association
gameofthrones,removed,as soon as the torrent comes out im going to sync the entire episode to watch the throne and post it here under the title watch the game of thrones it if works itll be almost too perfect
gameofthrones,removed,you could tell he had a book boner
gameofthrones,removed,proof this show is about making men look weak and women strong

gameofthrones,removed,its sad to live in your world where that wasnt enjoyable your life must be misery
gameofthrones,removed,oh boy here cum the tinfoil theories
gameofthrones,removed,no i hate how the show is pandering to women by making a little year old girl so badass its pathetic what makes this show great is that men rule and women serve i hope lyanna and sansa and dany die brutal deaths cant wait ps i loved how walder frey and caster treated women thats how it should be in this world
gameofthrones,removed,rfuckollies meaning takes an unexpected turn
gameofthrones,removed,httpimgurcomsrggwga looks like it you can see targaryen and tyrell flags in this scene and the shot before this you could see martell flags
gameofthrones,removed,its risky stuff talking about a possible naked jon snow your post will explode with all the fan girls and orlando survivors
gameofthrones,removed,great something new for people to make porn of
gameofthrones,removed,am i the only one no i know im not that didnt like the knights of the vale coming for the rescue was fucking predictable rickon dying too btw it was a little retarded zigzag pls was predictable at least tormund dying would be a surprise a lá got everything that happenned was too positive to be a episode of got i dont know i didnt feel the emotion everyone felt
gameofthrones,removed,i think dd might just give arya the role of lady stoneheart next season
gameofthrones,removed,best episode of anything ever i am in absolute awe its like they were jerking us off for years but wouldnt let us cumand we all just came simultaneously now its very likely that jaime is gonna be the one to kill cersei but where does that leave arya arent the only people on her list the mountain and cersei
gameofthrones,removed,wait wait as a nonbook reader isnt jon danys half brother
gameofthrones,removed,damn i just had a thought all this time cersei has been driving herself crazy with the prophecy she always just assumed tyrion was the valonqar and has treated him as such but what if over the next season things with jaime get rough jaime sees her as what the mad king would have become if he didnt kill him so he begins to act distant cersei begins to get paranoid and starts to rethink the prophecy at this point she has shut down emotionally so she comes to the conclusion that jaime is actually the one to fulfill the prophecy so she has him kill and he dies in the arms of the woman he loves but then shit goes down with danny and co and they capture cersei and tyrion really is the one to kill her written by m night shyamatargaryen
gameofthrones,removed,mother brother sisterinlaw and many soldiers brutally murdered dont know if arya is dead or alive sansa only recently escaped a psychopathic rapist madman jon was only resurrected after being killed by his own men i would exactly say thing have been going well
gameofthrones,removed,a girl has hit puberty and jamie is a sexy sob
gameofthrones,removed,since both side characters have their own major boss battle to come dany vs euron sansa vs littlefinger jon vs night king theyd be too busy to ever consider fight each other besides their side friends all know each other very well which will avoid any potential for conflicts whats likely to happen is that danys fleet will be decimated by euron during a massive storm and euron will pull out a trump card his dragon binder which majorly screws dany until she get the binder herself jorah will likely sacrifice himself to blow the dragonbinder and win back the dragons once they reach westeros cersei would have likely blown up kingslanding along with the tyrells and sand sneks the whole thing a smouldering ruin so dany would be forced to head south the cluster fuck of a riverland would end in slaughter as arya wipe out the freys and move edmure back to the lord position they also head north meanwhile in north sansa will have to deal with personal desires and littlefingers a major political battle later sansa will likely end littlefinger herself or they both die jon would be too busy to try and find bran which leaves ruling to sansa jon will act as a scout to see how close night king is to the wall but falls into a trap and nearly dies before bran using his power to save jon bran gets captured himself and night king plunge a dragon glass to his heart basically levelling the playfield against danys dragons once sansa dealt with littlefinger she may confront dany as she doesnt trust her they nearly fight in open field with potentially disastrous consequences but jon prevents this by announcing his parentage to both armies and he is the song of ice and fire with all tools in his disposal night king uses the horn stolen from citadel to bring down the wall it is revealed that euron worked with the others all along bonus ice dragon controlled by corrupted bran
gameofthrones,removed,yup people were complaining about how he still loved cersei in riverrun whereas in the books he does not but how its unraveling in the show its pretty great if you ask me
gameofthrones,removed,haha thought you said stripping her tittiesmaybe ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gameofthrones,removed,the whore actually ordered it because he didnt pay her it just happened to fall on the same day as the green trial
gameofthrones,removed,the one with most titties you say
gameofthrones,removed,but dem titties
gameofthrones,removed,oh my god he definitely felt the bern
gameofthrones,removed,when sam went into the citadel library i knew at that moment that the song of fire and ice was the tale of westeros told by sam
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,the most perfect tits on television are gone 😰😰
gameofthrones,removed,that means jon gets to bang his aunt luck son of a
gameofthrones,removed,i was hoping she would get out and was disappointed she died but as the episode went on i realized it had to happen there is so much more going on big picture wise do we really need to drag out the margerycersei struggle more also if she lived tommen doesnt pull a birdman and try to fly need to start lining up the final bosses right now weve really just got cersei and the night king left its yet to be seen if euron will prove a real threat littlefinger will try to enter the game or if those stupid fucking sand snakes will i dont know stab dany for no reason because they got bad poosey between their legs and their ears
gameofthrones,removed,they could have done all that better i think or not showed so many useless scenes but her trip was essential in hindsight she also has a wolf militia as well now if they stay true to the books
gameofthrones,removed,lets see here melisandre rides south meets up with the brotherhood without banners arya also shows up there fulfilling the premonition that those two would meet again the hound goes with arya to kings landing because cersei is on her list he runs into the mountain in the throne room and the battle wages as cersie blood spills slowly over the iron throne s fucking confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,lol everyone downvote this fucking idiot who does he think he is expressing his own opinion fucking kill yourself idiot
gameofthrones,removed,sad fap for the margery that is gone
gameofthrones,removed,azor ahai is discussed multiple times in the show rewatch or read the books or use google
gameofthrones,removed,exactly there is a very well known redditor on a couple of other gotrelated subs that has been spoiling episodes for the last few seasons heshe spoiled the last episodes to a t as to what will happen others then come into this sub with their theories or predictions based off what was spoiled by that person in those other subs its pathetic but there will be no stopping any of it from happening seems the only way to enjoy the show as much as a naive viewer would is to stay off of reddit completely during the season and perhaps even before as they finish up filming
gameofthrones,removed,regislayer
gameofthrones,removed,did he bang her
gameofthrones,removed,grrm seems arrogant and up his own ass enough to completely change shit now just so he can steal some thunder
gameofthrones,removed,im here to fuck shit up and suck on my mommys titties and im out of mommies
gameofthrones,removed,those books were full of porn
gameofthrones,removed,it isnt the one with the most titties
gameofthrones,removed,your ಠಠ
gameofthrones,removed,i mean im sure it was more the writers that put them there to get told to shut up
gameofthrones,removed,this is a common theory online lol your roommate didnt come up with it his facts are all backed though in addition to tywin explicitly claiming many times that tyrion is not his son and aeryss raging boner for tywins wife tyrions description in books matches targ description pretty well read through it online i actually think that theory has a good chance of being true
gameofthrones,removed,everyone knows the one with the most titties why is my brain so
gameofthrones,removed,but jon could bang sansa without it being incest
gameofthrones,removed,underrated comment would bang
gameofthrones,removed,a library porn gif please
gameofthrones,removed,kill yourself
gameofthrones,removed,that baby saw some bad poosey
gameofthrones,removed,never go full isis
gameofthrones,removed,oh my sweetsummer child
gameofthrones,removed,there is a lot of love there that is only tempered by a belief they are brother and sister when they discover that is not the case i think jon and her bang for sure god i hope he does not end up with dany that would be corny af
gameofthrones,removed,i would have had a boner as my username hints it
gameofthrones,removed,i dunno i imagined him having the most raging boner when she glanced at him after she sat the throne
gameofthrones,removed,tin foil i can expect a jon and dany meeting with bran and everything with him bran reveals jons a targ dany is angry at the suggestion and has drogon burn him and yoooooo naked jon emerges untouched or something theres gotta be some sweet fire survival reveal
gameofthrones,removed,i was too but cersei simply outplanned everybody involved margaery was ahead of the curve and definitely working on her plan but she knew something was wrong as soon as cersei and tommen didnt arrive at the sept
gameofthrones,removed,catelyn stark brought back to life by beric dondarrion who died in the process she was found in the river by nymeria aryas wolf who arya warged into at the time then found by the bwb she leads a far more ruthless bwb and they begin intercepting freys and killing them they killed the frey third in line of succession just a child another frey in the epilogue of asos the current frey heir etc the guy with the yellow cloak that was killed by the hound in the tv series is still a loyal member of the bwb and he is her right hand man they catch brienne and pod and almost hang them its a cliffhanger at the end of affc then send brienne on a mission to capture jaime to answer for his crimes against the starks and tullys
gameofthrones,removed,what did he do to convince her of this his lame mereen strategy that was questionable and gave a couple of corny speeches and lied about that whole theon episode and made that about him
gameofthrones,removed,season is going to start with a bang well dany and yara are going to have a lot of free time on that ship after all
gameofthrones,removed,wait how isnt catelyn stark lady stoneheart
gameofthrones,removed,can we all take a minute to acknowledge qyburn bothered to make sure zgregor can achieve an erection
gameofthrones,removed,besides episode and i liked it
gameofthrones,removed,houndgravedigger coldhandsbenjen and rlj are all predictions that remain unconfirmed within the books dont they and i dont believe the blackfish has returned in the books either i dont think its accurate to say these events are just what happens in the story its a tv show with a huge slightly rabid following the showrunners have to keep them happy or there will be blood in the streets to keep their ratings up it sure sounds like fanservice the very best kind if you ask me
gameofthrones,removed,i would have cum on my self right there
gameofthrones,removed,considering jaime is my absolute favorite character on the show i would cum bucket loads of milk of the poppy if that happened
gameofthrones,removed,its all really simple if youve been paying attention at all the wildfire has been there for years and was put there by the mad king there had always been rumours about it but nobody took it seriously she is not a known regicide and kinslayer nobody can prove it was her that blew up the sept for all anybody else knows it was an accident and the grand maester has suspiciously gone missing too shes the last one alive in her family all of the children are dead stannis and renly are dead there are no other baratheons left on the show at least one of her brothers was actually convicted of killing the king and the other one is in the kings guard shes queen because theres absolutely nobody else to do it
gameofthrones,removed,what about that one scene where a sand snake shows her titties to bronn in a jail cell i was okay with that scene they were some nice titties
gameofthrones,removed,well maybe itd be good to have some sort of prompt that asks you if you want a thumbnail ffs i swear so many subreddits you post a simple thing and itd removed because the community has no idea how to adhere to all their pedantic bullshit rules
gameofthrones,removed,why is there a thumbnail at all if i clearly indicated theres an spoiler
gameofthrones,removed,really though what is spoiled by a tiny image of qyburn since you cant see anything beyond that
gameofthrones,removed,mods pretty sure this needs to be deleted because spoilers in the thumbnail i only base that on how stupidly sensitive it is but since its supremely pedantically and idiotically applied i figured yall would want to know
gameofthrones,removed,also didnt dany pull that pin out of her cleavage i guess yara would want that pin now though she does not want to be the hand of the queen but the queens extra finger
gameofthrones,removed,especially to someone who i imagine isnt allowed to drink as part of her vows evil on multiple levels
gameofthrones,removed,no more bewbs
gameofthrones,removed,the effects were amazing this episode it felt like sams erection was right in our faces
gameofthrones,removed,you cant see that hes the hand in the thumbnail the thumbnail is completely illegible its a dark blur and nothing else
gameofthrones,removed,if your sub has a rule about images that have spoilers and you enable thumbnails in that image its your own fault if they appear but if youd rather tell people their post isnt worth seeing because you failed to set up your infrastructure in a way that adheres to your pedantry go right ahead
gameofthrones,removed,but at the same time cercei must burn them all to truly enrage jaime i feel plus with the dany prophecy seeing the iron throne in ashes i feel like someone has to burn the city down it could just be dany with her dragons but i feel like it most likely will be cercei with her wildfire that is confirmed she has now but in the end yes i do believe jaime will queenslay her sister
gameofthrones,removed,weirwoodcom could be a great porn site
gameofthrones,removed,o noes sis gotsoiaf copying reddit comments cause everyone already predicted this like years ago they also predicted that bran the builder is related to bran similar to how hodor was controlled by bran they predicted the wall was magical reason the whitewalkers cant climb south they also predicted jon snow was a targaryen like what years ago
gameofthrones,removed,oh wow im learning a lot about this subject today i also learned from you that i stand every chance of being right about bran that depending on which nerves were severed he may or may not be able to achieve an erection when he gets older thanks so much for throwing in your two cents on the subject
gameofthrones,removed,so much porn
gameofthrones,removed,it wasnt justice she has a boner for it was self indulgence
gameofthrones,removed,i am deaf confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,httpimgurcomlwzdsna found this at since tyrell and dorne made an alliance with targaryens season finale isnt that too much of an army cersei would shit her panties if she knew about this is this even accurate at all
gameofthrones,removed,what was he cumming in if she was wearing underwear
gameofthrones,removed,thats fine bro but biologically can a zombified clegane get a boner
gameofthrones,removed,unsure if tommen killed himself bc he never got to bang his hot wife or bc he saw what his mom was capable of doing
gameofthrones,removed,finally found the httpsiimgurcompzpxkjpg from baltimore meetup
gameofthrones,removed,how ironic no one is westeroes realizes the targareyens are back with a bang
gameofthrones,removed,i think i had an o face at the same time turned to so and said i think i just came seriously stunning library
gameofthrones,removed,i know what an erection feels like michael no its the opposite its its like my heart is getting hard
gameofthrones,removed,please tell me im not the only one who cummed watching this episode i mean cercei bang arya oh god rlj confirmed daeneris is coming cercei motherfucker queen jon king i mean is there anything that this episode has not got
gameofthrones,removed,who wouldnt after all that
gameofthrones,removed,were not even comming werre just in the climax just before that happens and well be in the climax for another whole year
gameofthrones,removed,nah i dont think they have porn in that internet
gameofthrones,removed,he was too busy wanting to be up her ass to care
gameofthrones,removed,so youre one of the people that think that slack jawed spank with permanent duck face is hot huh
gameofthrones,removed,you gave me a boner
gameofthrones,removed,no blood no boner sorry gregor
gameofthrones,removed,also armin gets burned to death by wildfire
gameofthrones,removed,can his rotted dick even get a boner these are the questions we should be asking hoping for some answers in season
gameofthrones,removed,read that as most titties
gameofthrones,removed,my god that was a good episode very satisfying to watch arya get sweet revenge very sad that queen margery and her brother were killed by cersei i cannot wait for cersei to be destroyed on that note i hope im allowed to say what i predict will happen im only a recent fan and havent read the books nor do i intend to in that regard im like jon snow i know nothing dany will attack with the help of the dorn women arya will kill cersei before dany gets to i pray to the faceless god this happens jaimie insane with mourning over his lost love and weary of the lanisters battles will join tyrion and pledge his allegiance to dany after all she is blonde enough thank you bron dany and jon will square off for the iron throne jon snow will be killed this time it sticks sansa will align herself with dany and be given the rule of winterfell dany prevails and sits on the iron throne wildcards who can affect things somehow jorah mormont and that witch the red woman
gameofthrones,removed,would still fap
gameofthrones,removed,robb and oberyn are already up there cersei is now added to the list most probably but there is also sansa jon and dani
gameofthrones,removed,we need him to find information on the white walkers and instead he spends all his time hes looking up red head incest porn

gameofthrones,removed,im sorry but that was waaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy too long no way i am ever going to read whatever you just wrote i make it a point to always ensure that people express themselves in as few words as possible to make sure we stay on track whenever you learn to write comments of words i might consider reading it until then i shall return to masturbating furiously over danys cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,fuck sake man so annoying having to actually restrain from making gifs of show characters jumping out of windows uuugh why should we care about other people if they dont watch the show on release they should blame themselves anyway
gameofthrones,removed,god youre a piece of shit for this comment
gameofthrones,removed,upvoted because racially hilarious
gameofthrones,removed,thats some serious poosay stank
gameofthrones,removed,i just upvoted it purely because youre being a bit of a douche about it
gameofthrones,removed,oh then things are alright i guess i mean shes dead your dead but at least you got to bone her
gameofthrones,removed,we have reached such level of epicness that having arya brutally pull a cartman and cut walders throat is a minor part of an episode
gameofthrones,removed,weirwood trees are for porn
gameofthrones,removed,stfu
gameofthrones,removed,tommen was awesome he showed cersie that she truly was stupid everytime she tries to scheme things backfire and this is going to backfire bigger then anything before the worse part is i dont think fans of the show who hate cersie are going to enjoy her death she doesnt care anymore i honestly believe shell be happy once jaime kills her since it fulfills the prophecy there isnt going to be horror shock or fear on her eyes when she dies itll be acceptance
gameofthrones,removed,she got away with it cause shes a woman nobody gave stannis the same benefit of the doubt or alliser when he killed jon snow
gameofthrones,removed,i think that in the middle of season the northerners already saw the undead and the white walkers on the other side of the wall and convinced themselves and their lords that yup we need more men for this shit i think the northerners will not care about jons heritage if hes a bastard or not but they will need a leader that knows how to fight the white walkers tyrion quoted that its not the last time someone will love dany i think that tyrion will advise dany to talk to jon and jon will just relinquish his title and the north to dany for exchange of man power to fight the white walkers just like what tyrion said in this episode thats the kind of selfsacrifice that makes for a good ruler
gameofthrones,removed,httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpdragonbinder
gameofthrones,removed,good comeback sorry not sorry you got caught
gameofthrones,removed,boner or not he could still tear that bitch apart with it
gameofthrones,removed,im responding to your comments mate its a public forum a public post im not sending you pms stop responding to me thats all you need to do
gameofthrones,removed,bullshit
gameofthrones,removed,damn i forgot about that its hard to even imagine how the scene would go ifwhen sansa and tyrion see eachother again and their reactions to eachother or tyrion and jon you pissed off the wall i climbed it and commanded it and dont call me bastard i married sansa and killed the asshole father i told you about looks like you wore the bastard title like armor afterall and it can no longer hurt you
gameofthrones,removed,she channeled her inner cartman there walder frey scott tenorman
gameofthrones,removed,they held the shot on that open window just long enough for you to realize they were doing it for a reason then he climbs up there and bows out so nonchalantly and there was no music to tell you how to feel about it it stuck with me
gameofthrones,removed,well had he continued the scene on the imgur or if you go rewatch it she basically tells tywin fuck you i say my lord deal with it so her saying my lord to frey was true to her character
gameofthrones,removed,makes sense why rhaegar wanted to bang her then targaryens tend to keep it in the family
gameofthrones,removed,oh yeah it was a great scene but with the exception of these last couple episodes theres been some questionable writing this season and the whole dorne plot as been a mess so its kinda hard to have faith when you know dorne is gonna be in the episode seems like they salvaged the plot though which is encouraging maybe they can re cast the sand snakes like they did with daario naharis lol
gameofthrones,removed,id say the gravedigger is confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,rfuckolly
gameofthrones,removed,wealthiest family in westeros i know i know lannister gold but thats just liquid value the reach provides more food than any other region and you cant eat gold you just demonstrated you have absolutely economic sense whatsoever for one just liquid value is what you want not being able to eat gold doesnt matter you cant eat your own money or your bank account but you seem to be content working or going to school for money because money can buy food if you think trading a larger value in goldmoney is worth trading for a lesser value in food ill gladly make that trade with you in real life dollars for dollars worth of food what say you i mean you cant eat gold
gameofthrones,removed,oh god i think that might be it that is the kind of cruel game of thrones irony i dont guess without help
gameofthrones,removed,off topic she doesnt really look as good as the showstory makes her out to be like i would totally bang her but i wouldnt go to war for her nor kill an entire bloodline
gameofthrones,removed,still weird since shed be marrying her nephew
gameofthrones,removed,you were looking forward to arya becoming a badass assassin and now that she is youre over her story line and think shes over the top what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
gameofthrones,removed,and fewer
gameofthrones,removed,yeah thats what i figured
gameofthrones,removed,i was a bit disappointed tbh theyre a bit saggy and far apart for my taste
gameofthrones,removed,yeah thats what i figured
gameofthrones,removed,too sweaty swollen ankles smudged makeup umattractive crying bloody bed wouldnt bang
gameofthrones,removed,dorne was overdue for some bad poosay
gameofthrones,removed,dat booty
gameofthrones,removed,holy fuck i think hes really that dumb
gameofthrones,removed,so sick of people claiming this queens as a good thing for the show it honestly makes me feel less represented in my favorite show and i find it offensive to do this simply to appease the feminists and make a politcal statement this isnt a plot device for the sake of the show its to send a real world message that women are strong keep politics out of shows jesus christ
gameofthrones,removed,what is hypewhat is hypewhat is hype may never dieeeeeee shame shame shame shame shame shame shame the beat is the mountain and you are the vipers
gameofthrones,removed,porn

gameofthrones,removed,a man is so hot

gameofthrones,removed,hes going to bang himself
gameofthrones,removed,til killing people is okay if you are following your religion and it doesnt make you evil are you a muslim by any chance

gameofthrones,removed,ew geriatric sex scene
gameofthrones,removed,that is exactly what this series needs aunt nephew porn
gameofthrones,removed,not today but soon how dare you get me hyped
gameofthrones,removed,you know nothing
gameofthrones,removed,nice its good to be king of the north
gameofthrones,removed,lf has given too much information to sansa his feelings for her are his achilles heel hes shared his thoughts about her halfbrother and things of the like from that moment forward you see sansa change in a positive demeanor towards jon she prepares him a fur like her father wore he wears roughly the same leathers that ned wore they arent totally in agreeance with one another at first when they dont listen to her plans for the botb you then see sansa show up at the perfect time with the knights of the vale lf to save the day which is her way of showing shes not to be overlooked the look she gave lf as everyone was chanting for the kingindanorf was nothing more than a fuck you told you so i no longer need you kind of moment lady mormont is da real mvp though
gameofthrones,removed,mlady i found the cure youre probably not going to believe this but well we need to bang probably many times
gameofthrones,removed,yeah i have a friend who thinks hes so awesome and i just cant get on that train he went from being an asshole to a coward to now hes just kind of there
gameofthrones,removed,this is the worst advertising for a site ever why would i post to a site that wont even let me post i like reddit but there should be an im not a asshole button
gameofthrones,removed,and cersei and jamie wanting to bang
gameofthrones,removed,you rationalize and its not a bad rationalization but i still think they didnt show his death for budget reasons andor because the actual actor is probably too old to do action scenes
gameofthrones,removed,fuck olly
gameofthrones,removed,thats because they werent groomed as the heir apparent a lot of his problems come from constantly being told he is the greatest thing ever and is owed the world and he is entitled to everything by right plus i dont think hes insane just an incredibly sadistic and uppity asshole
gameofthrones,removed,bad poosay
gameofthrones,removed,fear the walking ned
gameofthrones,removed,there are many female characters whom are very masculine in got dany is the one looking like a porn star yes
gameofthrones,removed,maybe he can no longer get an erection
gameofthrones,removed,im just guessing here but i assume the red wedding is because of all the deathblood and purple wedding because joffreys face got purple from the poison again this is kind of me talking out of my ass so someone please correct me if im wrong
gameofthrones,removed,red wedding bloody as hell literally everyone that wasnt with the freys got killed then and there purple wedding joffreys corpse was purple as an effect of the poison that killed him
gameofthrones,removed,the gempoison dispenser is made of amethyst stones these are almost always purple though on the show for some reason they made them bluish so i believe it is a combination of the purple gem which they later found in the goblet and joffrey turning color
gameofthrones,removed,he died for brans sins rip
gameofthrones,removed,my brother didnt see it coming and so when it was a shot of just the window and the burning sept he kept talk i told him to shut the fuck up and watch them tommen jumped
gameofthrones,removed,as someone else said joffrey colors were baratheon yellow and black and lannister red and gold it was purple was his face turned purple
gameofthrones,removed,i have no idea if im able to post yet as it hasnt been specified i realy want to get this out though so plz dont ban
gameofthrones,removed,youre closer to right than i am the meeting i was speaking of between sansa and baelish happened in moles town much closer to castle black than moat cailin i dont know why i was convinced they went south first
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,yeah i just started my first rewatch when ned had to kill sansas wolf and bran snapped out of his coma it made all the sense in the world
gameofthrones,removed,absolutely because im especially weird a few weeks before season ended i rewatched seasons and and last week thought fuck it ill start from session its like there are entire episodes ive missed despite having read the books its unbelievable how much they cram into each episode i noticed little things though one question wasnt the wildfire beneath the city out there by aeryss pyromancers the show alludes to cersei instructing lannister pyromancers to create all of the wildfire during the scene when lancel is informing on cersei to tyrion in the litter and another thinglancel is a pathetic milksop with no equal— whether as cerseis fuck toyerrand boy—or as the high sparrows lackey
gameofthrones,removed,well most of my friends kinda forgot gendry he thought jon is the only one have the valyrian steel sword mormonts basically cause of the family names they got confused on few of them
gameofthrones,removed,i remember the hodor theon champion and actor penis scenes but not the other ones links plz
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,at
gameofthrones,removed,we had tons of butt shots though emilia clarke said iwan rheons but was a cute great butt
gameofthrones,removed,i thought the exact same thing pretty blond boy one minute hes sucking renlys dick the next hes fucking cersei whut
gameofthrones,removed,just enough of a shit to be an asshole for no reason right
gameofthrones,removed,the guy who led their house for one year i guess just throw away and forget the lives and sacrifice greatjohn umber and all their people gave to the starks cause for generations just because his son was a dipshit greatjohn umber was robb starks most loyal and most fierce supporter him and many of their people died for the starks who will there to be left over to rule over if you banish all your subjects in the book series greatjohn umber i still alive and held prisoner we have good reason to believe that the umbers are helping lead a stark revolution so i take issue if i see someone saying that they need to wiped outpunished
gameofthrones,removed,if you mean then s test text will edit
gameofthrones,removed,exactly like cut scenes
gameofthrones,removed,he said why do i have a boner right now jk
gameofthrones,removed,loved ending of the ends of time episode i think they cant topple it
gameofthrones,removed,much of its history mirrors the history of china and the romance of the three kingdoms just as much of game of thrones mirrors the war of the roses in england from what it sounds like yi ti is actually the oldest civilization in the known world even older and richer than valyria and they have multiple races including a race of tall beautiful elflike people known as the lengi
gameofthrones,removed,update this post is now featured in several online articles whoo thanks guys
gameofthrones,removed,it was also in beddington they are everywhere
gameofthrones,removed,yeah agreed jon is targaryan since apparently bran just keeps reliving his life again and again im assuming that a new bran will be able to get one up bran the boner theyll call him
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think you know what red hair is myranda didnt have red hair nor did jaqen lysa and catelyns hair had hints of red hair bit i wouldnt necessarily call them red heads also characters arent killed because of the colour of their hair
gameofthrones,removed,sadly it will be banned in region
gameofthrones,removed,if you think guys with paralysis cant get an erection then youve never met a guy with paralysis
gameofthrones,removed,certainly that can be seen by his refusal to assassinate dany or his great displeasure with the murder of the targaryen babies which robert was ok with um this is actually an example of ned stark holding to code of honor neither proposition is an honorable thing to do nor are they moral but this is a quite poor example i think since in this case the honorable and moral thing to do are both the same a better example i think would be jaimes regicide of the mad king killing the mad king was a moral thing to do its the just thing to do in fact ned stark walked into the red keep to bring the king to this very fate when he found that he had his work cut out by jaime lannister what did he do judge jaime for breaking his oath and propose that he be sent to the wall as punishment never mind that the dude had just saved the entirety of kings landing from being blown to bits avenged neds father and brother and more or less acted as his executioner for something hes gonna do anyway his main concern at the time was not that the despicable king was murdered but that a kingsguard broke his oath and the law theres also that time when he caught a black brother south of the wall fleeing from the white walkers despite the fact that this guy is a valuable witness of a looming threat to the whole westeros the honor code demands that a deserters head is to be chopped off and so he chopped off the deserters head white walkers be damned was that a moral thing to do fuck no poor headless bastard rip these two are examples of ned starks honor which garnered him respect and admiration from everyone that knows him when it comes to honor theres just no bullshitting this guy even if youre king hed rather see the world burns before betraying his honor except when it comes to love ned stark would break his honor for love which seems like a running thing with the starks theres more exploration of honor code throughout the series jaime carries a stigma of a despicable and untrustworthy man because of that one act in desperation brienne bound herself by honor to catelyn stark even after the latters demise she had no moral obligation to serve sansa but she did it anyway because shes honorable like that et cetera et cetera i am disappointed with this version of ned which feels more like stannis in my head youre right to be ned stark was an honorable fool retard not sure id agree with saying hes similar to stannis though stannis stabbed his brother in the back ned stark wouldve never done that ned stark is the kind of man who would fight battles strictly in the field with no shady assassination sabotage or whatever following geneva code to the letter his kind had no place in the backstabhappy land of westeros and thats why hes dead his son was honorable like he was except for that one time when he broke his oath for oh love so hes dead too i love the starks really they are the heroes of the series ned and robb are some of my favorite characters but they all had it coming
gameofthrones,removed,in the books its varus who orders the little birds to kill pycelle
gameofthrones,removed,besides being a nod to the books its how pycelle actually dies though qyburn isnt behind it varys is i think it also makes sense to kill him before he got to the trial because he knew about the wildfire having served under aerys and could have guessed what cercei was up to when she didnt show up encouraging an evacuation of the sept
gameofthrones,removed,in the books ned said bran would never lay w a womensex is ned a qualified medical consultant if he can piss he can get a boner or artificially inseminate a wife
gameofthrones,removed,im really having a moment trying to imagine what you all would assume creampie porn means
gameofthrones,removed,valid criticism no it isnt its just a criticism and an empty one at that nor is it poor writing there are no rules for the progression of time the audience is asked to be intelligent enough to figure it out on their own something many of you seem incapable of
gameofthrones,removed,no time travel no got simple as that
gameofthrones,removed,we watch teaser over and over again while sweating in our palms
gameofthrones,removed,man that easily couldve just been a random selection of gifs and quotes
gameofthrones,removed,yeah if you look at her new chapter released in twow she seems on the path to a meddler like lf someone who does everything for their motives no matter the harm
gameofthrones,removed,so which one is left also wtf is up with all the s i see people using in daenerys learn to spell ffs
gameofthrones,removed,speaking of spin offs are there any got porn parady available you know for science
gameofthrones,removed,i couldve used one more nude scene before axing her heck i wouldnt have mind her being nude while getting axed
gameofthrones,removed,well im not denying the lack of quality but its defiantly not for that reason almost all of season was straight of the comic and the leaks pretty much confirm season follows it too
gameofthrones,removed,why do they all have porn star names
gameofthrones,removed,thats true and robb never had the time to have any sort of throne built because he was busy fighting a war and then he was murdered
gameofthrones,removed,if she survived stab wounds with soup and a good nights sleep her head can take a light tap
gameofthrones,removed,season seven episode one cold open shot opens to rainy fields and an imposing castle on the edge of a great cliff overlooking stormy seas inside the castle walls lords are gathered in the great hall you can see the shields and banners of estermont and swann selmy and penrose tarth and connington and above all else the great golden banners of baratheon draping every wall as the lords mutter and mumble amongst themselves a tall rugged man with red hair in white and crimson armor walks into the room my lords they quieten ive gathered you all here to storms end to discuss a matter many of us find troubling in these very troubling times king robert baratheon died years ago now many of you supported his brothers renly and stannis many of you supported his sons joffrey and tommen regardless of whether they were rightful kings or true kings you were men of the stormlands and you supported kings of house baratheon who sits the iron throne now a lord spits aye you all know her the lannister bitch queen cersei the woman who had king robert killed i say shes no queen of ours the lords shout in agreement aye luckily for us weve an alternative a year or so ago my men at griffins roost came upon a young lad escaped from dragonstone the bastard son of king robert the last surviving member of his house gendry dressed head to toe in fine baratheon garments steps into the room to seven hells with the lannisters this young man may have once been lowborn but for the rest of his days may he live and rule as our king the naturalised gendry of house baratheon first of his name all the lords stand up at once and jon connington places roberts crown upon gendrys head long may he reign the lords shout long may he reign from ─ starts playing game of thrones opening credits bumbumbumbumbumbum
gameofthrones,removed,i just see the complete opposite and im allowed to express my point of view like everyone else the dany haters will forever continue to baffle me bashing a year old girl with literally no upbringing who has worked her way up on her own terms and whi has inspired countless loyal followers hating her because of one mistake killing that slave boy although i can see why she did it is kind of harsh you cant hold it against her that she trusted people and wanted to be good to them its not her fault that they betrayed her but i guess these dany haters are those kind of people who would also say it is the childs fault for being robbed molested etc so im not really surprised just tired of the unnecessary hate and bashing of a fierce young leader
gameofthrones,removed,looks like a ripoff porn parody
gameofthrones,removed,game of thrones porn edition
gameofthrones,removed,i think when tommen fell from the window
gameofthrones,removed,why jail
gameofthrones,removed,that doesnt matter jon didnt want to be kon comment didnt want to be king i dont think doran really wanted to either
gameofthrones,removed,thanks theworld
gameofthrones,removed,i mean the wax seal looks like a wooden dildo
gameofthrones,removed,plot armour is that the new pc word for fat
gameofthrones,removed,ah ok so whoever might read this limited to season stop reading here i dont know how to put a spoiler tag in my text im not sure if the show also mentions it but in the books it is known that they speak some kind of language but nobody in the north understands it they have a deal with craster he donates his sons so the ww leave him unharmed they can ride horses use weapons light armor and even have ornaments like ribbons decorating their weapons these are signs of culture and culture is a sign of human intelligence we know that in the past they somehow had agreed upon some kind of pact between them and the living there is another visual hint which does not appear in the books the spiral pattern they leave behind in the beginning this pattern is repeated later elsewhere and visually connects several specific elementsstory arcs
gameofthrones,removed,ice dragon
gameofthrones,removed,but he only needs goodmen
gameofthrones,removed,i dont know why but i read this with the tune of shame shame shame from the walk of shame parody from family guy anyone else get that vibe
gameofthrones,removed,aprox hour ago it was released as a torrent someone told me
gameofthrones,removed,here is the episode
gameofthrones,removed,syrio is not there
gameofthrones,removed,clears throat
gameofthrones,removed,just watched it and a bit disappointed especially with blackfishes death no fight scene and just a stupid unnecessary death
gameofthrones,removed,can you please pm me
gameofthrones,removed,why is this showing up as minutes ago does the episode not air until anywhere why have i already seen the whole episode
gameofthrones,removed,oh man that pod and bronn reunion was perfect
gameofthrones,removed,yea at least we can escape all those people being pointlessly slaughtered in order to watch this show aboutwait a minute
gameofthrones,removed,yes i have already finished the episode be wary of spoilers
gameofthrones,removed,arya kills the wife and leaves bravos as arya stark jamie takes the casstle and the black fish dies zombie mountain kills just dude the hound joins the brotherhood
gameofthrones,removed,i hope they just kill sandor to end this constant hype and cleganebowl talk its so annoying and spamming
gameofthrones,removed,prediction arya is jaqen he will lead the waif to the real arya in the cave where she kills him as arya and his last words will be he is syrio forel
gameofthrones,removed,place your bets folks floppy penis or perky titties
gameofthrones,removed,so i still dont understand what happened to arya she killed the waif but why did she walked without the needle in the first place those theories that arya was actually jaque is now proven false but why give so many hints also in the last scene we can see the blue shirt guy which is supposed to be olyvar again so why didnt he do anything we see him following arya in but now he just casually walks by when she fells from metres ans is chased by the waif also do you thing that cleagane will join the brotherhood without banners
gameofthrones,removed,its only gay if they cum
gameofthrones,removed,i hate cersei but that gave me a massive erection because i hate the high sparrow more
gameofthrones,removed,fuck her right in the pussy
gameofthrones,removed,bronn got wise words about everybody banging and im just over here wanting to bang bronn
gameofthrones,removed,the faith and the crown are the two pillars that hold us together tommen the republicam
gameofthrones,removed,cleganebowl fucking unconfirmed lose hype
gameofthrones,removed,my hype boner just went flaccid
gameofthrones,removed,too much catelyn stark reference im calling it lady stoneheart confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,jesus fucking christ if they mention cat one more time and she doesnt return im gunna find dd and kill them
gameofthrones,removed,jesus all this catelyn talk is edging the shit out of my lsh hypeboner
gameofthrones,removed,catyln stark hit me with a rock lady stoneheart confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,was an extra for this fight prepare for them white fishes
gameofthrones,removed,holy shit it looks like that prediction was right fuck
gameofthrones,removed,b oh shit so varys might actually be the one to kill kevan and pycelle
gameofthrones,removed,i felt a great disturbance in the show as if millions of voices crying stoneheart suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced
gameofthrones,removed,i thought a certain body was going to float on by when he was pissing
gameofthrones,removed,cleganebowl dead the manderlys mia lady stoneheart not happening
gameofthrones,removed,that ending wouldve had me jump in excitement if they ended it at the candle slice and the sounds of sword fight
gameofthrones,removed,check the edit
gameofthrones,removed,no its not
gameofthrones,removed,rip cleganebowl rip blackfish rip lady stoneheart
gameofthrones,removed,i almost cried im so gay
gameofthrones,removed,no your islamic traditions are saved
gameofthrones,removed,jons plot armor is off the charts no way they kill him and resurrect him just to have home die again plus the whole rlj
gameofthrones,removed,then maybe they should cut it with the cat references
gameofthrones,removed,are you guys joking we have episodes left and a whole lot of nothing has been progressed thus far
gameofthrones,removed,if it does happen i have a horrible feeling it will cliff hang like in the books with pod and brienne swinging from the end of a rope
gameofthrones,removed,if they are seriously only just about to find that body its going to look a bit worse for wear compared to even the books in which i think week or so had passed and the effects had already taken a heavy toll on the appearance might was well use a skeleton now maybe a bit of flesh that the odd fish never quite managed to chew off
gameofthrones,removed,i ultimately agree i think that if there ever was to be a lsh reveal the season finale would be the place to do it they dropped her name so many times and a few last week too the riverrun plot seems to be over but with the hound walking around with the bwb maybe its just weird because at this point youd think her body would be gone especially if it was at the bottom of a lake
gameofthrones,removed,wait and watch come back to this comment in a week hahaha
gameofthrones,removed,this episode had not one but two offscreen deaths that along with the whole no trial by combat thing i havent felt this blue balled since the walking dead finale
gameofthrones,removed,his skin thats like the color of a kids skin who still hasnt ever gotten a boner yet is so annoying like that pinkish reddish embarrassed white kid color hes such a lil bitch
gameofthrones,removed,it was stupid get over your obsession with this show and admit it
gameofthrones,removed,her body has to be decomposed to fuck
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,what if lsh is already back and they arent saying anything yet
gameofthrones,removed,i need to spray my hype cum this looks like itll do
gameofthrones,removed,jaime this episode the things we do for love aka i really admire how catlyn reacted to me throwing her son out of a tower
gameofthrones,removed,still theres no reason for him to love her except for firm tits and a tight fit
gameofthrones,removed,haha rasoiafcirclejerk is leaking
gameofthrones,removed,plus him stealing the boots hes a not changed man but not completely he has no problem killing people hes just more particular about it now
gameofthrones,removed,honestly welcome to reddit as it was originally inteded that is the actual purpose of voting system also if you mind it you are encouraged to read through a different forum devoted to got
gameofthrones,removed,to imply that saying something with a drawing isnt as relevant as saying it with words flies in the face of all art ever done enjoy your message board you fascist
gameofthrones,removed,in the books feast for crows exactly that happenshe gets away and jaime declares him an outlaw
gameofthrones,removed,lady stone heart
gameofthrones,removed,your edit you dont have to like how it was executed but the storyline objectively moved forward the siege was ended the blackfish is dead jaime came into his own as a commander and it likely foreshadowed events to come with cersei all of those things demonstrably move the plot forward you asked what the point was and that was the point id be the first to tell you that i didnt particularly enjoy any of it either but im not going to insist that nothing happened
gameofthrones,removed,had a boner
gameofthrones,removed,point proven
gameofthrones,removed,your mom is a cum terminator
gameofthrones,removed,uhm yes for literally years the evidence for clegane bowl is strongly relient on the trial by combat and is pretty much what the fan theory was built on that the faiths champion would be sandor due to him being the gravedigger books whereas in the show he was shown to be living with a relgious group and is friends with brother ray though not anymorehence the antihype and the mountain would be cerseis champion because hes the mountain clegane bowl evidence has pretty much exclusivly been built on the trial by combat theory it doesnt mean it wont still happen and there wont still be a bowl but i assure you they are almost universaly considered to be the same thing
gameofthrones,removed,but its been years since the red wedding so catelyns corpse would have turned to bones by now even if they found it in the river
gameofthrones,removed,i miss the days when filler in got was ass and titties now its just shitty comedy
gameofthrones,removed,in the book there are quite a few other faceless men other than the kindly man there is also servants and the such
gameofthrones,removed,what the others already said furthermore sansa potentially controls littlefinger with her bad poosiee he wants power but he also wants her
gameofthrones,removed,yup if youre into beastality and gay porn
gameofthrones,removed,is blackfish really dead he was right about the ruse and his own men were sent to arrest him no acknowledgement of any death there not even a noise jamie is a cunt still the hound is still going to fight the mountain its had a huge build up since season one dany sucks and i want tyrion to leave that plot seriously this episode wasnt that bad this season has been fan serviced to the max all of the theories have come way to easily obviously loops will be thrown in im also feeling the rlj theory is coming too easily as well probably going to get a surprise at the tower of joy i do think that theory is correct though
gameofthrones,removed,one boner door closes another boner door opens
gameofthrones,removed,what what this world needs is more stormborn titties
gameofthrones,removed,i lost my boner too
gameofthrones,removed,well ive given up on lady stoneheart she wasnt with the brotherhood i dont think shes making any appearances 😞 this episode was all hype and no substance
gameofthrones,removed,you all are complaining about the speed in which a characters wounds healed on a show that has fire breathing dragons think about how much mental energy you are wasting on that nerds all of you bad ones at that
gameofthrones,removed,catelyn has been dead for three years it would be really silly to bring her back now just have beric do whatever she does in the books
gameofthrones,removed,you sound like youre about crying for your tendies
gameofthrones,removed,oh please this sub loves arya and sansa and brienne the reason the dany story and therefore dany is annoying is that its unchanged since season two shes full of confidence meets bump in road didnt lose confidence magically saves at the last moment
gameofthrones,removed,we thought beric was gone dropped entirely but here he is how theyre going to pull off making him a character that fights the king of winter i have no idea considering hes dead by this point in the books
gameofthrones,removed,dude you should stop watching the show and just go watch reruns of the bachelor
gameofthrones,removed,cersei is gonna allahu ackbar the fuck out of kings landing
gameofthrones,removed,youre being a negative nancy this was a good episode again you people have to stop chasing the magic fucking dragon the shit that people are expecting from these episodes is getting more and more outlandish can you motherfuckers take a long breath and imagine an episode were everything that people on reddit wanted to happen happened it would be revealed that the waif was actually arya who stabbed an innocent person with aryas face and you complain about bad writing sounds like my fucking year old nephew would make that shit up clegane wouldve teleported to kins landing by episode to fight against the undead mountain and eat some chicken jaime wouldve stormed riverrun and killed the blackfish etc etc this was a good episode see below stop bitching you remind me of my year old nephew crying because he didnt get the legos he wanted but he got a lego city cleganebowl was never going to happen this season and all you hype fuckers knew it at least you got a good meme out of it and its still not canceled because that shit was fucking confirmed not this season but maybe next season the mountain rips a dudes head off bucket list check siege of river run ended by edmure im guessing you havent read the books if you were disappointed by this mereen is under siege tyrion was wrong now we get dragon action varys goes back to westeros felt like a varys send off for little birds bowl vs littlefinger cersei is betrayed by tommen she going to kill him somebody is thats for sure and for you all of you english majors wannabes here on reddit im sorry to tell you this but you dont know a fucking thing about writing neither do i but i admit it you want bad writing watch a fucking porno movie or a straight to dvd horror movie the same guy who wrote all the other awesome shit that happened this season wrote this episode which was good not the best but good but of course theres a million idiots on here saying that they couldve done it better
gameofthrones,removed,not to get dark but as an orlando local watching a religious zealot get his head pulled off felt kind of good
gameofthrones,removed,that would be the tits if that happened for one it would show him honoring his word to catlyen stark sorry if i misspelt and it would potentially end the feuding of the great houses
gameofthrones,removed,and everyone bows before a naked jon and he turns his back we get to see his pretty butt
gameofthrones,removed,i think the worst part was having sandor come back at all instead of just doing the gravedigger bit from the books what made his character is that he didnt give a flying fuck grrm knew this and put him to rest once his story reached a point where the reader can see that even this complete asshole who is capable of murdering a child still has some good left in him his entire scene was so forced it was painful to watch
gameofthrones,removed,then stop watching cunt
gameofthrones,removed,after seeing the brotherhood without banners does that mean there will not be a lady stoneheart
gameofthrones,removed,then jaime and brienne finally get to bang
gameofthrones,removed,i like how its almost impossible to read represents how much i wanna suck dem titties
gameofthrones,removed,its been hours since i watched this and my boner still hasnt subsided what should i do
gameofthrones,removed,he let tyrion who wasnt that great of a hand honestly fuck up daeneryss plan to get to westeros because he supports young griff he gets the fuck out of dodge as tyrion has given religious fanatics rise in the city and invited an attack on the city from the masters young griff will be introduced at the end of the finale while kings landing burns
gameofthrones,removed,guys give tommen a break imagine being like or whatever the fuck he is getting laid by natalie dormer a few times then getting completely blue balled for months at a time he didnt go through that years of awkward boners jerking off in the bathroom because a girl smelled nice trying to figure out what kind of underwear a girl was wearing or waiting patiently for the si swimsuit edition shit man he probably never even jerked off before he started pumping her full of the royal seed and now nothing no action whatsoever thats some real cold turkey shit man and he has no idea whats going on but grandpa there is gonna wingman for him and let him furiously hump her for seconds before disappointing everyone within ear shot of the red keep
gameofthrones,removed,off to kill kevan hopefully
gameofthrones,removed,i bet tormund popped a giantslaying boner when jamie and brienne started talking dirty about honor
gameofthrones,removed,seriously do people not appreciate the story and character development maybe lot of people are just watching for the boobs and swords i really resent this idea that if i didnt like the episode im not a real fan or i dont care about storycharacter development id be willing to wager that the book readers are more unhappy than anyone do you think i read pages for some descriptions of boobs and blood people arent pissed at a general lack of battles they are pissed about important characters being killed off screen and story lines just plain falling flat either arya learned a lot from the fm and the issues with her getting stabbed are down to bad writing or she didnt learn nearly as much as expected and the entire plot line lacked any meaningful character development either way it isnt a very satisfying resolution to the character arch
gameofthrones,removed,arya gets sliced stabbed times swims through shit is in a drugged stupor manages to awaken and jump out a building onto stone runs like a olympic athlete jumps and falls onto stone steps and rolls down bleeding with a injured hand waif walks like the terminator arya still wins and is magically not injured she threatens a man who can change faces and disappear and do crazy shit what the fuck why is game of thrones now like every other show
gameofthrones,removed,jamie gets an army and gets booted out of kings landing long enough for cersei to go full cersei
gameofthrones,removed,i has to be something to move jaimes story didnt really even do that though hes still the same guy from the first episode in fact he even reuses his line the things we do for love in reference to cersei from episode hes still just a guy who would do anything or kill anyone to bang his sister shame considering his character when he goes to the riverlands in the books
gameofthrones,removed,i say that mostly because arya is one of my favorites and it seems her entire plotline was lead up to that fight dont get me wrong the season has been full of hype but i dont like when they get lazy with some story telling to ensure that episode bang
gameofthrones,removed,because im not paying for it and its kind of fun watching a bastardized offshoot from the book
gameofthrones,removed,my boner cannot be contained
gameofthrones,removed,ice dildo ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gameofthrones,removed,wholeheartedly agree for how rich and complex the material is got fans are the worst at coming up with theories theyre so dumb theyre not even fun
gameofthrones,removed,ive agreed with that sentiment wholeheartedly until tonight huge fan of the books show but i cant defend this episode i only hope they can get it back on the rails and finish the season with a bang
gameofthrones,removed,it was a bit more of a fight in the books
gameofthrones,removed,maggie the frogs prophecy about all her children dying and that gold would be their crowns and shrouds and that only after her tears dried then the valonquar will wrap hisher hands around her neck and choke the life out of her
gameofthrones,removed,the books completly finished with sandors storyline its over and it had a good ending sandor became the gravedigger and can finally live in peace
gameofthrones,removed,haha i did like that bit how did you feel about all the season references in the script the fuck you doing here id prefer chicken shit like that
gameofthrones,removed,the writing made sense to me at least that makes you one of the people that whoever wrote the braavos scenes were catering to
gameofthrones,removed,why the fuck is everybody pretending people are dissapointed with the direction of the story line we are dissapointed with the shoddy writing not with the conclusion arya hides in the darkness with sword drawn looking scared like a pup completely different behaviour survives lethal inch stabwound to the abdomen and parkours through a city with on pursuit with a reopened wound there are a thousand ways of handling the end of this arc with the same conclusion of arya never becoming no one
gameofthrones,removed,bitch ass downvoters i literally watched the clip before typing that post to make sure i was right
gameofthrones,removed,you know this subreddit gives the show a lotttt of shit for stuff like bad pussy i didnt think it was that bad i thought a dumb bitch like her would say some nasty slut stuff to a rude hard guy like bron but this episodescene arya surviving how she did and the chase afterwards which she absolutely should not have been capable of and her being considered as no one by jaqen after she did nothing that would otherwise befit her of being no one since she still had all the suspicions she had before of not being no one on top of that it just had that really corny feel to it due to the a girl is no one no a girl is someone hmph holy shit the entire thing was so bad i never didnt enjoy watching this show until that scene
gameofthrones,removed,yeah but confirmed by whom that crippled stark boy who claims to have seen it in a vision a tree gave him oh and of course the old howland reed will also confirm it but hes known to be a stark loyalist that swamp dweller cant be trusted jokes aside im really curious how they are going to proof rlj to anybody that doesnt want to believe it i think it will not be used as a way to leverage political power but more as a personal revelation and closely kept secret that will allow jon to do something at the grand finale that he couldnt do without knowing his true parentage what exactly that will be i have no clue
gameofthrones,removed,im not even reading the rest of your post youre even worse you kiss your mother with that mouth
gameofthrones,removed,okay im doing that and all im seeing is cersei naked okay and now shes kissing that actress girl ok i think im way offbook now but im enjoying the show a lot
gameofthrones,removed,if true im gonna miss dem titties
gameofthrones,removed,i just had an erection
gameofthrones,removed,httpimgurcomrshit
gameofthrones,removed,they shouldnt have taught aarya to fight blind if she hadnt cut that candle out it would have been her face in the hobaw

gameofthrones,removed,in all fairness its a fictional character and i really dont like cerci
gameofthrones,removed,im lmaoing at your life when you use a rating system that puts game of thrones at and big bang theory at as a good indicator that the show is good the writing is worse just because they have more badass stuff for plebs to enjoy doesnt make it better
gameofthrones,removed,foreshadowing i hope we finally meet lady stoneheart with the hound in her service
gameofthrones,removed,i have the strangest boner right now
gameofthrones,removed,yeah and il torrent it again deal with it nerd
gameofthrones,removed,raeghar ermygawd spelling lyanna jon snow thats not neds baby he brought back but lyannas that hes protecting from crazy robert baratheon whos on a targ killing frenzy especially from lyanna love of his life
gameofthrones,removed,pretty sure was when i started having spontaneous raging boners so maybe not
gameofthrones,removed,how about last nights episode d
gameofthrones,removed,its a fucking fantasy show and youre arguing realism ship me some of the paint you huff
gameofthrones,removed,when youre so salty about realism in a fantasy show that you write an essay to prove how you are the greatest show writer in the world why arent you writing for dd
gameofthrones,removed,with a long knife were we watching the same show or is the heroin you shoot before the show cause your judgement to be that messed up i literally have sewing needles longer than the knife the waif used to stab arya now i at least know youre trolling
gameofthrones,removed,plus she was cute
gameofthrones,removed,fantasy is a genre of fiction that uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element theme or setting many works within the genre take place in imaginary worlds where magic and magical creatures are common
gameofthrones,removed,i read your low effort posts i down vote i simple man
gameofthrones,removed,or this is a fantasy show and you sound like a clown
gameofthrones,removed,a man has an erection
gameofthrones,removed,at least he didnt suck at dying
gameofthrones,removed,yeah ill agree with you there but still its hard to tell exactly how long arya really was in the bed or to the extent of how quickly and how much benefit milk of the poppy gives after consuming it you cant just assume because it all happened in the same episode that the time lapse from one scene to another was only a day
gameofthrones,removed,just for the record the creators dont cant shouldnt and wont give a fuck about theories and if it means bursting fan bubbles its even better thats the purpose of this show ned will gain support in kl fuck you off with his head robb will win with the lannisters fuck you jaime sends his regards oberyn will kill the mountain fuck you splat thats what got does and being mad at dd because what they did does not match your ideas about what they should have done then its just flat out stupid also what the hell were they supposed to do get out of their castle and get slaughtered trying to save edmure ed is the head of the house period they listen to him but they couldnt get or obey him before he came back
gameofthrones,removed,hey her seductiontorture netted me a boner so i aint complaining
gameofthrones,removed,not a book reader myself couldnt tell ya i would assume their world is also spherical but maybe not
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think the concern is whether arya can get an erection
gameofthrones,removed,actors said it wasnt rape and it didnt play like a full rape in the show as well i choose to believe what the writer meant to happen
gameofthrones,removed,im pretty sure little finger will want some payback to what ramsay put sansa through and making him look like a douchebag to her
gameofthrones,removed,it stands for lady stone heart i wouldnt google it unless you dont mind spoilers
gameofthrones,removed,grey worm totally would have popped a boner if he could when missandei was laughing
gameofthrones,removed,youre so dumb i never said or implied that i am master of the universe i am entitled to my opinion just like youre entitled to being a human tampon k k
gameofthrones,removed,certain leaks regarding the whole season so far almost everything it said came to pass and there are a lot more information on how things will happen in the last two episodes as well and hence i was wondering do we really already know how things will end this season
gameofthrones,removed,pretty sure he is going to bang greyworms woman
gameofthrones,removed,then continue to have a fantasy television show get you so flustered that you resort to typing essay rants on a sub reddit do you you highly intellectual individual btw you didnt offend me at all you just sound like a huge pussy tbh
gameofthrones,removed,this actually gave me a boner
gameofthrones,removed,except youd look like a retard because the waif has been serving the facelesmen for over years while arya just got in doubt shes an apprentice
gameofthrones,removed,i think theres too much its fine to have some trailing plotlines secondary arcs etc but imo theyve got too much to work with they know the end game but need to have all of this filler to keep the show going theres too many characters to keep up with it seems just when i start to enjoy some political banter at kings landing we cut to somethingsomeone i can give two shits about greyworm fuck that guy hes boring that city is boring tyrion is being undermisused imo just when the fuck is dany going to conquer the world with her dragons not anytime soon thats when apparently dragons are useless without a bunch of rickety old ships to back them up everything of actual interest to me at least is just teased or briefly glossed over in order to fulfill every checkmark each episode im tired of all the bouncing around between different characters without any payoff minus a few climaxes im getting bored at some point all of this has to come together i suppose what im saying is its maybe time that winter finally arrives it may be time for all of these pivotal central characters to somehow find their way to wherever the fuck theyve been going all of this time maybe its time to start wrapping things up big things theres too much to work with and the pacingtime allotment is boring me to death in the way they are presenting things
gameofthrones,removed,everyones made cuz theories didnt come true for the last fucking time no one is mad because our theories didnt come true the theories only came about because of the shit writing that lead up to we all developed theories because what actually happened made absolutely sense to anyone they dont get points for being unpredictable because being unpredictable and making no sense is fucking easy for instance arya doesnt die from her stab wound because she saved a secret potion that she stole from the hobw that heals her and she takes it the waif trips and dies trying to follow her out a window of stories look at that i wrote an equivalent unpredictable scenario it makes no sense breaks the coherent storyline is anticlimactic and generally weakly thought out but lets give it points because you didnt figure it out people are mad because the culmination of seasons of aryas story boils down to i sure can be a fucking idiot but the only thing thicker than my head once im being hunted is the plot armor on my stomach everyone feels cheated we needed a catharsis from this ride we were on and instead we got a boot on the ass and a move on to westeros now
gameofthrones,removed,this is a fantasy show you clown
gameofthrones,removed,just as jon is about to lose his boner bad poosi out of nowhere
gameofthrones,removed,right right completely fallacious im done humoring you and im content with the fact that this asinine argument started from a rebuttal of yours that turned out to be completely refuted by the existence of a line that id missed gonna go ahead and block further drivel adios
gameofthrones,removed,i laughed harder than i should have take my upvote
gameofthrones,removed,well apparently not am i wrong the tears of all you whiners arent gonna change the episode
gameofthrones,removed,yeah also what if cersei is actually doc brown from back to the future and she gets in her delorean and goes back in time and changes everything
gameofthrones,removed,but they gotta bang first d
gameofthrones,removed,did you pull that number from some guys arse who you coincidentally tried to make out with
gameofthrones,removed,damn sansa is a cold hearted bitch but i would still fuck her
gameofthrones,removed,or better depending on your taste in porn
gameofthrones,removed,i get your point i guess my thinking is that while i dont like seeing the repetitive posts or the same meme over and over i very rarely down vote anything unless i feel it absolutely deserves it for instance someone the other day posted some thing like davos liked little girls based on his relationship with shireen and his influence over lyanna mormont that deserved downvoting i dont really look at the comic con pictures or the artwork but i dont try to make it so others cant it seems as if some people do though
gameofthrones,removed,i cant believe this got upvoted its so stupid it borders on parody
gameofthrones,removed,i would be pissed because its so blatantly set up to be true in the books
gameofthrones,removed,hes in next weeks promo im fairly certain hes had lulls in his screentime like this before and i personally welcome them not every character needs to be in every ep and its good to take a breather now and then
gameofthrones,removed,plz no lady stoneheart barely even a good idea in the books would definitely not work in the show
gameofthrones,removed,except its very well established that he did indeed love cat and i genuinely dont think he knew about ramsay this sub doesnt really understand littlefingers character at all though people just think hes a master schemer and thats it
gameofthrones,removed,i dont know if alex jones has a web forum for his show or not but if he does i guarantee they cant shit out stupid unfounded theories at the rate that this sub can
gameofthrones,removed,fair enough but he didnt have shit to say when tyrion told bronn to kill him if he speaks again and nobody knew bronn at that time also they were in the kingsguards house the red keep trant had his fucking armor and big sword and bronn was wearing just that leather jerkin thing any man worth his title wouldnt stand for that trants a poosey not even a bad one
gameofthrones,removed,its not alex jones level but its still very baseless and more or less relies on a poor understanding of both the books and the show and how the two relate jon has never tried to claim himself a stark its not fitting with his character that he would give sansa any trouble were she declare herself queen of the north and lady of winterfell nor would sansa have any reason to betray one of her very last surviving relatives its just an exceptionally stupid theory and fleshing it out doesnt make it any better than were it a single sentence and im only being harsh because this sub is filled with horrible posts about incredibly dumb theories
gameofthrones,removed,hey man summer going out like that saved the show a lot of money
gameofthrones,removed,ugh this sub has gotten so painful to read yes it was just a budget thing no the observations you made while rewatching are in no way meaningful obviously there are threads like this that arent shit but this one very much is
gameofthrones,removed,or in the case of porn a big black fish
gameofthrones,removed,my prediction for arya is that it was jagen we saw get stabbed he walks into arya he dies and basically tells her to be true to herself but in nonlame got way then the waif discovers arya and we get the showdown we were hoping for arya kills waif takes boat arranged by jagen home to westeros we likely dont see arya in ep or and if we do it will be her either getting on or getting off the boat im pretty sure this is what will happen and i would very much like to be right
gameofthrones,removed,my guess is well get a scene of dorne and its leadersarmies rallyingpreparing to go to war with the intention of taking kings landing possibly striking up an alliance with house tyrell since they were aligned in roberts war
gameofthrones,removed,why should i its a dumb question its important to point out that its a dumb question so people think before asking any more stupid questions imo dude more or less asked why didnt they use this expensive set in the first season as much as now lol
gameofthrones,removed,i think youre pretty stupid for thinking that jaime is going to go and massacre a house loyal to his family all for the sake of helping the blackfish make it north like thats really really really dumb
gameofthrones,removed,get hype
gameofthrones,removed,any other obvious observations this is getting reidiculos maybe tell us about some interesting parallels bewteen random scenes from unrelated seasons
gameofthrones,removed,it is well known that turtle pee helps the wall stay cool and strong they let the turtle walk in packs on top the wall peeing to fortify and let it wee p
gameofthrones,removed,i think they needed to change actors
gameofthrones,removed,when jon finds out his parentage i think it would be really cool if he took the blue winter rose as his sigil marking his birth right wait if rlj is true why would his sigil be a rose wouldnt it be the dragons
gameofthrones,removed,im helping weed out the stupid people
gameofthrones,removed,spoilers from adwd varys appears in the epilouge and kills pycel and kevan seemingly after having hid in the red keep since tywins deathtyrions escape
gameofthrones,removed,badge of honour or i just needed a number for my generic username to get accepted maybe thats akin to me writing off your opinion because i think your name is seriously spelled sssteven
gameofthrones,removed,it just stuns me how so many people put so much thought into coming up with theories but cant even follow the god damn show lol
gameofthrones,removed,agreed hes an interesting character because hes got shades of grey and his scheming is interesting because while he is a great schemer hes not that powerful in the grand scheme of things i think he just didnt know about ramsey i think his apology was sincere and i think this mistake will prove a defining moment for his character
gameofthrones,removed,you can argue i was a dick but i dont see how pointing out how stupid this question was makes me stupid
gameofthrones,removed,listen i love where you are going here its giving me a hype boner but i cant take that all that depression and crushing of my hope feeling when rickon dies
gameofthrones,removed,a trial of combat is being setup the mountain is named to one side the other side is a mystery then the person who hates the mountain more than anyone and one of the few who could stand up to himtake on the fight the hound shows up back from the dead why it just kinda fits i hope its true
gameofthrones,removed,hes not explicitly good or evil in the show but it is established that a he loved cat and b he did not know about ramsay
gameofthrones,removed,well he fucking told lyssa he loved cat right before he pushed lyssa out the moon door not really sure what else you could ask for at this point denying that lf loved her is just stupid since its well established in the books and as well established as one could hope for in the show
gameofthrones,removed,so basically youd just rather not admit to being wrong about this cool
gameofthrones,removed,most theories say varys was planning for a targareyan return far before danaerys got hold of her three dragons if he was in fact one of the people arya was spying on he was planning on a targareyan return even before her marriage to khal drogo and possibly for viserys its goes far beyond dany and her dragons i can understand for the greater kingdom reasoning as he constantly seems to profess that but the kingdoms were relatively stable before he and the rest of the small council decided to drive it towards chaos
gameofthrones,removed,what am i right about your hes a sociopath idea is completely disproven by the fact that he loved cat
gameofthrones,removed,just admit you were wrong lol its not that big of a deal i dont know why youre so desperate to argue this his backstory is that he loved cat both in the show and in the books you suggesting that in the show hes only lying about loving her is sooooo ridiculous
gameofthrones,removed,im wondering if were even going to see in the show seems like the show needs a more expedient way to set sam up and i doubt shell make it back to the north this season its possible but it doesnt make much sense at all imo i think next season shell reunite with jon and sansa and likely bran too who i think will likely meet back up with jon and sansa before arya does and possibly in ep
gameofthrones,removed,yeah of course i didnt convince you youre a stubborn idiot lol like i guarantee if the show were to conclusively prove lf has feelings youd either a stick to this theory and say hes playing the long con or b pretend you still had good reason to believe otherwise and were therefore not wrong but alas you are very wrong and will only be proven more wrong as the season ends
gameofthrones,removed,she wont be in the show and she shouldnt be in the show and honestly she shouldnt have been in the books either
gameofthrones,removed,the scenes with her in the books were very cool but ultimately her being a character at all is stupid literally just floats down a river for days beric thinks it would be a good idea to resurrect her and gives her his life cus whatever then she takes over the brotherhood without banners becauseno seriously why the fuck do they have her as the leader shes entirely self serving and offers absolutely nothing in the way of leadership or fighting ability
gameofthrones,removed,the reach and dorne and stromcrowlands
gameofthrones,removed,why does this dude have cum on his face in the first frame
gameofthrones,removed,hot blonde milf fucks her not twin brother im sorry i browse porn sites way too much
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,ill be in my bunk
gameofthrones,removed,your sister is out of the bag
gameofthrones,removed,i doubt it i check the upload date for these kind of videos and i would have remembered if it was made so long ago that no one would have any credible information
gameofthrones,removed,leaks say that you shouldnt be concerned
gameofthrones,removed,nah that cant be it unless he kills someone very important there is absolutely no sense in bringing him back then dying killing some random assholes that carry no significance and that we dont care about
gameofthrones,removed,suicide
gameofthrones,removed,yeah if you see the scene where arya is taking off peoples faces the eye color hair color hair style and skin color all change from jaqens dark skin and long hair to aryas shorter hair and pale body
gameofthrones,removed,rumor is he kills himself after cercie uses wildfire to blow up the sept and kills the high sparrowthe sparrowsmargery and loris he jumps out the red keep window
gameofthrones,removed,there wes no reason for you to spoil it so massively you fucking cunt of a person i hope you step on a fucking inch nail
gameofthrones,removed,i want to slap your stupid ugly fucking face just by the way you casually spoiled it i can tell i fucking hate you i truly hope your dog chokes to death while you watch
gameofthrones,removed,he only needs good men
gameofthrones,removed,but he does talk about the scene and the fact that it was deleted it may not confirm what is saying but the way he talks about his disappointment towards the scene being deleted does support the supposed quote
gameofthrones,removed,as the budget increases so too do my erections
gameofthrones,removed,fuck marry kill cersei the mountain and breanne
gameofthrones,removed,fuck marry kill cersei the mountain and breanne
gameofthrones,removed,whats wrong with a blow job
gameofthrones,removed,i fucking love that movie fun as hell power porn
gameofthrones,removed,he is still ned starks blood and winning the battle of the bastards after charging in like a twat heroic leader as the songs will go he wouldnt pose that support they swear to him as a snow him actually having legitimacy the the iron throne would just bring more people to the cause i think
gameofthrones,removed,and snow is coming ಠ‿ಠ
gameofthrones,removed,wow danys double is hot af
gameofthrones,removed,looks like the cast for a really bad got porn parody
gameofthrones,removed,in the show perhapsor he could rule winterfell with sansaas there still married as no high septon or king set there marriage asideof course thats dependant on jon becoming king along dany or dany perhaps dieing and never ruling the line of succession is kind of fucked up for pretty much every house at the moment
gameofthrones,removed,just not a fan of liberals constantly jamming their views down my throat why cant a story just be a story and not have to turn into a lecture symbolism or whatever you want to call that
gameofthrones,removed,looks good but why are you wearing clothes
gameofthrones,removed,oh fuck youre right
gameofthrones,removed,yes yes i can fap to that
gameofthrones,removed,gilf
gameofthrones,removed,i actually kind of want to see jon sansa and arya just as a big fuck you to everyone who tried to destroy the starks its hard not to say davos but i think hes at peace with his own death now tyrion was the other really tough choice
gameofthrones,removed,for someone so adept at playing a psychologically damaged spiteful mass murderer lena always looks like the most fun person on the planet to be around
gameofthrones,removed,oh wow he seems a little its actually adorable i have new respect for what an amazing actor he is
gameofthrones,removed,i bet lena headey and the viper dude had sex that night

gameofthrones,removed,unlike this sub the show isnt intended for mature audiences here the comments are purloined to ensure no one takes offense or reflects their base nature
gameofthrones,removed,the boobies are the giveaway
gameofthrones,removed,checks natalie dormers face in his closet yup thats correct creeeeeeeepy
gameofthrones,removed,she is prettier than the actual actress actual actress doesnt have a flattering nose
gameofthrones,removed,bonner achieved
gameofthrones,removed,im sorry but she doesnt look anything like margaery tyrell shes a human person not a pile of green ashes
gameofthrones,removed,yeah especially since the last episode
gameofthrones,removed,so margaery actually survived the green trial and escaped to moscow shes a genius
gameofthrones,removed,idk what you mean i thought she was a green pile of ash now
gameofthrones,removed,ygritte
gameofthrones,removed,thanks for repeating the comment you replied to inefficiently
gameofthrones,removed,ill be in my bunk
gameofthrones,removed,cousin marriage is not incest my parents were cousins its legal and always has been not to mention its very common how offensive
gameofthrones,removed,hnnnnnnnnng
gameofthrones,removed,i was mostly sad when margaery died because i no longer get to see natalie dormer every week
gameofthrones,removed,now lemme see dem saggy tig ol bitties 😛
gameofthrones,removed,wtf are you people even talking about lol
gameofthrones,removed,dracarhips
gameofthrones,removed,im not much of a tattoo guy but that sure is one alluring thigh you got there
gameofthrones,removed,hot
gameofthrones,removed,sadly all you wanted to do was show off your body
gameofthrones,removed,looks great now hope you keep that thigh toned as in years cellulite will screw up that tatoo badly
gameofthrones,removed,looks awful imho
gameofthrones,removed,dont listen to ushroomite hes probably all hopped up on shrooms anyway you showed the perfect amount of thigh
gameofthrones,removed,no idea how accurate the subtitles are on here since i dont speak spanish although the english ones have been spot on so far so hopefully they would be the same way
gameofthrones,removed,okay keep believing that you got your karma well done
gameofthrones,removed,haha but you have to admit half the votes were from it its cute i admit it but oh well ima getting lynched anyway
gameofthrones,removed,omg this thread is delicious
gameofthrones,removed,in terms of stirring the pot no there isnt
gameofthrones,removed,obviously not to a lunch mob
gameofthrones,removed,hope youll let dudes nut on it
gameofthrones,removed,or knows about terraria rather cover my ass when i can
gameofthrones,removed,needs more greyscale
gameofthrones,removed,syrio vs jaqen make it happen bastardbowl cleganebowl wolfbowl braavosbowl can we survive the hype
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,so true
gameofthrones,removed,can someone please tell me if theres going to be any violence as well i love this show but dont want to witness any violence because of my religion
gameofthrones,removed,there are multiple news articles detailing the two truths and a lie event as well as exploring which options are most likely lies simple process of elimination happens if you reveal even one of them with ramsays imprisonment the appearance of lady stoneheart and aryas next three names are true with her next three names true that means sophies third statement is a lie arya returning to westeros ties in with her progress on the list and her appearing multiple times in the trailer is already apparent point out the simplest thing in the world that ledditors miss and theyll bring the pain with valyrian blue arrows
gameofthrones,removed,i can send you some nudes kek
gameofthrones,removed,so much great food and not a single missed episode of got feels good man
gameofthrones,removed,really gives me the same impression from the star wars cover art for the original trilogy the remastered ones i think
gameofthrones,removed,get out
gameofthrones,removed,respect his authoritah
gameofthrones,removed,mod please hide picture and tag post spoilers all
gameofthrones,removed,i may yet be the only living thing on this planet that isnt so triggered by the dorne scenes as everyone else whats the big fucking deal
gameofthrones,removed,worth the chuckle
gameofthrones,removed,but how many shades of grey walkers are there
gameofthrones,removed,that and hodor held the motherfucking door it stands to reason that only a few would reach meera and bran at first and coldhands said himself that the dead dont rest they were still being pursued
gameofthrones,removed,it certainly carries a lot of skyrim with it though
gameofthrones,removed,some mmos have lasted an extremely long time is sb still running or could it run again
gameofthrones,removed,which one there were definitely different sets
gameofthrones,removed,a man is curious
gameofthrones,removed,probably more like
gameofthrones,removed,now thats savage
gameofthrones,removed,this is a joke right ramadan or not you cant look at nonmahram women
gameofthrones,removed,this whole thing is incredible you did a wonderful job
gameofthrones,removed,about tree fiddy thousand
gameofthrones,removed,right hurry up time i cant wait to agonize about another of emptiness
gameofthrones,removed,if you say so i dont miss an opportunity to call passiveaggressive people out on their crap redditors above all i wont make any more posts or edits like that sorry
gameofthrones,removed,how do people know these plot details and which episodes theyll appear in like how people know that bastard bowl is happening in episode and promise me ned is happening on episode
gameofthrones,removed,i really do wonder sometimes how good of a leader ned would have been as lordregent robert said hed hate the job and do it well but it would be difficult if ned didnt listen to the small council
gameofthrones,removed,not quite sure why they are voting you down
gameofthrones,removed,i believe that he desperately loves the starks and his sister she was justified in her anger and sadness at his return but you could really tell that she loved him just as much if not more him stepping forward in her defense and then working together with her during their fleet steal seemed to reinforce that
gameofthrones,removed,not contesting that at all the interface has some skyrim similarities though doesnt it
gameofthrones,removed,what did you use to animate this
gameofthrones,removed,probably a meme at this point particularly the bad poosi crap i do understand the ridiculousness and why people think it is a weak storyline but thats comparing it to everything else i was kinda interested in ellaria sands behavior after oberyns death namely her reactions to jaimes presence in dorne her method of murdering myrcella also caught me way offguard especially since i was rejoicing at her sharing the truth with her father and embracing him
gameofthrones,removed,have you picked up the antireligion message in the books and the show its very clear time to choose one side acknowledges its fiction
gameofthrones,removed,we do there are spoilers from legitimate sources here the scene with yara and the other girl isnt even a spoiler considering it was shown in a trailer and the promo shows theon and yara in the same vicinity so common sense dictates that the scene is most likely going to happen tonight
gameofthrones,removed,grenn
gameofthrones,removed,without turning this tread into something completely different i would say there is a good chance of it in the trailer for season we see yara getting it on with another woman who looks like shes from volantis and we definite know that yara and theon are in volantis next episode
gameofthrones,removed,yes once by bran not long after the wedding took place he told jojen meera osha rickon and hodor about the legend of the white rat and why guest right is so tremendously important
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,removed,this is just me pitting his character against the pressures and evils of ruling an entire kingdom im not taking the other factors into account
gameofthrones,removed,there might be some since yara is in volantis and we see her making out with a volantene slave in the trailer
gameofthrones,removed,wow i dont know what to say its really eyeopening to talk with someone like you im so sorry that you have to live that way hope things get better
gameofthrones,removed,womans wisdom
gameofthrones,removed,he did it all so he could bang a hot nun what a jerk
gameofthrones,removed,kys
gameofthrones,removed,just those dothraki that jorah and daario saw when they were sneaking around this has been a pretty tame season so far

gameofthrones,removed,is it wrong that im not this strict about things i wont be watching porn or anything but i wouldnt mind watching got while fasting to me its a show that i watch because of the story i dont get aroused by the sexual scenes and hell i wouldnt mind doing anything at night lol

gameofthrones,removed,kind of hypocritical huh be good for only one month and continue watching your porn for the rest of the year
gameofthrones,removed,there is tittys in this ep dude my boner confirms it
gameofthrones,removed,sorry muslim friends we got titties
gameofthrones,removed,asha greyjoy you can fuck the tits off my any day
gameofthrones,removed,calling her a star seems flatout wrong
gameofthrones,removed,bless your pious little heart
gameofthrones,removed,but the old gods and the new approve of the nudity
gameofthrones,removed,guess you can never watch this episode then because of titties
gameofthrones,removed,titties only allowed after am sorry
gameofthrones,removed,fuck you bill simmons i dont care about your stupid show we have minutes left of game of thrones
gameofthrones,removed,fuck the titties of that girl
gameofthrones,removed,ill be in my bunk
gameofthrones,removed,i had such a turgid erection tonight
gameofthrones,removed,aryas in the preview for the next ep i think her plot armor will keep her alive
gameofthrones,removed,whoa that would make for a crazy theory how come no one has ever said this before
gameofthrones,removed,wherever did you get such an idea
gameofthrones,removed,kinda like chronologically lost i like this idea
gameofthrones,removed,the sparrow cheated the audience from seeing marges naked bod by taking away her walk of shame now he is making it up to us by arranging a bang scene between her and tommen
gameofthrones,removed,can we just stop and appreciate how many theories that have been around for years are finally being confirmed jon snow is alive big brother is sandie clegane coldhands is benjen cleganebowl does this confirm sandor is the arrancar almost r l j
gameofthrones,removed,i can only masturbate so many times you guys so stoked for cleganebowl
gameofthrones,removed,people here are fucking stupid even thinking about her dying now
gameofthrones,removed,i guess spoiler for the next episode but she was shown in the preview
gameofthrones,removed,tyrion sure gave him a taste
gameofthrones,removed,can you imagine being around a ton of hot naked girls and not be able to get a boner because you dont have a dick anymore
gameofthrones,removed,please dbs dont kill arya or i swear to god ill burn your houses down
gameofthrones,removed,shes jumping off buildings in the preview so i think shes good
gameofthrones,removed,would lsh kill a bunch of innocent faith worshipers i have only read one chapter with her in it but that doesnt seem like something she would do
gameofthrones,removed,is septon meribald dead in the books
gameofthrones,removed,that yara scene though ill be in my bunk
gameofthrones,removed,lol maybe thats the reason kevan doesnt like her hes like why am i the only one in the family who you wont bang
gameofthrones,removed,oh i know uncle benjin last week next week syrio forel saves arya
gameofthrones,removed,your lips to the gods ears i want some effing sparrows to die already
gameofthrones,removed,no go watch my little pony of something
gameofthrones,removed,if boners last more than four hours call more ladies
gameofthrones,removed,hes been getting some good poosey
gameofthrones,removed,draw what hodor will look like as a whit
gameofthrones,removed,i wonder if yara keeps theons cock around as some sort of strapon dildo for sexy times
gameofthrones,removed,this is the most shameless karma grab
gameofthrones,removed,preview shows some of us the faith getting destroyed by zombie mountain and arya alive jumping out of a window
gameofthrones,removed,brainwashed cucks
gameofthrones,removed,im starting to realize that show kinda has a problem with making characters a lot more vengeful and spiteful than they are in the books in the books the waif is actually very helpful to arya and teaches her how to lie properly while arya teaches her the common tongue then theres ellaria who in the books simply goes away to quietly mourn the death of oberyn and to raise their children while in the show they had her murder innocent children her lovers brother and wanting to start a war like ok
gameofthrones,removed,lets see when it showed a blacksmith at the beginning i was damn sure it was gonna be gendry but dammit this is even better welcome back fuck the king and all that i lost my shit with lyanna mormont mvp black fish has nonhealthy levels of badassness bronn had like minutes of screentime but he still managed to be awesome welcome back i find it remarkable that after one episode away from cersei jaime is kinda cool again when does she die again on that note olenna is also mvp glorious burns welp arya vs waif began as anticlimatically as possible i thought arya already had this cunning badass plan given how last episode ended i find comfort in the fact shes unkillable right now no writershowrunner is that dumb this war of the bastards jon is kinda fucked and ill be fucking mad if they make ramsay win dammit but then again jon did just came back from the dead so hes also unkillable huh two starks who cant die how about that bucks say sansa sent her letter to littlefinger asking for the aryns army support oh the stark dumbness
gameofthrones,removed,tell that to quentyn martell

gameofthrones,removed,in the scenes from next week it showed arya doing some pretty serious parkour she was running from someone and was strong enough for big jumps
gameofthrones,removed,because i dont want this to turn into a religious debate i will pm you
gameofthrones,removed,sorry but there is no god dont waste your time
gameofthrones,removed,i think youre talking about deadalive catlin but what does asos stand for
gameofthrones,removed,i hate the kuffar but i really like their infidel shows excuse me why are they drinking rum in the show thats so haram they should ban it it offends my religion
gameofthrones,removed,how is seeing violence death and murder less worse than a nipple i would say hold off on gots until after ramadan no sense in halfassing your holy holiday
gameofthrones,removed,basically gave away the hound coming back told people his own character dies when the internet blew up he said get a life its only tits and dragons pretty funny if you ask me
gameofthrones,removed,i was like oh wow no one is gonna die this episode then i remembered what show i was watching
gameofthrones,removed,you just going to straight karma whore my theory savage bruh
gameofthrones,removed,sushi sissy
gameofthrones,removed,who fucking cares
gameofthrones,removed,now that you mention it the preview for next episode shows pod being kidnapped
gameofthrones,removed,till one takes an arrow when he flees
gameofthrones,removed,it was the big reveal was gendry in the next on game of thrones clip arms looking buff as fuck from rowing for seasons
gameofthrones,removed,lmao cant believe this is for real
gameofthrones,removed,so unnecessary its so easy to look up reviews on mature content in showstelevision i feel these posts were created to get some free religious advertisement or look at me points
gameofthrones,removed,the time stamp probably leads straight to boobies
gameofthrones,removed,here you go it is a spoiler and it pretty much confirms it
gameofthrones,removed,ive got a very disappointing boner right now
gameofthrones,removed,it wasnt voluntary either the hype boner tore off your clothes
gameofthrones,removed,i still cant believe people have so much hope for their favorite characters did the red wedding teach them nothing does valar morghulis mean nothing arya is going to die and the waif waited until she secured passage back home so she can take aryas place carefulthose tinfoil hats are getting so big people cant even see from behind them i mean this was obvious tonight
gameofthrones,removed,muslims celebrating ramadan and avoiding nude scenes have absolutely nothing to do with each other
gameofthrones,removed,what about dem titties
gameofthrones,removed,die yes we surely can valar morghulis affect westeross arya still can do that but shell really be waif wearing aryas face and id actually prefer to see that because arya is soft weve been learning that all season she doesnt really want to go get revenge because if she did shed have taken the opportunity from jaquen to become a ruthless assassin but she slapped him in the face and thinks shes tough enough to do it on her own without completing her training shed be mince meat this way with waif taking control of arya we might actually see the arya we wanted when she got stars in her eyes watching jaquen leave westeross its better this way
gameofthrones,removed,that wasnt from a kings blood it was from a kings seed stannis and melessandre on the painted table all shed have to do is seduce jon he may be a bastard but hes descended from the kings of the north and if a certain theory is true from another line of kings as well
gameofthrones,removed,thats not what its all about but thats how it will end if you arent catching the hints then you arent paying attention just one more timesay it with me now valar morghulis in all seriousness i love this show its a great analogy for life we strive with so much vigor and pursue our lives with passion many of those pursuits can be meaningless it all depends on whos perspective you seek while the peasant feels political positioning is ridiculous the highborn know it means life or death for them the watch all know theres bigger problems afoot than whos house is doing what davos mentioned this just this last episode however do you think olenna would feel the same way right now so we spend so much energy on life but when its all over with we wont bring any of it with us all our accomplishments will be lost just as our life is gone and even if those accomplishments affect others after you and your name is celebrated you wont be alive to enjoy it if everyone dies at the end this will be the only show to truly give the meaning of life justice life is not a fairytale its a tragedy filled with fleeting moments of comedy that is the great oscillation the collective breath of life i do believe its cylical so it will happen again but firstvalar morghulis
gameofthrones,removed,whatever this sub is shit anyways so i wont be around to shove it in your face when i end up being right too many idiots here and the mods are trigger happy thinking theyre valiantly defending their webspace enjoy your rainbows and sunshine ill enjoy my game of thrones the way it was meant with piss and blood
gameofthrones,removed,ill be in my bunk
gameofthrones,removed,this whole season is messed up and makes no sense its like each episode is directed by a child
gameofthrones,removed,ramsay is gonna shoot him with an arrow before bastardbowl as rickon is running to jon
gameofthrones,removed,the high sparrow had a boner when touched margaerys hand and she knows what kind of pervert shes dealing with
gameofthrones,removed,sansa gets a response hehe knew ud cum around no can resisted the baelish dick pic
gameofthrones,removed,speaking of no context my soul has no pulse haunt you like cunt cheese wanting just to fall in love httpswwwredditcommessagecomposetonocontextbot httpnocontextbotherokuappcom dont want me replying to your comments send me a message with the title blacklist i wont reply to any users who have done so
gameofthrones,removed,at least theyre wont be awkward boners
gameofthrones,removed,the hound is coming and many a men are cumming whos gonna die we dont know yet all the ladies are getting wet sorry i was kidding its going to be the mountain the blood is going to ooze out of him like a fountain
gameofthrones,removed,house neoclegane sigil a bloody fucking chicken words fuck the king
gameofthrones,removed,you could say that fighting for arya and spending time with her was a neutral good route hes after the money but he clearly cares about her by the time they part ill be gnawing my fingers to the very bone while i wait for their reunion
gameofthrones,removed,definitely but arya getting waifd caught me completely offguard im as hyped now that cleganebowl is fucking confirmed but i definitely have to see what happens with arya
gameofthrones,removed,reek nods like a pussy but the great theon smashes the pussy or used to anyway im sure jon could teach him how to do that thing with his tongue
gameofthrones,removed,this needs to be under lady boners to because i could shine that metal
gameofthrones,removed,why do this subreddit clap for every child actor like its the special olympics
gameofthrones,removed,oi you can fuck right off meeraxbran otp
gameofthrones,removed,she totally liked him after that one
gameofthrones,removed,listening to talkersmakes me thirsty nabs drink
gameofthrones,removed,a lot of people are slow to process this and its rather annoying but the two truths one lie situation is about resolved this is assuming sophie and maisie werent totally lying lady stoneheart will appear arya will go to westeros and cross three names off her list ramsay when defeated will be imprisoned for the time being he does not die this season with the ramsay survival point exposed process of elimination leaves the above statements as true
gameofthrones,removed,according to a certain little spoiler apparently he lets rickon run across the field to jon only to put an arrow in him before they reach one another he dies in jons arms
gameofthrones,removed,gendrys wasnt it gendrys cum
gameofthrones,removed,really a picture gets the number one post this sub is full of this shit
gameofthrones,removed,the way their heads are just peaking through those convenient openings in the bushes is hilarious to me for some reason
gameofthrones,removed,do you not think grrm is going to bring back the hound you dont believe in the gravedigger theories
gameofthrones,removed,now now boner
gameofthrones,removed,just stop posting what kind of crackpot garbage is this ill be back next week after youve been proven wrong to make fun of you for saying such idiotic nonsense
gameofthrones,removed,it cant be tragic because olly wasnt a highborn king or prince fuckolly fuckthecommonman fuckserflosers
gameofthrones,removed,the brotherhood without boners
gameofthrones,removed,the brotherhood without boners
gameofthrones,removed,hahaahaahahahahahahahahahahahaaha
gameofthrones,removed,could have just said it out of spite its not impossible to imagine that she didnt finish him off and left him there to die just like arya did for the hound i dont think believe brienne is the type of person to kill a dying old defenseless man
gameofthrones,removed,eddard stark also said he killed arthur dayne
gameofthrones,removed,ill fap over her anytime
gameofthrones,removed,where are you getting huge possibility from just because character came back now every presumed dead character has to come back mostly yes it was left ambiguous the way he died just like the hound we dont see brienne giving him the fatal blow leaving a possibility that stannis could somehow manage to have lived thats what the series creators intended to do in my opinion letting stannis live is a worse punishment than being dead and brienne could have easily thought that he lost everything and now he has to live with it for the rest of his life as i said its just a possibility that ran through my mind as soon as i saw the hound alive
gameofthrones,removed,lol this is bullshit everytime i try to open a thread on got to discuss theories it gets removed post in the official episode discussion theres like thousands of comments good luck someone commenting on it lol this is why everyone is leaving this subreddit and going on the official forums discussion
gameofthrones,removed,theres a glimpse of both of them in the trailer for brace yourself for yet another waifarya fight scene
gameofthrones,removed,i cant see it i admittedly havent read the books and understand that jaime is different there but show jaime wouldnt betray cersei pretty much his entire motivation for anything thus far has been to please herget back to her spoiler i could see it happening at one point but not this season more would have to happen to persuade jaime otherwise most likely something involving tyrion returning as the only other character jaime is shown to really love beside cersei is his brother
gameofthrones,removed,i think he turned her down because he was a brother of the nights watch
gameofthrones,removed,my hype just went from to midnight
gameofthrones,removed,i just rewatched the preview of episode and its not arya doing the parkour its the waif
gameofthrones,removed,best line of the show a lanister always pays dont fooking tell me that
gameofthrones,removed,wait sorry am i missing something isnt arya on the verge of dying i mean i know that the hound managed to live after being seriously injured — but that was his leg not his stomach aryas wound is much worse than the hounds imho why is everyone so sure that she is going to live dont get me wrong — i hope she wont die but it just seems to me that her survival is highly unlikely
gameofthrones,removed,i think she was fine but got washed out by all the sand snake crap they should have had two snakes at best tyene i only remember that name because it alliterates with titties and whoever it was that keisha castlehughes butchered with a better actress have a quick throwaway line to explain why the others werent around actually no that still doesnt solve the problem that dorne didnt add a goddamn thing to the story
gameofthrones,removed,at least we would see some titties
gameofthrones,removed,maybe his ax is a symbol for the new gravedigger becoming a fighter for a different set of beliefs than the old hound was
gameofthrones,removed,his sister shows him that you dont need a dick to fuck some titties hope hes a quick learner oh and hell be a great addition to the varys team
gameofthrones,removed,thank you are we to assume that spoiler b lsh has only recently in the book timeline been resurrected or maybe resurrected days post red wedding like in the books and has been lying low
gameofthrones,removed,see this is the thing that i dont understand why is incest so negative for jaime and cersei they come from a culture where it has been acceptable up until a short time ago the infidelity is a larger issue in my mind the mad king aerys ii openly wed his sister so why is cersie and jaime such a heinous idea i understand that in our culture it is considered a distasteful act and has been such for thousands of years but we arent westeros where many of their actions would not be acceptable in our society even infidelity is not held with the same stigma as it is in our society they openly take the children in and even give them a surname that denotes that they are partly highborne i think the problem is that you are projecting your social values onto their society in a quasiethnocentric manner yes i got to use that sat word
gameofthrones,removed,your grace im sorry to interrupt but are you sure you want meself to stick this dildo up your arse
gameofthrones,removed,isnt this tywins armor i feel like there was an interesting missing scene where jaime decided to wear is full knowing that tywin was smiling in his grave that the thought of jaime finally wearing it
gameofthrones,removed,ive got the most confused erection right now
gameofthrones,removed,are you sure i watched that episode recently and i think the flashback is after the title sequence i think there are only episodes with delayed title sequence and
gameofthrones,removed,im pretty sure ser twenty of house goodmen will be able to lend a hand to the starks
gameofthrones,removed,weirdest boner ever
gameofthrones,removed,that would be a pretty good plot line for a got porn
gameofthrones,removed,try dating a girl from a devout catholic family on saturday theyre fucking animals in the sack by wednesday theyre on their third trip to confession this week to beg for forgiveness then friday night rolls around and theyre so turned on by how wrong it all is that you spend the whole weekend fucking your brain and your boner will never know a wilder ride or a better one
gameofthrones,removed,hehe you said boobs
gameofthrones,removed,the only character of importance to the got show from house martell is elia martell and oberyn poking around in kl about her death she is an integral tragic part to the backdrop of the other houses and their past this is really sad because other houses with similar relevance have been handled better house arryn for instance consisted for the longest time of named characters of which jon arryns offscreen death got rolling we were left with scenes at the eyrie and the whole housearea got established within those shots including the knights of the vale family relationships and the inherent weirdness of lysa and robin with dorne we got oberyn and man what a great introduction that was it just developed so so sad from that starting point maybe i was just hoping for more awesomeness from doctor bashier in a wheelchair
gameofthrones,removed,gilf
gameofthrones,removed,seeing jaime with bronn at the head of a lannister army was probably my favourite scene from this epsiside that whole image and what it represented was gangsta as fuck the only let down was how they were on a mission to help the freys as oppose to the starks
gameofthrones,removed,its called mexicans
gameofthrones,removed,another thing thats been bothering me in the preview for next weeks episode we see arya running from the waif and taking a flying leap off a balcony onto a lower staircase that seems like a stretch for someone who just got stabbed in the gut
gameofthrones,removed,bang a goateed pedophile
gameofthrones,removed,rfuckolly
gameofthrones,removed,if she does come back i can see her jon and benjen representing different moralities after youre brought back jon leans more towards the morally good side after his death he still believes in justice for those who committed crimes like murder and betrayal but will still show compassion when he needs to we havent seen much of benjen but so far he seems mostly indifferent and very similar to what he was like before he died then lady stoneheart would show the negative ways death effects a person turning her into a cold sadistic killer
gameofthrones,removed,nobody will ever know since that wont happen
gameofthrones,removed,that would be an interesting argument as jaime has been pretty much faithful to her im pretty sure the high sparrow is holding that as a trump card if he ever comes back to try to save her
gameofthrones,removed,that obviously isnt arya the arya that sold clams had different hair different clothes and pushed around a cart she didnt carry a basket
gameofthrones,removed,this brought back so many memories
gameofthrones,removed,they are both shit with tiny peckers and they are probably into dead girls or their own sister there is only one good lay and that is me
gameofthrones,removed,ha leaked
gameofthrones,removed,theon greyjoy
gameofthrones,removed,it is in my own belief that jaime is in fact the better lay he is well seasoned and has proven that he can impregnate a woman who is to say he cannot impregnate me im horney it is a well known fact that jaime is big his chest is broad and welcoming i could kiss him and feel warm did i mention im horney im horney his butt cheeks are taut and look like they could be a handfull all in all in the final end i would kiss jaime over jon jon is prude jon knows nothing jon could never prop me up on that diapy changing station like jaime could im horney
gameofthrones,removed,id still tap that
gameofthrones,removed,its podrick dont you know
gameofthrones,removed,calling it the transition from that axe swing to the ringing of the bell at the beginning thats foreshadowing the head of the mountain inside his helmet being smashed by the hound
gameofthrones,removed,so why do jon davos sansa and a few of the wildlings look right at him as he stands up they all stare at him without issue your explanation makes no sense they fight alongside him he joined them he fights with them why would he just smash people for looking at him when he is literally about to say things to them
gameofthrones,removed,acting
gameofthrones,removed,sure brienne of tarth olenna tyrell and arya stark
gameofthrones,removed,cocksucker
gameofthrones,removed,i like how no one responded to the motive question and they downvoted you bc they had to use their brain typical rgameofthrones people truth is there is no fucking motive and this is a retarded theory bulit upon an attachment to the character of arya
gameofthrones,removed,i thought he was hot from the very first scene my femboner went limp a bit when he threw bran out of the window but got back right up in the next scene where they resumed it the war for cerseis cunt scene god i miss the old jaime not the kidkilling part but the sass part
gameofthrones,removed,you sound like such a douche this hype crap is by far the most stupidest shit on reddit
gameofthrones,removed,spoilers nope
gameofthrones,removed,cant wait for the next episode based on the scenes from the preview and if arya is able to utilize her skills then itll be like an assassins game of cat and mouse
gameofthrones,removed,it was a lame and unfunny dick joke that made no sense in the context at all you just started randomly talking about dicks and expecting strangers to follow along
gameofthrones,removed,i would be okay with another pointless speech and repeats of her titties
gameofthrones,removed,so bang her on the side robert fucked hella bitches despite having a wife
gameofthrones,removed,jokes funny jokes im all for some dick jokes it has nothing to do with maturity but it annoys me when people cant read and they blather on regardless
gameofthrones,removed,nodrama subreddit so that means people calling me a dick is also a violation of this general principle
gameofthrones,removed,lf may be a manipulative pedo wait what did i miss the scene where him and merryn trent are telling girls they are too old
gameofthrones,removed,kit norththats my porn name meow
gameofthrones,removed,she has gotten hot this season i think its seeing her more as a powerful women more then the frightened little girl shes been in the past
gameofthrones,removed,brothers without boners
gameofthrones,removed,her being back up north tends to accentuate her blue eyes shes surrounded by dark greys and black so her eyes pop if youre anything like me then dark hair and light eyes just makes anyone men or women better looking lol
gameofthrones,removed,because she was burned all throughout the episode
gameofthrones,removed,booty got pow
gameofthrones,removed,i read titles as titties hopefully its the latter
gameofthrones,removed,to be honest i would still gladly let him drizzle his cum all over my face
gameofthrones,removed,for the love of all that is holy please someone make this meme
gameofthrones,removed,well without prior knowledge of the cleganebowl theory obviously not much the main thing is that this scene is an approximation of the gravedigger scene in the books which is what sandors survival and new godly outlook on life is based on this is the foundation of cleganebowl and when the septon is asking him about what purpose kept him alive when he was on deaths door sandor says hate probably implying the hatred of his brother which is one of sandors defining characteristics the septon also says that the gods have more in mind for him all these together can be interpreted to be pointing in the general direction of sandor coming out of retirement and representing the in cleganebowl also and i know im going out on a limb here but its a joke and doesnt necessarily have to be taken as a statement of fact
gameofthrones,removed,and coming soon to pornhub got giant porn
gameofthrones,removed,i like men
gameofthrones,removed,in the preview for next episode she said she choose violence
gameofthrones,removed,yeah imagine them going ass to ass on a dragon dildo
gameofthrones,removed,brotherhood without bonners
gameofthrones,removed,i read somewhere that tommen jumps out a window so i dont think hell be part of the trial by combat shell need time to mourn and then the prediction will be fulfilled maggy and when your tears have drowned you the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you is the valonqar jamie tyrion i think its the hound hes the younger brother of the mountain maggy never said whose younger brother would choke the life from her
gameofthrones,removed,it would be better if jamie east hadnt been exiled to a vt the usurption of the show throne by sue perkins has spoiled the show and the addition of an audience of randoms who get to fap on queue in return for prearranged question instead of the nerds grinds my gears no issue with perkins per se but the format and loss of jamie east is a deal reader for me thank the sky for fast forward to the teaser and then erase from the planner
gameofthrones,removed,we fucking called the gravedigger theory too
gameofthrones,removed,jemmy should stop acting hes already ruined everything first he tried helped his father with the war against the north but was captured then he promised take care about straks childred again failed tried to rescue his daughter failed and finally tried to kill high sparrow and was defeated too every thing jemmy starts he fails so black fish will destroy his army and kill jemmy
gameofthrones,removed,the gravedigger theory is alive whos gonna bury those people sandor has to dig at least graves for those that he lost
gameofthrones,removed,tommen gasp arent you gasp the least bit gasp into this at all gasp margaery no my king to get invested in this is a sin as the high sparrow says it is my duty to bear your heir and through patience i shall tommen yeah but youre like gasp a brick gasp i cant do this alone and its really killing my boner later that day high sparrow margaery its good to see you studying king tommen tells me youre being quite patient margaery of course i took your words to heart high sparrow well urm you know the king told me that being patient is urm killing his boner you must try a bit harder to be urm invested its totally not a sin
gameofthrones,removed,bad poosi
gameofthrones,removed,gilf
gameofthrones,removed,tommen will commit suicide and unellas head will be smashed by the moutain
gameofthrones,removed,ill get to tap that if we win
gameofthrones,removed,the wheel of time by robert jordan it has about books in the series at this point jordan has died but a few of the books were produced posthumus by his son or someone i had a hard time around book with remembering characters but is is the same period and very in depth with plot and characters like asoiaf i read another series last summer but am blanking on the name of it now i also found this buzzfeed link
gameofthrones,removed,go look for the confirmed spoilers for season and you will see what happens and doesnt happen all in all this sub will blow a lid because nothing notable happens
gameofthrones,removed,poor reasoning ability inability to admit defeat delusions of grandeur sad littlefinger would put you down
gameofthrones,removed,if you were twice as smart youd still be forest gump level stupid if you were twice as interesting youd still have no one to talk to do us all a favor and find another sub to troll you boring ignoramus
gameofthrones,removed,there are worse boners to be had
gameofthrones,removed,as opposed to her actually doing something for her god damn self you straw man making moron
gameofthrones,removed,ive had my quota of blithering idiots for the week good day ser
gameofthrones,removed,game of thrones meets likespinningcoin after talking with you for a few minutes bronn would throw you through the moon door cerci would have the frankinmountain bash your head in sansa would manipulate you to poison yourself arya would stab you with needle and the hound would bbq you like a chicken because you cant keep your stupid mouth shut can you stupid
gameofthrones,removed,i love the theory i just dont see tommen going for it
gameofthrones,removed,its arya the sleeve in the shot with the bloody hand completely matches the clothes that arya is wearing when she does the running jump off a ledge which can be seen in the preview for the next episode the clothes arya is wearing while doing the running jump dont look anything like jaqens robes and yes the girl doing the running jump in the preview is arya
gameofthrones,removed,therefore your brother and his ragtag army should ride into certain death because you cant swallow your pride thats not feminism thats fucking stupid
gameofthrones,removed,fucking stop with this shit
gameofthrones,removed,she turned very hot
gameofthrones,removed,your fundamental logic is the same dumbassery thats too prevalent in this sub and your justification for it is even worse
gameofthrones,removed,arya and the waif porn
gameofthrones,removed,husband watching the series happened to walk in during this scene
gameofthrones,removed,such insecurity
gameofthrones,removed,i really doubt that clegane bowl is going to happen its almost certainly going to be loras which makes way more narrative sense the fact that the brother hood without banners are led by lady stoneheart and like lady stoneheart are becoming more violent i reckon sandors will hunt down the brotherhood without banners and we will get the big lady stone heart reveal that would be so much cooler in my opinion
gameofthrones,removed,whats so special about hodor in the background
gameofthrones,removed,jon
gameofthrones,removed,the freys are rich as fuck tho they gave lord bolton lady waldas weight in silver if he would wed her and she wheighs a few tonnes
gameofthrones,removed,how about arya and jon snow are reflections of one another jon is the outsider brother of the family and arya doesnt behave like a normal high born jon was stabbed last season because he was lost trying to stay at the wall instead of taking back his home winterfell he was killed resurrected and now doing what he should be doing arya is a stark this faceless men assassin bullshit was a distraction shes now stabbed and close to death but will realise shes not just meant to return to westeros shes meant to return for vengeance lady stoneheart
gameofthrones,removed,technically speaking the boltons and the freys became great houses when they were named lords of winterfell and riverrun respectively if you accept the rule from kings landing as legitimate if not then nobut the point being they wereare technically now great houses even if they lack the might to back up that title and the crown isnt showing much enthusiasm about backing them up
gameofthrones,removed,eh maybe its been a tradition to kill a king a season though robrenlyrobbjofferrystannisbalon so i think theyd save him for next season
gameofthrones,removed,it could of been its tough
gameofthrones,removed,last shot of the wall coming crashing down and the ww advancing south
gameofthrones,removed,mike tyson open your gatesth ramsthay
gameofthrones,removed,you must be pretty kinky if you think arya and that old bitch were making out
gameofthrones,removed,someone is thirsty
gameofthrones,removed,finally always looking forward to his reviews also he doesnt use a super spoiler thumbnail this time
gameofthrones,removed,the gravedigger
gameofthrones,removed,lmao you really liked her acting skills didnt you
gameofthrones,removed,brienne thats what youre doing watching over her sandor aye thats what im doing
gameofthrones,removed,who knows the time relativity between sandors location and this seasons events at kl but i bet the hound is about to go on a killing spree and some buddy of the dead leader from kl is going to come check up progress to find the hound burying the bodies realize hes a total badass and take the story back to kl when cersei calls for trial by combat the faith people are going to think hey didnt some huge gravedigger slay a load of mother fuckers in vengeance of our followers where is that guy lets get him
gameofthrones,removed,please dont support this show its just a bunch of fear mongering theyve also left out facts on many issues because they are owned by people with an agenda like every other show like this
gameofthrones,removed,nah i think jamie is going to kill her im reading the books for the first time in prep for the final season and finally got to the part of her prophecy where matt the frog says or shows or maybe she just dreams it that her volanqair will strangle her im betting its going to be jamie on a side note when jamies aunt says tyrion is tywins true heir i think i got a little wet and grew a justice boner hahaha
gameofthrones,removed,funny how conservatives complain about pc culture censoring conservative thoughts yet they are quick to dismiss anything left leaning as bullshit those stupid liberals say
gameofthrones,removed,hes going to run out of commentary on trump and his lack of new joke lines will be even more noticeable i liked lwt early on but now it seems like he is just beating a slightly different dead horse was h episode the fact that people think it is a news show is almost more frustrating than his jokes too
gameofthrones,removed,but its written bastard son of lord stark so they were wrong right i dont see what they predicted here please send some help i feel dumb
gameofthrones,removed,wow youre just as stupid as sansa you probably havent even read the books obviously sansa didnt read them when i was years old i totally would have picked up on mental instability while being super emotional and the drunkest i had ever been you probably also think that all of catelyns decisions are somewhat acceptable and that she isnt a stupid bitch who should have seen the exact consequences of her stupid butthead choices
gameofthrones,removed,al gore is azor ahai wut
gameofthrones,removed,you sound like ignorant conservative
gameofthrones,removed,busy sucking all those dicks junkies gotta get paid
gameofthrones,removed,jaime for paralympics
gameofthrones,removed,i dont know i feel ramsay would be pretty good at archery if skydiving was one lysa tully would be gold medalist
gameofthrones,removed,i lost it at diving lol
gameofthrones,removed,i guess brienne could team up with gendry for the rowing competition she did refuse when jaime proposed himself to help her rowing when she was taking him to kings landing season one of the last episodes or first pages of book if i remember correctly
gameofthrones,removed,i would probably invert hodor and ser gregor since björnsson is a professional strongman which involves weightlifting and wrestling would probably suits hodor since he could prevent thousands of zombie walkers from getting through the door rip my friend
gameofthrones,removed,i lost it at diving hahaha
gameofthrones,removed,diving tommen baratheon wow
gameofthrones,removed,rugby jon snow he survived the worlds most terrifying scrum
gameofthrones,removed,pretty sure brienne beat sandor in the boxing trials already
gameofthrones,removed,either answer the question or fuck of
gameofthrones,removed,it would be terrible to be bran
gameofthrones,removed,that sounds like some liberal bullshit to me
gameofthrones,removed,so the nights king is wikileaks
gameofthrones,removed,jon is stabbed dany flew away on drogon and was approached by the dothraki horde and cersei walked with shame
gameofthrones,removed,why do people use the word perfect to mean cool or interesting
gameofthrones,removed,hold the door 😭
gameofthrones,removed,both of them are too leftleaning to be associated with the tea party their involvement with it was probably as guests
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,wow what a hottie would love to spend an evening with george rr martin
gameofthrones,removed,ugh
gameofthrones,removed,i just wish a girl had no dress shes now dammit
gameofthrones,removed,nah imo shes gotten uglier as shes gotten older in season she was the cutest little thing ive ever seen
gameofthrones,removed,george wants that pussy
gameofthrones,removed,yes shes very lucky that those uncomfortable looking shoes barely in view at the bottom of the picture dont make her entirely unattractive
gameofthrones,removed,his ass should be locked in a room finishing the rest of the god damn books
gameofthrones,removed,that the face of a man who knows the path to seeing boobs
gameofthrones,removed,anyone ever think he could die before finishing the book
gameofthrones,removed,i swear to god hes doing the thing with maisies boobcrack
gameofthrones,removed,i think maybe its just maisies cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,i only voted for jon because i didnt want to give littlefinger the satisfaction seeing as they paired him with sansa clearly pointing out that yet again there will be problems between her and jon let me guess shes gonna keep being a pawn of littlefinger right i mean she has been the entire series why not just a bit longer s seriously though wtf did they put sansa with littlefinger for it should be jon and sansa littlefinger could have idk robin or he can just be by himself because all he thinks about is himself
gameofthrones,removed,i thought everyone liked tyrion the best well i guess that was true for the noncrotchety nontransferable previous seasons of tyrion
gameofthrones,removed,myrcella didnt die from cerseis actions or at least cersei is very far down the chain reaction line interestingly enough both deaths in that comparison could just as easily be attributed to olenna stemming from a single point killing joffrey ultimately triggered a chain of events that brought the kingdom to ruin
gameofthrones,removed,do you mean put that exact image into a shitty onlinemobile editing software and added an effect the other painting of arya you put up got the exact same replies
gameofthrones,removed,not hoping for a lot of oral sex are you

gameofthrones,removed,i say this when im about to cum
gameofthrones,removed,streamlordcom
gameofthrones,removed,because all you seem to do is post shitty quality artwork which is just images from the tv series with a crap filter i mean you got a shit load of upvotes on your bran one alongside a shitload of hate saying it was basically just crap phone art but you continue to upload it when nobody really wants it
gameofthrones,removed,wrong map
gameofthrones,removed,ahem from your top comments thenintheiement days ago of course he was smiling who wouldnt want to have kit harington on top of them
gameofthrones,removed,dunno why you guys acts like everyone have to love jon snow i have news for you i dont like him he acts like world cant hold him and always so moody he thinks no one knows what feels to be bastard and acts like he suffered so greatlywhen tyrion constant object of mockery and hatred knows about bastards and rejection unlike jon show does he know all those starving orphans or uneducated peasants or other real bastards even durning his early days he so fucking annoying he was raised well but always unhappy and jealous cause he cant inherit winterfell he is so dumb and whiny has ridiculous amount of plot armored even disnety characters dont have all his scene is sulking and complaining all the time
gameofthrones,removed,dude just let it go youve made your opinions about jon snow perfectly clear at this point and with each subsequent post about him you fail to bring anything new to your argument if your gonna keep on ranting please bring something new to the table i know you have a hateboner for jon and you cant stand how popular the character is but none of your posts are going to change that and the more you carry on the more and more of a petulant immature child you appear to be
gameofthrones,removed,still would take him for a ride

gameofthrones,removed,it appears you have used the word bitch have you checked your privilege today maleprivilege patriarchy
gameofthrones,removed,reported
gameofthrones,removed,dude was a straight up douche yes his primary goal was to stick to tradition but at the cost of murdering his brothers in arms and yes he was lying of the way when it came to trying to lure jons companions out of the room where jons body was he would have kept killing to eliminate the threat and other dissent from the nights watch the man was consistent though that i will give him to his last breath he never regretted any of his decisions thats worthy of respect for him as an individual but it doesnt validate the murderous mentality he had to achieve his goals
gameofthrones,removed,yeah in the show he was nothing more than an asshole and a villain even if a minor one
gameofthrones,removed,he definitely is that but thats part of his appeal for me hes dangerous
gameofthrones,removed,she let tomme land though
gameofthrones,removed,oh my sweet summer child
gameofthrones,removed,i might follow your advice so far the only spoiler that i have seen is from facebook before i started watching got maybe i will avoid using fb too for now spoilers i know jon snow will die and resurrected jon snow is daenerys nephew starks that is alive is sansa arya bran and jon hodor will die joffrey will die sansa got married to tyrion shae will betray tyrion coz of jealousy

gameofthrones,removed,still hot tho
gameofthrones,removed,emilia clarke just isnt suited for daenerys imo she doesnt look the part i always imagine that the dragonlords from which daenerys is descended from would look fierce and majestic sort of like instead we have daenerys who has such a baby face and round cheeks she doesnt look fierce or like a badass at all and dont get me started on her miscoloured eyes pouty lips and atrocious eyebrows she acts a lot with her eyebrows but for someone like daenerys targaryen her eyebrows almost over act the situation shes supposed to be the fierce dragon queen not mr bean the eyebrows are overkill and then the acting jeez its actually so hard not to cringe by the time season came around i started skipping her scenes because i couldnt stand her character first off the writing is absolutely terrible shes got valyrian steel plot armour and it pisses me off everytime i watch her moonwalk away from conflict without a fucking scratch whats this the second sons are planning to assassinate you and manage to get inside your tent without anyone noticing nah its just daario naharis with an entire army for her on a silver platter oh youre stuck in a house with dozens of the fiercest warlords of the dothraki alive just push over a fucking torch conveniently set in a completely straw house ablaze in literally seconds arent they aware of fire hazards in vraes dothrak what kind of super flammable straw do they have that instantly roasts everyone alive in half a second why didnt one of the khals run the fuck out or stick a spear in her i wont even shit on her anymore sansa starks story is pretty shit too yeah i get that youre a battered woman and its so tragic but being subject to cruel punishments doesnt make you have a good story or an interesting character her whole plot line has been about her getting abused joffrey mentally tortures her and physically has her beaten ramsay i think fucked her in the ass or some other fucked up shit and now in season sansa is just a whiny teenage girl whos so cliquey and snobbish it pisses me off she thinks shes too smart for jon and too good for everyone else she thinks she knows better but she doesnt know shit
gameofthrones,removed,those fooking non valyrian eyebrows man thats something im never gonna get makes me wonder the same thing those dothraki horse riders where thinking is her pussy valyrian blonde
gameofthrones,removed,if you think this has a happy ending you havent been paying attention
gameofthrones,removed,i basically agree with you but i dont care im still in love with her think shes beautiful and perfect in every way and desperately want to marry her and have her babies

gameofthrones,removed,stop only a dany nuthugger would think shes a role model her morality is highly questionable as is her intelligence and honor
gameofthrones,removed,you gave your honest and uncut opinion so i will do the same i think that youre very immature you confuse the character with the actress your opinion isnt as objective as it should be in order to judge the actress performance appropriately but yes for what its worth youre a special snowflake with a special opinion
gameofthrones,removed,in the show she tells caitlyn stark that her boy died of fever in episode
gameofthrones,removed,threads like these are the reason i dont even spend much time on reddit or pretty much any got related sites these daysthis fandom is garbage and im glad the show is ending as fast as possible so i wont have to be a part of it anymorefucking embarrasing
gameofthrones,removed,your post is fucking terrible theres no point bringing up the character itself when discussing someones acting why bring up a line she delivers when that literally has nothing to do with acting thats on the writers
gameofthrones,removed,lol snow ghost fuckolly d
gameofthrones,removed,campaigning for an award costs a lot of money to the networks thats why only the principal characters are submitted makes more sense for hbo to invest in their bankable stars than tertiary characters if the show had a less sprawling world then a few could be considered to be submitted for lead categories but thats not the case right now even if i would have loved a nom for liam cunningham

gameofthrones,removed,i was talking about the name calling lol i appreciate putting more than seconds of thought into this latest comment though
gameofthrones,removed,what are jonsashippers whenever someone mentions the possibility of sansa and jon marrying there are a responses of eww incest now i know youre just an idiot a troll seeking attention or both at least not on reddit because reddit is the universe and there are clearly never any cross posterslurkerswhat have you between sites also gotasoiaf fans in general arent a dumb audience if practically no fans could pick up then i am clearly a genius and a divine beacon of intuition and intellect far far beyond what even you and the rest of the supposed enlightened scholars of the got fanbase can comprehend how does that does that translate into jon not having the intellect or the savvy that she has per direct sophie quote hes not a redditor™ and clearly sansa is so there you go

gameofthrones,removed,unlimited lives until he meets his purpose its clearly a different purpose than in the books but trust me hell have a purpose at this point probably lshs purpose why bring her back in the books if she doesnt do anything and again why keep beric around and reintroduce him for no reason something book and show wise had to happen with that itll be lsh in the books or itll be the lord of lightening in the show but something has to happen no way they bring back the brotherhood this late without them having something left to do same thing for euron no way dany teams up with yara and theon and they just destroy their uncle euron easily thats the obvious conclusion but its too simple why bring in euron this late for him to be destroyed immediately when frankly they havent built him up to have any chance whatsoever they cut so many seemingly important characters and then they include or reintroduce them this late very few believe me but i think euron is going to outshine all of the previous baddies as the most fucked up and powerful of the villains white walkers aside of course

gameofthrones,removed,had a pretty good life despite being a bastard yeah losing his entire family after living a life being a bastard outcast and getting sent to a prison camp where he has his only love killed in front of him and eventually being killed only to get revived a few moments before a war with the odds is completely easier than getting married to a war lord and using her dragons and her drogo bullshit to become queen
gameofthrones,removed,theyve got my phone greyscaled hold mod on certain subs and shadow ban instantly sneaking into this house stealing things been trying to break my gf and i apart dont even want me speaking been hard for me to play along in this
gameofthrones,removed,rladyboners
gameofthrones,removed,literally all her power was given to her by her name and her dragons she wouldve died once the dothraki left her after drogo died if not for her name and her dragons she wouldnt have been able to free slaves or come to command unsullied without her dragons
gameofthrones,removed,yeah they did both have it rough but jon came from nothing to becoming the king of the north she only fell in love with drogo because she knew he was her ticket to power otherwise she wouldve left if she doubted him i mean its pretty easy to see how jon had it harder since hes basically a front line bastard and dany is just a political viper
gameofthrones,removed,she wouldnt have survived after the drogo horde abandoned her if it wasnt for her name and dragons migo her childhood was rough yeah but jon had it a lot harder during the show family was slain while he was in a prison campharder than being a runaway with an abusive brother lover was slain he was slain revived only to face the odds to point towards his death and now hes the king of the north through his own lucky actions not only by his name unlike dany
gameofthrones,removed,she has paid for everything by her prestigious name and her dragons you know that and i know that jon is only king for his actions everyone knows hes a bastard he had nothing at castle black and now he has everything because of who jon is not because of his last name
gameofthrones,removed,no shit dude im summing it up why would i make a bigger list of points for someone on the internet that obviously gets defensive over his waifu obviously youre not gonna take any opinionated reasoning because youre stuck on her
gameofthrones,removed,in comparison to dany that is literally nothing dude his own achievements and his ability to obtain respect is obviously because of how jon himself is not because of his relation to a stark

gameofthrones,removed,i have some news for you
gameofthrones,removed,i wouldnt even call tywin an antagonist hes just someone who got sucked into doing shitty things because his family was a bunch of idiots except for tyrion tywin was literally sweeping up after his family the whole time he was a cold son of a bitch but in some ways he was never a villain but a victim of circumstance tywin had love for his family and respect for his friends and servants the scenes between him and arya are amazing its not like we are looking at a villain but just an old soldier who is ready to settle down and chill out once and for all he really gets humanized when he talks to her especially when he lets his guard down and says it will be his last war one way or another we all love starks so much that people tend to forget that all is fair in war tywins red wedding was designed to put an end to a futile war sure it killed some of our heroes but was tywin really wrong when he said is it that much worse to kill a few men at dinner than a few thousand on the field
gameofthrones,removed,repost repost repost
gameofthrones,removed,no i clearly remember that one its probably the only argument for him being a true villain besides ordering clegane around to rape and murder things i think this only proves true to the tyrion being a targaryen theory and tywin knowing it if this is true it was tywins only true out for getting rid of tyrion by taking advantage of their justice system
gameofthrones,removed,that was more or less on the boltons and freys had tywin oversaw the operation directly i wouldnt doubt if he gave the stark forces a chance to bend the knee to joffrey and go home quietly he was a smart politician he would have been wise to let them walk i also feel he would be disgusted with roose bolton and walder frey for being such scheming coonts had he actually met them in person especially walder roose was kinda like tywin except a bit more cynical and evil
gameofthrones,removed,a lion does not concern himself with the opinions of sheep
gameofthrones,removed,its a very arguable point but like i said all is fair in war in my opinion its a shared responsibility kinda like unleashing a mad dog which kinda ironically reflects what roose told ramsay right before he got shanked lol
gameofthrones,removed,lololol yes
gameofthrones,removed,was hoping to see the south oark caran clip of him waiting for the wii was slightly dissapointed

gameofthrones,removed,prettier than the real daenerys
gameofthrones,removed,step be attractive
gameofthrones,removed,looks better than emilia and im sure this chick is probably better than her in acting too emilia is by far the worst actress in the show shes not beliveable at all
gameofthrones,removed,id dothraki the shit out of her jk i have no muscle tone
gameofthrones,removed,might be cosplay but this daenerys is better looking
gameofthrones,removed,sansa with the hotness of melisandre perfect combo
gameofthrones,removed,boobs
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,god you cant even see her whole outfit and youre like jesus christ this person is annoying me because im not able to immediately recognize her in a crowd as specifically sansa stark so ill bitch to her on reddit so she knows shes not good enough for my positive opinion she looks exactly like showsansa
gameofthrones,removed,sansa is noted for her breasts in the book multiple times before shes even this could be sansa by the time the series is over
gameofthrones,removed,would bang
gameofthrones,removed,got a lot of sexist comments on here pitiful people
gameofthrones,removed,rnsfw

gameofthrones,removed,tough choices really bed dany just basing it off darrios comments about how she is when fucking wed sansa love them redheads behead margery she looks really good and i dont think shes a bad person just too much kl bullshit to deal with missandei ygritte and that one servant that was with dany in season and cant remember her name but shes hot
gameofthrones,removed,stannis was the one who wanted to rebuild and restaff the towers along the wall he was the only one who wanted to build up the wall the men of the watch were too worried about just maintaining so i guess stannis would be donald
gameofthrones,removed,bed dany bed margaery wed sansa
gameofthrones,removed,bed margaery wed sansa behead daenerys
gameofthrones,removed,can we just remove every single fucking post with the word theory in the title or text jesus fuck
gameofthrones,removed,considering that you seem to believe that there are knife sized pockets in your stomach that hold nothing of importance id say youre the fucking idiot your points are impossible to refute because theres nothing factual about them well maybe the knife didnt hit anything that mattered well maybe her adrenaline was that strong well maybe that canal didnt have anything in it that would cause am infection yeah maybe but its not likely your lack of understanding of this basic idea is fucking pathetic and you sound like a total retard
gameofthrones,removed,i think dany will just be like ok masters we tried doing things the easy way but fuck you all now youre toast
gameofthrones,removed,bed sansa wed ygritte behead cersei
gameofthrones,removed,oh my god your explanation for brienne is hilarious honey could you do the dishes brienne grips oathkeeper and nods solemnly
gameofthrones,removed,bed cersei wed missandei behead yaraasha lets do the littlefinger edition lysa lysa or lysa
gameofthrones,removed,oh fuck off dont do this i swear im going to lose my mind
gameofthrones,removed,less at least grey worm has seen missandei naked but more boners i guess
gameofthrones,removed,all aboard
gameofthrones,removed,yeah it was pretty dumb
gameofthrones,removed,i read somewhere that the original stark sigil is a grey dire wolf running on a white field it was robb who changed it to just the head when he began his campaign
gameofthrones,removed,bed dany wed margaery behead cersei
gameofthrones,removed,i was hoping melisandre would do it but after that reveal i realized she was the evaporator of erections
gameofthrones,removed,but it still has its head are you sure its a stark direwolf
gameofthrones,removed,httpwwwhiyoooocom
gameofthrones,removed,obviously tywin lannister he inherited a massive fortune and had a plethora or opportunities sprout from that fact his family is dumb he had a keen business sense and military understanding and that voice he is the don
gameofthrones,removed,nah next weeks episode will be the largest boner the north has ever seen
gameofthrones,removed,wed sansa bed margaery behead dany lady olenna ser davos tywin lannister
gameofthrones,removed,wed gendry bed jon behead robb
gameofthrones,removed,good thing hes a targaryen
gameofthrones,removed,wed missandei bed ygritte behead melissandre shes old af
gameofthrones,removed,the head is often depicted on its own as ned had his chopped off and robb was paraded with his dire wolf as his head it is known
gameofthrones,removed,daenerys is like im like might be fun to bed just to try it but too short for marriage sansa wins that one shes the only one whos not tiny we wouldnt look ridiculous next to each other that leaves margery for beheading im fine with that she seems like the most drama
gameofthrones,removed,this is totally going to happen now
gameofthrones,removed,bed
gameofthrones,removed,i always thought it was interesting that ned was like fuck it kill them and jon was the one who got them to keep them and now hes got one of possibly two surviving wolves
gameofthrones,removed,seeing as how pod was not listed as the obvious choice for f gendry m robb k jon hes annoying but hell come back anyway so you can decide again
gameofthrones,removed,cant help but think that truncating their sigil down to just the head of the direwolf has turned out to be a bit of a bad omen for the starks
gameofthrones,removed,bed ros idk if you still remember her wed daenerys ned obara
gameofthrones,removed,well the city is mainly defended by unsullied right those guys are clueless thats why they still fight with long spears in close combat in hallways and shit or how they ran like security on the opening day of their controversial fighting pit or how their commander and adviser to the queen still goes on patrols
gameofthrones,removed,wed dany bed marg ned sansa i cant believe nobodys wiring dany
gameofthrones,removed,you must be thinking that g ned stark will be the king p
gameofthrones,removed,you cant blame him for that hes probably young dumb and full of cum
gameofthrones,removed,wed sansa damn i love me that redhead bed dany i wanna ride the dragon too ned margery i cant stand that smug b¦÷©h cersci melisandre and ellaria sand
gameofthrones,removed,neither is anyone else yet it will end up being someone
gameofthrones,removed,bed ser arthur dane that sword fight toj was fookin hawt well up until he got stabbed in the back wed oberyn because he was a good dude behead gregor clegane cuz he crushed my husbands head like a melon
gameofthrones,removed,source
gameofthrones,removed,dang
gameofthrones,removed,sea cat clearly being cat fish meaning blackfish is resurrected in catelyns place
gameofthrones,removed,he meant it as in battle not the family
gameofthrones,removed,they needed proof that the lannisters were behind it of course now we know that they had nothing to do with it so ned would have never found evidence against them
gameofthrones,removed,there was no proof and her sister wasnt the most reliable source of information we eventually discover that littlefinger was involved as well but it is good to question the whole matter since it is what started the downfall of the starks and baratheons was littlefinger hoping ned would die as a result so that he could court cat
gameofthrones,removed,wed sansa she seems like the least pain in the ass out of the options behead daenerys and while a tough choice its made mostly because id like to deflower margaery heres a redhead conundrum for you sansa stark ygritte melisandre
gameofthrones,removed,yeah and i bet back in the it probably sounded glorious to do a christmas special revolving around star wars with the main cast and thats how we ended up with interspecies vr wookie pornso be careful what you wish for
gameofthrones,removed,bed tyene the bad pussy sand wed ygritte ned myranda
gameofthrones,removed,saaaame
gameofthrones,removed,bed margaery wed dany fookin dragons behead sansa
gameofthrones,removed,pretty much ned couldnt believe that roberts wife would be so cruel so he traveled to kings landing to investigate further and protect his friend when he discovered the truth that jon arryn died for he wentto the queen first so she could leave before he told robert but she didnt he let her manipulate everyone around him against the starks it was worsened when caitlin took things in her own hands plus it didnt help that an assassin was killed in front of her making her believe that it was the lannisters the problem was neither of the attempts were by the lannisters lysa arryn killed jon arryn and joffrey sent the assassin jaime did push bran off the tower though
gameofthrones,removed,its infinitely better than losing the full package he can piss so he can obviously cum would just have to get used to prostate simulation gotta work with what you got
gameofthrones,removed,dont tell me what i was doing you were trolling do something bruh
gameofthrones,removed,while i can see where youre coming from there is a difference between being left for dead and having multiple characters exclaim how they saw the body i kinda liked the offscreen deaths as in blackfish and stannis case it depicted the realities of war not every commander goes out with a bang in some epic fight scene with slow mo dismemberent sometimes they just die id argue that the blackfishs death scene was when he drew his sword and climbed the steps we didnt need to see the aftermath of soldiers were in his castle i have doubts he couldve killed many before being overwhelmed
gameofthrones,removed,yeah this episode screamed budget savings from all those important deaths not shown to drogons presence only being shown through him stomping on a roof ah well at least were in for a huge bang
gameofthrones,removed,kevan is doing an incredible job they could show this better though in the books he eventually had to be murdered by varys because he was so good at managing the realm that he was undoing all cerseis shit and was getting in the way of varys plot to re throne a targaryen
gameofthrones,removed,i really wish there were less dumb comments here
gameofthrones,removed,made no sense made me feel utterly stupid made me feel disrespected narcissistic butt hurt is clearly the majority voter here you made me say that
gameofthrones,removed,these last two though ill need to see a doctor about my erection
gameofthrones,removed,agreed this is why hes going to die super soon
gameofthrones,removed,nsfw
gameofthrones,removed,i just want more of that bad poossey
gameofthrones,removed,even theon could manage an erection for the next episode though
gameofthrones,removed,i always looked at this as a sign theyre both strongly connected to lyanna stark if we look at r l j then jon is related arya on the other hand is referred to as looking similar and having a similar personality so yeah i always think of these connections to lyanna though unknown by the characters as creating a bond nonetheless
gameofthrones,removed,looks like all that dagger can do is show some boobies
gameofthrones,removed,after sansa and theon escaped winterfell ramsay sent his hounds after them to track them down they had just caught up to sansa and theon when brienne and pod showed up to rescue them and during the fight the dogs seemed to disappear
gameofthrones,removed,id make a case for season apart from a few writing issues ive found it really enjoyable
gameofthrones,removed,is it wrong to say the best part of the dorne storyline was tyenes tits
gameofthrones,removed,is this legit can somebody confirm this
gameofthrones,removed,because its stated in the books that it was joffrey
gameofthrones,removed,man the hype is getting the better of me
gameofthrones,removed,jon snow stands alone not alone vale soldiers petyr pulls a gandalf
gameofthrones,removed,actually the spoilers suggest that jon does know about the vale forces and is trying to buy time but is provoked into an early attack because ramsay kills rickon in front of them all at the end of the battle he apparently says youre late to sansa and the vale forces i am not sure how accurate these are but i could see this being the case also if jon does go into this battle being completely surprised by the vale forces swooping in to save them then that is sansas mishap jon never had the time or the resources to gain a larger army before this battle time was running out who was he supposed to turn to they sent out letters to all of the northern houses and only got a few replies his chance of gaining any more northern support was all but dashed unlike sansa he also had no indication of being able to gain access to tully or vale troops give the guy some slack and again at this stage comparing jon as a military commander to robb is pointless due to the unequal circumstances between them
gameofthrones,removed,looking at the date of when this was written march i think this is legiti mean by that time we didnt even know we will have a bastarbowlmany things he mentioned are in fact true like the lf saving the day jon being really outnumbered rickon being ramsays captivejust wow
gameofthrones,removed,yeah but boobs
gameofthrones,removed,jon drogo
gameofthrones,removed,khal drogo danaerys on their wedding night but the book version the tv version was not authentic to the book imo
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,theon ramsay
gameofthrones,removed,samgilly it was just so genuine awkward and sweet
gameofthrones,removed,i feel your critique is reasonable game of thrones has become a point of pride i want it to go down in history like lotr as opposed to the hobbit i understand budget constraints and such but there is such a fan force behind got they could almost open a kickstarter and ask for donations because the frenzy is real i want it to be the best it can be
gameofthrones,removed,i dont likebuy into brienne and tormund as a couple
gameofthrones,removed,and as a result of those conclusions cat consistently makes very very bad decisions throughout the books and show in the books shes the one pressuring ned to go to kings landing instead off maester luwin she kidnaps tyrion on a lark practically starting the entire war she sets jaime free driving a bigger wedge between rob and his armies trusts walder frey lol hates on jon snow we all know what really going on there and coddles and accommodates robs wife who she should loathe for totally ruining his plans
gameofthrones,removed,the shorthaired snake just randomly flashing her tits was a nice touch
gameofthrones,removed,i started rewatching and had to stop because i knew how the characters were going to fuck up i just got to jon not killing ygrette and i just turned it off my list were not telling robert up front he could have said jaime and people wouldnt have flinched instead of saying cersei becoming the hand taking tyrion not telling jon about his mom before going to the wall robert hasnt seen ned for ten years after robert became king im sure jon didnt want to wait ten years not killing ygrette telling cersei and no one else about the her and jaime at first not telling robert about cersi and jaime and not having a witness during the final will scene joffrey killing ned means they cant stop the war rodrick taking all of winterfells troops during a war to help another keep jon taking the back after finding out the wall was just a bunch of criminals he was there by choice and could have walked away just so much to take in i had to stop
gameofthrones,removed,i mean they were nice titties though
gameofthrones,removed,remove the stick from your ass hole and learn to take a joke
gameofthrones,removed,sansa power of dat ass
gameofthrones,removed,this part of the trailer looks too much like that scene from the books
gameofthrones,removed,it is known upvote me too plz
gameofthrones,removed,is daenerys wearing a strapon in this scenario
gameofthrones,removed,as a quick thought because your post is quite long i agree that there will be multiple saviors i believe that is what is being conveyed to us with the various tales of the long night each region attributed the end of the long night to the actions of a different savior either the one most proximate to them or through some evolution of the story as it was passed down over thousands of years additional interesting thought there are a half dozen or more iterations of the duality rhllor v great other drowned god v storm god maidenmadeoflight v lion of night etc there are only three alternative religious hierarchies the old gods of the first men the folk gods of the rhoynar and the seven of the andals of them weve seen that the old gods are just some sort of vast collective guided by one or more greenseers and were told that the folk gods of the rhoynar engaged in a secret song to turn back the long night however the andals who should unquestionably have been hit by the long night make absolutely no reference to it theirs is the only tradition free of the long night final interesting thought because i see someone mention nissa nissa nissa nissa was a blood sacrifice and the story of azor ahai while a story of forging is not the story of forging iron it is the story of forging valyrian steel why there are two indicators the first is the number of times were told the metal is folded azor ahai goes bronze then iron then steel ned confirms this for us by telling us that ice was folded times in its forging and it should be obvious by now that blood sacrifice is the key component in all the most powerful magics people get caught up on the willing nature of nissa nissas sacrifice and im inclined to believe the willing sacrifice imparts even greater power than the unwilling sacrifice but so much of that story is just fluff nissa nissa is a blood sacrifice
gameofthrones,removed,good one sport i guess thats the sort of language one resorts to when they have nothing of value to say grow up

gameofthrones,removed,in my experience americans think racismbigotry towards mexicans is quite hilarious i was creating something on rvexillology for someone a mexican for the mexican empire and the comments on imgur were all taking the piss out of mexico and their people
gameofthrones,removed,what difference would it make go to a latin american country and youll find people not only making this same joke but dropping gringo jokes like theres no tomorrow
gameofthrones,removed,ice boners
gameofthrones,removed,of course she shouldnt bang daario she should bang poor jbear instead and catch greyscale and die
gameofthrones,removed,they all say you know nothing jon snow i know this because im a genius
gameofthrones,removed,maybe read whats already posted on reddit before coming up with this major theory of yours
gameofthrones,removed,the last we heard of the stormlands they joined to stanniss cause when he attacked kings landing right then they lost stannis fled and its probably assumed that the storm lords knelt to the crown since stannis had such a small force when he sailed north its hard to say what dd will since there are so little houses from the stormlands that have been mentioned in the show dd may just end up giving the stormlands to house tyrell and introduce a character like mathis rowan to become lord of storms end if not the stormlands could be involved in the olenna tyrellmartell conspiracy we saw i cant remember if it was an actual conspiracy or not i zoned out when we came back to dorne ugh and theyll yield it to dany shrugs
gameofthrones,removed,dany might land there its probably pretty torn to shit with stannis and renly dead and their armies scattered and banners either with the lannisters or dead or in the north
gameofthrones,removed,i just checked out the rest of the products and they look hq so i purchased some i really look forward to them coming
gameofthrones,removed,i got mine from here httpswwwuniqueteeshopcomcollectionsgameofthronesteamcollection
gameofthrones,removed,ok culturally i could give you if daenarys takes over because they only just now got their first queen in westeros so perhaps females in power become a little more common politically depends on if the daenarys instituting a parliament theories are right which i dont really see
gameofthrones,removed,you should have a spoiler tag they will take your stuff down if you dont just a heads upi enjoy reading theories people come up with and wouldnt ever discourage anybody from doing it having said that its confirmed that jons father is g rhegar targaryan that pretty much puts an end to the jon snow parentage theories
gameofthrones,removed,or you know go into the past warg into jaime bang cersei then not push himself out of the window

gameofthrones,removed,connor mcgregor appears to be going to make an appearance in the following got seasons comments opinions concerns what character do you think he will play a free folk an iron born or aegon who would you rather him fight he already sparred the mountain irl ps sorry for the horrible quality of the post i am new to reddit feel free to give criticism
gameofthrones,removed,i heard that the tunnels under the main area where the bird spy lead to comet pizza
gameofthrones,removed,hehe my dad ruined the series for me i was on the pilot and he walked in the room and said what are you watching i said game of thrones and he said oh i saw that it was cool until the king got his head cut off thanks pops i just started the series
gameofthrones,removed,i watched the series over the summer and the only thing i had spoiled cant blur on mobile so putting this to get your attention was that jon snow ended up dying so throughout the entire show i was just waiting for it to happen thought it was going to happen a couple different times but when it finally did it still took me by surprise good thing though is that i was not spoiled as to what happened in with him so it was a great surprise
gameofthrones,removed,well they say you hear what you want to have sex with your sister
gameofthrones,removed,all men must die
gameofthrones,removed,feelthebern lmao
gameofthrones,removed,hopefully he doesnt end up regretting it like those bernie stickers

gameofthrones,removed,kill ur self pls faggit
gameofthrones,removed,bang my sisters before everything else im a simple kind of man
gameofthrones,removed,yeah and we could start by roasting shireen baratheon
gameofthrones,removed,damn hes handsome
gameofthrones,removed,its making me uncomfortable how handsome he is
gameofthrones,removed,i wanna see too
gameofthrones,removed,convincing him that rl j would not be hard imo convincing him that he should take up the claim for the iron throne would probably be much harder but i think it could be done appeal to his sense of duty he has seen that robert is a shitty ruler and that cersei is a bitch joffrey even more so it is objectively true that he is running the realm into the ground with debt no the realm needs a proper ruler once again the targaryens who are only mad because of all the incest appeal to his sense of vengeance jon has or rather had halfsiblings and a stepmother tell them of what robert baratheon and tywin lannister ordered done to them just because they were dragonspawn appeal to his sense of family we are his family after all during our stay dany and i will treat him just like our own sibling and he will feel like he belongs with us sure hell miss arya and robb but he already gave them up to go to the wall btw we make sure to kidnap him when hes the most dejected eventually varys who we know is working with illyrio mopatis will tell robertcersei about jons presence which will hopefully make them do something stupid like capture ned andor kill him for being a traitor who harboured dragonspawn as as well attempt to capture the sisters varys could help arya out who would never survive in court but keep sansa to cause more reasons for robb to call the banners
gameofthrones,removed,what hurt was davos finding out what happened
gameofthrones,removed,this sounds like a great plan but i see right through it its actually all a set up just so you can bang margery
gameofthrones,removed,han solo dies

gameofthrones,removed,god theon was such a prick any last words old man to fucking sir rodrik cassel while robb said my lord to karstark and jon even said my lord to fucking janos slynt possibly the biggest weaselcoward combo in the series
gameofthrones,removed,rhaenyra targaryen was named heir to the iron throne by her father even though it was after this great counsel this is what caused the dance with dragons and she did in fact become the queen of westeros only for half a year but yeah with danys dragons they wont be denying her although if rhaegar and lyanna got married jon is the rightful heir
gameofthrones,removed,hmmm i would petyr his baelish
gameofthrones,removed,he is a total silver fox is he single uh asking for a friend haha
gameofthrones,removed,she legit just left the group and person she travelled from westeros to bravos just to be with after she walked around on the streets of an unknown place before she could even get in the house she pretty much had to be a maid who washed dead bodies after she got in the house and then went through rigorous training was blinded beaten up constantly and even had to relive her fathers execution multiple times because she was sent to kill someone acting in it she defied the faceless men the first time and didnt kill a man she didnt know and it wasnt like this was a charming man you could convince yourself he was scum if you wantedi forget if they said what he did and if it was bad instead she went and killed meryn fucking trant who killed syrio and also beat her sister with the dull part of his sword on the kings orders even though she didnt see this or know of it he was just the definition of a scumbag with shiny gold armor and a sword in his hand she chose to take out someone she knew was bad for the world over someone who would help her get in with the faceless men which she really wanted at the time obviously she was blinded for this and had to get beat up with a stick by the waif for a while before they gave her her vision back and let her back in we all know what happened with lady crane i dont want to keep writing a summary its just that she turned her back on something she really wanted at one time and worked very hard to be in a position to achieve that goal and she gave it all up not to kill someone else this time but because she couldnt allow herself to murder someone she saw good in she did this knowing they would come after her and it would likely be the person who had been beating her ass nearly everyday she then killed walder frey after she killed his sons and cooked them up to serve to him for dinner the bastard got what he had coming arya let out the necessary darkness in her to take them out shes going to have some dark moments where she may even seem evil during but its going to be because thats what she needs to be what do people think was going through jons mind when he was killing men and then punching the life out of ramsay nobody seems to be questioning if he is going to become darth vader
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,he gets killed after banging shaes brains out dont be slagging tywins dick game thats my boy
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think shes attractive at all

gameofthrones,removed,really i always thought she was kind of and intentionally cast as homely
gameofthrones,removed,is she yet
gameofthrones,removed,shes trying pretty hard
gameofthrones,removed,i dont like how shes showing off her breasts
gameofthrones,removed,how nice a safe space
gameofthrones,removed,reddit is so delusional when it comes to celebrities i get it she is cool and a good actor but if she wasnt a celebrity and i saw her walking down the street i wouldnt give her a second look same with emma watson now let the downvotes flow
gameofthrones,removed,i feel like it is messed up to be into maisie because of how young arya is but in reality she is a month older than me
gameofthrones,removed,racks ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gameofthrones,removed,admit it you would hit that
gameofthrones,removed,cant wait for next season no spoilers
gameofthrones,removed,scary shit
gameofthrones,removed,and a girl has no a man cannot say
gameofthrones,removed,from the article the sheer logistics of staging a battle scene this size was like a battle in and of itself minus the lifedeath thing the creative decisions i make are heavily influenced by simple practical concerns like every time we charge the horses it takes minutes to reset all the fake snow on the field and rub out the horseshoe prints so how many times can we afford to charge the horses each day knowing we need to give time for a reset thats times longer than the actual shot another thing was how to make extras look like when you are shooting in a field where theres just nowhere to hide your shortfall it becomes a bit like a bonkers math equation and finally how do you get these guys riled up enough to run at each other and get covered in mud and stand in the rain and then run at each other again and again for days hours a day without them just telling you to piss off i cant even start to imagine how one can juggle with this crap and preserve his artistic vision hats fucking off to him
gameofthrones,removed,i think he means the scene where drogon comes and rescues her from the arena the shots close up of her on drogons back are a bit cheesy and look like something you would expect from never ending story rather than got
gameofthrones,removed,a man is hard
gameofthrones,removed,i need more nonfrumpy gilly in my life it seems
gameofthrones,removed,the stabbing of meryn trant was spooky
gameofthrones,removed,not a morality contest shes so were good to go
gameofthrones,removed,my friend saw it she downloaded it from extratorrents or extra torrent proxy if u want to see clips u can visit emmycom
gameofthrones,removed,dont get me wrong maisie is extremely pretty but i still picture her as a year old my father instinct just cant handle a revealing dress
gameofthrones,removed,lady brienne looking pretty good too id hit it
gameofthrones,removed,i was thinking about scene where jamie and doran are talking is that in the water gardens
gameofthrones,removed,to be fair it is medieval in setting tywins actions against house reyne and house tarbeck were horrific but if he simply ignored the slights it could be a sign of weakness like many times in history when something goes out of balance tytos lannisters weakness something or someone else tries to right it tywin vs the reynes and the tarbecks and shit ends up getting out of hand kind of like the french revolution in a way not excusing tywins actions but most people has at least once done something that was completely driven by personal grudge he paraded his fathers consort naked because he had a personal grudge against her he had tysha raped because he hated tyrion if it were jaime in tyrions position i dont think tywin wouldve done this tywin is usually a man driven by cold rationality but hes not above losing himself to rage i think the general consensus is to basically not piss him off
gameofthrones,removed,in the show i dont think so i bet jaime will die together with cersei or he will escape grrm world with brienne and in the book if youre speaking of propechy for dany then you should get one from her pov not cerseis the hint of her last romantic partner who might as well end up as her husband is a blue flower growing from a chink in a wall of ice filling the air with sweetness mother of dragons bride of fire some people say its jon i hope not tho because who knows
gameofthrones,removed,nah fuck olly

gameofthrones,removed,robb and only bang talisa not marry and fuck the fuck out of kings landing and show sansa joffs head on a spike
gameofthrones,removed,now do birthday suit dany lol
gameofthrones,removed,yes it contains spoilers it doesnt outright say it but it hints very strongly at the deaths of ned robb and jon
gameofthrones,removed,shes not gonna bone her dads murderer bruh
gameofthrones,removed,got is not based entirely on medeival times who gave you that idea he took inspirations from it but it is not a fictional account of medeival england you are confusing the norms set by religion and the limitations of implementing them read some anteoplogical or subaltern studies about women in medevial times critical thinking is essential in any subject and you need to ask yourself how well were rules implemented and monitored now if youre done with intro to patriarchy ask a got question like will dany and jon bang each other to oblivion jesus
gameofthrones,removed,see bookeuron might actually be able to seduce dany with his big cock we know how she loves good looking people with psychotic tendencies showeuron isnt getting and dragon titties
gameofthrones,removed,lmao youre not feeling it yet youre still here you think im trolling but you keep on coming back if trolling is what you call it then that what youve been doing all this time you see your own actions and you hate it its obvious youre upset because of sansas impending doom still you manage to be entertaining your irrational hate boner for jon snow and blind worship of sansa are hilarious just take comfort that sansas last act is going to be interesting instead of dusting the furniture at winterfell she is the weakest link with her overall dumbness that she has to go before the white walkers arrive at least her death is not going to be off screen although it will be a riot if that happens leaving her heartbroken fans like you raging just like what youre doing right now
gameofthrones,removed,everyone was enjoying his purple face no one noticed cerseis cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,he got ygritte naked so he knows something at least a certain something i wish i knew too
gameofthrones,removed,holy shit i just came
gameofthrones,removed,oh i see you are trolling thanks for the lack of actual valid commentary
gameofthrones,removed,no those movies are awful i do not need explosions i need good writing
gameofthrones,removed,please rewatch the show and read the books
gameofthrones,removed,nicolaj costerwaldau jaime shouldve got it in during his bath scene with brienne hes been a standard and well playing is character from the start than trying to award an actor for finally doing his job by the end of a series ie harrington
gameofthrones,removed,ita
gameofthrones,removed,we know nothing since renley was killed by the shadowbaby
gameofthrones,removed,good question with stannis dead the control of the stormlands likely passes to tommen but with him dead i guess it passes to the crown so the title of lord paramount of the stormlands will be disputed between major houses my pick for new lord would be the head of house estermont since cassana estermont was robert renly and stanniss mother until circe appoints a new one hell maybe the dornish might decide to invade a weakened stormlands to support danys invading force honestly the show will probably forget all about it until they decide if gendry is going to get off the boat or not since hes the last surviving male heir to house baratheon
gameofthrones,removed,probably whoever declares for dany first in the stormlands will be named lord paramount of the stormlands or someone within her forces now could earn that reward i would of thought dhario if he wasnt left behind
gameofthrones,removed,i believe the actress said in an interview that she did say something of note but she couldnt say
gameofthrones,removed,i just figured dany and jon would become strong allies especially since theon feels so bad about everything
gameofthrones,removed,halfman halfman
gameofthrones,removed,grrm sets the tone for jons decision making with robb choosing his heart over his duty by marrying jeynetalisa jon chooses duty over his heart betrays ygritte i disagree jons arc is about aemons words coming full circle love is the bane of honor the death of duty what is honor compared to a womans love what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms or the memory of a brothers smile wind and words wind and words we are only human and the gods have fashioned us for love that is our great glory and our great tragedy jon continuously struggles with these words he does choose duty over love in two cases when he decides to remain true to his vows rather than run away to join robb and then again when he abandons ygritte for the watch however he doesnt prevail sitting at the wall being unable to help his family as they are butchered eats away at him it is subtle because he has grown numb but the inner conflict is there and it surfaces he finally discovers that arya is alive the sibling he was closest too yet she is in danger he can sit back and do nothing like he did with the others or help her this time he has the authority to do something he does it forgetting his duties as lord commander jon flexed the fingers of his sword hand the nights watch takes no part he closed his fist and opened it again what you propose is nothing less than treason he thought of robb with snowflakes melting in his hair kill the boy and let the man be born he thought of bran clambering up a tower wall agile as a monkey of rickons breathless laughter of sansa brushing out ladys coat and singing to herself you know nothing jon snow he thought of arya her hair as tangled as a birds nest i made him a warm cloak from the skins of the six whores who came with him to winterfelli want my bride backi want my bride backi want my bride back i think we had best change the plan jon snow said
gameofthrones,removed,whos that dog its mr peanutbutter

gameofthrones,removed,this is true as well as at least some way to keep an infant from freezing to death on the journey north this implies some source of food thats palatable to infants as well as a source of heat which is what you would not expect from a bunch of undead assholes
gameofthrones,removed,i feel like this wouldve leaked if this was true
gameofthrones,removed,i think she made a mistake not at least letting him tell her he has the knights of the vail at his back or telling jon how she got the info they will need his thousand men even if they manage to rally every northern house
gameofthrones,removed,heres the urban dictionary definition of httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermbrain another word for head or blowjob this term is most appropriate however because unfortuantley most male brains reside in their penile regions that girl has a foot long tongue i bet she gives great brain httpwwwredditcomrautourbanbotwikiindex summon urbanbot what is something

gameofthrones,removed,so the preview for the next episode looks alot like well see coldhands or maybe benjen fingers crossed meera is saying something like sorry bran almost as if she is leaving him but just in the nic of time from season trailer we see a figure on a horse with a flaming flail thingy benjen comes in to save the day lead the two through the wall only to let the white walkers walk right on through because bran is marked also summer dying means that summer has ended winter is coming is here

gameofthrones,removed,theres no evidence just fan theories like the pragmatists said about philosophical thought one does not need philosophy to act one simply acts and philosophy tries to explain one does not need an explanation of hodors timewarp to have cried like a baby at that scene
gameofthrones,removed,нам пиздец to us not мы we
gameofthrones,removed,just watch the full video i go over a lot in the video but it is worth the wait especially if your a fan of the hound
gameofthrones,removed,also if you dont want to listen to me talk for mins just go into the description of the video for the most important stuff
gameofthrones,removed,i could walk up to a guy in the middle of a bridge and throw him off and i wouldnt lose a single vote sounds familiar i could shoot somebody and i wouldnt lose voters im going to build the greatest navy evar im going to get daenerys hand we are going to make the iron islands great again
gameofthrones,removed,yea sorry man i recorded this kinda early so i didnt want to wake up my parents and the music didnt really help lol thanks for the constructive criticism should be fixed if i make another one of these for season
gameofthrones,removed,this is how i feel to his death happened in less that seconds and no one batted an eye albeit bran was going warg and hodor is retarded someone couldve mourned him for a second or two i remember when robs wolf died it was an emotional scene that stressed the importance of the wolf the way summer died makes it seem like he was nothing more than a bodyguard
gameofthrones,removed,could i just edit my title instead of re posting
gameofthrones,removed,hes gwetting some good poosey
gameofthrones,removed,eh the assholes of the forest had it coming
gameofthrones,removed,yeah i do and didnt renly like shut them the fuck down afterwards like yo thats not right you guys are assholes and danced with her or something
gameofthrones,removed,came for the foreshadowing stayed for the cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,if you dont feel like listening to me for mins just check the desc of the video for the spoilers
gameofthrones,removed,was this a subtle reference to the south park nambla episode dudeyou have sex with children anyway i read your comment in kyles voice so the reference wasnt lost on me if it was one
gameofthrones,removed,could be that bran is stuck going from era to era place to place while hes in his warging state and is freaking out about whats going on in present day and hes the whispers the mad king hears maybe desperation on brans part i dont think he has much control right now as far as where his green dream takes him and aerys already being somewhat mad could have just taken that and ran with it
gameofthrones,removed,nope arya will never be no one shes gonna ditch and go back to westeros and get her life back or die trying
gameofthrones,removed,he could die in battle die with more honor than mutiny perhaps i really feel like hes an endgame player though and hes gonna see it through he may die but if he does i dont think it will happen until the very end possibly at the hands of dany but i dont really think that either
gameofthrones,removed,wow your characterization of eurontrump was so on point that it shone through from the very first screenshot with him before spoofing trumps more widely quoted bullshit also zombie movies
gameofthrones,removed,i dont want to see hodor die again
gameofthrones,removed,confused boner
gameofthrones,removed,people disrespecting my boy rhaegar
gameofthrones,removed,tengo duro not i have an erection
gameofthrones,removed,im pretty sure they represent natureenvironmentsplants so probably asexually
gameofthrones,removed,true but i also got to watch martha jones throw a sopping wet dildo on the floor
gameofthrones,removed,i mean i feel like there arent many that arent in the show yet my favourite is telling people that tyrion changes his name to yolo and goes into acting no one ever believes me
gameofthrones,removed,the experience is enhanced when watching with friends who yelled cut back to the titties tho right before it cut to an uncut cock
gameofthrones,removed,well the whole point of bloodraven making him greensee at such an inconvenient time was to sort of upload everything he knows into bran surely that is something that bloodraven would know especially if it has any effect on the events to come kit harrington said that there was an entire episode dedicated to jons story someone had convincing clues that it would be episode i just cant remember their claim at the moment well learn something one way or the other could be that jon finally meets howland reed after the battle never know
gameofthrones,removed,magic
gameofthrones,removed,just put a necklace on it
gameofthrones,removed,you could you know be a man and deal with it but i suppose if you wanted to be a year old girl about it youd have to dl all episodes at least the ones with sex and nudity and cut them out with a program like premiere or something it wouldnt be hard but it would be a bit time consuming but this is something youd have to do yourself because nobody else on the planet has been as much of a weeny about the show as you have regarding the shows slight nudity from time to time cheers
gameofthrones,removed,splinters
gameofthrones,removed,oh without a doubt pregnant or not if she whips those titties out for him shell get his support
gameofthrones,removed,he had that dream in reference to the iron borne the drowned men of the iron islands sacking winterfell js
gameofthrones,removed,thats what i gatherif its living they want it dead
gameofthrones,removed,i think they just want to bring oblivion they see how everythings fucked up with these kingdoms and civilizations and humanity so they want to put it out of its misery they see what life cant see about itself so they do what they believe is moral their only recruit the dead so none will suffer if thats what hes up to and theres no hope for sequels is there then i think the nights king is the guy im rooting for yes hes producing immediate suffering but hes preventing so much more from the future
gameofthrones,removed,theyre like years past the age of consent so i think its ok
gameofthrones,removed,or they could be a metaphor for technology slowly taking over the world destroying our humanity and turning us all into mindless zombies that are completely controlled by our devices
gameofthrones,removed,and bran being torn apart by it because he understood that it was his fault he didnt want it to happen
gameofthrones,removed,the babystabbing had me pretty shook up most all of the killingsdeathsimplied deaths have either mad me angry shocked or somewhat sorrowful the deaths from just down right hurt that death hurt my whole heart i knew i loved the characterbut i didnt realize i loved him that much
gameofthrones,removed,wait what
gameofthrones,removed,wow thats cool hope it turns out to be right because it would be awesome
gameofthrones,removed,all the same every bit of it identical but i teared up and i may have wailed some this show though i really did experience nearly all facets of human emotion i was proud of sansa embarrassed for petyr confused by sansas lie to jon afraid for theon and ashayara angry for arya tickled at tormund shocked at the cotf creating the white walkers and why downright pissed tf off at bran scared downright shitless at the wights coming down the hallway seriously the stuff of nightmares and heartbrokenly sad for hodor and summer thats when you know its an epic show that youre watching its got me right by me heart
gameofthrones,removed,dragonglass though sometimes called obsidian it kills the ww because that is what they are created from
gameofthrones,removed,i think he will help destroy the white walkers in any way that he can both out of fear and for revenge though it was his mistake that caused it all and dany wont fight him because she knows she needs to control her dragons its a winwin nowhow to get bran to the dragons and does he even need to be near them or even discuss what hes doing with dany
gameofthrones,removed,because he wants the frosty threat in the north eliminated
gameofthrones,removed,when ned lost his head we watched all the true justice of westeros die it was like a metaphor the beginning of anarchy ensuing but to break it down would you really want to be the solitary noname guy that called any of these people out on the crazy shit they have done honestly the way ramsay killed roose was merciful compared to the other shit hes done and euronwell he paid the iron price the high sparrow isnt concerned with jaime or his sins because he isnt a pawn in the little game the hs is playing with cersei and the tyrells i really hope we see some justice restored through dany and jon both seem like the types to want to make it all right
gameofthrones,removed,lots of people have mentioned this
gameofthrones,removed,a woman scorned theres no fury like it
gameofthrones,removed,they do this cool thing on tv shows and movies called timelapsing varys even verbally communicated to tyrion that it had been a fortnight two weeks since they made their peace treaty with the masters not sure if theyre all on the same timeline or not but its been at least weeks since last episode
gameofthrones,removed,but dany hasnt proven to be a tyrannical ruler shes still getting her monarchal footing so to speakbut she just wants to avenge her family and rule the seven kingdoms like she feels her family should have been doing shes spent her whole life outrunning people that want to kill her honestly i dont think shes the worst candidate for the throne especially with the right people by her side
gameofthrones,removed,hey there are two things i hate in this world people who are intolerant of other peoples culturesand the dutch
gameofthrones,removed,this has been pitched before many times i havent found one yet that makes sensetheres just too many holes in the theory not trying to be rude also raven is supposed to be brenden targaryen so theres that also
gameofthrones,removed,ive watched it already a couple times how is this any different from stannis or renly they both thought they had given right to the throne and that it was theirs i get that you dont like dany but come on
gameofthrones,removed,its about to heat up stay tuned
gameofthrones,removed,what about sansa
gameofthrones,removed,hodor
gameofthrones,removed,lets see jon snow and robb stark for sure oh and joffery
gameofthrones,removed,well fun question i suppose i think youre missing characters though myranda dead former friend of ramsey doreah dead former friend of dany sansa alive i think by acclamation margaery is on everyones list
gameofthrones,removed,ros
gameofthrones,removed,it was literally because so many people complained about female only nudity there are tons of pointless tits not complaining this just balanced it a little
gameofthrones,removed,you say that like its a bad thingsmall hands and your dick looks huge
gameofthrones,removed,right you are gracias
gameofthrones,removed,i thought this too but how would he fund them
gameofthrones,removed,i hope she just means all the physical damage he did no telling what he rammed up her various ermplaces or how brutally he mutilated her
gameofthrones,removed,this checks out but varys pointed out that the peace treaty with the masters was working for now perhaps euron made a deal with the masters to fund the sons of the harpy
gameofthrones,removed,i hope so
gameofthrones,removed,the internet is very very great for porn
gameofthrones,removed,i will fap away the tears to these awesome titties
gameofthrones,removed,three fires must you light one for life and one for death and one to love first drogos funeral pyre second killing khals third dragon fire to cure jorah third seems too obvious but daenerys has been sort of cliché quite a few times
gameofthrones,removed,three fires must you light one for life and one for death and one to love first drogos funeral pyre second killing khals third dragon fire to cure jorah third seems too obvious but daenerys has been sort of cliché quite a few times
gameofthrones,removed,we should be supporting every chance that our fellow kingsguard member has to bang someone other than his sister
gameofthrones,removed,house umber i think are playing ramsay im hoping its a trap of some kind
gameofthrones,removed,and he will as soon as he gets to the wall after benjen helps him and meera well see lyanna whisper something to ned and we probably wont get to hear what she says then well see baby jon then the scene will end and cut to present day jon just a guess
gameofthrones,removed,confirmed benjen helps them reach the wall before disappearing again
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think were going to see the white walkers again this season could possibly come to fruition next season though
gameofthrones,removed,benjen helps them
gameofthrones,removed,this has been said multiple times and its asinine
gameofthrones,removed,also cant wait to see tommens weak ass suicide
gameofthrones,removed,or jaime assumingly kills the blackfish and takes the army and refuses to march north despite briennes pleas
gameofthrones,removed,possibly i think it was just enough to push aryas limits at any rate i dont think she will kill the actress and sexy jesus is going to tell the bitch waif to kill her and arya will finally prove that she finally is ready by beating the waifs face in so while the play could be poking fun its actually really important in the speeding up of aryas story
gameofthrones,removed,bran will visit the tower of joy scene one final time just as he reaches the wall and we will get the answer we all want
gameofthrones,removed,possible but it wont be this season
gameofthrones,removed,welltommen wont be using his sword in that battle and possibly not any othersso his doesnt do much good
gameofthrones,removed,amazing job alsocould you make me a latte please
gameofthrones,removed,its not porn its hbo
gameofthrones,removed,arya will refuse to kill the actress the wait will be given permission to kill arya well find out that maybe arya is ready after all then she will manage to escape braavos and go back to westeros hopefully with needle also valaryan steelgood for killing white walkers it is known
gameofthrones,removed,theres also this to consider theres the dagger that the paid hitman tried to kill bran with it was valaryan steel if i remember right and wasnt aryas needle
gameofthrones,removed,ahh okay couldnt remember
gameofthrones,removed,good because its happening lol
gameofthrones,removed,to beat euron to the punch on the whole fleet of ships for dany thing
gameofthrones,removed,i assume butt stuff
gameofthrones,removed,i think hes actually sorry and despite her dismissing him he still wants to right his wrong so i think the vales army will march in and save the day at the snowbowlbastardbowl
gameofthrones,removed,i see what you did there
gameofthrones,removed,i was thinking according to the book it is incredibly traumatic for a warg if the animal whose mind they have entered dies while they are controlling it bran needed hodor to hold that door until his death to buy them enough time but himself being warged into hodor whilst he dies would be a terrible possibly mindbreaking experience so to not risk himself he uses wylis as a conduit reaching hodor but not really being inside him as he dies wylis takes that blow instead
gameofthrones,removed,i know when i was a kid i used to watch a cycle of classic and not so classic movies at midnight all with spanish dubs weird really weird like some translations la máquina de follar sounds so weird for latin americans
gameofthrones,removed,redbubble and teepublic are both fairly good for selling art prints so long as you dont tag your work with gotbased tags stuff isnt likely to get taken down which is normally as far as copyright stuff goes you wont sell a ton but it will allow people on here to buy your art if you link to it there is no sweeter feeling with regards to scaling issues vectors are my favourite thing and would probably work quite well with your style of stuff
gameofthrones,removed,left one i cum in that butt middle one i cum in that butt right one i cum in that butt thanks
gameofthrones,removed,go to natureboxcom and use the codeword rogan to get off thats naturebox not natures box as that website is about a girl called nature
gameofthrones,removed,thanks to httphodorrewardscomrewardsphp
gameofthrones,removed,meera and jon could be siblings what if rl j but it was twins howland reed and ned both took one
gameofthrones,removed,good i dont want a yucky yicky gay man touching my door
gameofthrones,removed,nah way to feminist
gameofthrones,removed,it seems like sansa got there sort of fast but the point i think is that going by escorted carriage is fast as shit horseback alone is decently fast and horsebackwalkboat is slow and walking is lord of the rings trilogy
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,goes in one hole and cums out another
gameofthrones,removed,do you actually believe thats a real word its stupid and anyone that uses it in a nonsatirical way is an idiot
gameofthrones,removed,him being the root of everything just wasted years of story development and makes this show just another convoluted time travel story do you feel the same way about hodor bran cant change the past everything he is going to do already happened how is that wasting years of story development
gameofthrones,removed,rickon gets shot by arrows
gameofthrones,removed,i dont want dany take westeros theres enough madness and death without her
gameofthrones,removed,how could it possibly be the greyjoys
gameofthrones,removed,well a man didnt specify the pool from which the next face would be drawn a vague disclaimer is nobodys friend
gameofthrones,removed,hodor didnt make a valiant sacrifice if it was up to hodor he wouldnt have done anything bran mindfuck warged him and forced him to plant himself in front of that door
gameofthrones,removed,more titties less titles
gameofthrones,removed,something something bad poossy
gameofthrones,removed,test
gameofthrones,removed,a dick with warts really elevated the episode
gameofthrones,removed,please explain why this is fitting has one of the best lines areo to jaime when you were whole it would have been a good fight
gameofthrones,removed,i was wandering why that episode was so low so i looked at the synopsis trystan and myrcella romance sandsnakes fight sansa and ramseys wedding ahok then
gameofthrones,removed,badpoosi
gameofthrones,removed,that episode scarred hold the door in every fans heart for the rest of our lives
gameofthrones,removed,nope we all cared about the dogs or the cats
gameofthrones,removed,i suspect it will be a bit anticlimactic at first i was really hopeful that the tyrell army signified a major clash in the capital but i think it will be a bit blueballish theyll start out all dramatic with jaime on his horse and what not but margaery will probably be playing the long con by pretending to atone for the sake of loras so the tension will defuse and everyone will kind of go home
gameofthrones,removed,bawwwww we want arya to do something other than play sticks with the waif goes to muder someone has emotional journey watching play about her father and sister bawww nothing happening in emotional character study jesus it had tits and cock too
gameofthrones,removed,hardhome was definitely my favorite just that stand off at the end lets us all know the real threat and it has nothing to do with the petty wars of the kingdoms
gameofthrones,removed,like what maybe it flew over my head but the only significance is that ayra is still hurting from neds head being chopped off what did i miss
gameofthrones,removed,it was an important episode with taking all the moving parts coalescing them and giving them direction the women are in charge dany on her crusade maya with her fleet that dany has use for arya getting sort of free from the nonames sansa is making the decisions for jon and building her army she also told off littlefinger getting free from him
gameofthrones,removed,i think everyones just overemotional and biased because of the doublewhammy of losing both hodor and summer
gameofthrones,removed,i think it wouldve done wonders for the ratings if the final scene before cutting to black was from hodor pov with a wight pointing a bat at his face
gameofthrones,removed,clegenebowl will happen in the they will fight on drogons back while he torches kings landing as that happens jon has to retreat back south to kl with the ww chasing them then the dothraki will have to fight the ww while danys taking back kl with the unsullied cause thats all she cares about as thats happening tyrion will crashland somewhere in kl with an electric guitar and the pick of destiny he will summon all the dead characters with the sweet sound of metal so they can help in the fight
gameofthrones,removed,didnt read books but i have to admit it really was one of the best episodes i have seen so far when i saw how the white walkers were created the night king touching bran and beginning to enter the cave after i was totally excited and my jaw already started dropping but when it came to the end scene i really lost it it was so sad and a real heartbreaker and made me shed tears for the kind giant hodor who just moments before talked about breakfast with meera seeing the implications of brans warging into young wylis and meanwhile watching hodor holding the door and closing the circle was one of the most brilliant scenes in the whole series and showed the competence of the producers aswell as the actors to be honest maybe it would have been a mediocre episode if only died we the ihaventreadthebookspeople didnt grow too close to him anyway imagine they all escaped safely again the fact that hodors past and future destiny was revealed the very last minutes of this episode made it so special for me because it still keeps me thinking and reading through this subreddit
gameofthrones,removed,yeah it seems like its going to feature the battle for the north and the producers and actors have all been extremely optimistic about how it turned out really hyped
gameofthrones,removed,explosions and a white walker getting destroyed oh wait that also happened this episode
gameofthrones,removed,kissed by fire jamie tells brienne his backstory and hound vs dondarion imo two of the scenes i was looking forward to the most and they were executed about as good as you could ask for fuck everyone else i give that episode an fuckers
gameofthrones,removed,its been a long time since i saw the one with the red wedding and i know a lot more about asoiaf today however i think the door is the best episode ive ever seen so far even better than hardhome the action was insane the ending was so incredibly sad but yet very beautiful and varys face talking to the priestese was just priceless memes appear here there and everywhere
gameofthrones,removed,its a full but i poured out for my fallen homie hodor
gameofthrones,removed,he is like a bizarro bernie
gameofthrones,removed,number of kicks in the nuts without payoff that is what makes so good set up had to happen for the pay off to be satisfying i dont think jonxsansa meet up have had much of an impact without all the shit they went through neither would all this lead up to the battle for the north
gameofthrones,removed,for the lazy here are the top with rating rains of castamere red wedding hardhome jon co vs ww jon kills a ww the door hodorrrr the lion and the rose purple wedding joffreys death the laws of gods and men tyrions trial
gameofthrones,removed,i think it was a great episode but there are lots of those what put it over the top for me was the emotional gravitas of the last few minutes and finding out hodors backstory at the same moment of his sacrifice this also goes handinhand with the after hearing dd talk stunning knowledge that grrm had hodors backstory and fate planned from the beginning on one hand given some of the earlier revelations notably littlefinger and lysas actions to start the whole series off hodors name shouldnt have been such a big surprise but i was stunned in that moment from a show where ive been stunned a handful of times there are times where i feel like i can expect it when it continues to happen it seems fair that the author and producers deserve that much more credit
gameofthrones,removed,unfortunately on the eve of the battle of winterfell ramsey bolton contracts cholera and dies in his bed jon sansa simply walk into winterfell cut to black s
gameofthrones,removed,he hides behind sanctimony while practicing selective enforcement some bad people get slaps on the wrist but when its cersei she gets paraded through the streets
gameofthrones,removed,where do you think theon is going with yara
gameofthrones,removed,meanwhile the red woman is bottom not sure if its caused by disappearing dogs shitty dornish plot or century age boobs
gameofthrones,removed,found a good explanation so bran wargs into hodor — but crucially he does it while hes still observing the past bran is watching the past and controlling hodors body in the present at the same time that appears to have created a psychic link between past hodor and present hodor we see past hodors eyes go white which is what happens when bran seizes control past hodor hears meera reed yelling hold the door through the link which he starts repeating he eventually shortens this to hodor and that becomes the only thing he can say for the rest of his life after that eventfrom
gameofthrones,removed,you should definitely slip a couple of let me hold the door or could you please hold the door here and there just enough to make him recognize but not enough that he could make any connection not that i think there is any risk of anyone making that connection beforehand and than he will think back of your foreshadowing thinking that sonofabitch
gameofthrones,removed,that could certainly be argued and i cant easily come up with another string of episodes quite like that however i dont think a stretch of great episodes at the end of a season chained together makes up for a very lackluster episodes through all of which are ranked in the lowest per imdb ratings and of those are ranked in the bottom episodes of the series i can vividly remember being very excited for season and midway through the season feeling just a bit empty with the results by the end of it i was back on the excitement train but most of that was with how those last episodes built up to whats coming next in season even the end of season as good as it ended up turning out finished on a note of jon snow dying in a show where death is supposed to mean something this was the death that ended up counting the least in a sense almost nobody thought jon was actually going to stay dead at this point in season aside from a slow introductory episode every episode has been very exciting with some incredibly poignant moments and huge reveals
gameofthrones,removed,i guess people really hated the dorne episodes and i can easily see why there are a lot of valid reasons to hate them but i enjoyed them anyway elliara sand interests me i like that oberyns death has consequences and i even liked the bright colors i can see why people like the sparrow stuff too its not uninteresting i do like learning about the religion i just dont particularly enjoy it not for the greatest reasons i like loras and margaery and id rather see them doing well or at least in a less bleak situation things have gotten slightly more hopeful now though
gameofthrones,removed,season also had some pretty bad acting and storytelling dorne was a total waste of time the sand snakes were awful stannis story was rushed and poorly executed sansa had a lot of her character development hindered by going back to winterfell and we basically had a whole lot of nothing going on for the first episodes which they tried to rectify by sloppily and pointlessly killing off barristan selmy contrast to season which i feel is a lot better because each plot line save for aryas is progressing in a fluid manner and each scene feels like its necessary for the progression of the overall story for instance contrast hodors death with barristans hodors death had actual real emotional weight and was very well done in execution whereas barristans death was basically pointless poorly done and thrown in to make the season less boring season has cut down on useless plot lines and cheesy exposition except for the sand snakes in episode
gameofthrones,removed,what are you even talking about i was pretty sure i already explained it apologies if i was unclear if you believe that all sinners must atone you dont arbitrarily make some suffer severe punishments walking through the streets naked while condemning others to solitary confinement until you want to use them to break the will of their sister while letting other known sinners walk free hypocrisy is the act wherein one maintains an image of goodness and fairness while actually indulging in more basic and ordinary motivations like personal interest also known as exactly what the sparrow gives all indications of doing i think the issue here is that you have no concept of what hypocrite means beyond being a negative word you like to ascribe to religious characters youre wrong
gameofthrones,removed,i just wish it had more i still dont fully believe that arya is ready to give up her identity and individuality she was clearly bothered by the scene and it wouldve been nice to see something extra like her fidgeting or growing increasingly uncomfortable
gameofthrones,removed,the viper and mountain fight scene was amazing but i was sad they left out one of my favourite quotes from the book series tyrion tells oberyn my life is in your hands at the end when oberyn is killed i believe the passage goes like this i put my life in the red vipers hands and he dropped it when he remembered too late that snakes have no hands tyrion began to laugh hysterically this is my favourite passage that i wish it had been put in the episode
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think its that greatespecially what happened with this past season just lack luster writing poor direction and the same gimmicky wide angle lens shots minute music videos in the middle of an episode to pad it out etc a lot of the recent criticism of the show is pretty on point i loved the first season but this season was a big huh the entire time hopefully the turn it around next season but telling a bbbetter call saul fan that their show is not perfect and amazing and beautiful is like talking to a wall
gameofthrones,removed,because op keep lurking around nsfw subs and not this got sub
gameofthrones,removed,i think its how they mostly avert and betray audience expectations ie presenting ned as the primary character and then killing him off to drive the point home that anybody can die as well as the details grrm has put into this world for the books theres also the method of storytelling using various characters points of view which are overall unreliable and not just an omniscient narrator that would reveal important details that would take people time to figure out such as arstan whitebeard being ser barristan or ser robert strong being gregor clegane

gameofthrones,removed,except in hitlers case its the opposite ofc also if germany won its not sure europe would be overrun by world subhumans at this very moment bet you are american aswell blaming germans etc for stuff when fact is your country is responsible for like of everything bad thats going on in the world maybe more if you count your culture
gameofthrones,removed,honestly a green tower of stairs would not have been too difficult by todays got standards but especially on season budget i can see why making an intricate digital model of the iron throne would have been a problem that and framing the one sitting on the throne and whoever theyre addressing at the same time would have been an absolute bitch
gameofthrones,removed,heh maybe its the years i spent taking psych classes before i decided to go into it instead this qualifying me as totally not a shrink but i think of myself as onebut im constantly looking for the real underlying meaning behind peoples negative actions so that i can better understand them its actually improved my worldview a lot the world seems like a much nicer place when you assume everyone is battling their own demons rather than just shitting on stuff for the sake of it that guy isnt really a jerk hes just insecure about his weight and thats how he deals with it oh well now im not angry i just wanna go give him a hug
gameofthrones,removed,you did too

gameofthrones,removed,gerrymandering is i think a pretty important thing in american politics atm
gameofthrones,removed,i dont get his point because there is no gerrymandering for the us senate everybody in a state has equal say when voting for their us senator gerrymandering is irrelevant
gameofthrones,removed,keep your politics out of this sub nobody gives a fuck
gameofthrones,removed,from here can confirm
gameofthrones,removed,when they send wildlings to westeros theyre not sending their best theyre sending rapists and thieves
gameofthrones,removed,the entire handling of the aryas visit to the house of black and white has been done poorly in the book there is no conflict between the waif and herself they didnt even show where aryas blindness makes her ability to warg stronger

gameofthrones,removed,honestly imo reddit is too overmoderated i understand moderating spoilers even though its ridiculous to have an enormous chart of spoiler tags because anyone that reads the chart will immediately get spoiled defeating the entire purpose but content as well casual reddit users like myself who come on here very infrequently will come on after a crazy episode like the last one and maybe post something stupid about hodor and immediately have a moderator removing the comment because its overposted or something sorry not all of us read reddit all the time and know what is or isnt overposted tldr most reddits this one included have a million rules or even soft rules like dont talk about overposted topics that people wont know unless they are seriously invested very unfriendly to infrequent reddit users

gameofthrones,removed,also from alabama while there are lots of racist people here there are also a lot of people i know that arent racist im guessing theres lots of similar situations in different states and rural versus city or suburban environments as well my husbands extended relations that live out in the country have a lot of super racist people in their family example at a family get together at the hunting camp i asked a girl i didnt know what the name of her adorable little puppy was her response little nier i was floored and didnt know what to say we try to avoid that part of the family as much as possible
gameofthrones,removed,like itslarger no thats not it
gameofthrones,removed,it wont be just one man as the show likes to keep episode titles as open for interpretation as much as possible it would be a number of people theon yaraasha knows that he was broken as reek but now that they are together shes pretty much helping him get his mojo back edmure hes pretty much broken from being kept in the frey dungeons since the red wedding if youve read jamies chapters from affc youll know what happens to edmure its very clever politics from jaime winning back riverrun without shedding any blood sandor clegane i hope we see him tommen being broken by the high sparrow and margery

gameofthrones,removed,actually the full quote you had best run back to your room little sister septa mordane will surely be lurking the longer you hide the sterner the penance youll be sewing all through winter when the spring thaw comes they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers people forget the first part of what jon said just before that often quotesd line about being frozen with needle in her hand jon warned her to stop hiding or the rest of that quote will happen right now arya is doing exactly what jon predicted and is hiding her true self behind no one and the faceless men order if she truly became no one her fate of being found frozen with needle will likely come true but if arya chooses to stop hiding grrm also foreshadowed a different future for arya that even she doesnt see coming it will definitely be a holy shit moment for the fanbase considering how many of you guys think she will not live passed this series when it concludes
gameofthrones,removed,i honestly feel that his dad wouldve been a trump supporter irl
gameofthrones,removed,that would explain why they casted the mad king without a beard as opposed to the books the opening flashes bran has shows jamie killing the mad king but also shows him walking towards the throne sword drawn which is inconsistent with the story by not giving the mad king a beard the lack of beard in the silhouette of jamie killing someone in the throne room gives no clear identity to the victim just a theory
gameofthrones,removed,even when i can watch it legally on my parents house i still dont do it because of the risk of them thinking im watching porn not hbo

gameofthrones,removed,milf
gameofthrones,removed,jaqen hghar is a familiar face the head priest of the house of black and white is wearing to train arya she is naturally a good assassin so they want to keep her the jaqen hghar we met in westeros is still in westeros he may or may not come back up in the show but he is definitely out and about in the books aryas movements in the house are very limited so there could be others we simply do not see in the books there are many other acolytes they are only showing two in the show to convey a specific atmosphere the waif is also in training just at a different stage she is showing avarice and jealousy so the kindly man braavosi jaqen hghar is sending her on a mission he knows she cannot complete a mission to kill arya stark there is no reason for arya to die showing mercy is actually the foundation of the faceless men but if the waif wants to kill arya for personal reasons even before she quit thats no good yes arya did kill meryn fuckin trant but this is early in the training before she lost her identity presumably the waif is past that point in training and still wants to kill people for slight personal offenses
gameofthrones,removed,oh yeah i guess jamie will meet brienne again it did happen in the book but only right before the end of the book
gameofthrones,removed,there is a literal cleganebowl in this picture
gameofthrones,removed,i hated dany scenes before it was cool
gameofthrones,removed,what if she took that girls place
gameofthrones,removed,none of this contained a lot in the way of action scenes some people really just want the big epic wartype scenes like they expected when the tyrell army approached the sparrows when it all shortcircuited they were left with blue balls im with you but thats why many are hating on the episode
gameofthrones,removed,maybe but weve seen arya warg nymeria from across the sea if the wights are animated through magic similar to warging it shouldnt be limited by distance then again weve seen wights animated south of the wall and warging isnt supposed to be able to cross the wall because of magic hmm now im not even sure what i believe
gameofthrones,removed,you know nothing jon snow
gameofthrones,removed,yup its better than the i really cant post here because it takes a phd to understand wtf the rules are in terms of spoilers
gameofthrones,removed,did anybody else think sams mom is a total grecoroman milf
gameofthrones,removed,🙌🏻 thank you clear this up for non book readers was teaching bran how to control his greensight he has the ability to warg and skinchange easily but he needed to master greenseeing to become the since died prematurely bran still has not mastered this skill which is why he is so concerned
gameofthrones,removed,very good post my frendes i rilly liked it sori for bad englando
gameofthrones,removed,dude its a tv show let it go go out and get some pussy
gameofthrones,removed,clickdailymotionfuck off

gameofthrones,removed,upvote for naked jon
gameofthrones,removed,yeah would not bang
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,this is a very good point his actions drove theon and yara to mereen and gave dany the final ships she needed to finally sail to westeros and its possible that next season hell try to stop dany and shell just bbq his ass and take whatever ships are left buuuut we still have two seasons to go here too ample time to throw some trouble at dany during her voyage back too why settle for an easy voyage if the writers can add some deussuspensemachines to mix things up i guess well just have to see if eurons big cock really is the only thing he has going for him
gameofthrones,removed,id destroy sansa given the chance
gameofthrones,removed,thank you for being a polite user on reddit this bot was created by httpredditcomukooldawgstar if this bot is an annoyance to your subreddit feel free to ban it httpwwwgithubcomkooldawgstarpoliteusersbot
gameofthrones,removed,i see this and im likecool but a lot of it is just the dude trying to reach for hidden meanings and reasoning behind every piece of wardrobe which is clearly looking way too much into it you can do this kind of thing for anything or anyone in any show movie or book if you tried the fact of the matter is that dany is a freaking rich dragon queen who likes to shop for nice clothes whenever she gets to a new town like any woman would thats the deep meaning behind her wardrobe
gameofthrones,removed,the dick wants what the dick wants
gameofthrones,removed,jon and dany meeting is awesome with tyrion spectacular but there is something special about jon and arya those who read the books would agree with it they need to meet and jon needs to hug her and call her his little sister even shes his cousin she will always be his little sister
gameofthrones,removed,the timelines dont match up theres more than nine months between lyannas disappearance and jons birth else neds story wouldnt make sense baby jon would be visibly too old to have been conceived during the war and shortly after robb
gameofthrones,removed,as a huge fan of the series fuck the haters this is great no one knows shit about lyanna or rhaegar including how they dress great detail and also id do either of you you are both attractive do avoid warhammers and towers though
gameofthrones,removed,rhaegar and slutty lyanna

gameofthrones,removed,ahh crap i was on the toilet with my dick under the seat now im stuck
gameofthrones,removed,mm margery w big titties
gameofthrones,removed,there are a couple of prominent differences between her and natalie that dont match
gameofthrones,removed,its the boobs
gameofthrones,removed,if only sadly the entire fan base would notice the drastic change in boob size midscene lol
gameofthrones,removed,im a simple man i see boobs i upvote
gameofthrones,removed,agreed i think wws will mend all bridges jon will show his red fury steam up his breath and huff and puff but ultimately all conflicts take a backburner to the wws the only battles hell fight are those he needs to unify the realm and we he needs to do to win against the wws i hope there isnt too much conflict with dany since shes seen kl destroyed and snowing
gameofthrones,removed,ven when life begins in that horrible situation of rape that is something that god intended to happen ser richard mourdock
gameofthrones,removed,never underestimate the power of big boobs
gameofthrones,removed,if those titties couldnt change the high sparrows mind on celibacy nothing could
gameofthrones,removed,i can think of reasons why it isnt really her
gameofthrones,removed,two reasons why its not her
gameofthrones,removed,dear god this woman is gorgeous she looks like the original actress with much bigger breasts i know they can lift and enhance what a woman already has but this woman has a lot of material to work with
gameofthrones,removed,i can see a way this chick could make some decent money
gameofthrones,removed,here are more cosplays by xenia shelkovskaya
gameofthrones,removed,who is this and where can we find more scientific photos of her
gameofthrones,removed,here are more cosplays by xenia shelkovskaya
gameofthrones,removed,not from me shes definitely hotter than natalie
gameofthrones,removed,her boobs are bigger i like it
gameofthrones,removed,itt ranking women you stay classy rgameofthrones
gameofthrones,removed,ill take please
gameofthrones,removed,there are two things i really like about this photo
gameofthrones,removed,rip your grace we will avenge your death
gameofthrones,removed,yep id stick it in
gameofthrones,removed,i know one of the rules is not to be immature or sexually objectifying but have any of you played game of boobs ill admit its a stupid game scored terribly on it httpsuplustcomplaygameofboobs
gameofthrones,removed,no seriously are you blind because this girl has considerably larger breasts than dormer like youd have to be legally blind not to notice theyre right there
gameofthrones,removed,really the much larger boobs wouldnt give it away
gameofthrones,removed,i think its kinda stupid how all of us men with testosterone pumping through our blood are not allowed to say exactly what we all see when were all looking at it together its a huge elephant in the room and were staring right at both of them
gameofthrones,removed,httpswwwinstagramcompblqoghcjxtyhlen slight difference id say
gameofthrones,removed,id fuck this girl right in the ass 😂 aynal seks 😂😂😂👌👌👌
gameofthrones,removed,huge tracts of land
gameofthrones,removed,jugs juuuuuuuuugssss juuuuuuuuugggggs jugs worth it
gameofthrones,removed,look at the bust it isnt natalie
gameofthrones,removed,i like tits am i doing anything wrong is this the right thing to say
gameofthrones,removed,admiring a womans cleavage is like complimenting her nice hair or is that too provocative as well
gameofthrones,removed,you look just like her except way better boobs
gameofthrones,removed,wow thats an amazing cosplay its almost as impressive as
gameofthrones,removed,busty margaery fuck me sideways
gameofthrones,removed,her tits arent that big
gameofthrones,removed,introducing the new and improved dormer shes like the old dormer but theres more of her in all the right places
gameofthrones,removed,ill be in my bunk
gameofthrones,removed,somebody posted her instagram and her boobs arent even that big she just overdid the pushup good cosplay and would be slightly well more accurate at least if she actually just eased up on the cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,well there are at least two obvious reasons why you can tell this is cosplay
gameofthrones,removed,a girl has a great rack tho
gameofthrones,removed,as was i glorious day
gameofthrones,removed,yeah but there also boobs
gameofthrones,removed,the policy is fine but they are way too heavy handed with it the last time i came here i made a light hearted risque joke and it got removed which is the day i unsubscribed theyre huge babies about it
gameofthrones,removed,boobs
gameofthrones,removed,please try to keep it as respectful and mature as we can thanks my mind is telling me no but my body my bodyyyyy
gameofthrones,removed,no charred extra crispy skin its like shes not even trying
gameofthrones,removed,well i know id sure like to nail nevermind
gameofthrones,removed,oh brother is this the new dont say mean thing please auto moderator crap
gameofthrones,removed,well she definitely has better breasts
gameofthrones,removed,look at the breasts though
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think saying a fat person is fat is bad for society though im overweight and i say it all the time you are letting people get away with being in denial not accepting their problem here there is no problem we see big tits and we get to say we like em big nothing wrong with that
gameofthrones,removed,thats normal it doesnt normally give me a chubby but that would most definitely naturally draw my gaze is that not the very definition of sexual provocative
gameofthrones,removed,too soon
gameofthrones,removed,im jealous of her boobs
gameofthrones,removed,wow youre beautiful hun
gameofthrones,removed,dormer facial symmetry tits op smirk
gameofthrones,removed,house tyrell is not the only thing thats growing strong from this picture
gameofthrones,removed,i think cosplay is stupid
gameofthrones,removed,or her cup size
gameofthrones,removed,the tits are on point
gameofthrones,removed,i guess im in the minority here but i dont think shes nearly as attractive as natalie dormer
gameofthrones,removed,ask you mom moron dang that cut deep almost as deep as this cleavage we are looking at
gameofthrones,removed,way better looking
gameofthrones,removed,tittaaaaays
gameofthrones,removed,they guy above him said check out her tits the mods here are now ruining jokes this place is bland as hell
gameofthrones,removed,boing
gameofthrones,removed,god damn women posting pictures of themselves they should know that men cant control themselves they should really just make sure to wear burqas whenever they do post a picture of themselves that way the poor men arent tempted to make lewd comments
gameofthrones,removed,boobs doe
gameofthrones,removed,tits are fake you can tell because theres a little square at the top with an awkwardly shaped space its always in the cleavage line that you can tell what is this photo about again
gameofthrones,removed,its just because i ugh imagine her tasting good like fried chicken i cant be alone in this right right
gameofthrones,removed,at first i thought natalie dormer got a tit job convincing cosplay
gameofthrones,removed,i dont recall doing or expressing any of the opinions youre arguing against i just miss a world without egg shells i believe jokes are part of the fabric of what makes us human theyre dumb wild flawed and unpredictable like us once you start policing it to extreme extents the world feels sterilised people competing over who is the most offended and right now its everywhere it gets kinda exhausted i know a sub reddit needs rules and certain liberties and sensibilities need protecting i just think sometimes weve gone too far i know its an unpopular opinion and i respect the rules just think we forget that were all flawed humans sometimes
gameofthrones,removed,this snowflake pulls her shirt down well past half way to show as much cleavage as possible then gasps in disgust when you compliment her good looks

gameofthrones,removed,its really disappointing this doesnt have more upvotes it perfectly displays how wide and varied of a fanbase game of thrones has s olenna is one of the best characters
gameofthrones,removed,ur supposed to have one tit out
gameofthrones,removed,wheres the booby d
gameofthrones,removed,since its not been mentioned enough one teat should be out
gameofthrones,removed,no tit
gameofthrones,removed,thanks
gameofthrones,removed,looks shit sorry put more effort in
gameofthrones,removed,im surprised dany has a fanbase to begin with for me shes the biggest villain and tyrant in the show however almost everyone seems to be hypnotised by the her pretty looks tits and dragons to even notice her fucked up actions she is the biggest entitled little cunt on the show she basically conquers city after city destroys the ways and traditions of its citizens without providing a solution to keep the peace as usual the citizens end up rebelling against her to restore their city to the way it was dany outlawing slavery may make her seem like a heroine but her methods of achieving it makes her the complete opposite the reason why people love jon so much is because hes willing to give his live for the greater good of the realm without wanting anything in return dany just wants the be everyones little princess to look up to and she plans on achieving this with fire and blood jon seeks to save the realm dany will most likely end up making it bleed with her dragons and army of savages ps dany finally getting the throne she desires only to get stabbed in the back is what i would call a bittersweet ending to the show and books
gameofthrones,removed,has game of thrones reddit become cancer
gameofthrones,removed,fanboi lol
gameofthrones,removed,i totally respect your opinion maybe youre right but i disagree i thought her interaction with olenna was less about her mourning joffrey and more about her being frustrated that shes been a widow to two kings as for the sparrows i thought she handled it similar to cersei she was too proud to submit to them believing they had no real power it wasnt until later she said fuck it and decided it was easier to work with the sparrows rather than against them as for the tyrells and their small folk they fed them because they had the means to do so not because the wanted to be loved their lands were largely untouched by war im pretty sure i wasnt aware the lannisters had reputations for being travers and rapists i know they burned some fields crops infrastructure during the war to combat the north i dont think they did it to piss of their own people

gameofthrones,removed,im actually more impressed by the lifelike drawings as a whole than just the tattoos
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think it was an unnecessary scene at all it was a nice parting fuck you from sam to his dad it showed how much he has grown from when he first appeared on the show old sam meekly acquiesced to his fathers threat to either go to wall and take the black or be killed he was so beaten down that he couldnt help but admit to everyone at castle black that he was a coward when he arrived since then sam has seen some shit hes killed a white walker and a thenn made friends who appreciate him for who he is and fallen in love sam will never be the fearless hero but he has come a long way its good to have scenes that highlight these little character moments i hope they dont get lost in the mic with the reduced episode count well be seeing the next two seasons not every scene has to be about progressing the overall plot i do think that heartsbane will come back into play eventually but even if it doesnt the scene definitely served a useful purpose
gameofthrones,removed,you think theyre aromatic almost exclusively perennial rarely annual herbs
gameofthrones,removed,my ovaries
gameofthrones,removed,if he is her husband he would sit there like i said their hatred goes a good distance for any lannister if one of them is blue rose growing rom the chink oon the wall of ice third marriage is out of love is she going to love tyrion or jaime i understand youre not fan of jon and dany marriage right basically any marriage with tyrion or jaime would destroy any chance of jon and dany marriage too because jon would hardly consider it also as i said dany is supposed to be married three times two marriage already happened
gameofthrones,removed,did trump grow his hair this long
gameofthrones,removed,whats this we bull shit sexualize the hell out of female actresses i dont care hell ill join id swing for the other team for natalie dormer and her sexy smirk

gameofthrones,removed,battle of the bastards as a whole but more notably when the horses were charging at each other in slow motion then at impact it speeds up and gives a collision effect
gameofthrones,removed,i absolutely loved the chaos is a ladder scene and everytime the hound kills someone especially the scene with polliver in the inn
gameofthrones,removed,the cut from the baby to jon snow i get goosebumps thinking about it
gameofthrones,removed,every scene with natalie dormer in it
gameofthrones,removed,the scene where young ned tells sword of the morning i looked for you on the trident this single line alone gives me chills
gameofthrones,removed,all she had at her command was qyburn and the mountain at the time of the explosion she were probably tons of people who had previously supported her within the kingsguard city watch and lannister forces they simply had better options at the time the king and queen ser kevan with the sudden power void she could have easily regained those people graspers who would have seen the sudden power void as an opportunity to get ahead by jumping back into cerseis good graces in the absence of any other options in the city cersei would have been the one to back cersei and jaime are probably well known among the lannister forces to have each others back and people with the power to stop cersei could have weighed their options and decided that it wasnt worth the risk support cersei and wait for jaime to come back which isnt likely to draw the ire of either or stand against cersei and risk both cersei and jaime getting pissed and potentially losing their head once cersei had reestablished sufficient control over the forces in kings landing thats that
gameofthrones,removed,i just came back from a master debating class in oxford myself really polished off my master debating technique have any tips yourself
gameofthrones,removed,septa unellas cunt
gameofthrones,removed,i know better than ask woman this irl but is dany pregnant
gameofthrones,removed,i have liked them to do what they usually do example is dany speaking to douche bag khal she does the reminder of prophesy and im just saying we should have had more talk prior about euron just needed to be teased slightly as a reminder cause most viewers didnt remember there was an uncle s it was mentioned in season one
gameofthrones,removed,really loving the jon snolo s since both ofem got stabbed in the gut
gameofthrones,removed,ned and catelyn dark
gameofthrones,removed,since when are the starks dothraki
gameofthrones,removed,can you link me plz in return ill give you the original pilot got script httpgoodinaroomcomwpcontentuploadsgameofthronespilotscriptwinteriscomingpdf most likely real or good fake this is potentially the unaired pilot draft
gameofthrones,removed,you can expect not to get laid
gameofthrones,removed,lol dm me if you want major spoilers
gameofthrones,removed,pic is too dark s
gameofthrones,removed,people are doing reverse race cosplay now huh well thats a thing i guess
gameofthrones,removed,hes been sighted on set so hell be back for sure his ties with the mormonts and longclaw hint that hell come back even if its not big deal to the overall story
gameofthrones,removed,shes not upset at him dying she sentences him to death nope not a clue about id say the scripts for that are still being written
gameofthrones,removed,dany gets a bit determined now that shes set foot on westeros which worries varys and tyrion who have been hoping she isnt as power mad as her dad she torches a few rulers to make some points including sams dad and brother so shes clearly not above using fear to rule after all im not sure any ruler of westeros really cares about the iron islands they dont produce anything and theyre sparsely populated by grumpy blokes who cares the north though has the largest population and is the biggest chunk of westeros of course she wants it its probably a good bit of the agriculture too come to think of it shes more than happy to let jon be warden of the north like ned she just doesnt want anyone else with designs on royalty knocking about which makes sense
gameofthrones,removed,ghost stays in winterfell the whole time a boat is no place for a direwolf
gameofthrones,removed,not following your question can you clarify
gameofthrones,removed,she also has a bitchin scene where she spars with brienne that i think is going to be a fan favourite
gameofthrones,removed,ah right i havent really the time to go into it now but if you look through my comment history ive outlined a lot of it
gameofthrones,removed,tyrion persuades her that most of the people who would die in a direct dragon attack on kings landing would be innocent she likes jon from the start simple as that he isnt scared of her and nothing he says contradicts her worldview she can see he only wants to help his people not a threat dany justifies her killing people by pointing out that jon himself has slain many enemies he concedes the point
gameofthrones,removed,no hes pretty straight with her and she admires it but does her best not to show it
gameofthrones,removed,he greets her on return from a battle and she notes that he isnt scared of drogon and even pets him drogon lets him she is puzzled by this it bothers her slightly
gameofthrones,removed,to be honest i cant figure out where the scenes shot in spain are supposed to be set beyond flashbacks to the tower of joy again i cant recall any dornish scenes maybe its highgarden although neither jon nor dany go there its all jaime and olenna
gameofthrones,removed,ah gotcha yeah ironically i dont really follow the rumor sites much yeah hell be there as will cersei jaime the hound tyrion etc
gameofthrones,removed,no she watches him fighting on an island against the undead north of the wall jon carries on fighting long after the others have escaped the horde and she is flying above providing air support
gameofthrones,removed,he receives a raven in episode and hes aware shes landed at dragonstone before that shes heard stuff from tyrion about him but even hes surprised that the young man he met at winterfall is now the kitn when she sees him shes surprised at how young he is she hasnt heard about his resurrection though and davos sort of mentions it but jon dismisses it he doesnt want to discuss it obviously the other kings arent answering her ravens or have already pledged to her dorne highgarden have sworn to her iron islands have joined cersei
gameofthrones,removed,youre in a everything spoiler thread ya dipshit
gameofthrones,removed,classic
gameofthrones,removed,nice tits
gameofthrones,removed,lets see robert baratheon has no legal heirs those are all jamies kids all of the starks are neds tyrion is jamie and cersies brother anything more do you need be specific and ill tell you i dont want to ruin anything
gameofthrones,removed,yes in december we got this teaser but with no new shots only maxs epic voice
gameofthrones,removed,all i see is boobs
gameofthrones,removed,boobs
gameofthrones,removed,more like redhead with nice boobs wears different outfits
gameofthrones,removed,he looks to old and ghost is to small
gameofthrones,removed,damn dude why are you so obsessed with this thread
gameofthrones,removed,not really its like all artwork some have more longevity than others its the difference between and
gameofthrones,removed,its not being said about all tattoos just this one
gameofthrones,removed,i have tattoos and still think this is pretty questionable its nothing to do with quit enjoying things i dont its nothing to do with your own tattoos its saying getting a tattoo because you wanted something cute her words is a pretty dodgy idea like i said earlier its the difference between getting something like and something like that people are bringing up
gameofthrones,removed,listen up everyone this is ugiveyokoachances boyfriend the next person who insults my girl or her tattoo will be in world of hurt respect my girl or ill disrespect your face
gameofthrones,removed,its a legitimate opinion dont be upset about it
gameofthrones,removed,its me ur boyfriend
gameofthrones,removed,isnt it i just pulled them both of the internet by literally google image searching terrible tattoo and amazing tattoo and grabbing the first ones that caught my eye
gameofthrones,removed,thats cool like i said in another post i just google image searched terrible tattoo and awesome tattoo respectively to get these images my point still stands that when people have grown and the cute factor and fad factor fades you want something that doesnt make you look like a tween girl has doodled on you with magic markers i have had tattoos for over years now and at one stage as a teenager considered cutsie tattoos like wings on my back etc i am so glad ive gone for the latter style im pretty good evidence that some types of tattoos are regrettable
gameofthrones,removed,its the artwork style im referring to
gameofthrones,removed,just because some disagrees with you it doesnt mean they are rude
gameofthrones,removed,why is the guy on the left dressed as renly and not sam
gameofthrones,removed,no youve missed my point my point is that it is a general objective opinion even from people who have tattooshave considered tattoos like this in the past i literally found these examples by googling terrible awesome tattoo its not just what i prefer
gameofthrones,removed,id probably wife that lady if i was dating her tattoos lit
gameofthrones,removed,i agree looks childish and is not well executed plus not even drogon not even got
gameofthrones,removed,what the fuck do you want a hugbox you put this out on a massive public forum youre upset that someone commenting didnt like it on a public forum what
gameofthrones,removed,that kid got ugly
gameofthrones,removed,dumb
gameofthrones,removed,nah
gameofthrones,removed,haha yes please go down the chill lol route when im actually making a great point in a discussion this tattoo looks like she let a teenager at her with magic markers simple as enjoy
gameofthrones,removed,haha one is seriously shit though i dont know if you read my post but i literally found it by googling terrible tattoo
gameofthrones,removed,cause you get a tattoo and game of thrones ends in seasons your tattoo is literally relevant for years lets say op lives another years years dumb decision
gameofthrones,removed,thing with tattoos is that the person wearing it can have different meanings of it op could have the drogon tattoo because it reminds her of how telltale her earier life was whats wrong with that thats a big could have and what if op just got a tattoo cause tattoos are cool and dragons are cool what if she just got those tattoos cause everyones got tattoos these days and she got a dragon cause dragons are cool in every form of media theyre in what if getting tattoos is her just trying to fit in like some people go through an emo phase shes going through a just turned trying to be cool phase for all we know her tattoo could be about as deep as a trail of stars
gameofthrones,removed,does anyone know who is playing cersei for research purposes
gameofthrones,removed,came for the dragon stayed for the leg
gameofthrones,removed,a song of ice and furries
gameofthrones,removed,yeah he looks like renley got older for like years and was heavy eating drinking and whoring to put himself into an early grave

gameofthrones,removed,she is not even hot
gameofthrones,removed,aw dear you did notice that i got the cupcake tattoo image by googling the words terrible tattoo
gameofthrones,removed,a gatekeeping bro im being pretentious jesus thread
gameofthrones,removed,why are you comparing cersei to real mass murderers and psychopaths you know its just a show by your logic all the main characters in this showbook are mass murderers and psychopaths who need to see a therapist lol
gameofthrones,removed,then you understand its nothing to do with my personal taste but an objective sentiment about tattoos deadly im happy now im out
gameofthrones,removed,youre right i should get self awareness in comic sans on my upper thigh to remind me itll be so cute like i just said im out enjoy
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,fat renly so like robert well not exactly fat but
gameofthrones,removed,and that ladies and gentlemen is how you miss out on everything good in life by not being able to handle the bad parts of something great anyway maybe shell get over her experiences at some point and watch got its really not that bad you americans im assuming are just overall too sensitive with nudity and sexual violence and curse words
gameofthrones,removed,she doesnt
gameofthrones,removed,both gendry and nymeria will appear in the next season nymeria in only one scene gendry in episodes
gameofthrones,removed,jorah will appear in most of season

gameofthrones,removed,i laughed too hard at this
gameofthrones,removed,i guess they dont realize theyre not the first people to come up with that alternative title
gameofthrones,removed,wasnt that the title of a porn parody for got
gameofthrones,removed,my khal sucks but im pretty sure i nailed khaleesi i swear i read this
gameofthrones,removed,i hope some guys dress up as nights watch and beat up those fucking clown kids
gameofthrones,removed,you totally like you know nothing
gameofthrones,removed,great fur piece i prefer margys growing strong tittys but good effort
gameofthrones,removed,where boobs
gameofthrones,removed,shes venezuelan but excellent intuition
gameofthrones,removed,if you expect to get a fraction of her upvotes without huge tits taking up of the frame you are sorely mistaken
gameofthrones,removed,dont feel bad for him just think of all the tang he gonna get in haloween
gameofthrones,removed,no tits or face scar
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,oh my god that jon snow has a smaller penis
gameofthrones,removed,where is dany with bigger boobs cosplay
gameofthrones,removed,nah bro cleavage all day
gameofthrones,removed,ok so i just read some of it and its laughable that some of these happens dorne and high garden get trashed by the lannisters
gameofthrones,removed,boobsbeards
gameofthrones,removed,i saw one of those leaked plots and i knew it was bs when they said jons real name is aegon lol
gameofthrones,removed,formula confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,no cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,you probably say you read playboy for the articles too
gameofthrones,removed,yes but could we just have a little bit more cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,can we get a kickstarter campaign going to get these two together to star in a got porno
gameofthrones,removed,you forgot to add tits
gameofthrones,removed,you should of folded she carries pocket queens
gameofthrones,removed,i foresee you getting laid in that cosplay
gameofthrones,removed,damn jons tits are better than margerys
gameofthrones,removed,you cant raise something without bigger boobs
gameofthrones,removed,oh yeah youd hate to do that s
gameofthrones,removed,that and dozens of other completely fine comments the mods in this sub are some of the worst ive seen very heavy handed and seem to remove stuff they just dont like
gameofthrones,removed,not enough cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,no cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,plus he gets to bang dany at the end of
gameofthrones,removed,this sub is now truly in the shutter
gameofthrones,removed,as khal drogo im pretty sure you nailed khaleesi
gameofthrones,removed,but it was really fantastic cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,thirsty to me makes me think of someone trying to get something physical to happen desperately not pointing out the fact someone has nice tits this is the internet afterall
gameofthrones,removed,immediately goes to facebook cant find it immediately goes to r freefolk
gameofthrones,removed,id love to see her nail khaleesi
gameofthrones,removed,there is a disturbing lack of cleavage
gameofthrones,removed,you know nothing
gameofthrones,removed,dont wanna shit on the mods for fear of getting banned
gameofthrones,removed,but i believe life begins at erection
gameofthrones,removed,you dont even have an hour a week to watch one episode wtf dude thats just not true no one is ever that busy just wait until you have time to watch the show if you just want to read the highlights of the season what is the point of being a fan clearly youre not that interested
gameofthrones,removed,the real question is do you have bad poosi
gameofthrones,removed,dany not just for the reasons you listed i dont like her because she makes a lot of dumb decisions any time someone does something stupid they pay for it look at house stark robb broke his promise to marry a frey and was killed ned disregarded littlefingers offer to make joffrey the king and then trusted littlefinger to help with his own plan sansa lied about joffrey at the trident and lady paid for it rickon didnt zigzag and look where it got him there are plenty more examples too but i wont list every single time someone screwed up because i dont think i have enough characters dany has made plenty of mistakes and didnt pay for them locking up the two dragons that werent causing terror trusting her hand maiden who stole her dragons trusting mirri maz dur with khal drogos life forsaking the dosh khaleen because she thought herself better than them killed all of the khals beneath the mother of mountains sending away jorah probably one of the most loyal soldiers she could ever think of getting multiple times essentially stealing the unsullied army she has done so many things that other characters would have paid dearly for and she just gets away with it every single other character who has done something wrong has paid for it either the iron price or some other way cersei did her walk of shame joffrey is dead jon died she is my least favorite because of these all this along with what you said as well
gameofthrones,removed,well heres my thought process for that she bought the army the killed the man she bought them from and took back the payment she gave him
gameofthrones,removed,id hit the one in the left
gameofthrones,removed,daario releasing revenge porn
gameofthrones,removed,really thats the level set on this sub for pervyness if so im a bad bad man because my thoughts centred around how much more blessed the lady on the left is compared to the actresses
gameofthrones,removed,tell your friend to pass them digitssssss
gameofthrones,removed,the cat was mentioned again in acok sansa was panting by the time she reached the top she ran down a shadowy colonnade and pressed herself against a wall to catch her breath when something bruched against her leg she almost jumped out of her skin but it was only a cat a ragged black tom with a chewedoff ear the creature spit at her and leapt away just noticed doesnt have much significance
gameofthrones,removed,pics or did not happen
gameofthrones,removed,a rapey one
gameofthrones,removed,me too but i want a bust and the cleavage to be the stand
gameofthrones,removed,the issue is shes in a really shitty position right now all her allies have abandoned her and sided with dany whos now an unprecedented threat to her and her family dany has the backing of pretty much everyone who still has an army but the lannisters the only one who doesnt directly oppose her is jon and the north and thats more out of apathy than like of her she still killed his family and sansa probably actively hates her hed prefer her to be disposed than remain in power but he has higher priorities than the south right now no i think the game of thrones is going to end this season and things will be set up for the war against the white walkers
gameofthrones,removed,i must always reply with his plan in the books is going to be kickass and the bolton scum will burn all hail the one true king
gameofthrones,removed,he is going to die
gameofthrones,removed,go away stop complaining
gameofthrones,removed,im okay with during the walk as well just make it happen
gameofthrones,removed,it was an absolutely craziily moving scene in so many ways at once hodor seemed to me to be the embodiment of love
gameofthrones,removed,whos kevin and how do i get one of these
gameofthrones,removed,whos kevin and how do i get one of these
gameofthrones,removed,rfreefolk
gameofthrones,removed,rfreefolk
gameofthrones,removed,rfreefolk
gameofthrones,removed,while i agree based off the books i cant believe they waited so long for his introduction though on the show at least
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think its necessarily that hes always in control or knowledgeable but he always tries to position himself for a pivot if a plan backfires he likes building in fallbacks and plausible deniability for example his move now it seems as if his first intent is to help sansa by bringing the vale army and claiming glory however if sansa were to deny him this he can make the sly remark about the tullies while he still has the army camped at moat caillin if the tullies go north to aid sansa they have to go through littlefingers army or he has to let them through if he lets them through he could turn the vale armies around to the riverlands and reclaim his lands as lord of harrenhall
gameofthrones,removed,makes sense i am going to believe this and exit this thread and stop the mind fucking that is going on in my mind going to bye thanks mate
gameofthrones,removed,how is that actress lady still alive did arya lie about poisoning her
gameofthrones,removed,according to my hbo east coast schedule blood of my blood is set to air at pm est an old foe comes back into the picture gilly meets sams family arya faces a difficult choice jaime faces off against the high sparrow
gameofthrones,removed,well since euron was announced last year in castingyes yes i did
gameofthrones,removed,i bet daario felt like a real boner right there
gameofthrones,removed,that was my initial response when i heard how serious her tone was with baelish lol although it could simply be the writers pandering to feminists its hard to tell
gameofthrones,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gameofthrones,removed,hopping unto top comment to mention that ops pic has a get them here which makes me suspect its a underhanded commercial that said just google custom pins and where youre from germany sweden us etc and therell be bound to be cheaper ones for you to make yourself instead of paying extra because someone uploaded the jpg to a pin and then sold it to you
gameofthrones,removed,what if he declared himself a woman and instead of worrying about walkers the seven kingdoms got preoccupied arguing over which rest room he should use
gameofthrones,removed,thirsty for sapphire poosay
gameofthrones,removed,ayye u wont sum fuk boy
gameofthrones,removed,what
gameofthrones,removed,when bran sees the nights king later in that episode hes played by the same person minus the ice blue skin crown of spikes and wardrobe change they look the same
gameofthrones,removed,nah she dead but you can check out some of her other work
gameofthrones,removed,you could just put the barrel of a loaded gun into your mouth and pull the trigger give it some thought
gameofthrones,removed,ikr damn cunts are getting spoilers in their inbox first chance i get
gameofthrones,removed,unless u get some bad poosie
gameofthrones,removed,weve seen in the trailer what looks like davos at the place where she burned we also know that davos mel jon sansa are about to travel the north to rally horses i am thinking they will come across the place where stannis camp had been and davos will learn the truth then davos has witnessed fire sacrifices by mel before and i think he will recognize the burned area where shireen was not as an attack burn from ramsays men but as a place where a sacrifice occurred he will either piece it together then andor ask mel who was sacrificed andor both i think itll be pretty emotional and heartbreaking scene to watch if thats how it goes down i think this is why its taking so long for it to be revealed to davos so it can be done at this location
gameofthrones,removed,wun wun raping the mountain to death like he did to elia martell
gameofthrones,removed,youre the worst type of person in all honesty
gameofthrones,removed,dont you mean sexiest
gameofthrones,removed,or the fact he was inbred
gameofthrones,removed,if you want to see her naked so badly watch the tudors lots of naked natalie dormer p
gameofthrones,removed,well i see you are in full cunt mode well played
gameofthrones,removed,actor of davos confirmed we will see the house mormont this season and they will support the starks in the battle for winterfell home of the bears
gameofthrones,removed,i think those images were purely promotional and it doesnt mean anything regarding their story lines it was just an interesting way to present the characters and marketing material
gameofthrones,removed,not really a son of ned stark though
gameofthrones,removed,jorah had a rock hard erection for dany jorah die from an infection that makes him rock hard
gameofthrones,removed,less neck choking more cleavage exposing amarite
gameofthrones,removed,they did and we keep up with it overwhelmingly the masses do not they havent read the books they dont read reddit and they dont read the blogswatch the youtubers the only reason most of them might know is because smug assholes much like myself tell them they are gloriously ignorant
gameofthrones,removed,when this is a real doll call me
gameofthrones,removed,nah i think tormund had her body burned beyond the wall
gameofthrones,removed,this reminder me how pissed off i was when olly killed her with that smirk face
gameofthrones,removed,what are you talking about most of us were devastated when we readwatched it
gameofthrones,removed,can we just all stop and imagine who may be the hottest gilf here
gameofthrones,removed,why you gotta bring back the sad memories
gameofthrones,removed,i miss that wildling
gameofthrones,removed,wouldnt bang knees are too sharp
gameofthrones,removed,i wish she would hold my sword like that
gameofthrones,removed,would def smash that in a random cave
gameofthrones,removed,just woman typical reddit
gameofthrones,removed,she dead
gameofthrones,removed,screw lannisters think of the terabytes of targaryen incest porn o o
gameofthrones,removed,i havent found any lannister porn
gameofthrones,removed,i noticed irishthrones on twitter have a video of this very place at riverrun and showing the destruction after the siege what happens next episode
gameofthrones,removed,shes holding jons longclaw ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gameofthrones,removed,someone pointed out previously that during the flashbacks bran had the had the stained glass area wrong because joffrey had updated it to be like im glad they fixed it for this shot
gameofthrones,removed,if this ever happened i would consider my life complete and burn myself at the stake in hopes of becoming the prince that was promised worst case scenario i dont end up being fire proof but die a very happy gamer best case melisandra resurrects me and shows me some yr old titties win win
gameofthrones,removed,
gameofthrones,removed,we do not boner
gameofthrones,removed,the real reason is because it is meant to be a secret porn act right
gameofthrones,removed,me i would you dude shes dead me and
gameofthrones,removed,are you really trying to tell me theres absolutely no way anyone could have ever walked in on them during any of their other sexual encounters how does them being careful negate the fact that the continued existence of their relationship put their own family at risk they could easily protect their family in a way that results in no death of innocnet people like maybe not being sibling fucking pigs
gameofthrones,removed,a gift reddit approved of will probably be a giant pink vibrating dildo with heartsbane written on it in black sharpieactually yeah do that
gameofthrones,removed,your entire title is a spoiler
gameofthrones,removed,what about dying in a fire
gameofthrones,removed,first time i want to bang a painting
gameofthrones,removed,and jaime would know a thing or two about losing hands
gameofthrones,removed,most likely rickon
gameofthrones,removed,shitty porn website
gameofthrones,removed,pretty sure he dies from an arrow while running towards jon
gameofthrones,removed,i miss her tt
gameofthrones,removed,fap material for millenia
gameofthrones,removed,would bang
gameofthrones,removed,tower of joy confirmed by young ned tho
gameofthrones,removed,you can blame robb for that in the say way you can blame the us for what happened on it wouldnt have happened if the us didnt meddle with things in the middle east just like the red wedding wouldnt have happened if robb didnt break his vow but at the end of the day its still alqaeda who crashed the plane and its still the boltons and freys who killed the other northern men after the events it doesnt make sense for the victims to blame the us and robb over alqaeda and the boltons
gameofthrones,removed,one of the brothers without banners theorized to have been the guy with the yellow cloak last episode that hanged ray aka ian mcshane
gameofthrones,removed,a character lem lemoncloack brotherhood wo banners member follower of lsh pretty sure that was him in the middle of the three dbags who came and crashed the hounds churchbuilding party last week
gameofthrones,removed,the theory is deliciously tinfoiley if you it almost seems plausible
gameofthrones,removed,dany did get it on at least once with one of her handmaids in the books so anythings possible i guess
gameofthrones,removed,sandor fights his way in bwb hq and sets up this big dramatic reveal with their leader lsh turns around and proclaims behold i am lady sto immediately cleaved in twain by the hound youre a talker
gameofthrones,removed,warg into the mans body and bang his sister
gameofthrones,removed,anal
gameofthrones,removed,would bang
gameofthrones,removed,i did look up the definition it applies but good on you for being a cunt
gameofthrones,removed,end of season jon dying end of season jon being born
gameofthrones,removed,ramsay will ask rickon to run to jon and hell fire arrows at him while hes running one of the arrows may hit rickon in the leg
gameofthrones,removed,rickon gets shot with an arrow to the back of the leg
gameofthrones,removed,ramsay will have rickon at the battle and let him run off to jon while firing arrows at him hell hit him just before he gets to jon
gameofthrones,removed,he doesnt want a toothless gilf bj
gameofthrones,removed,maybe ramsay releases him before the battle tells him to run to jon and then proceeds to shoots arrows at him until he nearly makes it back to jon before finally being hit
gameofthrones,removed,i think rickon will be let loose to run to jons army then ramsay will shoot an arrow through his leg followed by his archers spiking him with arrows
gameofthrones,removed,if its on the front page of this subreddit doesnt it mean that people like these kinds of posts or at least like discussing them as a member of the free folk you guys and your damn rules are too much its a fricken tv show subreddit as long as we are discussing the tv show whats the harm dont click the links to shit u dont wanna see no need to make a post about what your subreddit preferences are
gameofthrones,removed,also their weird murder boners make me uncomfortable were going to kill everyone yeah thats so hot kiss me
gameofthrones,removed,arrow to the back of the knee
gameofthrones,removed,i think that the reveal will come later in this season likely leaving the audience stunned and wow though proving the rl j theory wrong would probably be quite a mind blown moment for all the theorists out there
gameofthrones,removed,httpiimgurcomocggsprjpg
gameofthrones,removed,completely agree like the one where shae and tyrion are staring at each other and then theyre in the same position after he kills shae i think it was just a coincidence and not something that the directors or cinematographers were aiming for
gameofthrones,removed,he gets shot with an arrow as he runs to jon
gameofthrones,removed,this goes in line with what an extra said happened to him in the show he commented a couple of weeks ago and no one believed him but he said there is a scene where rickon is standing between jon and ramsay and ramsay says he has to choose which one to run to he runs to jon and is shot down before he reaches him by ramsay who we already know id a good archer
gameofthrones,removed,jon always comes back foreshadowing
gameofthrones,removed,this ive been seeing so many useless threads like that and one that gets me are all the crackpot theories people bring up after every episode like the dozen or so different ones about arya actually being jaqen of jaqen actually testing the waif how arya is his senpai or jaquen is actually syrio or jaquen isnt the same jaquen as before and everyone is jaquen but everyone is arya but wait olyvar is there too who the fuck is olyvar no clue but hes there i used to visit this sub every day now i only show up on saturdays to read the preep discussion and the post survey results plus whatever may happen to be on the front page at the time
gameofthrones,removed,after the hounds return im actually inclined to beleive its not so unlikely we didnt actually see him die on screen afterall
gameofthrones,removed,ah but the arya we saw was jaqen fakesansa lady crane and syrio everything makes sense all are confirmed
gameofthrones,removed,the op is mad and full of butthurt
gameofthrones,removed,i definitely agree im still not thrilled that jensnow was allowed to stay a mod after her bullshit modding and randomly deleting comments with no explanation but i made my peace with that the mods have been allowing more and more garbage content and just utterly ridiculous tinfoil theories to be posted now
gameofthrones,removed,make rgameofthrones great again
gameofthrones,removed,make rgameofthrones great again build a firewall and make the shitposters pay for it
gameofthrones,removed,hey op shut up nobody cares what you want to see on the front page there are no other interesting posted being posted so why not stfu
gameofthrones,removed,so after posts of the hound on the frontpage of the sub numerous of them the exact same arrow clegane arrow bowl ones my one sentence is out of line s
gameofthrones,removed,at first i thought it was an absurd theory and then the hound was shown alive and involved with the church of the seven
gameofthrones,removed,not to mention the circlejerks and repeated original theories are incredibly stupid dae think charles dance is the best actor this show ever had i love how this show doesnt have heroes or villainsso anyway i have this crazy theory do you guys think dany is the villain of the show that cant be arya she was acting a little different than she was seasons ago before all that character development wow bran can influence the past he must be every character in the show
gameofthrones,removed,i read the theory and i think its sort of silly for a few reasons but if im wrong its admittedly the least ridiculous thing of the things i listed
gameofthrones,removed,ive said this before in another thread but i believe what hbo has here is the opportunity to film what could be if done right the best sex scene outside of actual porn ever filmed
gameofthrones,removed,the carelessness was only momentary and it wasnt out of character shes still young and a little naive and up until then she was careful i cant see jaquen getting stabbed a few times and then go wander around scared and confused in the streets its like people who are buying into the theory are only watching the first half of the scene besides how does jaquen acquire this power to imitate arya when up until now all we know is that you can only steal the faces of the dead
gameofthrones,removed,not sure if trolling or just stupid
gameofthrones,removed,my biggest pet peeve is the whos the heir to the iron throne after tommen is it kevan who cares dany is coming with dragons and an army should tommen die chaos is the heir if tommen doesnt die chaos will still be the heir
gameofthrones,removed,wow so meta this post is a perfect for riamverysmart
gameofthrones,removed,i mean reading a storm of swords it seemed relatively obvious to me she gets angry quite a bit unleashing the dragon and such and wonders if shes bad or crazy like aerys was she asks barristan about him a lot and such i havent read adwd yet so i cant comment on the stuff in it though
gameofthrones,removed,spoiler warning for all you not caught up peoples what gets me is how innocent and cliche some of these theories are grrm seems to have a disdain storys with both of those elements but then youll have theories like jon will learn of his true parentage from jorah who he has never met or has shown to have knowledge of this before or my personal favorite jon and dany will fall in loveew or live happily ever after ruling side by side with tyrion has hand of the qking yeah no also on a side not im not appreciate the amount of antihype lately you guys never bothered having an actual discussion about cleganebowl and now that we are at are most hype you think its a good idea to talk about how it wont happen and that lancel fucking lancel will be the faith champion
gameofthrones,removed,just dont check reddit before youve seen the episode i quickly checked reddit before the hodor episode and first post on my front page was a comic about someone saying hold the door ive learned my lesson
gameofthrones,removed,i hope she goes mad and burns them all jorah her lover the whore that she picked up and all of the dothraki that speak up against her and the red milf too ofc
gameofthrones,removed,come to freefolk for quality got posts
gameofthrones,removed,i subbed here a couple months ago and within the first two days of seeing different people post the same exact thing probably a hundred times over i realized that finding interesting topics was going to be a nightmare how many times can i read the topic what if is azor ahai and the content is something like i just had this crazy theory that maybe azor ahai is jon snow i havent seen anyone say this before what do you think ive seen probably posts stating that op came up with an insane theory that rlj not much quality around these parts
gameofthrones,removed,where is stannis still alive somehow shitpost
gameofthrones,removed,at first i misread this as mentioning her titties
gameofthrones,removed,my guess is ramsay tells rickon to run to his brother and sister and while rickon runs down the hill ramsay shoots arrows at him eventually ramsay hits rickon in the knee making him fall
gameofthrones,removed,hngg
gameofthrones,removed,very hard to pick one because all of them had somthing unique botb showed sheer face of the war unlikely weve ever seen jon going through boltons soldiers and it gets bloodier and bloodier absolute mayhem and it truly shows what soldiers went through in every war also it showed tactics and of course cinematography was amazing that tracking shot of jon was one of the best ive seen best one is for sure true detective and rusty with crash raid watchers on the wall was a bit like blackwater bay it showed not only fighting but also emotions and characters wat they gone through before and after the battle even the ones who never got to fight on battlefield many amazing moments and some quiet scenes were best one aemonsam cersei and tommen and so on worth noticing that neill marshall shoot both of these episodes hardhome was build n literally suspense sheer terror of whats out there and element of surprise we know that something happened at hardhome in the books as cotter pyke reported dead things in the woods and in the water also it shoed what are white walkers capable of and that last scene was probably best one in all of game of thrones so fucking cool literally every scene was perfect and when fog came down and avalanche that was mesmerizing stuff from them personally i love them all i know its a cliche but every battle had something unique to them if i really had to choose hardhome
gameofthrones,removed,hope these help
gameofthrones,removed,varys

gameofthrones,removed,the hand of the king jon arryn dies at the beginning of the show he was like a father to ned stark the lord of winterfell and the guardian of the north and king robert baratheon when jon dies robert rides for winterfell to ask lord stark his best friend to be his new hand of the king robert is married to cersei lannister and the lannisters are the wealthiest family in all of westeros cersei has two brother jamie the kingslayer and a knight of the kings guard and tyrion the imp across the narrow sea we meet daenerys targaryen and her brother viserys the targaryens used to be the rulers of westeros for the last years before king robert overthrew the dynasty and daenerys dany and her brother were forced into exile dany is to be married to khal drogo so that her brother can receive the khals army in exchange viserys is the rightful ruler to the iron throne and wants to lead an invasion to take it back back to winterfell we again see the starks and lannisters bran stark the middle child is exploring the castle while his father king robert and their men leave on a hunting trip while climbing he finds cersei lannister and her brother jamie fucking in a tower after being caught jamie pushes bran out the window knowing it would mean both of their heads if the king finds out since cersei is the queen
gameofthrones,removed,jokes on you bitch i already got what i needed
gameofthrones,removed,always works
gameofthrones,removed,according to the pyromancers there are only three things hotter than the substance molten lava dragon flame the sun since wights are known to be vulnerable to regular flame from burning pitch wildfire wont be necessary against them but im sure it would be an extremely effective tool against a horde of a few hundred thousand of them we know that the night king can extinguish regular flame but perhaps wildfire is too potent for him but seeing as dragon flame and objects made from it are the only things we know that can destroy an other there is always a chance that wildfire wont be strong enough for them thats not to say that wildfire wont become incredibly important when the wall falls but we just dont know if it will be able to destroy an other
gameofthrones,removed,i dont know but i think it leaked couple minutes ago im downloading now will report back
gameofthrones,removed,i am a bot and i want to make you happy again

gameofthrones,removed,dibs on margaery oh wait
gameofthrones,removed,youre dumb
gameofthrones,removed,you could attribute it to walt pretty much being at the end of the line i dont think he genuinely cared too much he obviously cared a ton for jesse but at that point as we see minutes later he had no qualms with his life in general
gameofthrones,removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvzvwuztuzlhw
gameofthrones,removed,little finger wiping the mouth on one of her girls after giving the blow job giving her to the next guy then this guy kiss her on the lips asap
gameofthrones,removed,stopped reading after deus ex machina maybe know what a phrase means before typing it its obly deus ex machina if it happened without anyone knowing and was an element never brought to the story we knew that lf had the army we know he offered it to sansa and was rejected we know sansa wrote to lf after the fact asking for soldiers predictable plot is not deus ex machina go sit on a dildo
gameofthrones,removed,the scene where robb executes rickard karstark ive always really liked that scene
gameofthrones,removed,he wants to bang sansa and marry her to be warden of the north jon doesnt have the claim because hes a bastard technically bran is the heir but no one knows hes alive
gameofthrones,removed,drogos fight against mago
gameofthrones,removed,dany buying the unsullied actually it depends on the person i cant think of a single scene that will appeal to anyone who watches it
gameofthrones,removed,i actually subscribe to my favorite porn sites i respect and adore specific porn actors and feel compelled to pay for my pleasure so that they have the incentive to keep doing a great job i only use pornhub for things my sites dont have plus i have a very vain and picky penis so hd quality is a must
gameofthrones,removed,think we would have gotten to see the first two bang though
gameofthrones,removed,also the sansa rape scene so theres that
gameofthrones,removed,lol to true but porn hub is better for sex and i plant trees by the minute and there are dozens of movies with better fight scenes
gameofthrones,removed,stark sansa technically bran lannister jaime lord of casterly rock once removed from kingsguard targaryen danyerys technically jon greyjoy euron voted in by kingsmoot mormont lyanna that is her name right arryn robin technically littlefinger martells dead so ellaria sand is leader now i guess or one of the sand snakes tyrells mace baratheon dead technically tommen tully edmure although dont think he is lord of anything at the moment clegane technically sandor frey walder karstark dead i presume umber dead as well i think bolton dead there are definitely a lot of powerful women in this show i just went off of blood lines and rightful heirs although i should have bran instead of sansa i guess
gameofthrones,removed,i have the weirdest boner right now
gameofthrones,removed,where is that what is moist may never dry gif when you need it
gameofthrones,removed,another ad hominem by low iq person
gameofthrones,removed,walkers wont get to winterfell till they break the wall it seemed like men who were alive after the battle were taking care of the bodies rickon brought back his body was furthest from winterfell also all the wildlings and jon know about the dead bodies and the need to burn them they will find a way out i believe also wall isnt going down this season as it is too early cersie burning the kl arya killing walder frey and jaime helping her escape jon becoming the king in the north and banishing melisandre is my prediction for finale
gameofthrones,removed,yeah my brain was lagging due to the fact all the blood in my body was being diverted to my massive erection it hasnt gone awayi probably should call my doctor
gameofthrones,removed,nerd boner
gameofthrones,removed,of all youre not my friend so stfu its one against greater odds clearly you dont understand one
gameofthrones,removed,i dont want her to leave the show because titties
gameofthrones,removed,so much room for a neckbeard
gameofthrones,removed,nice
gameofthrones,removed,i am stupid
gameofthrones,removed,you got itwe have to promote women power in the show brienne sansa danaerys etc
gameofthrones,removed,he doesnt fucking time travel time traveling is transporting your physical self through time bran can only see the past he cant change something thats already happened and he cannot go into the future ugh hardheaded ass people
gameofthrones,removed,scissorbowl is unstoppable the hype rocket has left the atmosphere and is headed to the moon
gameofthrones,removed,she is still a bitch for not telling jon and leaving him to die whaat she was cold and only cared about winning cold game of thrones
gameofthrones,removed,mother of dragons breaker of chains licker of bad poosi
gameofthrones,removed,fair enough but i would then argue that in the end shes still using a fleshlight as opposed to a dildo
gameofthrones,removed,i too am down for it emilia
gameofthrones,removed,its a very stupid question if kl burns down bran can just travel back in time and rebuild it
gameofthrones,removed,that believes greenseeing isnt time travel i think you are
gameofthrones,removed,tower of joy bran is warging and he sees a young ned knock the door out lyanna is bleeding and is hurt beyond help she is clutching the baby hard and sobs profusely the child unhurt unbled is playing with lyannas hair i love you my little star i love you dont be afraidi will keep you safe the cries are all that the child hears but it is his mothers voice what could he do but giggle only if he knew that this was the last time he saw his mother as the door is knocked down lyanna cries out you wont hurt him i will diebut but she is cut short by the sight of ned he drops the sword and walks upto lyanna her soul has almost left the earthly possessions as she departs she whispers keep the child safe for me ned cut next scene we see jon snow in winterfell the talks were not easy the one with davos and melisandre and sansa of course how could he kill melisandre the red priestess the only second woman to have been pierced by jons longclaw he takes a drink and walks into the crypts to pay a homage to rickon i am sorry brother i failed you i tried but i failed may the gods bring peace upon your soul as he departs he comes across a familiar name lyanna he bends down and reads it again lyanna he smiles to himself lyanna she was something such a wise and fearless ruler at such a tender age her support of men shall be rewarded something strikes him its an odd thought surprise she is not deadwhat as he dusts the tombstone son of lyanna stk and rhgor taeanjon credits roll
gameofthrones,removed,woof
gameofthrones,removed,im down with emilia being down for lesbian stuff
gameofthrones,removed,ive never listened to the full audio and why do you do this shit leroy at the end had me cracking up
gameofthrones,removed,in comes jorah like a giant stone dildo to save the day
gameofthrones,removed,reading up on a couple of got wikis about giants they arent smart and they are mean remember his reactions to whatshisname staring at him the fuck you looking at i think half the problem is nobody could talk sense to him and he just did his own thing and who the hell is going to argue with a giant who is willing to help you fight
gameofthrones,removed,youre being incredibly condescending hence the dickbag dont be condescending and nobody will think youre an asshole and will actually enjoy debate i would say she likes brienne more you cant keep changing your statement though from those who are in her top to now who does she like most
gameofthrones,removed,if you think this has a happy ending you havent been paying attention i kept thinking about that during thr battle was really sad to see him go
gameofthrones,removed,there are pictures of her walking with jon and tyrion on i assume dornish sands so i think shell be there pretty early
gameofthrones,removed,no she act all witty and shit only a fool would trust littlefinger but as soon as she got a problem she just run to him cuz she knows he want that fish pie classic hoe
gameofthrones,removed,no man honest question do you have aspergers or some other high functioning autism on the chance that this aint a troll everyone whos ever is a diehard asoaif fan we all got the obvious house targaryen references its just that well the dragon footprints look quite similar to weed and weed culture is funny for some reason thus the joke that someone who assosciates their lives with weed hid a reference to it in the footprints i just deconstructed a joke this goddamn sub and its theories
gameofthrones,removed,i really wanna give aegon i props for badassery but the whole sister fucking thing i just cant get behind dynasty or not
gameofthrones,removed,god i hated those smug thalmor fucks
gameofthrones,removed,i would top that jon snow cosplayer if you know what i mean
gameofthrones,removed,dude you belong on rladyboners you will be much appreciated there
gameofthrones,removed,as i said i can understand why youd want this as a poster or something wanting some dudes face permanetly tatooed on my fore arm i cannot understand that being said if he is homosexual and he likes to beat off to a blood kit harrington bloody face thats understandable i suppose by most accounts he is a very attractive fella
gameofthrones,removed,isnt gendry one of the final baratheons what would their sigil be now watch me row
gameofthrones,removed,hah yes they did if youve read the knight of the seven kingdoms there dunk explains to egg all the important things about armor especially how you go for functionality and what makes it a protective armor and not just a fancy gay piece of crap so those are definitely just artists this time
gameofthrones,removed,say artist you fucking weab
gameofthrones,removed,euron seriously wtf were they thinking on the show
gameofthrones,removed,kill his loved ones at the party red christmas
gameofthrones,removed,i have a bad feeling that s ser davos will die justtequilathings
gameofthrones,removed,still probably a step above claiming that their work didnt meet your standards not paying them at all and then defending it in front of the entire country
gameofthrones,removed,hey uh where can i rewatch past episodes for free i cant find any sites that work
gameofthrones,removed,where can i watch the show free my regular site doesnt work for me anymore
gameofthrones,removed,for some reason at first i thought this post said motherinlaw and was thinking ok ill let it slide then i double checked for shame
gameofthrones,removed,cool but the others rl were better
gameofthrones,removed,they did that after a multiyear war in which whole families were slaughtered and multiple castles burned to the ground and that was when westeros had no better reason to hate targaryens than that they were foreigners trying to take over their country now theyre foreigners trying to take over their country and give it back to the dynasty that made setting people on fire for no reason an olympic sport i think danaerys could win eventually by pure brute force sure it wont be because people love her though thats for damn sure
gameofthrones,removed,did you miss all those pictures of jon and davos meeting dany tyrion the unsullied and the dothraki on what is likely dragonstone that might be an even bigger hint
gameofthrones,removed,i feel like there are more safe characters out there than people tend to consider the only surprising death in my opinion was robb stark and to some degree cat as well it seems like the red wedding alone has given the show this reputation that main characters arent safe and yet the vast majority of main characters are still walking around even the hound and jon snow return from what we thought was their end hbo stannis was super predictable same with ned at this point the arcs are reaching their destination id be more surprised if cersei survived the whole thing than if tyrion was killed off
gameofthrones,removed,arya looks so young honestly how does an nineyearold turn into a faceless assassin
gameofthrones,removed,in a brilliant stroke grrm offed neds head a protagonist of the first bookseason since then protagonists have been pretty resilient look at the names of the only catelyn died i believe and i dont agree with your premise that tyrion is unique several other characters are more safe for now i would say there are two types of plot armor first if a character is foreshadowed to play an important role in the end games bran jon danaerys etc there is credible speculation that tyrion is a targ bastard and will be the the third dragon rider the second plot armor is character growth if a character gains new strengths discovers honor reconnects with their humanity etc then you can naturally expect something good to come out of it before they die that is just how stories work tyrion has finally found a position he earned on his own and where he is appreciated and his talents are useful something significant should come of that before he dies in particular something in westeros redemption i would also expect a resolution of his relationship with jaime before the story ends reconciliation that said we are nearing the end of the story and by season the protagonists will probably drop like flies possibly including tyrion
gameofthrones,removed,like others have said character fulfillment of purpose is the factor determining whether they are ready to be offed or not the question is what is that purpose it might not be so obvious or simple ned brought forward the credibility in cerseis childrens claim to the throne leading to the war of the five kings robb for intents and purposes was very successful in his campaign and what the north stands for unfortunately there were traitors in his midst as well as his own lack of foresight khal drogo wanted to give dany the power to take what she dreamed of in his death dany hatches her dragons oberyn wanted to avenge his sister and wanted everyone to know what happened to her he did
gameofthrones,removed,there are countless incidents in real life where someone has been stabbed several times and recovered easily because the cutsstabs did not bring harm to any vital organs like wise there are also incidents in real life when someone has been stabbed once and died moments later
gameofthrones,removed,the only big death i would think the deaths of ned robert robb catelyn all the stark men oberyn stannis tywin and joffrey were all pretty big
gameofthrones,removed,never doubt the healing power of penicillin tea soup
gameofthrones,removed,fuckin electoral college

gameofthrones,removed,as the guy who directed jons resurrection scene does he think jon snow came back as the same person or is he changed in ways we and maybe he dont understand
gameofthrones,removed,have my babies drools
gameofthrones,removed,how is it correct its been mentioned in the show that only a high septon can annul marriages and besides we have this line from lysa in season theyll execute that dwarf and youll be free to marry robin youll be the lady of the vale sounds like tyrion being alive is a bit of a hindrance if the marriage was instantly anulled simply because it was never consummated they should not have to hold off wedding sansa to robin until tyrion is executed
gameofthrones,removed,do you all hear that its the sound of hundreds of panties dropping
gameofthrones,removed,how the fuck do you get that big but still use is my real question hes like an incredibly ripped year old emo kid

gameofthrones,removed,gotta get that link karma huh op
gameofthrones,removed,who the fuck cares about infinite warfare
gameofthrones,removed,but i really wanted to know how to do a jon impression in under minutes or see futuristic jon photoshops
gameofthrones,removed,i honestly believe one of the dragons will be killed and resurrected by the whitewalkers and i feel like they will fly their way across the wall or maybe have the dragon breathe like frost fire or something that can break the wall everyone assuming we need to use dragons to fight white walkers could be jumping the gun what if all dragons fell to the white walkers and they were brought back as a wight
gameofthrones,removed,double posting to get double the karma shameful
gameofthrones,removed,lmao op i just posted this on the freefolk sub hours before you

gameofthrones,removed,as far as killing witnesses go the clintons might have more kills
gameofthrones,removed,wow it got deleted i think it made a joke that was something about the high sparrow and jaime saying they both would get angry because cersei wasnt cumming something like that

gameofthrones,removed,the golden company attacked storms end and is besieging it it is said that a garrison loyal to stannis is holding the castle
gameofthrones,removed,hmm with the trueborn male line of house baratheon extinguished i suppose storms end would pass to next of kin i think the closest known next of kin would have to be the estermonts though that is only through marriage im not super clear on the rules of inheritance but it would seem to make sense just go up the family tree until you find someone who has living descendants through a baratheon line joffery and his siblings are all dead robert and all his siblings are dead steffon had no siblings ormund had no brothers lyonel the laughing storms parents and siblings are not known this leads me to think that it would have to pass through the most recent baratheon female line which would be descendants of ormunds sisters it is unknown whether that line has survived to present day however this is why i would think estermonts could be wrong tho

gameofthrones,removed,and shes really sadistic with qyburn and his experiments its really creepy
gameofthrones,removed,i cant recommend erikson enough malazan is by far my favorite series i have one recommendation if you pick it up dont stop in book gardens of the moon even though the next book and subsequent ones were published in quick sucession he wrote the first one years before the second and how writing gets much better not that gardens is bad by any means but good becomes excellent in subsequent books also the complexity of the story dwarfs even asoiaf while the action and excitement starts right away youll barely even sniff the actual main plot until around book what im trying to say is that is not a series for a casual reader but if you have focus it is the most rewarding thing ive ever read the world be builds is second to none it is definitely high fantasy though gods demons world and reality altering powers abound i could sing malazans praises for days
gameofthrones,removed,that actress did actually do porn a while back lol
gameofthrones,removed,easily the worst character in the show worse than the bad poosay sand snakes i agree with most of your post but not sure shae was worse than them

gameofthrones,removed,my predictions dany and jon ruling together seems a given considering theyll end up sleeping together in this season coming plus theres got to be some meaning to the title ice and fire arya might die dont know how but i have a feeling shell die defending someone or be sacrificed by jon unknowingly sansa may become ruler of winterfell bran i feel is gonna become one of the dragon riders hell help dany regain viserion by warging into him thus fulfilling the bran will fly prediction he may end up becoming viserion permanently tyrion will become hand of dany and jon the hound will probably die in a showdown between him and mountain ocestrated by cersei accusing him of betraying joffrey by deserting blackwater and ordering the mountain to execute him littlefinger is definitely going to be executed by arya and the starks will learn ned died because of him also sansa will probably reveal he killed lysa and itll come out that robyn is his illegitimate son varys will still be master of spies brienne will be made commander of dany and jons kingsguard we know jamie will abandon cersei and head north he may likely join the fight against the white walkers and die defending the wall or die defending bran cersei will die most likely by tyrions hand sam will become a maester of the nights watch if it remains im betting the ww wont all be wiped up gilly and baby sam will go with him jorah will become lord commander of the nights watch davos im not sure i think hell be given some sort of honour by jon theon will die from what i read he abandons yara who gets captured by euron so that reformation hasnt worked out typical thats all i have so far
gameofthrones,removed,the fabric isnt the only thing that looks thick up top my man sorry
gameofthrones,removed,search the sub for cleganebowl for the full theory and all the hints in the books pointing towards sandor still being alive and then get hype
gameofthrones,removed,you should probably spoiler tag this this post is tagged
gameofthrones,removed,tor is funded by the us govt idiot
gameofthrones,removed,i agree with you is no conspiracy it makes no sense the starks are done and the umbers know it time to bite the bullet and join the boltons to take out the wildlings fuck it that asshole roose is dead lets get a fresh start with his son
gameofthrones,removed,george is a fatguy and he sucks at anything other than writing political intrigue
gameofthrones,removed,this is not reposted content please show me a link to it
gameofthrones,removed,but barristan varys and littlefinger were pardoned
gameofthrones,removed,is everyone forgetting the preview the umbers were still on ramsays side in the battle of the bastards not to mention that battle leak from the person who worked as an extra on set trust me i want shaggy to be alive as much as anyone but all signs point to umbers betraying starks
gameofthrones,removed,hes a poosey
gameofthrones,removed,watched first few minutes these are awesome im away to watch more thanks
gameofthrones,removed,now get hype
gameofthrones,removed,i would go gay for robb stark
gameofthrones,removed,if we compare to screenshots of the hound wearing the helmet and cross check against the dimensions of rory mccanns head and then use the measurements of the camera op has in hand then this helmet is too small conclusion that is not the real hounds helmet and the umbers are in on the great northern conspiracy
gameofthrones,removed,first d
gameofthrones,removed,im assuming we might see a certain pink letter appear
gameofthrones,removed,that was the coolest part of his armor i hope he puts it back on someday
gameofthrones,removed,hehe quentyn
gameofthrones,removed,still waiting for a reply or are you going to try and sweep this under the carpet because you dont want to admit that youre wrong
gameofthrones,removed,bayd puhssey
gameofthrones,removed,gthe hound
gameofthrones,removed,those rocks behind used to belong to a mountain cleganebowl confirmed get hype
gameofthrones,removed,because people also spent that time racking their brains with alternate theories like blj naj rldj etc because they couldnt believe that the answer could be that simple
gameofthrones,removed,birth of twins
gameofthrones,removed,giving birth to jon snow who is half targaryen
gameofthrones,removed,shes most likely giving birth since rhaegar is dead and shes being guarded by kingsguard
gameofthrones,removed,hodor is plowing her with his giant member
gameofthrones,removed,oh i know im just speaking from my own experience i started watching the show before i read the books and while just watching the show i started thinking about them bringing up lyanna and rhaegar and jon not knowing about his mother yada yada yada and i was like oh shit what if lyanna loved rhaegar rlj so i was so excited to get online and let everyone know that i figured out the truthturns out i was a little bit late lol
gameofthrones,removed,sadly s leakers are claiming she dies this season so i guess her story really isnt going anywhere truly
gameofthrones,removed,so if he said i dunno would the cop have just replied then you know bothing jon snow
gameofthrones,removed,your fucking kidding me right hundreds of people have been talking about this for a week now on this sub
gameofthrones,removed,ramsay wanted to confront stannis in open battle last season why wouldnt he do the same thing this season that is such a simpler solution to the problem than osha smuggles in a small army and takes the castle you might be overthinking this also set leaks revealed that tormund fights smalljon umber
gameofthrones,removed,op is looking for reasons they leave the castle considering ramsay wanted to leave the castle last season why isnt ramsays proclitivity for confronting the enemy on the open field which he did without any true strategic reason last season the most likely answer also the set leaks involving smalljon umber and tormund convince me that sj is truly on ramsays side plus the umbers do hate the wildlings in the books and i can certainly understand why they would fear a wildling army so close to their lands i think the show needed a way to bring rickon to winterfell since davos and skagos dont seem to exist
gameofthrones,removed,jeb
gameofthrones,removed,no shit sherlock
gameofthrones,removed,all men must fap
gameofthrones,removed,huh he doesnt look greek at all i thought he was latino
gameofthrones,removed,stop whining grow up pussy
gameofthrones,removed,see people complain that nothing has happened i can understand the complaint although i find the mereen story interesting but if something does its oh she was saved by dragons shes useless otherwise shes a mary sue etc etc and jon snow was resurrected by mel its fiction
gameofthrones,removed,some of the predictions suckclearly wrong
gameofthrones,removed,yeah robert was fooled because he wants to believe his best friend is just like him benjen would have known his brother would never believe he cheated on catelyn especially after he took over the marriage from his dead brother honor and respect for the dead and all that
gameofthrones,removed,not now boner
gameofthrones,removed,dany is the bad guy she is nuts and the anakin skywalker of this story for whatever reason the show has been terrible at getting this across like the books so all the way back to season someone being a dany fan was obvious that they havent read the books dany as mad and villain is the number one hope of dany haters some of them want it so much they went ahead and convinced themselves that it is already true and anyone who disagrees is a retard in denial the truth is dany is one of the main characters in this story one who will be extremely important in the end game and will probably turn the tables on all the westerosi characters people know and care all this talk of how her part doesnt matter andor boring is actually people projecting their fear about westeros onto dany because if she comes down with a massive army and three dragons to westeros none of the mind games and plots or characters will matter they will all be swept by her we are actually watching two ticking time bombs that will render all the games played in westeros moot and while the white walker time bomb promises an epic magical fight dany time bomb is an anticlimactic ending to all political games and thats the core of it really people care about westeros and want to see things about westeros the more dany drags in essos the less interested they are but the more she drags there they also see westeros only grows weaker for her to take as she inevitably grows stronger starting with season things went to stall where westeros slowly falls apart as she figures how to rule and chose how to handle problems its almost like game is rigged in her favor and we have been duped to love and care for the westerosi characters
gameofthrones,removed,spoilers ian mcshane confirmed it
gameofthrones,removed,a girl has the clap
gameofthrones,removed,i just posted about this i think that it will have a big importance to the end game of the show because as of now it has almost none
gameofthrones,removed,would still bang
gameofthrones,removed,am i the only one who doesnt want to see bloopers it really takes you out of the immersion of the series
gameofthrones,removed,i agree that the citadel would not be likely to try to cure jorah because of the risk he would cause i just think he may be desperate and figure its his last chance i dont really think hes going to be cured actually but i could definitely be wrong
gameofthrones,removed,oh its that faggot again
gameofthrones,removed,this guy has been posting jon is so stupid threads since he joined reddit just downvote and ignore him
gameofthrones,removed,ugh not another jerry martin romcom
gameofthrones,removed,i just wanna see dany and sansa make out and maybe press their titties together a bit its bittersweet because they can never birth an heir
gameofthrones,removed,its not porn its art
gameofthrones,removed,loved the fuck olly lol
gameofthrones,removed,yeah i was just thinking idaidt i drink and i drive things

gameofthrones,removed,awesome
gameofthrones,removed,jon could not be sword of morning the targeryn dayne marriage is or generations back maester aemons mom was a dayne in the book that is generations back per the the episode where jon learns aemon is a targ its three as they seem to omit the existence of jaeharys ii and make aerys the son of aegom the unlikely aemons brother instead of aegon the unlikely grandson the sword of the morning can only be passed to a knigjt of house dayne house is partilenial from the father unless there are no male heirs of the mothers house then a second son or the husband can take the wifes houses name a husband taking a wifes house name is how the first men house lannister became the andal house lannister after the andal invasion
gameofthrones,removed,most people cant read the books and show go through a lot of pains to explain that it is written down in the nights watch library but no one cares thinks theyre fairy tale stories and ignores sam the only person who bothered to read the history
gameofthrones,removed,this is not how you put spoilers come on theres a fucking guide in the sidebar
gameofthrones,removed,killing white walker didnt convince me either delete your account pls
gameofthrones,removed,wrong sub you fucking weeb
gameofthrones,removed,its been confirmed by leaks and you can also see it in the trailer that davos finds out how shireen dies as he visits the site of the burning but no fuck dd right
gameofthrones,removed,i predict more shitty tv show writing
gameofthrones,removed,even the poosay
gameofthrones,removed,no he is dead this has been brought up almost once a day ever since he died lol it was confirmed in an interview with dd and the guy that madedirected that episode they all said they he is dead brienne did kill him they just decided against showing the death but they said and i quote we chose not to show him dying but we are sure the fans will realize what happened so he is dead and he is not coming back in a related interview the guy who played stannis said that he was ready to leave since he never really understood the character or the show i wish i still had the links to those interviews
gameofthrones,removed,ramsaytheon no catelynjamie no ramsaysansa no high septoncersei no high septonmargaery no and baelishsansa is just ew to me
gameofthrones,removed,well you need to remember that davos and shireen had a strong connection stannis knew this and sent him to castle black knowing if he didnt davos would have tried to stop him and potentially forced stannis to kill davos too davos knowing shireen was most likely going to be sacrificed probably agreed to leave thinking i cant bare to watch and does stannis really have it in him to kill his own daughter i think theres a small pinch of hope in davos that stannis doesnt go through with it
gameofthrones,removed,ramsay marries rickon to garner legitimacy as the new warden of the north but ramsay doesnt rape rickon to consummate the marriage this time around the viewers are instead treated to seconds of the most consensual homosexual sex in the history of the known world followed by an additional seconds of dildo play with the taxidermied cock of theon greyjoy
gameofthrones,removed,two swords one was dawn the other was a kingsguard sword hightower was pictured with whent or daynes actor on set so either he is yet to be shown or was deleted from the series
gameofthrones,removed,original thread here what a joke how is this considered fan art i cant find a single image online when i reverse search why arent we allowed to post potential leaks
gameofthrones,removed,found the woman
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think jon left castle black yet he wouldnt leave without davos mel and tormund and there are leaked pictures from episode that show those three still at castle black
gameofthrones,removed,i dont think jon left castle black yet he wouldnt leave without davos mel and tormund and there are leaked pictures from episode that show those three still at castle black
gameofthrones,removed,id still bang it
gameofthrones,removed,meh shes not even that pretty could have picked a better looking girl to go back on some a big promise with haha
gameofthrones,removed,called everyone bastards and names
gameofthrones,removed,legally or illegally
gameofthrones,not_removed,i read the books first and as a consequence i cannot stand sansa im totally biased against her because of the books to the point where i cannot even see how shes portrayed in a sympathetic light
gameofthrones,not_removed,all of the show characters are either clear good or bad with straightened character arcs to make them more appealing and sympathetic to masses this happened to both sansa and daenerys sansa in books have very interesting character arc from a selfish immature year old girl who dreamed of becoming queen and having a royale palace and other fairy tale stuff to a growing adult who is being used as pawn by others politically to someone who is starting to take situations in her own hands she is much more developed character then the show am i wrong here does the tone for her povs change she is one of my favorite characters in book as her character arc is very unique from the rest her povs changes drastically as situations around her keeps getting worse and her character develops a lot during these povs finally she doesnt seem to respect jon why should she
gameofthrones,not_removed,sansa is a young version of her mother at this point her resentment towards jon stems purely from her idol her lady mother hating jon for existing the rest of her being is dictated by the songs she loves of great knights and love and happy endings for everyone she believes her life to become such a song as well and is heavily encouraged by her septa to believe in this there is a provocative article on the subject of sansa in the first book found that sheds light on the situation from a different point of view regarding what is expected of sansa as the future queen of westeros its a bit over the top in blaming ned who probably had little to no idea of how the court in kings landing works but does a good job showing the dilemma sansa finds herself in youll be pleased to hear though that she just like every other pov character has a lot of development ahead of her
gameofthrones,not_removed,when i read first book i had same thought but i read book first and i was surprised when i saw sansa in show
gameofthrones,not_removed,the show portrays all of this as well she lies about arya and her friend hurting joffrey even when lady pays the price she blames arya and neds for ladys death instead of taking any responsibility she is snarky and rude to jon many times before they part ways and hateful towards arya consistently even now in the late seasons she distrust jon even after confronting pyter
gameofthrones,not_removed,book sansa is a far more interesting character in my opinion not a slight against the show writing or sophie turner but most of sansas really interesting developments are all mental
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think sansa gonna killbetray jon for king in da north title she look fishy to me especially after that little talk by the tree that cries with blood with littlefinguh i would be cautious of her
gameofthrones,not_removed,shes supposed to come up as this stuck up bitch who believes the world is a perfect place of knights songs and flowers and gets ticked off everytime she has to face reality a large aspect of her journey is breaking this fantasy and coming to terms with realism
gameofthrones,not_removed,please tag your spoilers
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol sansa turning into a littlefinger can you imagine a jonsansa conversation next season involving making a decision jon so what do u think sansa every time im faced with a decision i close my eyes and see the same picture whenever i consider an action i ask myself will this action help to make this picture a realitehh pull it out of my mind and into the world and i only act if the answer is yes a picture of me on mother and fathers chambers and no one by my side jon well uhmm ok
gameofthrones,not_removed,same here from the start i had zero sympathy for her the show didnt really change that for me i still feel this undertone of selfish wants and her being ovely critical and judgemental about people its just that shes learning what characteristics to look for now after being surrounded by so many scoundrels now she has some real world experience being on the receiving end of manipulative and violent people it hasnt softened her perspective on why not to judge others i think its taught her how to be more like them
gameofthrones,not_removed,finally she doesnt seem to respect jon why should she i would put it slightly differently and say sansa treats jon like shit she doesnt have to have respect for him but she should at the very fucking least treat him with respect instead of like dirt according to what everyone believes its not his fault their father fucked around its basically just a massive character flaw sansa has no respect for anyone she considers beneath her
gameofthrones,not_removed,selfish immature year old girl shes actually or in the first book which further explains her behavior she is a victim of having to grow up too fast and so there are going to be rough edges in her character making her a more interesting and complex character
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks for the thoughtful post reply as for her respecting jon i mean this it seems she only thinks of him as a bastard and not much more there seems to be no love for him he surely loves her
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think she will betray jon and be found out but littlefinger willl take the fall for her and say he forced her to do it so only lf will be executed and sansa will just be exiled or something i cant see jon killing her maybe arya would though ive heard that theory
gameofthrones,not_removed,its basically just a massive character flaw sansa has no respect for anyone she considers beneath her she is a year old daughter of a lord who is being groomed to be a lady like her mother her mother doesnt respect jon why should she he is just a bastard its only a character flaw if you love jon and think everyone should love him in that universe he is just another bastard and sansa is just another in her head princess
gameofthrones,not_removed,i checked she is my bad i did read books few years back
gameofthrones,not_removed,he surely loves her he respects her family theres a difference between that and loving someone he loves arya jon and sansa are not close at all and as i said before she is an amateur girl with princess dreams she surely doesnt respect jon and thats not a big deal in that universe she is supposed to be a lady like her mother thats what her focus is in book
gameofthrones,not_removed,and sansa is just another in her head princess thats my point ned robb arya the majority of the other characters at winterfell treats him at least with a little bit of respect when he gets to the wall its a massive adjustment to him because other than sansa and catelyn hes not used to the disrespect
gameofthrones,not_removed,no it is a massive character flaw no matter what people should basically be nice to others even highborn ladies deserve some sort of good manners dont they she is selfish and immature in the beginning and stays this way i can see no character development just becoming littlefingers spawn in the end

gameofthrones,not_removed,wellno shitright
gameofthrones,not_removed,another game of thrones article that says absolutely nothing more click bait i wonder how much click bait can be attributed to the show and book i used to google winds of winter everyday thinking i would find that magical announcement i would find multiple websites that would speak in generalities and never have any actual news unless hbo released something which most fans already knew about all these sights release articles every week or more just to keep on top of the news feed in google no shit its gonna be epic

gameofthrones,not_removed,wow these are really awesome
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you d
gameofthrones,not_removed,well to be fair grrm hasnt killed hodoryet
gameofthrones,not_removed,the thing that made it hard for me was that hodor was the one of the only characters that didnt have an agenda his only point in his life was to protect bran and ofc hold the door
gameofthrones,not_removed,i bet hodor and samwell would have been best buddies if fate had not torn hodor asunder before the meeting
gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor was probably the most lovable good natured character ever perfect reason to kill him off no one is safe not even the guys who can only say one word
gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor served his purpose you cant expect characters to be safe just because theyre good natured
gameofthrones,not_removed,not only didnt grrm kill him yet but i didnt think he was a great character in the books he didnt stand out to me the show made him more memorable mostly because tvmovies are a different medium than books characters get developed differently that said even in the show i wasnt a big fan maybe ive just seen waaaaay too many showsmovies and the big lug character was meant for me
gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor
gameofthrones,not_removed,hello welcome to game of thrones
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes yes white walkers and whatnot but that just means someone who knows him will have to kill him
gameofthrones,not_removed,the thing that made it hard for me was that hodor was the one of the only characters that didnt have an agender agenda at first read i was likehodor is obviously a man
gameofthrones,not_removed,why anyway hodor and sam have met
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah but its more heart breaking when they do die
gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor is still alive in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,what meant was that dd killed hodor not grrm
gameofthrones,not_removed,hhaahahahah good one agenda ofc d
gameofthrones,not_removed,as king he can legitimize himself as a true stark no one would oppose that except maybe littlefinger whether he will or not im not sure i want him to but hes always had trouble seeing himself as a stark even though thats something hes wanted all his life and by being proclaimed king he might have proven to himself that he doesnt need to be a stark to be worthy
gameofthrones,not_removed,i doubt hell take the stark name honestly his followers have made it clear they are okay with a bastard as king in the north and consider him to be a part of even the head of certainly the military commander of house stark it just doesnt seem necessary as for the future maybe hell take a page out of the blackfyres book and call himself jon of house longclaw
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes he could go with house stargaryan seriously though i agree that he may have reservations about naming himself a stark not only because of his history with the name but also because he took winterfell back from a legitimatized bastard id like to see him take tyrions advice and embrace his last name call it house snow hes shown himself to be willing to challenge the status quo and making a bastard name into a house could have repercussions throughout westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe his own housetyrion told jon to think that being a bastard should be your armour and in a sense it embodies you
gameofthrones,not_removed,im pretty sure bran will eventually come to winterfell and tell him the truth
gameofthrones,not_removed,well weve had karstark as much as itd fit for him to be lord snowking snow i dont think he will maybe in the show because its a bastard name i think hed possibly pick a new name house winter perhaps
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love your question can he even do that i got a better question whos gonna tell the king he cant do that
gameofthrones,not_removed,he can legitimize himself or not im not sure this is something king snow is spending a lot of time thinking about the most practical thing is to call himself jon stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i think hell marry sansa and get her name that way in the original draft jon and arya were supposed to be in love it seems like show sansa is taking over more of the arya bit there is a precedence joffrey lydden adopted the name lannister upon marrying the heiress of that house as lydden was less important than lannister id imagine sansa will make jon take her name and he will finally be a stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,he learns that he is a targaryan bastard and creates a new name for himself jon of house whytefyre
gameofthrones,not_removed,he wont do it its something that he would have taken if it was given to him imo but not something he would take himself its a small distinction but an important one
gameofthrones,not_removed,it wont matter eventually when howland reed shows up robbs will will be revealed which legitimized jon as a true stark and named him robbs successor as king in the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,what could littlefinger
gameofthrones,not_removed,what about starkfyre
gameofthrones,not_removed,he wont need it if hes no longer a bastard
gameofthrones,not_removed,a new theory for the house motto winter is coming so now winter has arrived
gameofthrones,not_removed,i am dakingindanorf and i dont listen to what peasants say lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,wolfyre maybe
gameofthrones,not_removed,they cant only a king can do that
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats the coolest house name i have ever heard
gameofthrones,not_removed,much better
gameofthrones,not_removed,he might get sansa to give him her name in another way
gameofthrones,not_removed,well technically sansa bran or even jon himself can legitimize jon as stark and with a royal decree the north is an independent kingdom with house stark as their monarch since robb declared kitn and since both house stark and loyalist families regardless how few of them did not recognized the reinstalling of the baratheon lannister rule over the north as house bolton serving as its overlord or warden the official monarch status continues contested overthrown in exile and now back in power and if jon is a bastard with no right to inherit and bran presumed death sansa will be the successor and hence has the right to royal decree to legitimize jon same goes for bran if he returns and even for jon as he has no legitimacy problem with sansa at her sight not contesting his status and with popular support so he is basically in a position to name himself whatever he wishes including stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,roose had a royal decree
gameofthrones,not_removed,it would be cool because shes literally the last person who would want to but shed be a good ruler shell know her subjects well she lived as a highborn lady as a beggar as a servant she can relate to almost anyone she has a strong sense of justice the most important quality in a ruler she knew hunger and fear so she would care for the small people she learned to see with her eyes which means she wont be blind to what happens in the realm as most kings tend to do she is my favorite character so as long as shes not dead im all for it
gameofthrones,not_removed,she has shadowed almost all the best characters too ned tywin the hound jaquen i feel like shes carrying a part from each of these men and becoming a incredible person well see how it goes
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,to be fair jon lost a sense of duty when stannis offered jon the proposition to ascend as jon stark and become lord of winterfell jon refused as his duty held him to the nights watch yet when he was resurrected he took the easy way out with the until death loophole in fact he was already planning on simply heading south until sansa arrived
gameofthrones,not_removed,nah jon knew it was a trap but he had to try anyway from acok jon vii a man is never so vulnerable in battle as when he flees lord eddard had told jon once a running man is like a wounded animal to a soldier it gets his bloodlust up so yeah there is no way jon was going to head back towards his army rather than charging forward
gameofthrones,not_removed,each time they come back they lost a part of their soul they feel that but that doesnt mean they become evil
gameofthrones,not_removed,this also could have made an interesting scene with sansa afterwards when she asks why jon didnt try to help rickon nope sansa already knew that rickon was a goner he even told jon about it the night before the battle
gameofthrones,not_removed,that would make no sense if that was the justification hes riding with his sister and had up to that point demonstrated he wanted to save his family it just has no respect for jons motivations to make that happen its just a matter of how intelligently he attempts to save him
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the thing he lost was hope sansa had to convince him to fight and he only did it because of his love for family and his desire to protect loved ones i mean he literally did what he thought was right and was killed for it if that doesnt spell hopelessness idk what does also the show writers explain the botb as a rebirth of jon mentally and spiritually so that could possibly mean a rebirth of his hope
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think that its a fairly well spread and accepted theory that jons soul mightve went into ghost as he was dead which could possibly spare him the side effects of death
gameofthrones,not_removed,it also would have likely made the northmen a lot more conflicted about declaring jon king in the north a man who coldly watches while his brother is cut down while theres even a chance he might be able to save him is not the type of guy the north tends to respect
gameofthrones,not_removed,they didnt need to create some crazy change jon had gone through his change was that he was scared and pathetic he didnt regain his composure until after the battle was started
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought him leaving had to do more with his brothers killing him yes they were executed but that would leave anybody a bit salty
gameofthrones,not_removed,he starts charging after rickon dies because of the arrows that ramseys men shoot behind him forcing him to move forward not because he would be more vulnerable doing so
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the books that would make sense but the show hasnt shown his connection and possible warging with ghost at all
gameofthrones,not_removed,before his death jon probably would have left castle black and go to the other castles but to leave the nights watch entirely its a bold move considering everyone aware that the long night is approaching jon would have still thought of a way to still keep doing the good fight instead of simply running away like he planned
gameofthrones,not_removed,being killed by your own brothers is like not being invited to a friends get together and finding out about it through social media
gameofthrones,not_removed,cant it be both retreating would have been more dangerous both physically and strategically i can certain imagine a person running back regardless of the arrows if they panicked
gameofthrones,not_removed,no since the director purposely showed the arrows falling behind him as he ran forward clearly conveying ramseys strategy
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wouldnt put too much effort into an architectural analysis of winterfell the nearly flat roofs would be terrible for a place that got any amount of snow theyd collapse under the weight of it in real life any place that gets a lot of snow has steep roofs for this reason they just went with the design they did because it looked cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,round buildings are stronger
gameofthrones,not_removed,supposedly curved walls will deflect siege weapon fire better than flat walls that would bear the brunt of the fire
gameofthrones,not_removed,snow really only falls under very specific weather conditions if the winters are really cold there wouldnt be a lot of snow anyway
gameofthrones,not_removed,at least this is kind of a unique question and not something thats been asked times this week alone
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the issue is that even book readers have no idea how it will end now we are all in the same boat
gameofthrones,not_removed,sorry for correcting you but i live in canada and we get some pretty hefty amounts of snow in some regions here and we will have flat top buildings all over the place while a slanted roof will of course allow for less snow to stack up on a structure a structure can easily be made stronger to account for that extra weight its not an ideal design but calling it terrible is a stretch
gameofthrones,not_removed,and you can send your squire around the corner to get the breastplate stretcher
gameofthrones,not_removed,correct a circle will not collapse in on itself like a square also a spiral staircase gives defenders a tactical advantage
gameofthrones,not_removed,at this point the booksshow is just making the wait and the desire even worse every ounce of new material i read or theories just fuels my inner fire to see the ending this is one of the greatest fantasy seriess of all time game of thrones has met starwars in my own personal expanded nerdverse
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah but in canada you dont really get the snows winterfell gets during winter
gameofthrones,not_removed,with modern knowledge of construction and materials youre right i have a feeling if they were building castles in canada in the middle ages they probably wouldve done steep roofs
gameofthrones,not_removed,im in the south and weve got a couple times further up north is a small winter if winterfell gets more their walls arent high enough
gameofthrones,not_removed,as a canadian i think you underestimate how much snow we get especially up north or in the snowbelts around the great lakes not all of canada is toronto ottawa got record snowfall this past winter with in one day thats ft in in places like quebec city an average winter is feet of snow thats farther north than most canadians ever go and yet still a pretty modest latitude it doesnt hold a candle to what they get up north the canadian record for snowfall in one season goes to mount copeland bc in the winter of with of snow which is inches or feet and inches in one winter and thats still around the same latitude as calgary obviously asoiaf is a fantasy setting with magical seasons and you can handwave and say castle black got eleventy thousand inches of snow or something but its kind of asinine to act like canada doesnt get big snows
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not your buddy guy
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont chirp me bud
gameofthrones,not_removed,you actually look more like harry potter
gameofthrones,not_removed,shouldve gone as syrio a man has his hair

gameofthrones,not_removed,i wonder if he ever communicated with varys there are a lot of similarities between the characters but it might just be a coincidence both had mastery of a vast network of spies varys called his little birds both had the good of the realm at heart ive been curious about the voice that spoke to varys when his parts were thrown in the fire could that have been something to do with bloodraven takes off tinfoil hat who knows
gameofthrones,not_removed,i get it grey worm and varys are eunuchs and dany and missandei are chicks

gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think tywin would have let the faith militant situation happen he would have either shut down cersei before she armed them or slaughtered them all the moment they took loras hes a fair bit smarter than cersei and tougher than tommen
gameofthrones,not_removed,he wouldnt have given a fuck about the faith he would have marched the lannister army into kl and demanded jaime to be set free or would have freed him by force
gameofthrones,not_removed,well if tywin was alive the faith militant wouldve never been restored the show doesnt really go into too much detail about it but the faith militant are really powerful they managed to hold off against maegor the cruel for a very long time when he tried to take away their power it was only through negotioations that his successor jaehaerys managed to keep the faith protected in return for them not having their own force cersei the idiot she is decided to restore them because she is so easily manipulated anyone else wouldve seen the dangers as shouldve cersei especially considering her kids claims to the throne and incest that she has commited at the time in the books it is the height of cerseis power she has kicked out any good alliance and any good councillors from kings landing she doesnt trust pycelle she has kicked out the whole reach lords the worst decision was to kick out kevan lannister who wouldve told her she was a dumb bitch and not allowed it even jaime who isnt present thinks its a dumb decision lets say tywin somehow allowed it he wouldve marched on the high sparrow and killed everyone cersei or jaime it wouldnt have mattered maegor has however shown that you cant disband the faiths militant with force however hed have to figure out some way to turn the power back to the iron throne hed might have to send cersei to the silent sisters or disinherit her jaime is already sworn to the kingsguard so he is disinherited maybe hed have to be sent to the wall or do something honestly its such a dumb fucking idea to rearm them because of how hard it is to take the power back from them
gameofthrones,not_removed,if tywin was alive the faith wouldve never came into power
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah the faith was only in a position to imprison cersei because she was silly enough to empower them in the first place without thinking of the consequences tywin kept everybody else in check the high septom was easily controlled through his vices like whoring and drinking even the likes of little finger had to watch his actions when tywin was around
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think if its ever going to happen itll be this season this season or never the recurring theme weve seen so far for season has been going backwards to move forward we saw it with dany and the dothraki theon and the ironborne sansa and jon and winterfell arya and her identity benjens return everything about the riverlands etc given this i still find it very unlikely but it might be in the realm of possibility if hes not back by the end of this season though ill finally give up i swear it by the old gods new gods one true god and the many faced god
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think arya will kill the waif and sail to westeros jaqen doesnt seem to have any interest in killing arya at all i wish jaqen was syrio or there was a purpose from the beginning for aryas training but the odds are too few
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think its a common mistake to believe that the faceless are cliché assassins that hunt done anyone who does not want to belong to them or who could tell their secrets in fact they are well known to everyone so why should they kill someone who does not want to belong to them this is no secret order i also think we should remember what jacquen says all day a girl must make a choice and the manyfaced god will get his life one way or another this are in my opinion no direct threats the only real threat i read from this line is that arya will become no faceless man if he does not take her final chance but that does not mean they will hunt her down and kill her it could just mean she can go but cannot come back im not even sure if her contract was meant to be fulfilled it was too well tailored for arya and seemingly given to her to bring up old memories and feelings
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree the house of bw is not a secret order but i think they want to revenge because arya betrayed them twice the first time she stole a face and we know that isnt allowed the second time she said to a victim lady crane that the young actress paid to kill her so i think they want to kill arya only because she cheats on them especially the waif theres only one thing that i cant understand why is allowed to the waif to revenge on arya the waif is no one she shouldnt have any desire sorry for bad mistakes im italian probably i wrote something wrong
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes the stolen face could be a problem even if the bill was payed by the death of someone else and she also payed for her mistake by getting blind for some weeks so im not sure if this is still on the table i also dont understand this tests completely they are tests anything can happen how can someone expect to get the result he wants from such a test is this some kind of special offer you get it for a lower price if you let a trainee do the job i mean the faceless man are known for a nearly success rate how is this justified if they let a trainee do this job this has to be staged in some way i also have my problems with the waif she shouldnt have this desire for some reason she thinks that arya is some kind of competition or why should she hate her so much the reason for this could be that the waif is also still in training and no full member of the faceless man maybe its not only a test for arya but also a test for the waif there are so many contradictions im pretty sure there is much more to it than we see right now i dont want to believe that arya is just going to flee and gets hunted by the faceless man forever this would be a too simple solution for all this mysteries
gameofthrones,not_removed,hahahhaits pretty funny seems like today special offer pay the half of the price and you have the half of the chance to be satisfied on your request by the way in dd we trust maybe theres no contradictions but only another great story i hope

gameofthrones,not_removed,the high sparrow has shown time and time again that he is several moves ahead cersei made the point that she essentially has an invincible champion and thus i fully expect the high sparrow to make trial by combat irrelevant
gameofthrones,not_removed,you know all things considered im starting to think there wont even be a trial by combat who on the faiths side can really stand a chance against zombie gregor unless the hound makes a return the trial will probably get interrupted dont think cersei would get let off the hook so easy
gameofthrones,not_removed,due to the season trailer when lancel and some of his gang members encounters cersei and the mountain with the phrase step a side or there will be violence i feel that that will be a likely doom for lancel that scene could also refer to cersei and her companions take tommen to their custody and they are coming to free the king
gameofthrones,not_removed,the high sparrow knows full well that cersei would be almost guaranteed to win a trial by combat with the mountain hes very smart and will already have found a way to deny her one it wont happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,the faith might name tommen as their champion and cersei will get fucked
gameofthrones,not_removed,the hound
gameofthrones,not_removed,tommen
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know its awful hard to come back from having your face squished in but oberyn martell pascal played him perfectly would love to see him join forces with the queen of thorns
gameofthrones,not_removed,khal drogo he was supposed to be such a feared warrior and we never got to see him in a real battle scene it would have dramatically changed the story but man id love to see him fight on screen
gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor
gameofthrones,not_removed,i understand a lot of the issues with it but robb he was my favorite character and his weakness was that he was emotional i feel like thats somewhat forgivable as that is most peoples weakness in real life i love the dude and would love to have him back
gameofthrones,not_removed,rickon i dont get why he needed to die or maybe margaery she was one of the better characters in terms of her character for lack of a better word but i definitely want rhaegar fucking back hes got a shitload to explain
gameofthrones,not_removed,tywin for sure say what you want about the guy but he was the most stable ruler by a country mile
gameofthrones,not_removed,margaery probably it would be great if she came back and the remaining tyrells could rally to form their own interdany faction maybe switch sides to jon if jon wins a battle or something actually margaeryjon would be a strong marriage alliance
gameofthrones,not_removed,as much as i hate him joffrey just so we can watch him be killed again this time slower
gameofthrones,not_removed,wun wun make him captain of the winterfell castle guard not technically a person i guess but close enough

gameofthrones,not_removed,margaret tyrell gets my vote she had the most promise out of all the characters to seriously compete against and undermine cersei i really wish she had lasted longer and rose to be the queen of thorns
gameofthrones,not_removed,old nan just because i want to hear more of her stories
gameofthrones,not_removed,shireen baratheon just because her death was the worst for me
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned would fucking win the entire story if he came back the only reason he ate shit so early was because at the time of his journey to kings landing there were still hundreds of moving pieces all about westeros and he hadnt witnessed the atrocities that happened in all seasons to understand how carefully he had to posture himself he wasnt a slouch politically speaking but he was still in kind of a semihoneymoon phase upon arrival so he wasnt ready at all for the crap flying his way revive ned now and hell not only be much more prepared to wage a dirty war while maintaining his values all the pieces have also pretty much fallen into place the north would either welcome him back with open arms as their top dog or jon would remain the king of the north and appoint ned as a second in command the clout ned had in his life will more than surely help to rally the people of the north even further than jon already has and with that kind of power not even the skeevy rats back in kings landing could hope to contest them despite having been out of the game for many years now id say ned still has way more experience than any of his children at leadership so the inevitable war with the lannisters and meeting with daenerys will go much smoother and with less doubt his having been dead for so long will also undoubtedly have given him some insight into the supernatural side to the universe which would prove more than useful in the final battle against the whitewalkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned always ned choice would be robb those are just emotional picks tho story wise i would love to see tywin react to a new kingindanorf formed under neds stark bastard with the vale in his armys a broken down riverlands with the freys dead and the targaryen girl that has been scaring him since season finally moving vs westeros with the tyrels and dorne at her side tywin planning vs robb is what made season so good to me and i would love to see him plan and scheme vs jon an danny
gameofthrones,not_removed,rhaegar allegedly an amazing swordsman poet musician and quite the looker he would take the white walkers seriously he would be king a father to jon and a big brother to dany

gameofthrones,not_removed,the one true king
gameofthrones,not_removed,aeris because fuck sephiroth oh waitwrong sub
gameofthrones,not_removed,barristan the fucking bold
gameofthrones,not_removed,jeor mormont dude left his own thrown on bear island for his son whos is now banished from westeros joined the knights watch rose ranks and promoted to lord commander only to be stabbed in the back by his own men kinda wish they gave him a bit more screen time at his death or at least to pass on the message to sam that he wanted jorah to join the nightswatch
gameofthrones,not_removed,the legend of gin alley ofcourse
gameofthrones,not_removed,has to be hodor that poor poor soul
gameofthrones,not_removed,barristan selmy or margaery
gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor or margaery
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is very complicated i would bring back almost everyone you already mentioned but to settle for one that would advance the story the most that would be margaery she was pretty much the westerosi version of daenerys smart able to make hard decisions but also caring for the people
gameofthrones,not_removed,ollie so jon can hang the little prick again
gameofthrones,not_removed,while i really want to say ned without his death a lot of what has happened would have gone much differently i would have to go with robb or drogo to have robb see what his sisters have become what his brothers have become it would be beautifully tragic the interaction i would most like to see would be robb and jon in the godswood of winterfell if we had current jon snow and robb stark teamed up in winterfell again the others wouldnt stand a fooking chance and as someone below mentioned we never even really got to see drogo fight i personally want to see how that flowing ponytail was earned and we that would mean we would probably have a very different mindset for khaleesi and another targ child which would be dooooooope
gameofthrones,not_removed,ros magnificent breasts
gameofthrones,not_removed,iygrid
gameofthrones,not_removed,hard decision certain characters i think it would do more harm than good oberyn so we have a good character from dorne wun wun cause giants are awesome and i want to see him hang out with tormund more and see tyrions face when he sees a giant and realizes that speech he gave jon about fairytales was arrogant and ignorant ned would just be cruel like someone else said itd be great to have him back but you bring him back now his eldest son robb and wife cat brutally murdered rickon is dead arya not the same girl and all sansa has been through hed be devastated and blame himself tywin would be interesting but futile as the lannisters wont matter by the end of in the grand scheme now doran would be good another good dornish character jon arryn no real point lord commander jeor mormont he could lead the watch again and convince jorah to take the black robb stark would complicate things in the north would he or wouldnt he just step aside for jon catlyn stark love michelle fairley but no reason for her to be back unless she becomes you know who fuck the boltons the blackfish he would have been a great general for the north and important family member for arya and sansa too bad he didnt see it that way rhaegar would be cool and with how vague it was maybe he isnt really dead drogo would be legit he could really lead the dothraki and i wanna see momoa fight the wights barristan selmy would be great but i would say his sacrifice was good eapecially after his speech to daenerys about rhaegar and the people of kingslanding mance rayder would be interesting but unnecessary as i believe jon and tormund are fullfilling that role now together the one i would really like to see is ser arthur dayne maybe he isnt really dead and is in hiding in dorne somewhere he would onow who jon is and having the sword of the morning fighting beside azor ahai against the white walkers would be awesome have him give a speech kinda like barristan gave daeny in essos when he first showed up like i failed your family before i will never fail them again
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned
gameofthrones,not_removed,catelyn stark and i want her as stoneheart whispering throw a cut windpipe and hanging freys i also want her to see jon targarien as kingindanorf
gameofthrones,not_removed,the king in the north pulls sword out of sheath and kneels
gameofthrones,not_removed,id like to see either catelyn stark since in the books shes revived as lady stoneheart or rickon stark just because i feel bad for the guy and melisandre could have jumped into the crypts and brought him back as a way of saying no hard feelings to jon
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned fucking stark what the fuck kind of a question is this
gameofthrones,not_removed,catelyn stark not even as stoneheart i just want cat back
gameofthrones,not_removed,cat
gameofthrones,not_removed,arthur dayne
gameofthrones,not_removed,what about jon arryn this whole thing really took off when lysa poisoned him the vale is one of the most militaristically functional regions in westeros right now he had a hand in raising both ned and bobby baratheon for calming impulsive powers for making objectively analytical decisions i can only imagine what kind of pieces he could move if alive if anyone could foster relations between jon and dany for the benefit of westeros i bet he could and would do it the amount hes seen what he knows so valuable
gameofthrones,not_removed,doran martell had so much potential
gameofthrones,not_removed,robert baratheon back in shape montage followed by meeting and legitimizing gendry final scene of the episode is both suited up in baratheon armor on horseback with war hammers slung over their backs looking down on kings landing from that hill everyone looks at it from
gameofthrones,not_removed,the sword of the morning
gameofthrones,not_removed,the boar
gameofthrones,not_removed,oberyn martel for sure if not him then ned
gameofthrones,not_removed,oberyn he was such an awesome character he died in the most horrible gruesome way i would have loved to have seen more of him
gameofthrones,not_removed,robb robb and jon would unite the north theyre both good fighters and great strategists but it would also unite the stark children sorry rickon
gameofthrones,not_removed,gendry rip
gameofthrones,not_removed,meryn trant i loved the dude no seriously i want stannis his death just made no sense
gameofthrones,not_removed,oberyn so he can get ellaria and the sand snakes in line and lead the martell army into war it bothered me so much to see the martell sigil flying in daenerys fleet given the fact that there is no martell to lead them this would also allow the hound to go north with the bwb and oberyn could get a second short at justice from the mountain
gameofthrones,not_removed,now this is a hard question to answer because there are a few dead characters i want to see come back perhaps oberyn it would be awesome to see that character again and also to see how he would react to finding out his lover killed his brother only catch is he has no head another person id like to see comeback is stannis maybe brienne never cut his head off and told him to run away and maybe he died later somewhere else from his wounds and mel resurrect him it be cool to see how he would react to jon taking winterfell maybe he would side with dany only reason i cant see him coming back is at he has no real reason to at this point in the story however the one dead character i want to see revealed to be still alive is rhaegar targaryen it would fit the story there would be no catch to it and he would help make an alliance between dany and his son jon and like i said it fits the story
gameofthrones,not_removed,rhaegar
gameofthrones,not_removed,ygritte
gameofthrones,not_removed,rhaegar targaryen rip sweet prince
gameofthrones,not_removed,season daario
gameofthrones,not_removed,oberon
gameofthrones,not_removed,oberyn martell hed give cersei the fate she deserves and replace her as king of the shadethrowers
gameofthrones,not_removed,i might bring book robb stark back but not tv robb stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,tesla
gameofthrones,not_removed,m a r g a e r y t y r e l l
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just want him to see the man that jon grew to be
gameofthrones,not_removed,he would die of sadness knowing his wife and firstborn died his youngest son is around somewhere on the other side of the wall and his youngest daughter is nowhere to be seen
gameofthrones,not_removed,throw in yara and youve got yourself a treat
gameofthrones,not_removed,id love to see how he responds to his widow and daughters killing his brother and nephew
gameofthrones,not_removed,wouldve been really cool to she him fight along danys army
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a theme in the story though many characters die either ironically or with a poetic twist ned is killed for being a traitor genius tactician rob is lured into a trap imageobsessed tywin gets killed taking a dump etc
gameofthrones,not_removed,drogo v mountain
gameofthrones,not_removed,well he was kinda revived
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wish rhaego was alive more than khal drogo he would have impeded her progress more than anything the power she can gain by marryingaligning with another house would be tremendous she already has the dothraki behind her so he doesnt offer much plus nobody would have taken him seriously
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh dont worry hell come back as a wight
gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor
gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree would really love to see what wouldve come of robb and the northmen had the red wedding not happened and to see how it wouldve turned out with him going north to moat cailin to try and take back the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes and yes robb did mistakes stupid ones and he paid for it in a huge way it breaks my heart everytime i think about him he tried to be the best out of the huge responsibility that was put in his shoulders he was the first kitn in years and his end came in such a way even his body didnt even go back to winterfell he paid for being his father he paid for doing what was honorable
gameofthrones,not_removed,his weakness was that he had no political strategy or sense
gameofthrones,not_removed,what did he find in that book to make him put it down and pick up a sword
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cant figure out why the little idiot ran in a straight line just begging for an arrow arrows fly straight so maybe zig or zag
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think rickon ever even needed to exist in the first place his death was the least consequential in the entire series
gameofthrones,not_removed,id bring rickon back only to ask him why he didnt run serpentine or behind the burning crosses to hide stupid kid
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was thinking this the other day out of the ten last people to be in charge of kings landing the only chance of stability was under tywin
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just want to see charles dance again what a great actor for that role
gameofthrones,not_removed,more natalie dormer yes
gameofthrones,not_removed,arent the tyrells extinct now come to think of it how many houses have perished ever since robert died
gameofthrones,not_removed,honestly him staying king would have been less chaotic than tommen which says alot
gameofthrones,not_removed,joffrey is my favorite character from the show every scene hes in is great i wouldnt want him to die again i would want him to have to eat shit from jon or dany and like it
gameofthrones,not_removed,kinda fucked up to say hes not a person lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,the real hero of the battle of the bastards
gameofthrones,not_removed,this one gets it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i change my vote
gameofthrones,not_removed,summer is dead winter has come
gameofthrones,not_removed,hell fucking yes heres a short list to support this choice not dead in the books greatest swordsman alive probably with jamie maimed total badass adds much needed character to dannys group i mean strong belwas was too much to ask for i guess but damn is her group lackluster at times adds legitimacy he served targs then and he serves one now it actually shows that some people are legitimately loyal to the true kings of westeros there is no fucking way that selmy would had died to fucking thugs with daggers so why to advance a romantic subplot no one fucking cares about ugh this is part of what made season the worst season
gameofthrones,not_removed,well there is one way he could comebackmaybe mel could use her magic on barristan but that is just me thinking wishfully i dont think he will come back but still fun to think about
gameofthrones,not_removed,bobby bbbbbbb
gameofthrones,not_removed,the true king
gameofthrones,not_removed,and bad grammar
gameofthrones,not_removed,was not is
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes cant believe i had to scroll so far down to find this i want her to move in with lyanna mormont
gameofthrones,not_removed,im rereading the books now and i realise for all the shit i gave him for his decisions hes actually very smart and observing he knows the risks hes taking and the consequences of his actions but still goes on with them because he is a good person not because hes stupid
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe you can revive another duck too so we can have our fucking streams back
gameofthrones,not_removed,bring the god of duck back what is wrong with you
gameofthrones,not_removed,id revive duck
gameofthrones,not_removed,you bastard
gameofthrones,not_removed,but podric payne isnt dead though
gameofthrones,not_removed,right you were looking for rbadgames
gameofthrones,not_removed,are we watching the same show
gameofthrones,not_removed,gods be good please no
gameofthrones,not_removed,he is still rowing
gameofthrones,not_removed,in my opinion oberyn beat the mountatin fair and square but he got cocky at the end and suffered for it
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i would want martin luther king jr back to but i dont think hes on the show dude
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned would be the best as well as the cruelest knowing that his decisions echoed down through his whole family and legacy the pride hed feel at how his sons truly became the men hed hope they would be even though it cost them so much his daughters so different from who they were when he died hell even theons betrayal would devastate him he loved his as one of his own
gameofthrones,not_removed,whos going to tell him what happened to rob and cat and more importantly why it happened
gameofthrones,not_removed,his youngest was rickon bran was the youngest
gameofthrones,not_removed,might as well throw in sansa and yggrite while we are at it
gameofthrones,not_removed,and marcella he was pretty adamant that in dorne we dont kill little girls
gameofthrones,not_removed,what the fuck yall
gameofthrones,not_removed,something about not harming little girls in dorne rip myrcella
gameofthrones,not_removed,also legendary warrior dying in scraps and scuffles instead of epic battles drogo barristan blackfish
gameofthrones,not_removed,lets not forget mr i am the king joffrey dying on the actual day his kingship would be legitimized having not actually consummated that marriage it can be argued he never actually was king
gameofthrones,not_removed,i never realized how much i wanted this until right now
gameofthrones,not_removed,drogo wins that fight no contest he has a similar agile fighting style to oberyn and is perhaps even more skilled as we saw in this fight except he wouldnt be caught up in personal revenge and would go straight for the kill shot at the first opportunity
gameofthrones,not_removed,whoamind blown
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow can we somehow make this happen just bring him back to life i dont care how poorly written it is
gameofthrones,not_removed,if we are bringing back a targaryen rhaegar would be a great pick i remember a line in the book about the gods throwing a coin every time a targaryen is born in reference to the streaks of madness running in the family there is a good chance that rhaego would have been crazy prophecy notwithstanding rhaegar on the other hand would be amazing with the backing of dany he was a far more competent leader than dany can be
gameofthrones,not_removed,ahhh shit youre probably right
gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor
gameofthrones,not_removed,he probably wouldve allied himself with dorne after the event of the purple wedding and tyrions trial possibly even bend the knee to stannis after the siege on the wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,he paid because he broke an oath to marry walder freys daughter and instead married someone else and offered his wimpy uncle in return
gameofthrones,not_removed,no he had that but having blinding honour is what got him killed breaking a marraige pact has dire consequences wish he had properly understood the matters at stake he can even look forward to loosing a part of his army but expecting people to break age old guest right law for payback noone can prepare for something like that
gameofthrones,not_removed,dear god that was obnoxious
gameofthrones,not_removed,most likely the prophecy of azor ahai
gameofthrones,not_removed,exactly rhaegar may have been all that wonderful but hes an asshole for dying and leaving an entire books worth of questions behind
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe the shaggy dog story
gameofthrones,not_removed,the way i reconcile this is that based on ramseys past behavior i think rickon might have been starved and abused ramsey never had any intention of rickon surviving he would only have incentive to keep him alive until sansa returned and not keep him healthy this might have affect his ability to think clearly
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats not necessarily true his death sparked jons anger and pain having lost so many others already and resulted in an early attack by jons forces
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont know if he is in your ten but ned stark and jon arryn who kept the kingdom at peace for years also did a great job if robert would not have died the kingdom would have prospered under ned ned tackled the debt problem took care of the needs of the common folks and he kept robert in check the sparrows never would have formed if ned was still in charge stannis and renley would not have declared war rob would not have marched towards kings landing the source of all evil is cersei she got rid of ned and if tyrion didnt do it she would have taken care of tywin sooner or later actually i think westeros could only be stable without her if cersei wasnt there almost everyone would make a good hand
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion could have pulled it off except that joffrey was far more opposed to his control than to tywin
gameofthrones,not_removed,who are your ten
gameofthrones,not_removed,if rhaegar targaryen had survived and taken over the throne after his father the mad king died he would have been a much better ruler than anyone else even tywin
gameofthrones,not_removed,if stannis didnt care so much about the laws of succession and served as king renlys hand that would have been pretty great renly to do the king stuff and look pretty and stannis to actually get shit done all they would have needed would be someone handy with schemes and plots
gameofthrones,not_removed,varys and littlefinger are both still alive are you really convinced tywin was the best player note the series is still ongoing and tywin has been dead since season halfway point because he betrayed his own son not just through the trial process but also by sleeping with his lover and then repeatedly calling her a whore to tyrions face after he was confronted about it not the most strategic string of choices
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,the queen of thorns is still around and the rest of the family in highgarden
gameofthrones,not_removed,no there are still cousins near highgarden i like to think that the queen of thorns is being put in charge because of her experience even though she isnt a tyrell by blood people who complain about the queen of thorns being put in charge as forgetting about all the other tyrells kinda baffle me
gameofthrones,not_removed,by what is shown in the showdont know how many distant cousins are sitting around in the books there are no more legitimate baratheons left no legitimate martells the boltons are now exctinct those are the major houses that are clear cases but its a fair assumption that some other families are gone between the boltons and jon snows retribution after taking the north its a fair assumption that a lot of minor northern houses are gone especially the umbers and karstarks
gameofthrones,not_removed,weve lost almost all the major houses or at least seem them all greatly diminished
gameofthrones,not_removed,mm maybe he would not have let cersei control and manipulate as she did right with the faith and all but who knows what else he would have fucked up he might have just continued to be a brat kill the odd people and have tywin run the kingdom from behind the curtain it also means tywin may have not died as a result of the trial which i am all for
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea because he kept cersi off his back somewhat he wouldve went to war as soon as he heard his wife and mother were captured
gameofthrones,not_removed,id say hes person
gameofthrones,not_removed,triggered
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the show selmy says hes won more single combats than any man alive and i believe him but even the greatest living swordsman can be brought down by a big enough crowd still a shitty way to go i wanted to see at least one epic cakecarving session before he went down
gameofthrones,not_removed,so why to advance a romantic subplot no one fucking cares about ugh this is part of what made season the worst season to be fair mcelhinney is about years old id imagine it had more to do with the fact that dd might have had problems in action scenes the longer the series stretched out its the same reason why i think they killed blackfish offscreen as well that said danys party in the show is significantly less interesting the recent additions make it a tad better but you have to think theyre trimming anything they can to get a solid close to the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,his death was just another example of why season sucked so ridiculous to throw away such a badass who is still alive in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,what he is not the greatest swordsman alive at least not at his age maybe in his
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is no fucking way that selmy would had died to fucking thugs with daggers that sort of stuff happens all the time in asoiaf though
gameofthrones,not_removed,weve never seen someone come back after that much time beric was revived immediately each time and jon had been dead for a day or two at this point i highly doubt barristans body is salvageable also as best we can tell its not magic its the lord of light or at least some higher power that doesnt mind being referred to that way plus unless they brought barristans body with them theyre on different continents if anything they would have had one of the many red priestesses in essos revive him if they were going that route
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol jeez fellas i know the stream is gone but cmon
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think so do you have a specific gripe with what i wrote
gameofthrones,not_removed,well your opinion is wrong its to the death and neither were dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah my comment was dumb i know it was just my first thought and i felt that was reason enough to comment anyway ned stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think ned would be devastated by how much ruin and deaths resulted from his own death most of his family was decimated the families that had sworn to his were decimated through treason and war the things that he wanted most was to preserve his family and to preserve the seven kingdoms
gameofthrones,not_removed,do you think he really loved theon as one of his own
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned didnt love theon theon was a hostage that ned would have executed without question had the greyjoys not behaved he raised theon among his own because he was a decent man i do think he would mourn the price of his honor though
gameofthrones,not_removed,who the fuck is rickon
gameofthrones,not_removed,well she was on the ocean when she died so dorne is still clean
gameofthrones,not_removed,and the ex mighty warrior robert baratheon murdered by a pig
gameofthrones,not_removed,your comment just made me come to terms with the way blackfish died
gameofthrones,not_removed,roose poisoned by his cowardly enemies
gameofthrones,not_removed,kings dont need to be married to be kings take baelor for instance generally speaking a legitimate ruler is one who has had a coronation joffrey was coronated shortly after robert died
gameofthrones,not_removed,you could argue that sansa wasnt queen without consummation but i dont see any possible way joffrey could be called anything other than the king bastard status notwithstanding
gameofthrones,not_removed,when it came to mind i felt like a genius then i remembered those we lost in and was brought back to earth
gameofthrones,not_removed,oberyn had the reach advantage though using a polearm an arakh would require drogo to get way too close for comfort
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think the mountain agrees there would be no contest especially considering his massive plate armor and great sword and the fact that drogo had probably never even seen a westerosi night in combat
gameofthrones,not_removed,and hes probably wight
gameofthrones,not_removed,along with summer
gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor
gameofthrones,not_removed,yah i could see that the north might not like it but i think robb would have settled for warden of the north if stannis was king
gameofthrones,not_removed,he did marry her due to honour and broke the oath well show screwed up robb in this aspect and made him a lovesick person when its war at hands whereas in books it happened differently he married jeyne cause he felt himself responsible for besmirching her honour by laying with her and hence married her in case she got pregnant with a bastard and since her prospect for getting a good match will not be there anymore it was absolutely foolish decision by him but we do see where he is coming from ned and catelyn raised him as too honorable honorable at fault and he looked upto his father growing up and jon he has seen his own half brother whom he loved so much being shunned in the household by catelyn and carrying the baggage of being a bastard all his life he would not want the same thing happen again and to his own child all these did bear on him which led him to take the decision
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats true if you believe the red wedding was an act of revenge im not convinced i think walder did it for the power and the chance to get back at the tullys and would have betrayed robb even if hed kept his word
gameofthrones,not_removed,but wasnt it blood magic that set in motion him getting killed
gameofthrones,not_removed,na he found the prophecy of the price who was promised which depending on who you ask might be the same prophecy given to different people
gameofthrones,not_removed,he looked fairly healthy no obvious sings of abusetorture like we saw in theon it could also be that he was simply an unnecessary character that had no significant role to play ever other than his death angering jon to the point of charging into battle without a plan which ultimately didnt even matter because of a combination of plot armor and the knights of the vale saving his ass
gameofthrones,not_removed,that is true but its a bunch of what ifs but yah for the most part cersei has had a huge role in the downfall of westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon arryn actually inadvertently fucked the realm over by inviting the most toxic forces and driving forces behind the war of five kings littlefinger and the lannisters into kings landing
gameofthrones,not_removed,you make an interesting point i never thought much about it but theyve effectively set up cersei as the big bad of the seven kingdoms almost all the other antagonists are gone in one sense or another the boltons the freys joffrey tywin jaime meryn trant the mountain etc and you can trace most of the chaos back to some conniving scheme by cersei in a way that fits perfectly weve seen repeatedly that cersei isnt actually a deft political operative but shes been able to leverage the advantages that were handed to her tywins daughter married robert is attractive etc to persevere while most of the other big players have disappeared its exactly the kind of ironic twist that would appeal to martin
gameofthrones,not_removed,wasnt tyrion competent too
gameofthrones,not_removed,not just joffrey pretty much everyone but varys
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei delusional joffrey psychotic ned naive poor judge of character plus few friends in the capital robert was a warrior not a ruler tyrion discrimination even by own family tommen innocence varys a eunuch his game with petyr petyr not from a big house aka little power without wealth owns whorehouses his game with varys pycelle age and he is pretty much a well known parasite i cant believe he wasnt killed earlier and then tywin lord of a grand and powerful and wealthy house smart calm and cunning plus an opportunist some of the greatest leaders in our history have been opportunists whether they were morally good or bad doesnt matter for the most part commanded his children who all held high positions at some point or another he was decisive and knew how to play the game had he shown compassion for his only true rival his own son things would be very different in westeros and yes i know i mentioned some small council members but they have had just as much influence if not more in some cases than the top dog sure the others have some or all of the skills tywin has but he shares none of their disadvantages or faults aside for dislike for tyrion even jon arryns resume was not up to par with tywins because of how many lannisters cersei and co kept in kings landing
gameofthrones,not_removed,that i definitely agree with unless viserys tried some bullshit to remove him but hopefully aegon or jon would have been next not viserys
gameofthrones,not_removed,conversely if renly had joined up with stannis you know his elder brother and rightful heir to the throne all the same could still have transpired renly was in the wrong not stannis
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like that shes basically making a troll face there too like if she actually did come back and marry jon she just looks at cersai with the ultimate troll
gameofthrones,not_removed,she is still around but she is a redwyne who married into the tyrells so she cant officially be the lady of highgarden if i had to guess shed still unofficially call the shots in the tyrell family but the official leadership would go to a cadet branch
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the books there are more tyrell children did they ever mention them in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,karstark umber tully just about aeryn like robin is going to have kids
gameofthrones,not_removed,gendry could be named a legitimate baratheon in theory
gameofthrones,not_removed,wasnt he much bigger than that like people at least
gameofthrones,not_removed,wasnt he much bigger than that like people at least
gameofthrones,not_removed,giant lives matter
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah but wasnt it just one guy with a knife after he cut through a dozen of them the other huge issue i have with was the way they nerf the unsullied these people have trained since birth to be unparalleled killing machines the books give a number like each unsullied is worth regular soldiers so in that seen we have a phalanx type squad break formation forget that they have shields and then allow robed men to walk up and gut them seriously the choreography for really suffered because everyone was working on episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,get a body double in full queens guard armour to do his fight scenes problem solved in fact the reason he doesnt get screwed in the books is because of his plate armour
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes pretty healthy though and using a double for fight scenes wouldnt be an issue iirc the actor is a fan of the books and was pretty excited to keep playing selmy and very disappointed to be killed off in such a way the only character i know of who left for health reasons was illyn payne who got cancer also killing blackfish off screen was super dumb either kill him on screen or dont kill him but its really weak any other way oh but what if its lazy writing imo and the wasted death doesnt fit the character of such a strong and resourceful man
gameofthrones,not_removed,its the same reason why i think they killed blackfish offscreen as well allegedly o
gameofthrones,not_removed,oberyn was clearly the better combatant
gameofthrones,not_removed,if youre asking me who would i want to die and never revive the answer is little finger this asshole is the very reason the war of five kings started the great houses of westeros never want to rule westeros through war and killings not even theres a bad history between them such as after the sack of kings landing ned wants justice for the dead targs children which tywin was responsible but ned and tywin doesnt want to start a war because of this war costs huge amount of gold men time and headaches not to mention a real threat of getting your entire house going extinct hence powerful people just want to keep the peace maintain the status quo gaining influence over time
gameofthrones,not_removed,love may be too strong a word but he did raise him as his own and care for him ned was a good and honorable man who took his responsibility to his family his name and the north seriously and would have treated theon as such he would have never treated him poorly because his own sons would have seen that and followed suit
gameofthrones,not_removed,he would likely have done it but not without question it would be exactly as it was with lady
gameofthrones,not_removed,she was poisoned in dorne though
gameofthrones,not_removed,the sweet scared and skittish hodor dying heroically while holding back a literal fuckton of monsters
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was gonna include him and greatjohn but u chose not to cause they where planned attacks
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was offscreen he might still live
gameofthrones,not_removed,a king must be of age tho thats why cersei was his regent so basically he was never a king
gameofthrones,not_removed,when was sansa called a queen
gameofthrones,not_removed,well im just suggesting that from the point of it being an ironic death his kingship really wouldnt have gotten started prior to that wedding
gameofthrones,not_removed,never forget
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the dothraki wear light leather armor similar to oberyn also the mountain is so damn strong armor wouldnt be much of a help he would crush plate and cut chain so better to give yourself the best chance of not taking any hits at all
gameofthrones,not_removed,armor doesnt stop any of the attacks that the mountain is dishing out he hits someone in fullplate theyll break every single rib and then be down for the count either way
gameofthrones,not_removed,well we wont get funnier than this winter has come if the maesters are right itll be the coldest one in a thousand years we should ride home and wait out the coming storms
gameofthrones,not_removed,existential zombie question shouldnt he have plausibly been ripped to shreds by the horde of wights clawing at him similarly in zombie situations ala the walking dead shouldnt some corpses be so badly mutilated that they would be unable to come back as zombies especially if they are specifically targeting the brain as was always the case in all the old zombie movies yeah that was a pretty random questioncomment ive been pondering this in the zombie context recently and the hodorwight thing seems comparable
gameofthrones,not_removed,this made me laugh bravo
gameofthrones,not_removed,shit also probably wight nymeria is gonna have to come back and help ghost fight unsummer
gameofthrones,not_removed,holdor
gameofthrones,not_removed,plus if the events at the wall remained as they did and stannis went to save the nights watch from the wilding attack jon would have sent word to robb that stannis was now an ally
gameofthrones,not_removed,good point
gameofthrones,not_removed,well walder always wanted to get back at the tullys but something brilliant like red wedding isnt something he can conspire walder went forward with it due to two more important aspects he had the lannisters and boltons walder and freys ego was pretty badly hurt when robb married jeyne and its understandable and was the incentive still noone thinks of breaking the guest right unless they are pretty mad with revenge red wedding was an opportunity made up by tywin over robbs mistakes thats what happens here you make mistakes you die and the freys seeked it they had nothing to loose here except for getting the sniggering of seven kingdoms which they already had
gameofthrones,not_removed,she is as proud ruthless and arrogant as tywin but not even half as competent
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha well yeah thats true however under his rule the kingdom has been peaceful for years we have to give him some credit for that
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei just bumbles her way from one mistakebad decision to the next and she is quickly running out of allies littlefinger and varys have been manipulating her and all the other major players for years now the chessboard of westeros is primarily controlled by those two also the white walkers are a pretty significant enemy for the seven kingdoms and there is also a massive fleet about to land led by dany oh and euron is still alive and kicking
gameofthrones,not_removed,he was but he is not dead yet and this whole post is about what charterers should be revived but even if we count him in he has one major problem no one takes him seriously joffrey would have never asked him for advice in dire times everyone and their dogs were plotting against him he had no lobby if you put it that way and some of his decisions had questionable outcomes eg the deal with the masters hes more of an advisor than a ruler i know hands dont actually rule but the point should be clear nevertheless tyrions style of negotiation also has some flaws he is a master of cold reading he lets other people talk and tell him what they want he then uses this information to turn the tables in his favor this only works if tyrion has actually something to offer that is of value to his opponent those mountain tribes wanted weapons bronn wanted money the masters wanted slaves if one day someone comes and tyrion cannot cold read them or cannot give what the other desires he is screwed
gameofthrones,not_removed,stannis would have been a pretty bad king though nobody really liked him and he had to employ pirates and smugglers to field an army
gameofthrones,not_removed,well the gold was mostly dried up by the time he died or even for some time before thoug he did a reasonable job keeping it on the dl but i do agree tywin was among the best players of the game just not thee best imho
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not sure if its the same in the show but mace had two other sons willas and garlan who would be the tyrell heir back at home
gameofthrones,not_removed,im sorry you didnt get the joke it was a reference on how blacks where counted as person in pre civil war usa
gameofthrones,not_removed,how many times does this have to be explained they are a fighting unit that means they work best in groups but theyre individuals they are lacking
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont disagree that a double couldve been used i just mean thats what i believe the showwriters approach was in that situation i liken it to blackfish because thats a pretty popular theory i mentioned blackfish because by all means shouldve been shipping off north with bp it was still a shit move to kill him offscreen thats for sure whether it was just lazy writing or not they couldve even shown him getting hit by a stray arrow and had a better result
gameofthrones,not_removed,would he have though we know how opposed he was to the proposed execution of the targaryen kids
gameofthrones,not_removed,its ok smalljon died as insider for rickon fake shaggydog head never forget
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont believe we ever learn of greatjons demise do we in the books hes being held hostage at the twins but in the show all we know is hes dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,im with you in denial dude
gameofthrones,not_removed,first scene of is blackfish having a piss up with jamie
gameofthrones,not_removed,who was king then this is getting more into the real world than the asoiaf world but the king is dead long live the king is a phrase that exists precisely to point out the fact that there is no gap between monarchs someone is always theoretically the monarch regencies exist for all kinds of reasons the monarch is off fighting a war the monarch is incapacitated the monarch is underage etc an old and demented king is still king whether theres a regency or not
gameofthrones,not_removed,when all her show fanboys saw her on the hill leading the knights of the vale its not like it was all lfs plan to help jon with her glorious redhead masterplan of hiding her intentions from him i hate her
gameofthrones,not_removed,lets head to the winchester and wait till this all blows over
gameofthrones,not_removed,no
gameofthrones,not_removed,this made me cringe bravo
gameofthrones,not_removed,unsummer winter
gameofthrones,not_removed,holdddor
gameofthrones,not_removed,my impression was that tywin arranged the whole thing it was his scheme to end the war and walder was more than happy to play his part in exchange for power and revenge i dont think he cares about guest right thats not to say that he didnt enjoy it more as a result of robbs betrayal but i think he would have done it either way
gameofthrones,not_removed,every single plan she makes turns into a massive mess of explosive diarrhea and rectal hemhoraging
gameofthrones,not_removed,same is true for tywin under the mad king and for the record the hand doesnt technically rule the seven kingdoms even if they do rule de facto
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes littlefinger and varys are pulling the strings but cersei is still the queen shes still the one who incinerated half of kl and neither of those two is a clearcut villain the way she is within the realm who is a bigger villain at this point i made a point of saying shes not actually very good at playing the game so i dont see what that proves other than that her time is running out which is irrelevant and questionable given that shes slated to appear in both upcoming seasons the white walkers and dany if you want to count her again her status as a villain is dubious are external threats if you dont limit the scope youd be forced to conclude that virtually nothing thats happened in the seven kingdoms so far has mattered at all cersei is the only major villain remaining in the realm as for euron balon posed no real threat to the realm i dont see how his brother with most of his fleet and constituents gone is going to do anything especially when theon and yara have allied themselves with the person whos presumably about to coast to the throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,but this is a monarchy not a democracy renlys belief that stannis would be a bad king doesnt constitute a legal argument for the throne he should have aided his brother lending his political skills to stannis ule and likely being named hand of the king rather than trying to usurp him
gameofthrones,not_removed,the show has never mentioned them and in the last season qot said something to the effect of her houses entire future has been taken from her so i think the show is proceeding without those two
gameofthrones,not_removed,ah okay i feel dumb now d
gameofthrones,not_removed,so that unit of why didnt they fight as a unit and did you read the books they spar and train every day with spear and sword a lone unsullied is still dangerous many buyers could only afford very few unsullied yet they were still the best in the world
gameofthrones,not_removed,even just a shot of him drawing his sword as lannister troops bear down would have been more satisfying they also could have had the messenger who informed jaime mention that he took a few men with him they spent that whole subplot building him up as a force against lannister oppression only to dispatch him without actually accomplishing anything aside from character development for jaime
gameofthrones,not_removed,a stay arrow would have been perfectly senseless i like it
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes because daenerys wasnt aerys which was all that ned could see theon wasnt his father either but the ironborn were a possible direct threat a year old girl married to a dothraki horse lord halfway across the world is no threat to the seven kingdoms
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes he opposed it because tywin was killing kids theon at the time of betrayal was no longer kid hes a full grown man i think whatever that is hes capable of thinking for his owns reasonings with logic and shit the targaryen kids didnt murder anyone never betray anybody and not even taking part in the war theon is different he made a choice he has plenty of them to think carefully about consequences and he fully involve in the war hence his act of betrayal is simply unforgivable at least when roose bolton betrayed robb he didnt put his pride over his head he did it because robbs idiotic politics cost him to lose of his army stannis defeat at blackwater bay hence noone else can challenge the lannister beside robb and the tullys however the tullys already lost too many hence its still not contribute much tywin just went into alliance with the tyrells basically the most fucking powerful alliance in westeros at that time hence he can just crush robbs army with sheer number and resources regardless of how brilliant robbs tactics are he can defeat robb overtime thus roose realized that wo powerful allies robbs defeat is inevitable better make alliance with tywin and secure his houses future than fighting for losing side roose betrayed robb fully wellknown the starks cant avenge against him hence hes safe from the starks
gameofthrones,not_removed,if we go by the show then dayne wouldve killed ned after disarming him and killing a defenseless enemy is dishonorable as fuck
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh shit thats right i was thinking he died at the red wedding my mistake
gameofthrones,not_removed,stannis too
gameofthrones,not_removed,youve got a bit of red on you
gameofthrones,not_removed,braavos
gameofthrones,not_removed,both of you bravos
gameofthrones,not_removed,winter is coming has always been about brans wolf bringing hell upon westeros obviously
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope you intended that pun tyrion did poison her once which led to some unpleasant moments
gameofthrones,not_removed,if you dont limit the scope youd be forced to conclude that virtually nothing thats happened in the seven kingdoms so far has mattered at all this doesnt make sense to me we have only been shown characters and events relevant to the westeros storyline it makes no sense to limit this discussion of villains only to players within the realm of westeros when others heavily featured in the series are clearly headed there originally came from there and always intended to go back or are simply from a remote area of the continent iron islands or far north ill give you danys status as a villain is questionable but she will most definitely cause chaos with her arrival and its not hard to imagine dothraki hordes running wild earning her the villain label from the smallfolk who have largeley believed cersei and joffrey were great noble leaders regarding euron he is a bigger badass than his elderly brother he is younger has more worldly experience is building an iron fleet of ships theon and yara only stole about and may have secret magic weaponstricks up his sleeve and he will probably offer cersei an alliance and act as her navy protecting kings landing dont count him out just yet also all of he remaining actors contracts show them slated to return for the next years you know why because if their contracts said the exact number of episodes they would actually appear in then we would all know exactly when everyone is going to die before it happens the actress that plays cersei even said herself in an interview that she expects it to be a very short reign my overall point was that there are a few big bad villains out there still you didnt mention most notably euron and the white walkers and littlefinger and probably someone within danys faction will flip if not her there are also the maesters who have an interesting and secretive history and could be portrayed as villains depending on your perspective they are supposed to be extremely antimagic and claim to have ushered in the end of the dragon lord era part of what makes this series great is that they show characters existing in gray areas rather than black and white mostly they all act in their own best interest moral relativism its not an accident who is good and who is bad is supposed to be a bit murky
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree i dont think renly shouldve tried to usurp but i also think stannis shouldve recognised my point
gameofthrones,not_removed,she actually said cersei stole the future from me in fact she didnt mention the house at all while it doesnt confirm that there are extant tyrells aside from her i feel like she would have said something more similar to the way you remembered it or at least mentioned it it seems more likely to me that shes talking about her own legacy she has no living descendants and certainly cant produce anymore her own bloodline is dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,the question was over whether ned would kill theon if balon rebelled while he was growing up he would definitely kill theon for betraying the starks when he did
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did not realise how true this could be until now
gameofthrones,not_removed,this doesnt make sense to me we have only been shown characters and events relevant to the westeros storyline it makes no sense to limit this discussion of villains only to players within the realm of westeros when others heavily featured in the series are clearly headed there originally came from there and always intended to go back or are simply from a remote area of the continent iron islands or far north im not limiting the discussion of villains to only those within the realm rather im saying that of those within the realm cersei has become the biggest if you want to argue that its meaningless fine but i disagree in would you have called stalin the big bad of germany i wouldnt it was hitler with stalin an external threat even though he was unquestionably a villain and arguably a bigger one in his own right weve seen a lot of potential villains in the seven kingdoms the boltons the freys tywin joffrey the high sparrow jaime the mountain the hound stannis balon theon etc and most of them are dead others are changed theon and jaime or undead the mountain and of the few that remain cersei is clearly at the top yes there are bigger external threats most notably the white walkers but thats kind of the point the seven kingdoms has cannibalized itself to the point that theyre powerless stand up to either of the two massive invading armies and somehow cersei became the queen of that mess when there were far more likely suspects around the entire purpose of me bringing this subject up is that its actually fitting given the prevalence of ironic fates in this story that cersei whose skills are essentially order people to die and bang everyone in kings landing came out on top for however short a reign ill give you danys status as a villain is questionable but she will most definitely cause chaos with her arrival and its not hard to imagine dothraki hordes running wild earning her the villain label from the smallfolk who have largeley believed cersei and joffrey were great noble leaders i agree that she could be seen as a villain in a certain light but im limiting it to internal threats for the reasons i explained above the not clearcut comment was primarily intended for littlefinger and varys who you could argue are bigger villains than cersei since theyre pulling all the strings especially petyr who arranged jon arryns murder framed tyrion and betrayed ned that said i really dont buy that the commoners believe cersei and joffrey to be great leaders lets look over the regions the north i think this one is obvious the riverlands the lannisters razed the countryside perpetrated the murder of two tullys and put walder frey in charge dont think theyre big fans the vale probably still blames the lannisters for killing jon arryn the stormlands the people largely allied themselves with stannis and lost thousands of men invading kings landing its hard to say how many of them have received word of the defeat and its likely that nobody is even aware of stanniss failed siege of winterfell but when all your ablebodied men go off to invade a castle its unlikely that the remaining people are going to have a high opinion of the inhabitants of that castle the reach cersei killed mace loras and margaery the bannermen are currently invading kings landing dorne blames the lannisters for the death of elia and her children not to mention oberyn the bannermen are currently invading kings landing the crownlands admittedly most of these are untouched but kings landing is probably not on cerseis side and its only a matter of time before the others hear about the giant explosions that obliterated half a city the iron islands hardly worth mentioning but many followed theon and yara who are currently invading kings landing and they seem generally predisposed to hate everyone that leaves the westerlands as the only region i can really see having a favorable opinion of the lannisters and even they are probably still terrified of them after what tywin did to the reynes if anything should the dothraki be left unchecked dany will be seen as just the newest in a long line of shitty leaders who dont care about the commoners regarding euron he is a bigger badass than his elderly brother he is younger has more worldly experience is building an iron fleet of ships theon and yara only stole about and may have secret magic weaponstricks up his sleeve and he will probably offer cersei an alliance and act as her navy protecting kings landing dont count him out just yet he is building a fleet of ships how long does that take how much manpower does he have am i really to believe he has the men to build ships in time and man them i dont buy his grandiose claims for a second even if he offers cersei a strategic alliance it a will most likely be of little consequence and b proves that cersei is a bigger threat also all of he remaining actors contracts show them slated to return for the next years you know why because if their contracts said the exact number of episodes they would actually appear in then we would all know exactly when everyone is going to die before it happens the actress that plays cersei even said herself in an interview that she expects it to be a very short reign i wasnt aware of this but whether she falls in the season premier or the series finale it doesnt really change my point which is about the current state of affairs my overall point was that there are a few big bad villains out there still you didnt mention most notably euron and the white walkers and littlefinger and probably someone within danys faction will flip if not her the first three ive already addressed as far as danys faction i assume you mean one of varys ellaria olenna and the greyjoys thats possible but it remains only a possibility the seven kingdoms have a tyrannical massmurdering bitch of a queen right now the only one id entertain as a reasonable argument ahead of her would be littlefinger depending on what his goals are at this point hes a bit enigmatic as opposed to cersei who just wants power and jaime and will stop at literally nothing to achieve it but at the end of the day if you could quantify evil and power on some scale id say cersei is ahead of him in both there are also the maesters who have an interesting and secretive history and could be portrayed as villains depending on your perspective they are supposed to be extremely antimagic and claim to have ushered in the end of the dragon lord era thats certainly possible albeit a bit of a stretch see above part of what makes this series great is that they show characters existing in gray areas rather than black and white mostly they all act in their own best interest moral relativism its not an accident who is good and who is bad is supposed to be a bit murky i understand that i dont think it takes away from my point the fact that the characters arent black and white makes it even more significant when a character is so blatantly on one end of the spectrum other examples include ramsay and the mountain cersei at this point is straight up evil
gameofthrones,not_removed,not the person youre replying to but i seem to recall a conversation between olenna and tywin where they discussed marrying cersei to loras and olenna was resistant because a cersei is old by westeros standards for childbearing and b loras is the only male heir to highgarden i could be remembering that wrong though edit here it is tywin also threatens to name loras to the kingsguard to rob the tyrells of their heir
gameofthrones,not_removed,interesting you are totally right about the quote yeah i guess i was trying to say the same thing you are in got there are most likely other tyrells out there just not any of the qots childrengrand kids i actually havent given much thought to her actually being a redwine and her whole linage possibly being gone
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks for taking the time to write this detailed response i actually agree with most of what you said including the facts that cersei is currently the biggest bad of the remaining villains but not the only one left and probably not going to be the last one standing and in my opinion a good character will flip to bad still most likely dany my comment about the smallfolk believing cersei and joffrey were benevolent noble rulers was in part due to my recollection of the mummers play that arya watched while in faceless men training portraying the events of roberts death and neds betrayal i know that took place in braavos on essos interestingly why are they so concerned arent they external to westeros but since the official story that the public is being fed by whatever medieval media exists paints cersei and joffrey as the victims of ned and tyrions meddling that is where i am basing my theory that the smallfolk generally support cersei except in places like the north where the lannisters are obviously despised now to argue against myself a bit earlier in the series season there was a riot in kings landing and it certainly didnt seem as though joffrey was a popular leader later when cersei was paraded naked through the streets the smallfolk werent exactly sympathetic in kings landing and all that was before she nuked the giant historical church in the middle of town along with all its leaders and half the nobility of the kingdom which will be pretty hard to deny or claim ignorance of so i guess my point is that there are a variety of opinions but it seems as though the various noble houses or kingdoms or however you want to parse them have differing views of how things are going and who would be most fit to rule moving forward i do think you underestimate euron even though the show has not had time to invest in developing his character yet from what ive read he is one of the major antagonists in the books and is a formidable warrior with a knowledge of magic smarter and more experiencedworldly than cersei although he is not currently sitting on the iron throne and therefore yes he is less significant of a threat for the time being plus they just cast ufc champion connor mcgregor to play his first mate thats pretty cool and i dont think they will kill him off immediately considering that is one of the biggest pr moves they have ever made in casting a character
gameofthrones,not_removed,hmm that scene does seem to suggest that there are no other male heirs though its not conclusive it really depends on how literally you interpret him saying the tyrell name will fade despite that i still find it hard to believe that there would be no other tyrells out there given that theyve made a point of establishing that there are distant relations of other major house heirs especially the lannisters though i think most of those are dead did olenna really only have one child the way she bragged about being so good in bed that seems unlikely
gameofthrones,not_removed,apparently theres another scene much earlier where tywin threatens to appoint loras to the kings guard and says the tyrell name will fade so it may turn out to be the case that olenna is the last tyrell after all i think they could go either way it just depends what they want to do with the story
gameofthrones,not_removed,i guess my thing with euron is that he just doesnt have the resources to accomplish much a little bit of googling suggests that they have probably soldiers max and who knows how many they lost between the raids remember ramsay was not merciful and defecting to support theon and yara i assume those ships have crews for starters the ships line was clearly just bravado unless theyre all really small ships more likely theyd be modeled on viking longships since theyre ideal for eurons purposes and the ironborn are clearly modeled on vikings anyway those had about people each this is all secondhand research but whatever the number is they bring troops to westeros and then what no tactician is going to save them from the fact that the reach dorne and dothraki armies are all way bigger and are all on one side the exception to this is if one of them especially if its olenna flips as you said but that just seems like more of a technical possibility than a legitimate threat from a storytelling perspective i get the need for a new opponent to challenge dany since shes going to make cersei her bitch im just not sure i buy that thats euron hes barely gotten any screen time and what weve seen so far is treachery and hollow threats i dont see how hes being set up as a villain or hero depending on how things play out of that magnitude actually it seems to me that jon has been built up to that point or maybe littlefinger through jon i could see him rallying the north the vale and whats left of the riverlands and once theyre done spitroasting cersei it could take a cold waresque turn it would be immaterial though danys army would massacre them even without dragons but thats probably even more true for the ironborn
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i remember this now that you mention it
gameofthrones,not_removed,margaery climbing out of the bell that she rode out of the sept of baelor explosion
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually think that the opening would be something like a view from the air of kingslanding with the fall of the first snowflakes since years then a closeup onto the red keep where cersei it at a window staring a snowflakes falling off and covering the roofs of the houses of kl id say something like that just because i like to think that theyll want to give us the idea that the time has passed and that well not have to wait episodes for daenerys to reach westeros so id say that this first scene would let us know that some months has passed and later on in the episode we see daenerys with her ships seeing in the distance the coasts of westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,montage of the wights prepping for war practicing with swords starting crappy at first but getting better and better set to joe espositos song youre the best around directed by the guy who produced the karate kid

gameofthrones,not_removed,gendry arriving in asshai with his rowboat
gameofthrones,not_removed,im gonna throw out the dream flashback to tourney at harrenhal let me have that ok
gameofthrones,not_removed,euron greyjoys fleet sailing in the direction of danys fleet
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would like to see tourney via cerseis pov she used to have big crush on rhaegar
gameofthrones,not_removed,the episode of season will be the shows first and only musical episode it will open with jon literally singing a song of ice and fire or it will start with jon texting dany and cersei lol will u stop fighting for a minute and come up here walkers invading omog note omog means oh my old gods
gameofthrones,not_removed,it will start in kings landing season started at the wallbeyond it season started in kl on joffreys name day season started beyond the wall at the aftermath of the wight attack season started in kl with tywin having ice melted down season started in kl with cersei having her dreamflashback then at the sept season iirc started with davos finding jons body season at kl
gameofthrones,not_removed,the hound eating chicken
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually feel really good about this one the opening scene will be a sort of comical one with danys fleet all handling the water rough or atleast the dothraki i expect some vomit in the first seconds followed by tyrion making a comment to dany about what lies ahead of her in kings landing definitely expect tyrion to fill her in with cersei and after a confident quote by daenerys it cuts to cersei doing some mad queen bitchy shit following a setup argument for the fall out of cersei and jaime
gameofthrones,not_removed,bran passing the wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think itll start off as some slice of life in westeros that reveals a character in a new setting like the reintroduction of the hound
gameofthrones,not_removed,im thinking a cerseijaime scene the two of them talking about the events of jaime demanding to know why she did what she did and cersei getting defensive and threatening jaime i think the rift between jaime and cersei will begin early in the season and just grow as the season progresses
gameofthrones,not_removed,daenerys landing in westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,jaime surveying the destruction of the sept
gameofthrones,not_removed,danys fleet passes gendry rowing in the narrow sea
gameofthrones,not_removed,either daenerys landing in dorne or the wight walkers attacking the wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,season six ended with daenerys fleet setting sail season may start with eurons setting sail my theory is that they meet up at old town that may seem illogical for daenerys but it is a large friendly port with a clear road to kings landing the stormlands and the crownlands do not have a large port other than kings landing itself dorne does not have a good road for euron it is a very familiar place to make trouble but their meeting may not happen in episode just euron setting sail
gameofthrones,not_removed,it will begin in great citadel or introducing new character in oldtown
gameofthrones,not_removed,euron greyjoy is on the ship he then raises the dragonbinder
gameofthrones,not_removed,i guess this thread needed a tag because all the top comments are lame jokes

gameofthrones,not_removed,different shots of what happened last season the aftermath of the battle of the bastards aftermath of the trial and the aftermath of the siege of meereen
gameofthrones,not_removed,a flashback of rhaegar and lyanna at the tournament
gameofthrones,not_removed,not likely but i would love if it opened up with negotiations between team dany and team cersei with daenerys cersei tyrion and jaime all present

gameofthrones,not_removed,sorry but in those kind of scenes you need ill make a man out of you
gameofthrones,not_removed,doesnt get better than this though this is pretty good too
gameofthrones,not_removed,also this httpiimgurcomimyvbqyjpg
gameofthrones,not_removed,thread
gameofthrones,not_removed,if this doesnt happen i will be so upset
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it would be better if it was a mulanesque make a man out of you sequence with the night king leading the montage
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would die in shock if that was how they opened the season
gameofthrones,not_removed,i too am looking forward to seeing cersei visit casterly rock
gameofthrones,not_removed,gendry crowned the supreme overlord of new qarth
gameofthrones,not_removed,with a hot bod from all that rowing
gameofthrones,not_removed,gendry sharpening a blade in fire at the blacksmith shoppe in oldtown
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn thats a lot of rowing
gameofthrones,not_removed,you mean euron i assume
gameofthrones,not_removed,but with people strapped to the hull of his ship a la the forsaken chapter of twow
gameofthrones,not_removed,dd said that they try to avoid flashbacks and prefer using brans visions for it
gameofthrones,not_removed,that would be the worst possible landing point possible
gameofthrones,not_removed,margaery
gameofthrones,not_removed,we saw ramsay get devoured by wolves lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,how about lol yes
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow just wow
gameofthrones,not_removed,bwahaha thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol i agree it would be exciting but that seems like an overreaction
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,yep just edited it thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,ohis that so but i wish there will be atleast one pov flashback either with jaime or cersei but yeah it will be all brans vision
gameofthrones,not_removed,why arent the dornish her allies
gameofthrones,not_removed,dogs not wolves
gameofthrones,not_removed,wouldnt make any sense shes dead lol i get it people reeeaallyy like her but this is game of thrones youre stupid if you even consider that to be true
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes actually ucerseilannister
gameofthrones,not_removed,huh no e
gameofthrones,not_removed,there was one with cersei when she was a little girl and getting the prophesy about her children remember she and her friend were running through the woods and came upon the witchs house
gameofthrones,not_removed,they said that they try to avoid pov flashbacks because they beleive it is lazy storytelling
gameofthrones,not_removed,they are but there would be absolutely no point landing at sunspear and walking throught several hundred miles of desert until they reach the stormlands instead of just continuing to sail there were martell ships already with her fleet in that scene takingburning lannisport would be the wisest first course of action also gaining the support of any of the lords of the westerlands would all but seal the deal
gameofthrones,not_removed,you heard him scream and you could see the blood covering his hands hes dead bro
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh right
gameofthrones,not_removed,so i was joking and im pretty sure the op was joking but okay sorry we rustled your jimmies
gameofthrones,not_removed,wasted username
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes yes i remember thankthats why i thought it will start from something cersei remembering but then it has already happened once
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh sure i didnt necessarily mean they would attack from there its a long sea voyage i figured with safe harbor there they could stop and get her army fedprepped etc
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not sure but i dont think his hands were covered in blood the hounds ripped the skinned right off poetic justice for the last member of the family that cuts peoples skin off but yeah we also heard him start gurgling when the hounds ripped his throat so that he couldnt physically scream anymore he dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,excuse me one bastard was already raised from the dead why cant the prince who was promised azor ahai reborn do the same its obvious ramsey is him uniting the north from those wildingling bastards
gameofthrones,not_removed,they are very violently rustled youre lucky i dont sue you
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i never understood why people take usernames and never bother to actually use them like think of a username like usnow or some shit and its one from days ago that was never used for anything
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i dont think theyll repeat that i suppose if it opens with a flashback it will probably be one though brans visions
gameofthrones,not_removed,that makes me happy im a very anti jimmie rustling kind of guy about as much as im anti charred margaery chargaery if you will
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wish accounts that havent had any activity in years would get shut down so the usernames could be used again
gameofthrones,not_removed,well im antianti charred margaery guy but we can settle our differences with a nice little game of whoever the fuck ends this conversation looses
gameofthrones,not_removed,to the death then
gameofthrones,not_removed,come at me margery isnt even that pretty
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow fuk u fam
gameofthrones,not_removed,you might not think that shes pretty but you cant deny that shes hot
gameofthrones,not_removed,well what u got
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah after episode she got really hot from to
gameofthrones,not_removed,god damn why is so far awayi gotta get threw round of finals before we get there fuck my guess is jon is there on a secret mission with davos and he left sansa and tormundmanderlys or glover in charge of the north while he treats with her that is if its early in the season if its late then i guess the north could be with him but that looks like dorne so i guess the actual host of the forces would be in the riverlands or something
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is kinda old many photos and videos of this and other scenes have been around for months
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon and daenerys meet oh my god lets hope jon knows he is a targ before hand so we do not get accidental incest
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love the outfits so much it shows a real progression from the first season to now i also love how theyre representing the three leaders fighting for the throne theyre all also wearing black a power color
gameofthrones,not_removed,one thing i am noticing here is that jon is leading dany might be some hint that dany will join jons cause instead of jon joining danys
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really wish i didnt click the link can never be unseen
gameofthrones,not_removed,so leaping to loads of conclusions i speculate they are walking on dornish sand on the way to starfall to pick up dawn even if they are not this is still awesome
gameofthrones,not_removed,saw pics of them last month exciting stuff
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wish i didnt see this
gameofthrones,not_removed,those costumes tho
gameofthrones,not_removed,not a surprise i wonder what that badge is on missandeis chest
gameofthrones,not_removed,daenerys the most bland mary sue on the show please dont ruin my sweet jon
gameofthrones,not_removed,by the gods
gameofthrones,not_removed,nice armor jon got on himself i wonder if its just a random armor or a special one
gameofthrones,not_removed,looking at the thumbnail photo i gotta feeling that emilia clarke isnt looking at the front shes looking at the paparazzi s camera
gameofthrones,not_removed,anyone imagining rhaenyra targaryen seeing this stark albeit jon support queen on dragonstone big dragons fucking nuts problems with other legitimate targs book only
gameofthrones,not_removed,i expect its a diplomatic missions to meet dany
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont think its dorne too many layers of clothes they look like clothes for colder climate
gameofthrones,not_removed,need karma in this seven hells
gameofthrones,not_removed,grrm didnt include decades upon decades of targaryen incest in his lore just to buck the trend now
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha i assume dany will offer marriage she is a queen he is a king i dont have the link but their is an article that mentioned another shot in the same setting where jon meets tyrion pleasant meeting
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol i like how you think it would be accidental
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah maker sure he knows before hand so its intentional incest
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea it only gets me off when they know
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is an interesting thought the night king did switch to a black outfit and we have slowly seen others taking black outfits so we are finally seeing the remaining big players what i find most interesting is in an interview with grr martin he said that he wanted game of thrones to break fantasy stereotypes the guys in white are good the guys in black are bad we know see everyone wearing black both good and evil i am curious if we will see a mix up of who is really good and evil in the next season maybe moving into a place where we are not sure who is what we have seen everyone else take a black outfit after making a very bold move nightking took over the true north cersei took over the city dany took over the bay jon took over the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just really love that jon is wearing the kind of official outfit of the starks in the same style as ned and robb did it really reinforces his personal journey especially when you remember he was outright offered the role of lord of winterfell by stannis which jon rejected jon couldnt accept being given the north but there is something of neds if you have to make a choice you should be the one to carry it out mentality in jons physically going to winterfell and taking it back and therefore being able to claim via his clothingappearance what had previously been denied to him or offered without first making the stark sacrifice as it were the fact that his outfit is still black though is kind of cool because its both a statement of reclaiming family and also remembering the journey that brought him there i guess in a way its a return to her roots for dany too as shes always been dressed in the style of other cultures and ive always gotten the sense that someone else has dressed her rather than she making style choices for herself she never had her own culture after all though i guess it could be argued that the targaryens lost their original culture the valyrian culture a long time ago black and red are associated with their house as seen on their house crest and seeing her in black makes me feel like its her way of saying she has finally found her true purpose or her place in the greater network of her house
gameofthrones,not_removed,after season of daeny gathering her army and dragons id be a little bit disappointed if she starts following him
gameofthrones,not_removed,that would be interesting it would be interesting to see dany reach westeros and to have the evil queen and the good king who is playing a very different game i assume she will aid in destroying or fixing the white walker situation
gameofthrones,not_removed,dragonstone
gameofthrones,not_removed,its not dorne
gameofthrones,not_removed,why would they be going to pick up dawn
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel it might be too soon for dawn i feel like that will come into play in if at all i think they are at oldtown sam is in possession of heartsbane and hopefully gendry is there as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,the climate looks like it it would also make sense for her to set up in the south first with the sand snakes and highgarden on her side
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats something i was wondering as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,could be dragonstone
gameofthrones,not_removed,george repeatedly said how it was one of the reasons for their fall so hes trying to tell us that targ incest wasnt good for them in history it brought conflicts wars sometimes madness to some of them its not a coincidence that as ser barristan said king jaehaerys once told me that madness and greatness were two sides of the same coin every time a new targaryen is born he said the gods flip a coin in the air and the world holds its breath to see how it will land having said that look at jaime and cersei incestous relationship it brought story forward so if george is doing it its because of it how it will push the story forward not because he wants to keep this tradition or thinks that it is normal or good just wonder what jons stance on this will be
gameofthrones,not_removed,im way more interested in seeing him meet up with tyrion again
gameofthrones,not_removed,i definitely agree with you on the good and evil point danys arc has been progressing toward a morally grey area showing more mad king like behavior and expressing a desire for power that she may end up pursuing instead of the white walker threat when it comes to cersei people seem to think that she will be super evil now that her kids arent holding her back by i think the opposite could happen her children are actually the main motivation in her evil acts so tommens death may have actually tamed the lion rather than motivating it jon snow is hard to see as an evil character but i think that his morality may actually play into it a bit i think we might see a situation mirroring ned stark where his sense of northern justice may prevent him from seeing the long term implications in fact he might even have to make the exact decision ned made in the first season killing dany ned refused to kill dany presumably because of his own targaryen child that almost died but in doing so put westeros at risk of dothraki invasion maybe jon will decide to kill her without realizing that her dragons were the best chance against the white walkers i dont know im just spitballing here but it is so open to interpretation
gameofthrones,not_removed,plus you know for dany at least a tokar gets cold in winter
gameofthrones,not_removed,think about stannis though remember his whole i was trying to win the throne to save the kingdom when i should have been saving the kingdom to win the crown she would probably need some convincing but doesnt that seem like the kind of advice tyrian would give her im not completely sold on it but it wouldnt be that crazy if she learns from stanniss mistake
gameofthrones,not_removed,that could be a great call jon could be looking for dragonglass
gameofthrones,not_removed,why dawn i dont see the significance in the show especially as valyrian steel is already confirmed to kill walkers seems like a waste of time even in the books its just emo dayne bait
gameofthrones,not_removed,dragonstone rocking that black vibe since aenar
gameofthrones,not_removed,targaryens didnt do it just because they didnt have access to valyrian sorcery after the doom so they needed to keep bloodlines pure to maintain control over the dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,king aerys
gameofthrones,not_removed,same here i cant wait to see that its going to be by far the most intetesting scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like it we are getting to a point where everyons morality is being pushed and with jon being king he will have to make harder decisions i could see them finding themselves in a very weird place next season
gameofthrones,not_removed,true just that inbreeding between generations or targs lead partially to their doom and george is trying to tell us this teach us about it
gameofthrones,not_removed,rewatching episode of season and totally forgot that theres a good chance tyrion and sansa will be meeting again that is something i want to see
gameofthrones,not_removed,but jon isnt pure so hes not exactly going to feel some type of way about it
gameofthrones,not_removed,of course he will just like ned is not is father ultimately his parents love lead to death of thousands of lives and so on jon is kinda of guy to deeply think about it george writes about human struggle and whats the biggest one for jon his identity he wrestled with it since the beginning its bound to cause a friction in his relationship with dany whatever it might be just because jon is a targaryen doesnt means hes going to be cool with it
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe his eyes are replaced with bright icy blue ones
gameofthrones,not_removed,why do you do this to me
gameofthrones,not_removed,you see nothing jon snow
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont know if thats enough supporting evidence to be honest ramseys threat seems to be in line with his general sadism and fits with the theme of his come and see letter i imagine the thenns line is probably in reference to the weeper a wildling leader who cuts the eyes out of nights watchmen and leaves their heads outside castle black maester aemon mentions his blindness in like of his dialogue as it stands one threat of mutilation is not really that compelling in my own opinion i also dont see how jon losing his eyes would move his story forward in a positive way and it would make it damn near impossible to write jon povs in the books if he cant see anything i think jons eyes are safe
gameofthrones,not_removed,prolly not just cause that seems like a major plot point and i dont think theres much foreshadowing in the books for it
gameofthrones,not_removed,now you have me wondering if arya losing her sight has anything to do with this too especially since grrm said that all of the stark children were wargs hmmm interesting
gameofthrones,not_removed,i seriously doubt that the same i read about tyrion losing his tongue its how people notice their strengths tyrion has his charisma and jon has his way of seeing people for what they truly are
gameofthrones,not_removed,it just seems like a pretty common threat in the showmedieval times to me i also think that since arya was already blind for a while that sort of plot would seem stale in the show i think thats also why theyre limiting their resurrections
gameofthrones,not_removed,that still you in there edd
gameofthrones,not_removed,chilly
gameofthrones,not_removed,shit i just thought of fullmetal alchemist the character who had the most natural leader characteristics went blind
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea your point of view could very well be right maybe part of jons bittersweet ending could be losing them in the war for the dawn and having to live out his days blind
gameofthrones,not_removed,wait was this confirmed for the show or only the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon isnt a stark child even though his mother is a stark he isnt a stark in the context grrm was talking about when he said this
gameofthrones,not_removed,he got it back though didnt he
gameofthrones,not_removed,book and show they are all confirmed wargs in the books jon and arya both have dreams of being ghostnymeria respectful which bran did too before he was taught to control it and can warg whenever he wants sansa doesnt but thats because lady is dead unfortunately we can only assume robb and rickon do too because while they have no pov they are described as being very close to their wolves
gameofthrones,not_removed,he wargs in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,its implied jon is also a warg grrm absolutely included jon in that context
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah but only via philosophers stone
gameofthrones,not_removed,its suggested that robb had grey wind scout for him while warging
gameofthrones,not_removed,the stark children arent confirmed wargs in the show just about every implication to support it from the books was cut from the show so id say it was book only even then the association is usually pretty vaguely alluded to
gameofthrones,not_removed,ill warg you
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i know ive read them i just meant in the context of him somehow losing his sight
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know he wargs in the books just not in the context of losing his sight
gameofthrones,not_removed,well its settled then jon snow must seek out harry potter
gameofthrones,not_removed,musta missed that til
gameofthrones,not_removed,when and how does he warg in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,he wargs just about as much as arya does ie wolf dreams
gameofthrones,not_removed,he starts in acok when bran visits him in a dream i think grrm planned brans time travel for a very long time
gameofthrones,not_removed,is the worse for sure because of the pacing its the slowest season as far as the others go they are all pretty equal to me season was a strong and good one despite being beyond grrms writing
gameofthrones,not_removed,edit quick explanation is the worst for a few reasons not the least of which being the dorne arc had some very good parts with the final two episodes being great but was not consistent in that quality over the rest of the season which is why i rank it low as well i feel that the first seasons are all consistently good so there is not a huge difference between them i might switch around some of those if i gave it another rewatch
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like the way uaxmeaquestion did it the reason i put so low is not because its a bad season it was probably the season that move with the most rapidity but still maintained its integrity however and maybe im alone here but i felt the difference between having the books for reference and dd having to fill in the story gaps themselves there was something a little more shallow about this season nonaction scenes felt like build up to action scenes i love gots action dont get me wrong but i also love how cerebral the story can be and how important good conversations have been to episodes in the past and how important they are to the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the show peaked at the season finale the writing in seasons and felt lazy the dialogue wasnt as sharp or witty especially tyrions aryas braavos arc was really underwhelming there were a lot of poor attempts at humor and the overall charm and attention to detail of the first four seasons was lacking almost completely
gameofthrones,not_removed,id probably put them in a numerical list going from lowest quality to highest quality probably in a format something like this this is where the worst season would go with each one id put a brief explanation as to why its ranked there i would then disagree with every other commenter that had a different opinion from mine maybe even insulting their intelligence until they conceded that i was right all along so if i were to do it id go along that route there may be better ways to do it but im a list type of person
gameofthrones,not_removed,imo people complain about no one being poorly written but i really think it was the hype train that was built up by all the fans looking for shit that clearly wasnt there season was all around the best written and most entertaining
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,seasons four and six are my favorites all the twists like tyrions trial and the green trial and season four also had great character arcs with arya and tyrion season six made me love jon snow also had great spectacles like oberyn vs the mountain battle of castle black and botb dont enjoy seasons one and two as much just because they introduced so many characters in such a short timeframe its hard to enjoy the witty dialogue when im trying to remember who each character is season is at the bottom for its pacing the atrocious dorne plot and sansas character regression
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think theres a general consensus on here for obvious weird pacing reasons i also just personally didnt enjoy as much because i struggled to keep up with the plotlines as a nonbook reader and wasnt really interested until ned starks death hell it took me about half a year to get through it then i binged my way through in a few weeks
gameofthrones,not_removed,personally i thought season was the weakest of the series i thought dorne was just a turdfest but season kicked ass with the last episodes being in my opinion the best the series has had to offer
gameofthrones,not_removed,best to worst
gameofthrones,not_removed,my best to worst would be
gameofthrones,not_removed,although and are pretty close
gameofthrones,not_removed,from best to least best because in game of thrones there is no worst
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,so happy everyone is mentioning how bad season was seriously the dorne plot the actresses wereare awful the shock value was way too much sansa raped shireen being burned maryn trant a pedophile who beatsrapes girls arya killing him was good but they made it too gruesome so gruesome that it took away from her story speaking of arya i hated how they ruined that story the part she is blind just made no sense if you didnt read the books meaning the casual viewer wouldnt understand the meaning behind it was jaqen the face he has isnt the man arya met years ago its just another person another face they are no one okay to the question at hand from best to worst seasons are perfection i can rewatch them any episode and never get bored but come season and i can barely watch of it only the episodes directed by miguel sapochnik the gift hardhome battle of the bastards winds of winter hear me out about i loved six but it only had two perhaps good episodes the rest was very slow and poorly planned michael the director has saved two seasons so far and im worried he wont be around for which he wont aryas plot with the waif bothered me so many problems arya would not have survived that stomach wound talisa died in minutes from hers yet arya fell into a dirty city river didnt get medical attention for a whole day and her stomach wound didnt seem to bother her as she walked away from jaqen
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,every season of game of thrones is still amazing compared to most tvshows so being last doesnt really mean a lot season weak dorne plot and a badly written northern storyline with a boring daenerys plot jon snows story is the best part of this season with cersei being a close second season great dialogue and a very well made battle in blackwater there is however some slow building up which sometimes kills the flow of this season season good season with a surprising ending and a good plot all around season sean bean steals the show as ned stark and the dialogue is fantastic season good season that ends with the two best episodes in the show so far season best season all around jon defends the wall tyrion goes on trial bran reaches the raven and much more
gameofthrones,not_removed,stannis being defeated alone destroyed my respect for the season
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,season got some shit but i think it might be the best yet the only problems were aryas stupid terminator chase scene really her whole arc was kinda lame and unrealistic the first episode but even though they killed off dornes only cool characters it seems like it was actually just their way of removing dorne entirely so ill let that slide
gameofthrones,not_removed,season six had the best finish the rest of the season was on part with their usual quality
gameofthrones,not_removed,six had the most feels though the only scene in the entire series where i teared up hodor
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed to me season only has two good episodes well i liked the end of the door and to me amazing episodes does not save a whole season
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is by far the most effective answer to the question
gameofthrones,not_removed,my list pretty clear
gameofthrones,not_removed,just wondering why do you rank so high not trying to knock on your opinion just wondering
gameofthrones,not_removed,aryas arc is one of my favorites it felt like shit until i understood it
gameofthrones,not_removed,but then they brought dorne back
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was pretty unrealistic tbf just like the dead coming back to life
gameofthrones,not_removed,that was one of the highlights in season quality i was affected more watching the red wedding as well as neds oberyns and jons deaths though
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just think its one of the most cohesive and bestflowing seasons and it just feels like most of the storylines have a purpose and destination i love all the kings landing stuff and tyrion as hand of the king everything with arya in harrenhall is very interesting winterfell with bran and theon all the north of the wall stuff the introduction of stannis etc the list of amazing storylines just go on and on and of course i think blackwater is one of the best episodes of the series it just works for me and the season feels very satisfying dont know how else i can elaborate on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats been happening since like season but youre right death is losing its impact a bit after jon and the hound but for both i feel it was pretty obvious that they werent going to die jon in particular obviously still hasnt hit the end of his character arc
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think lannisport
gameofthrones,not_removed,no the swords in the iron throne are just normal swords
gameofthrones,not_removed,when she conquers kings landing good one cersei is not done yet she still has lots of wildfire left she will explode the city once and for all and jaime takes the opportunity to choke her to death daenerys taking the throne just seems like a happy story
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like to think aegon the conqueror was smart enough not to waste valyrian steel in the construction of a chair
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think daenerys will succeed at taking back the iron throne in her vision when she gets to it its ruins with no smoke so its not a recent event at least several days before she sets foot there im guessing cersei blows it before she gets there
gameofthrones,not_removed,hmm maybe they can make a valyrian shrapnel bomb
gameofthrones,not_removed,the throne is made from the swords of the lords of westoros which he conquered westoros cant make valyrian swords only made by the people of valyria so unless he decided to melt his own sword there wouldnt be in the iron throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think there is a reason it is called the iron throne and not the valyrian throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,but but dragonfier and keingsblood
gameofthrones,not_removed,best answer yet thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,it wasnt just the dragonglass it was also the magic of the children of the forest
gameofthrones,not_removed,wish this was specified as something from the books i was scratching my head and googling where aegon was in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,im confused isnt aegon dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah the books do a much better job showing how big of a bitch cersei is
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha i just read this part yesterday
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the books a boy claims to be aegon the son of rhaegar targaryen and elia martell it is unknown whether he actually escaped death as a toddler or if he is an impostor
gameofthrones,not_removed,there have been a lot of people called aegon this one is rhaegar and elias son traveling around essos with jon connington one of rhaegars best friends and former hand of the king under aerys ii under fake names in the books theyve already landed in westeros with an army and have started conquering in the show a lot of their story line has been added onto danys with jorah taking most of the jon connington stuff in the books varys doesnt leave kings landing but sends tyrion to pentos to be delivered to illyrio mopatis his friend with whom hes conspiring to put aegon on the throne in the show they support dany instead as aegon doesnt exist in the show mopatis hands tyrion over to jon connington who is sailing towards volantis to await danys passing they plan to try to convince her to join up with them along the way they are attacked by stone men and connington contracts greyscale in the show this happens to jorah instead when theyre staying at a city called selhorys they find out dany isnt leaving meereen any time soon so they sail to westeros on their own with a massive sellsword company while in selhorys tyrion visits a brothel and is captured by jorah mormont who takes him to volantis on horse where they board a ship headed for meereen on the way theyre captured by slavers and made to fight in the pits but they escape when their master contracts the bloody flux dysentery jorah and tyrion then join a sellsword company thats where we stand while we wait for the new book
gameofthrones,not_removed,not in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,well in the show she literally blows up a religious wonder killing of nobles including her strongest allies
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah it gets tiring of the tv trying to make her more sympatheticthen she goes and commits the got version of
gameofthrones,not_removed,neat
gameofthrones,not_removed,very nice recap i forget how much the show differs from the books cant wait for martin to finish the book so we can get the detailed version
gameofthrones,not_removed,detailed explanation point neat points there is no justice
gameofthrones,not_removed,my problem with game of thrones latest season is that its way more eye candy than actual story we had the whole season to build up an awesome story for arya and it ended honestly like this when did she actually learn to kill people to make them into a pie is this what you are able to after fighting another assassin with a stick episode and were great but they were not perfect definitely but still there where things i didnt understood
gameofthrones,not_removed,im torn while the last two episodes are definitely two of my favorites but there were definitely some issues it definitely feels good to have some loose ends tie up though disregarding conventional travel patterns allowed benioff and weiss to focus on more important details is it just me or was this actually super annoying the world feels a lot smaller when characters basically can teleport all over and the time frame of events become very vague it just comes off as lazy writing
gameofthrones,not_removed,that is just how you write a story with this scale and this many characters you dont need to show every single character traveling in a second scene you have to assume your viewers arent total morons and can unscramble the timeline
gameofthrones,not_removed,rather have that than tyrions lame turtle traveling circus that i had the misfortune to read in adwd and countless other examples from the latest two booksmartins travalogue is fucking garbage imo
gameofthrones,not_removed,coc insanely strange players in clash of clans glitches in clash of clans glitched player in clash of clans clash of clans hackers player with no barracks no barracks weird strange weird players in clash of clans strange players in clash of clans town hall with no barracks no barracks in clash of clans this shouldnt be possible in clash of clans hacker hacked player in clash of clans this player has no barracks in clash of clans coc clash of clans playing game playing playing game game
gameofthrones,not_removed,emergency awesome did pretty good summary for all the season episodes and his content uses a mix of book and show so its easy on all viewers i think hes pretty good at pointing out the nuances without being too content heavy
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is a channel called filmfabrik but it is in german
gameofthrones,not_removed,nien
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes awful feels like he reads from the wiki and says it on a quick video even preston jacobs would be better id say smoke screen does good videos
gameofthrones,not_removed,nein ftfy
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont know of very many options im sorry ill delete my original reply
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was trying to remember the ie ei pronunciation rule i learned back in grade
gameofthrones,not_removed,its fine its just that hes mostly famous for making quick videos just to have a lot of videos but with minimal information and detail p
gameofthrones,not_removed,what rule
gameofthrones,not_removed,i remember i took a year of german in grade and it was kind of a blow off class but one rule that apparently didnt stuck with me was pronunciation of ei vs ie in german was you pronounce the second vowel
gameofthrones,not_removed,well that rule is wrong either way
gameofthrones,not_removed,surely jon and sansa are finally gonna learn about littlefingers role in what happened to ned
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really want a see everything collapse on littlefinger in season i think its likely olenna will tell varys
gameofthrones,not_removed,from what ive seen of varys id bet he already knows about the joffery thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,was this the scene where little finger claimed to have a valuable boy what was he talking about
gameofthrones,not_removed,well according to littlefinger in the latest episode he has already publicly declared for house stark whatever reluctance he had of making an enemy of the cersei and the lannisters is now gone even more so now because of how much she has severely weakened her house by destroying the sept
gameofthrones,not_removed,great catch i never thought about that line but youre so right cant wait to see what happens
gameofthrones,not_removed,i can name one possibility dany arrives in kings landing cersei is in the way right well maybe queen of thorns steps up asks dany to have faith in her and then all she does is play her cards right to let cersei know littlefinger was responsible using his activities in the north as proof cersei sends troops north now dany swoops in to sack kings landing cersei doesnt stand a chance cause shes out a couple thousand men that she desperately needed to even put up a fight gg other than that i doubt it comes up much i could see it as an unexpected downfall of littlefinger namely that the troops show up looking for littlefinger they state their purpose and because jon perhaps has his hands full with the white walkers and such he wants to comply with southern forces in hopes of addressing the white walkers he wants no issue with other houses he wants to work together this could likewise drive a wedge between him and sansa but well see im speculating of course but it definitely sounds like a move with potential to cause all sorts of neat conflicts if people are arguing about whether to kill littlefinger or spare him
gameofthrones,not_removed,and loras died too so grandson and granddaughter
gameofthrones,not_removed,surely cersei can ruin littlefinger so easily by making it public that he betrayed ned
gameofthrones,not_removed,by the way op nice username
gameofthrones,not_removed,he brought his dagger to kings landing i doubt hed leave it somewhere i guess i just dont see little finger killing olenna himself
gameofthrones,not_removed,what began as a battle of kings will end with a battle of queens personally olenna is a favorite character of mine and id love to see her come out on top
gameofthrones,not_removed,but why lf did nothing to help cersei in fact the exact opposite she raised arryn guys and north guys against cersei olenna should be proud of him
gameofthrones,not_removed,and this is my only problem with the showbooks all the political stuff seems kinda trivial when a known apocalypse is in the way i fell it more so in the show all the back stabbing and manipulating i feel in love with in the first seasons is taking a back seat to the action
gameofthrones,not_removed,can you remind me of the role littlefinger had in neds death that was so long ago
gameofthrones,not_removed,arya is gonna murder little finger i cant wait ☺
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i just rewatched and the only characters in the throneroom who could have witnessed his betrayal and are still alive to testify are varys and sandor excluding littlefinger and cersei themselves of course
gameofthrones,not_removed,its been pretty well covered up jons best chance at that was janos slynt but that head rolled a long time ago definitely not impossible but not the most likely scenario
gameofthrones,not_removed,and then jon gonna kill that fool
gameofthrones,not_removed,how though unless littlefinger confesses it himself or bran makes it past the wall and back to winterfell
gameofthrones,not_removed,and littlefinger with jon arryn
gameofthrones,not_removed,sansa told queen cersi too didnt she
gameofthrones,not_removed,im hoping bran will warg himself into the past and watch the scene in the throneroom unfold then he goes to regroup with his fam in winterfell and recognizes littlefinger itd make for a great turn of events
gameofthrones,not_removed,from who who is left except lf who knows about that
gameofthrones,not_removed,i had this same belief but the theme with danarys and tyrion is ending the psychotic habits of their parents ned was a little psychotic himself in executing deserters of the nights watch that halucinate white walkers he was talking madness claiming he saw white walkers perhaps jon will break neds psychotic habit of executing and pardon littlefinger for his usefulness he does kindabelong to the group of them imo varys littlefinger were long term rivals for example edit hey this was a play on eamon with the men of the nights watch being armed by headless men you start executing every soldier that runs in fear of something youre gonna end up with a very small army imo p plus i never really understood desertion anyway its not like you can hop in a rocket and escape the terrarium is only so big
gameofthrones,not_removed,are you following olenna plotted to kill joffrey she doesnt know a thing about ned and the joffrey murder pleased sansa and so jon
gameofthrones,not_removed,i want to see him rise up actually so far its all been him building himself up while destroying everything else in the process but it hasnt gotten to the point of him directly winning anything hes in such a precarious position anyway and it definitely looks as though nothing bodes in his favor vale knights arent loyal to him the north is loyal to jon the hound is heading that way with info on what happened to ned he broke his alliance with cersei olenna might reveal that joff was poisoned dany is coming with the intention to break the wheel the walkers are right next to him with an impending apocalypse his only hope will be sansa
gameofthrones,not_removed,but who cares that they conspired to kill joffrey what would be more interesting is if varys got words to sansa and john about neds betrayal
gameofthrones,not_removed,and varys will say i know even if he didnt
gameofthrones,not_removed,but why the good of the char is that without wealth withouth a big name without any combat skill he gets to beat knights and kings it would be much much better if he could gain alliance of jon and dany someway if they just kill him there is nothing fun about it
gameofthrones,not_removed,at some point i think grrm said that lf and varys are in a stalemate because lf knows something about varys that he doesnt want getting out and varys knows all about lf and his assassinations may have been book only though
gameofthrones,not_removed,the boy is most likely
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea i think the death of the lady stark is what triggered little finger to swing to the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,she doesnt care that baelish betrayed ned his betraying lord stark benefited her and revelation of that may hurt what little she has left no cersei is taking that one to her grave
gameofthrones,not_removed,all the men go off to war then they die and the women are all that remainexceptjonwhodoesntdie
gameofthrones,not_removed,just because she was a loose end and knew some stuff that could ruin him
gameofthrones,not_removed,exactly the last couple of books have had some intriguing and sometimes hilarious court intrigue which was abound in seasons and recently everyone but the main characters are so
gameofthrones,not_removed,littlefinger told ned that he was gonna bribe the gold cloaks for him and so ned walked into the throne room thinking he had the gold cloaks support but littlefinger actually bribed them to support cersei so they killed neds men and arrested ned littlefinger put a knife to neds throat and famously said i did warn you not to trust me
gameofthrones,not_removed,dude he did so much in the beginning he convinced cat that tyrion was behind the attempt on brans life which literally started the war he managed to keep ned in kings landing a few extra hours just long enough to ensure the conflict between ned and jaime would occur outside his brothel and of course he betrayed ned outright when he confronted the queen and joffrey
gameofthrones,not_removed,littlefinger tricked ned into thinking he had a standing army of sorts in the city when they were paid for by lf the whole time and ned did not understand lfs actual motives until it was too late he tried to assert his will of honor onto the throne and lf said naw son
gameofthrones,not_removed,arya gets to kill everyone id really rather sansa be the one to kill lf
gameofthrones,not_removed,if arya murders lf then she or sansa or bran gain control of the eyre
gameofthrones,not_removed,somehow neither of those two seem particularly fond of things like testimony
gameofthrones,not_removed,sandor gonna tell sansa
gameofthrones,not_removed,did the hound ever tell arya about littlefingers role in her fathers deathq
gameofthrones,not_removed,there was no chance that janos wouldve ever told jon varys or sandor definitely would
gameofthrones,not_removed,varys would likely know the truth though
gameofthrones,not_removed,sansa told cersei ned was taking his family and men back to winterfell asap she didnt know anything else
gameofthrones,not_removed,varys and sandor
gameofthrones,not_removed,killing deserters doesnt make him mad deserting the wall has been punishable by death for hundreds if not thousands of years if that deserter was found out down south the same punishment would have been given to him
gameofthrones,not_removed,the thing is with the deserter couldnt he have simply gone back at the gate to tell the lord commander of the watch was it necessary for him to ride all the way down south
gameofthrones,not_removed,are you the post discussed her alliance with varys and how she could use that against littlefinger varys knows about littlefingers role in what happened to ned and can inform littlefingers current benefactors
gameofthrones,not_removed,by the end of last season we got the first glimpse on grrms intentions the young being so fed up with the old bonding together over petty things like houses heritage nationality or rank to end everyone who is not capable of being honest and furthering an agenda i think that is the only thing littlefinger didnt anticipate in his plan the biggest play anyone ever came up with it always needs something horrible that later generations start saying no down with this shit and that is why littlefinger will probably be the last death in the entire show
gameofthrones,not_removed,it would be so annoying to have sansa regress yet again and be a pawn for littlefinger at this point she knows or at least has heard from many that there is a literal army of the dead led by white walkers heading to the wall to destabilize the north out of jealousy or whatever would just be incredibly dumb im hoping that glance at littlefinger was more of a realization that this guy is going to be a problem and not a glance of yeah the guy who made me a suspect of kingslaying and then who gave me to ramsey bolton who has told me hell do whatever he needs to to sit on the iron throne i should trust him over my half brother who has never done anything but treat me with respect and risked his life marching on winterfell after being killed and wanting to just go south obviously
gameofthrones,not_removed,also why would olenna betray lf now her only motivation is tearing down cersei and lf is going to have to get rid of cersei at some point too
gameofthrones,not_removed,his only hope will be sansa and thats why i think it will be sansa stoneheart that does him in
gameofthrones,not_removed,he must die
gameofthrones,not_removed,because while what hes doing could be considered worthy of admiration from a certain point of view at any other time him continuing to cause chaos as a literal army of the dead prepares to wipe out humanity could result in everyone dying on top of that we know that he is a compete scumbag through his scheming husband of the woman i love fuck him more power for me daughter of the woman i love fuck her off to ramsey whore so was sad bad investment let someone mutilate her hes not just a schemer he is an objectively evil character all of the other major players seem to have a common theme of trying to make the world a better place littlefinger would burn the world if he could rule over the ashes
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh boy youre not going to be pleased with the next season
gameofthrones,not_removed,to be honest their meeting alone in the throne room in or was one of my favorite dialogues and kind of implied this a certain youre good at hiding but not from me but im sure you feel the same so im going to keep my distance on revealing your dirty secrets for my own gain just in case some bad shit comes back vibe kind of sweeps over them
gameofthrones,not_removed,littlefinger hints to varys that he knows varys was meeting with illyrio mopatis whom they know was sheltering daenerys and viserys targaryan and planning on restoring the targaryans to the throne varys couldnt let that secret get out until the targaryans had an army behind them but at this point the game is up and theres no need to keep that secret anymore
gameofthrones,not_removed,but i thought petyr presented it as if it would be a gift from him but he had nothing to do with lancel confessing and so on
gameofthrones,not_removed,is everyone else watching the marathon too i actually have all the seasons on my computer but its nice having it on the big screen anyways that episode is on right now and i was thinking this too for a second i thought he might be talking about jon because i personally think that if anyone could figure out what happened at toj outside of what we the viewers know itd be littlefinger and varys later in the same episode tyrion is telling dany how his father helped to kill both the targaryens and the starks
gameofthrones,not_removed,valar morgulis d
gameofthrones,not_removed,was this the same in the books as well as the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,littlefinger didnt bribe the gold cloaks to do anything he paid them to do their jobs that was littlefingers job and thats the whole point the brilliance of his character is his ability to manipulate events to catastrophic conclusions without usually any actual actions of his own that stand out as inflammatory thus allowing retaliation to be directed elsewhere littlefinger napoleon sith lord big semantic rant to say the word bribe doesnt apply
gameofthrones,not_removed,had he kept the word given to baelish nothing would have happened
gameofthrones,not_removed,didnt he also arrange the death of jon arryn an event without which the lannisters would never have come north and ned would never have gone south in the first place
gameofthrones,not_removed,why bran
gameofthrones,not_removed,lysa married into house arryn shes a tully from the riverlands even if the succession for the eyrie worked like that the lords of the eyrie choose and even if robin died too it would just pass to a relative of jon arryns
gameofthrones,not_removed,varys might be inclined to tell about it since hes now serving daenerys and since she will likely form an alliance with jon snow and his kingdom perhaps varys will step in and tell jon hey bro im just trying to watch your back and that guy littlefinger hes probably gonna betray you like he betrayed your dad yeah did i mention he betrayed your dad of course jon might be reluctant to trust the word of a stranger who might just be trying to sow seeds of division through lies and deceit over the word of the guy whose army saved him from defeat at tbotb it would be much more convincing if coming simultaneously from sandor who is apparently going to be with the brotherhood now which is conveniently headed north to fight the others the hound formed a sort of bond or at the very least acquaintance with both sansa and arya so perhaps he would do his best to help
gameofthrones,not_removed,who is this sandor you philistines keep referring to sandor fell from that cliff and was left for dead only the hound remains
gameofthrones,not_removed,not on screen as far as i can recall they may have had the conversation but we just dont know about it if he did tell her arya probably would have put littlefinger on her list and we would know about it when she said his name
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah that wouldnt make sense hey i know youre lord commander and you hate me but i helped kill your father so you know you should wait did i say that out loud
gameofthrones,not_removed,she ran to cersei about them leaving it was a mistake but still a betrayal when ned told her to pack and leave i dont blame her but arya might
gameofthrones,not_removed,when ned was talking to his brother before the wall they were drinkingearly episodes of season like ep id guess he says why he executed him he was talking madness said he saw white walkers he explained the reason for his execution meanwhile the dude was a normal soldier that got spooked from seeing the dead his punishment death by delusional people in charge
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was more upset likewhy notyou knownot kill him and send him back because they kill deserters then complain about low number of members in the nights watch and then wonder how problems happen hehe
gameofthrones,not_removed,ok but why since they are all allied against cersei it makes not sense lf didnt backstab olenna she helped her as he could and tyrells died in fact just when he was away and couldnt help her in any way
gameofthrones,not_removed,ahh the old flip the table strategy
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed that would be much better
gameofthrones,not_removed,because olenna hates lf with a burning passion and only ever worked with him out of necessity im fully expecting her to try to take lf down even if she doesnt have anything to really gain from it shed do it just for the sheer enjoyment of watching him suffer i imagine that dany will eventually take kings landing and capture cersei in order to execute her olenna will be there and thats the moment olenna will reveal to cersei who really killed joffrey just to see the look on cerseis face shell make sure dany knows not to trust lf and basically force lf to flee kings landing somehow the lords of the vale will find out that lf killed lysa and lfs only option will be to flee to the north at some point after that id like for sansa to be the one that ends up killing lf let littlefinger have his moment where he thinks the throne will soon be his before everything falls out from underneath him itll be much more interesting watching him fall if he gets as high as he possibly can first
gameofthrones,not_removed,all men do
gameofthrones,not_removed,man you dont have to explain lf obiously he is more evil than good but in doing his own business he happened to do more good than bad lisa was a much evil and stupider person and he killed her he helped both ramsay and joffrey for a small while but in the end his final move in both cases killed them sure he has no boundaries but his big plays all helped the other big players in the end and probably even the realm since he moved the vale army north just as it happens the undead are arriving
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wasnt please with this season either a part from the astonishing direction and cinematic the story was bad hopefully there will be book out
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was all a bit confusing it happens completely differently in the books where its just cersei being an idiot and getting herself arrested through her own paranoia and dumb actions lancel isnt anywhere near kings landing when cersei gets arrested in the books but in the show i didnt entirely follow how it played out in the show the sparrows basically appear in kings landing out of nowhere with lancel who embraced religion after nearly dying from a wound then cersei declares the high sparrow to be the new high septon which is a bit weird as the most devout are supposed to declare the new high septon but their existence is never mentioned in the show as far as im aware and then rearms the faith militant lancel confesses to the hs and cerseis busted im not sure how littlefinger is supposed to have orchestrated all this according to the showcanon wiki there was an offscreen interaction between olenna and lancel in which olenna somehow forces or convinces him to tell the high sparrow about him and cersei after littlefinger instructs her to do so you would think a genuine convert like lancel who did all the necessary repentance would have already confessed these sins to the hs but apparently not
gameofthrones,not_removed,there were at least midwives servants that were present at the birthing what happened to them who knows
gameofthrones,not_removed,if you have hbo you can watch any episode either ondemand or on hbogo i marathon rewatched the whole series leading up to last season i wanted to watch an episode or two and before i knew it i had torn through the whole series lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,unrelated but if you have a or some other streaming device and a decent router you can download universal media server on your computer and stream to your tv
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes same quote too
gameofthrones,not_removed,iirc season was the closest to the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,actually littlefinger did bribe the goldcloaks janos slynt the commander was offered the lordship of harrenhal and many of the officers were paid large sums of gold tyrion cleans house when he is acting hand men who were bribed once could be bribed again
gameofthrones,not_removed,the whole context of the nedlittlefinger scene is ned reluctantly asking littlefinger to bribe them littlefinger bribes a lot hes frequently bribing people in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,doing their job would have been to follow the decree that ned be named protector of the realm until baratheon heir came of age he did bribe them to obey cersei and joffrey the bribery is evidenced by janos slynt being offered a lordship the castle harrenhal and all its attending lands
gameofthrones,not_removed,janos was bribed though harrenhal
gameofthrones,not_removed,what are you referring to he didnt break a promise to baelish he rejected baelishs plan and told him upfront
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah he convinced lysa to poison jon arryn she admitted this before she lost her mind and did a base jump out of the moon door edit sorry thats in the books not the show sorry
gameofthrones,not_removed,littlefinger is literally the source of everything of asoiaf
gameofthrones,not_removed,also true except that seems much more complicated the death of jon arryn seemed to be mostly to cover up joffreys illegitimacy i got the impression it was him giving cersei the hookup and gaining ties with the crown and more power but then also theres the conversation between varys and illyrio that arya overhears from the dragon skull where theyre talking about killing hands of the king to protect cerseis secret in order to prevent war before the time is ripe for the targaryan return so it would seem that jon arryns murder was also to support drogo and dany so i dunno that act specifically seems more convoluted than instigating some shit with the starks
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think through catelyn but i was under impression lords of eyrie would choose suitable male heir themselves among themselves
gameofthrones,not_removed,bran could take out sweetrobin and i cant stand bran but sweetrobin sucks
gameofthrones,not_removed,id argue its the other way around then again i thought the waters of the house of black white would kill arya stark and leave only no one so take my argument with a grain of salt
gameofthrones,not_removed,he wasnt killed for seeing white walkers he was executed because he broke the law by deserting the nights watch instead of reporting to the lord commander
gameofthrones,not_removed,if a deserter is sent back it gives others the incentive to desert theyll just think hell if im caught it just means ive had a holiday would his brothers be able to trust him again or would they always be wondering in the back of their minds how long until he legs it again
gameofthrones,not_removed,baelish told olenna he gave up olyvar whose testimony put loras in prison
gameofthrones,not_removed,even if they share a common enemy their interests are mutually exclusive and will eventually come to a head lf wants the iron throne for himself varys wants it to go to danaerys lfs plans will almost certainly involve danaerys meeting a non throne fate and varys who knows that will do what needs to be done to prevent that
gameofthrones,not_removed,break the wheel
gameofthrones,not_removed,itll be much more interesting watching him fall if he gets as high as he possibly can first possibly literally moon door anyone
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree he should be close to his goal before he falls if he dies now at winterfell right after his first few blunders it will seem kind of unsatisfying and sad
gameofthrones,not_removed,youve been downvoted but besides the last episodes the series was pretty disappointing as with the one before it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i keep a digital library on my computer from everything from star wars to harry potter to sopranos to game of thrones but yah i was just watching the hbo marathon
gameofthrones,not_removed,the first season was really great about this kind of stuff
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought his lordship and harrenhal came from cersei joffrey im not quite there in the books yet but thats how i understood it from the show plus lf cant give someone lands and a title he doesnt have authority like that does he seems to me he just kind of nudged him to the path of least resistance which happened to be the most profitable path anyways
gameofthrones,not_removed,what hes asking isnt about the money because littlefinger is going to be the guy that pays them the same money whatever they do therefore not a bribe by any definition ned and cerci both outrank littlefinger and are giving him contradictory orders what ned is asking for is littlefinger to follow his orders instead of hers thats all the dishonor expressed by ned is from having to admit that littlefinger is important enough to be the critical guy to have on your side he hates that because he knows littlefinger is a sneaky little shit and a great one at that
gameofthrones,not_removed,poor janos hes always been afraid
gameofthrones,not_removed,i meant the whole action lets say he would have fought baelish and got his throat cut end of story no conflict
gameofthrones,not_removed,she said it in the show too just not then
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh yeah im not under the impression his primary motivation was to fuck with the starks or even ned but without him they possibly would have had a nice peaceful life in the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,he is not sweet tho
gameofthrones,not_removed,he ran and never looked back because he got scared of the undead i still think it was poor policy and decision coulda said hey lets hold on the killing for now and brought him before the lord commander had the kid calm down tell his story and then decide the lads fate instead of hey he ran instakill lol what he said yknow just asking for some reason
gameofthrones,not_removed,how did he get south of the wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea but say a battle comes id rather have that deserter a chance to fight again then a corpse in the graveyard used to morally frighten
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah eventually the good thing about the feud between lf and varys is that neither has an interest in the other actually and that neither understand the long con of the other actually have everything resolved with killing one or both of them is so dull it hurts they are not powerful they are not strong killing ned was huge cause he was powerful killing robb the same killing lf means nothing it is just a cheap death bad as was bad to kill stannis after he already lost the battle
gameofthrones,not_removed,the series what
gameofthrones,not_removed,yup i know dont worry i dont care about downvotes
gameofthrones,not_removed,i watched seasons before reading the books it amazed me how much of the dialogue in the beginning was copied directly from the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,its because the book was such a perfect introduction to just about everything asoiaf the show only having one confirmed season then was a blessing in disguise they needed to be as accurate a representation as possible later the series derives pretty far from the books but there are many reasons for this
gameofthrones,not_removed,littlefinger brought the offer of the bribe to slynt
gameofthrones,not_removed,janos doesnt have to obey littlefinger littlefinger bribed him thats what littlefinger does he bribes people
gameofthrones,not_removed,little finger is master of coin he doesnt control the gold cloaks
gameofthrones,not_removed,the law is that desertertion is punnishable by death i get your logic of only headless men would man the wall if we executed everybody but there is a difference between going after whores and stuff in your free time and returning to your post after and leaving completely if desertion was not punnished enough not even headless men would man the wall as everybody would leave lets remember that most of the nights watch are there brcause they had no choice they are convicted criminals and all their crimes were forgiven for the service to the realm if anybody could join up and leave itd be concidered a free out of jail ticket and nothing more
gameofthrones,not_removed,deserters of the nights watch are sentenced to death they swear an oath when they join their ranks are fully aware of the consequences of desertion his encounter with the white walkers led him to choose execution over his sworn duty he knew what would happen willingly accepted his fate
gameofthrones,not_removed,i imagine that the reason that benjen stark was in winterfell was because he was hunting the deserter being headranger it would be him sent out if he had found the deserter before his brother he probably would have spared him and brought him back while neds honour demanded that he carry out the law benjen probably would have had a more sympathetic and pragmatic view of the situation
gameofthrones,not_removed,i imagine he returned in the normal fashion the watcher on the wall signalling to open the gate then he either tried to tell his story and wasnt believed so he hightailed it in the night or else the second he got through the gate he just galloped right through castle black and didnt stop until his horse died from exhaustion this is pure speculation though i dont think were ever told exactly how he got south
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes but if you were on the eve of battle would you want to go to sleep wondering how many brothers would still be there in the morning
gameofthrones,not_removed,if he ran when there wasnt a battle he sure as shit is going to run away from the battle
gameofthrones,not_removed,i picked them up between season and sadly one of the deaths in the book was spoiled for me but not how or when so it was a surprise but not that much of a surprise
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah unfortunately at some point the idiots dd started thinking they could actually write
gameofthrones,not_removed,the books do get longer so if they had to keep up the trend of accuracy theyd have to have seasons double as long not that id mind
gameofthrones,not_removed,right i guess im kind of splitting hairs but if it werent for joffrey he wouldnt be able to collect said bribe
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think he means littlefinger had a job to pay people and tellem their orders hand of the king versus the queen and he chose
gameofthrones,not_removed,slynt doesnt answer to littlefinger in any official capacity you are right but as the master of coin littlefinger is the one that ensures that the goldcloaks get paid so it is certainly in his interest to keep him happy
gameofthrones,not_removed,ok those are reasonable speculations in any case
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats it exactly it also helps to keep in mind that most people are not like benjen and jon the vast majority of the brothers of the nights watch are not there by choice
gameofthrones,not_removed,its like with stannis if youre a good king you get loyalty you start burning children at the stake your men gonna leave ya
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was him by himself leftover after the white walkers slaughtered his comrades like meat id run if i was by myself too p if he fights again he wont be by himself hell stand along side an army
gameofthrones,not_removed,clearly you need a bad pussy
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol just leave
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would christ im only a few chapters into affc and my fucking lord is it boring briennes story is so damn repetetive already and i dont see it getting much better
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is from a small council meeting shortly after he was granted harrenhal cersei you command the city watch do you not lord slynt janos i do your grace cersei and are you not a lord at my command janos i owe my title and lands to your generosity your grace cersei then do your job shut the gates to the peasants they belong in the field not our capital janos yes your grace then from game of thrones wikia for house slynt house slynt is a noble house of the seven kingdoms it held fealty directly to king joffrey baratheon who ordered the founding of the house as a reward for janos slynts assistance in securing the iron throne for him
gameofthrones,not_removed,littlefinger does not give orders to the gold cloaks as part of his job the gold cloaks are not under the command of the master of coin just because he manages the treasury janos did his bidding because he bribed him
gameofthrones,not_removed,not really because janos would get his normal salary paid by littlefingers replacement anyway he did littlefingers bidding because he was bribed
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think people would be more willing to join the nights watch if they would have it like current militaries are where you can still go back and see your family if they had enough men to arm the wall and protect it they could easily have vacations for the men at the wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,to be fair those who deserted stannis were the sellswords he bought with money from the iron bank stanniss men had probably gotten used to the numerous sacrifices the sellswords on the other hand were probably like what the fuck this guy is a nut makes me wonder do the sellswords that arent slaves have any governing organization to punish deserters youd think theyd bail if possible any time they find themselves in a situation with not so good odds
gameofthrones,not_removed,then why wouldnt he run to castle black he had to have went through there to run away anyway
gameofthrones,not_removed,an army of a few hundred men verses the legions of undead wights is far worse odds than the fight that he ran from
gameofthrones,not_removed,random words ok
gameofthrones,not_removed,the entire kingsmoot debacle was reduced to ten freaking minutes thank the seven
gameofthrones,not_removed,it took me like two years to finish that book the first three were great though i read them in early i bought dance with dragons but never started
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont k so why he though it would be interesting for us to read about her trying to find sansa when we know shes nowhere near her
gameofthrones,not_removed,feast is the worst one though like i fucked up my whole series bad but he managed to right the ship with dance with dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,man good to know im not the only one who thinks affc is kinda boring good thing i finished it before new years it dwindled my interest in reading though i read it in about a month while i finished the first books the month before now i cant seem to continue the fifth book
gameofthrones,not_removed,exactly there will always be another master of coin
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats a pretty good point using a penal military force to hold a strategically valuable point does seem like a bad idea especially if the military force in question is serving out an execution by a different name rather than just a period of service after which they could get a pardon
gameofthrones,not_removed,i get the sense that if youve shown your trustworthiness even if in the nights watch as punishment for a crime you could be granted brief leave for certain reasons we saw benjen in winterfell yoren and thorne were both sent to kings landing however they dont want family men in the nights watch like being a kings guard its supposed to be for life thats not a problem in and of itself in fact for so many men born without lands and titles or for those that shamed themselves due to crime joining the nights watch was a way to become honorable and thats the problem with the nights watch now it isnt seen as honorable anymore people stopped believing in anything other than wildlings living beyond the wall the wildlings were never a threat until mance organized them since being a brother of the nights watch no longer carried honor fewer and fewer people chose to join they became more and more dependent on criminals which made them even less honorable if being a brother of the nights watch was seen as honorable theyd have plenty of bastards men without prospects and even lords that are or in the life of succession willing to join the order for life
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes very random
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes usualy internet nonsense when a guy cant reply on topic seen millions of times
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was being sarcastic the bad pussy line is from game of thrones do you even watch the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes why
gameofthrones,not_removed,you want the good girl but need the bad pussy sound familiar to you
gameofthrones,not_removed,do better the crown looks shit on the wolf
gameofthrones,not_removed,we really need the next season
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont read a lot of fanfiction whats the context
gameofthrones,not_removed,imagine disrespecting george so much by writing fan fiction knowing his feelings towards it
gameofthrones,not_removed,robert dies ned becomes king via council of the lord paramounts
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was on the other side
gameofthrones,not_removed,going to the vancouver show on saturday cant wait
gameofthrones,not_removed,was it a good show
gameofthrones,not_removed,one of the best ive ever been to got goose bumps throughout the concert
gameofthrones,not_removed,try to use a bit more formating eg two line breaks so you get paragraphs navies in feudal society there were few standing navies in feudal society navies are expensive to build and maintain and feudal kings and lords could always hire or conscript civil ships for military purposes when needed the eastern romans and some of the islamic caliphates maintained navies though some years there was no money to crew the ships or keep them afloat some strong kings like henry v during the hundred years war found the determination and funds to create a navy of kings ships which allowed him to secure the english channel during his lifetime navies existed to transport troops and supplies since ships and river barges could carry troops and supplies farther and faster than they could be transported across lands which still relied on a transportation system roads and bridges built over a thousand years before in some instances navies then had to seek to deny an enemy the prospect of transporting troops and supplies especially an invasion force and sustaining them from the sea finally navies had to fight through the enemys attempt to prevent the movement of troops and supplies strategically navies were linked to critical and essential geographic points such as narrows and straits that an enemy needed to traverse or ports and bays that facilitated the loading and unloading of troops and supplies eurons best bet to engage danys fleet intercept at the coast trap the fleet and engage when landing break a blockade after landing whether euron greyjoy joins cersei or not he wants revenge on his niece and nephew if he somehow found enough ship lumber on the iron islands to build his ships crew them and arm and supply them which would take a few months his best bet at intercepting the trageryan fleet is the straits between westeros and essos ancient and medieval seamen could navigate across oceans and seas the problem was that their ships with some exceptions like the vikings werent built to survive rough weather so they stayed in sight of land in order to run for a bay or port as a safe anchorage against a storm the romans lost entire fleets to storms also without radar aerial recon and binoculars even large fleets could easily miss each other in the open ocean which is why there are so few open ocean battles in history so danys fleet will run along the coast of essos till it passes through the stepstones the grey gallows or the broken arm his other chance would be to trap danys fleet inside the sea of dorne or at sunspear and attack her as she is landing her troops another scenario would be euron seeking to break a blockade of blackwater bay by yara and theon after they had landed danys army somewhere along the sea of dorne danys likely route of travel why the sea of dorne unless resupplied during their travels another reason for staying near the coast a feudal fleet could not travel for a long period of time especially one carrying horses horses dont like sea travel and keeping them healthy for any period at sea can be problematic in the century the british rarely tried to transport horses to north america since too many died on the trip british german and loyalist cavalry had to find mounts in america or fight on foot sea travel also was unhealthy for troops between the lack of hygiene exercise and the horrible food regiments could lose of the men they boarded the ships with dany would want to get her army ashore as soon as possible that could mean heading straight to sunspear it would be difficult for euron to intercept her unless he waited in the straights for her to pass by if she didnt go straight across from the island of lys the three types of navies in feudal society there were essentially three types of navies in feudal society each with its own tactics and ships but in almost all cases the objective was to turn the ships into a fighting platform for menatarms infantry marines and sailors the galley in places like the med the galley dominated long narrow light draft and lightly built they could use sails for cruising but their primary motive power was men at oars in ancient times oarsmen were free men part of the crew and expected to participate in the fight slaves as rowers were introduced in the medieval period the galleys of this time never reached the size of some of the ancient ships usually had only a single bank of oars with one to ten men at each oar the galley carried artillery stone and bolt throwers mostly which with the missile troops using javelins and bows were intended to sweep the decks of enemy ships not sink them though some fire projectiles could start a blaze if the other ships crew couldnt put it out maneuver their ship and shoot at the enemy at the same time ships were sunk through ramming headon or into the beam side if a galley couldnt pull free she might go down with her victim a galley could maneuver to sweep across an opponents oars breaking them and leaving the enemy vulnerable whether after ramming or when an enemy was vulnerable a galley would pull alongside and its troops armored menatarms or marines would board the enemy ship and seek to kill or capture the opposing crew and take the ship archers and javelinmen would support the effort from the bow and stern of the ships at a certain point one fleet or another would lose heart and retreat or flee castle ships in the english channel some galleys operated north into the english channel but they were limited to coastal waters and only certain times of the year when conditions were good enough for them to safely operate the main warship in these waters was a heavily built sailing ship with one or two masts for square sails they could be as large as a thousand tons measurement not displacement which translated to over one hundred feet long and a forty foot beam while generally seaworthy they were by design somewhat top heavy and when converted to warships with castles fore and aft some what tender to high winds often the defending fleet covering a port or a river mouth would tie their ships together and lay planks across them which would allow them to reinforce the parts of their line under attack the attacking ships would approach archers and crossbowmen shooting across the water from the castles fire projectiles might by shot from bows sometimes light artillery catapults and spearthrowers would be mounted but often the troops would simply throw the incendiary bombs or materiel on to the enemy ship once contact was made the knights and menatarms would engage in close combat and the winner would capture the opposing ship other friendly ships would join this ship and their boarding crews cross over to reinforce the original boarding party otherwise this scenario would be replayed all up and down the line of defending ships at some point the attackers would capture enough defending ships and the survivors would cut the cables and escape or the attackers would admit defeat and draw away the viking model the third model was of course the vikings but other than not building castles on the fore and quarter decks and being able to sail or row combat would be very similar to that in the english channel in a sea battle between danys and eurons fleets dany would want to withdraw her horse transports to the rear and push forward as fast as possible into close combat given that neither the dothraki nor the unsullied have missile weapons which is strange given that every horse nomad tribe in history even the north american natives used bows from horseback dany might have better artillery aboard her ships but her best bet is to get alongside eurons ships and hope the dothraki are as effective on foot at sea as on horseback if shes landed her troops then their place could be taken by westerosi troops experienced at naval warfare say dornish infantry with bows and spears the odds might be more even in a battle between yaratheon trying to break eurons blockade of the sea of dorne or euron trying to break yaratheons blockade of balckwater bay based on history however an open sea battle between euron and dany would be unlikely
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree dany will have to stay close to shore probably stopping often let the horses run and graze dragons are getting big too i imagine theyll roost somewhere instead of trying to land on a ship i believe the dothraki did use bows though
gameofthrones,not_removed,meh brienne as a body guard makes that hard also i think i read sophie turner is allergic to horses so they use a double when there are scenes on horseback if they can
gameofthrones,not_removed,shitty click bait title means im not clicking it
gameofthrones,not_removed,why is this downvoted it is a well made video
gameofthrones,not_removed,dude never even looked at it that way but the sansa body double part definitely makes this a huge possibility agree on the euron part theres a lot about him in the books that i really hope they put in the tv show keep it up man
gameofthrones,not_removed,brienne completed her oath but it would be difficult but this is little finger were talking about i mean genuinely what options does he have
gameofthrones,not_removed,the riverlands he could tell both cersei and jonsansa hes trying to secure the riverlands for their cause and then work his angles that way he is from the riverlands anyways edmure and the freys are prime for the taking
gameofthrones,not_removed,travel a continent roughly the size of south america with ease its pretty rare for one to go from castle black to sunspear or vice versa most messages go much shorter distances how do they know such precise locations from the huge castles to the smallest holds each generally only knows one home location then theyre taken in cages along with other supplies in caravans so that when theyre released with a message elsewhere they just fly that message home so you can only send a raven to the extent you have the right ones in your rookery for the destination and i imagine ravens going to the smallest holds are mostly only kept at the castle directly above them in the hierarchy how do they never seen to get lost waylaid or deterred they do and in the story sometimes important messages are sent with multiple ravens or methods to make sure it gets through there have also been mentions of archers shooting down outgoing ravens during a siege to prevent or intercept communications though it hasnt really disrupted the story because that would just be an annoyance to the audience carrier pigeons couldnt pull this off they work on the same principle definitely shorter range though
gameofthrones,not_removed,the show does a bad job showing the maesters jobs the crows dont just fly from one place to the other they stop at any castle or hold on their way and the maester in charge there just check out where its headed to and sends it on its way also they dont just send one bird they send any where up to depending on how many places they are sending a message to and the crows are smart its a common thing in westeros that crows talk
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the book it explains that ravens were previously taught by the maesters to read out messages out loud and would communicate with the sender it also says that most ravens can only fly between two places to and from but every now and then some ravens learn other flight paths some as many as five but they only come around every or so years and are worth their weight in gold
gameofthrones,not_removed,its just something that were supposed to sorta suspend out disbelief in the birds in asoiaf and got are more intelligent and learn quicker than most if not all birds in our real world
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thught that crow explanation on ravens was a consensus when bran tryed to skinchange one raven he noticed the presence of a person the crow explains that all birds have this presence and ravens can speak the childrens tongue so i assume that the most of the ravensbird in asoiaf are skinchanged and thought what to do by the dude
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes didnt theon shoot one down that was traveling tofrom the river lands during robbs campaign
gameofthrones,not_removed,and the crows are smart its a common thing in westeros that crows talk heres the thing though we are asked as an audience to treat everything we see with a critical and realistic eye we dont expect happy endings for anyone because its not realistic we see battles in a very gritty and truetolife lens in the books we see what this kind of stress and adventure does to the body remember how we were treated to hearing about danys pooping habits yeah this is what leads me to believe that there is more at stake here that theres more going on that no one seems to realize
gameofthrones,not_removed,but we dont suspend our disbelief in literally anything else which leads me to think that theres something tricky at play here
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes didnt theon shoot one down that was traveling tofrom the river lands during tobbs campaign ah tobb stark the combination of talisa and robb
gameofthrones,not_removed,really what about the dragons or the varying powers of resurrection
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha damn phone
gameofthrones,not_removed,theyre all magic ops point is that the birds are also magic and you kind of just proved his point for them the only time we suspend disbelief is when its magic related
gameofthrones,not_removed,wtf is that
gameofthrones,not_removed,did flipping the bird exist in this universe
gameofthrones,not_removed,what did he do wrong
gameofthrones,not_removed,anyone know what im saying xd
gameofthrones,not_removed,he did a 凸 finger like your dragon doesnt frighten me
gameofthrones,not_removed,giving dany the finger
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats really reaching
gameofthrones,not_removed,httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphphousehetherspoon httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphphousesuggs remember kids be proud of your house

gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont know httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphphousegraceford sigil is supposed to represent the mother but thats just creepy
gameofthrones,not_removed,of the major houses definitely tyrell as olenna explained so eloquently of the minor houses hetherspoon and suggs as put by ubranstryke are good guesses id also put house estermont there httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphphouseestermont
gameofthrones,not_removed,have you seen httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphphousewydman
gameofthrones,not_removed,growing strong hah the dullest words of any house
gameofthrones,not_removed,httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphphousepeasebury
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont know should they be ashamed of their origins were any lannisters actual lions their sigil could be crossed pickaxes and a helmet if they were as honest as the spicers i agree on house tyrell i think a rose with visible thorns might be more apropos
gameofthrones,not_removed,mirror
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive always hated house lannisters motto hear me roar i mean come on
gameofthrones,not_removed,house tyrell
gameofthrones,not_removed,i imagine house piper probably gets a lot of crap from the other noble houses their sigil being a naked dancing lady
gameofthrones,not_removed,house whitehill from the telltale game is the most selfdeprecating house their sigil is legit how they wasted their half of the forest they were given and their name is representative of the worst part of their history httpsawoiafwesterosorgindexphphousewhitehilltelltale
gameofthrones,not_removed,how bad is harlaws sigil tho
gameofthrones,not_removed,house coldwater is awful on so many levels its just lines
gameofthrones,not_removed,houses kettleback and stokeworthoh noits the kettlesheep bannerrun for your lives
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was going through the stormland houses trying to find a silly one but most of them are on point house follard though is literally wearing a jesters hat
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not a huge fan of the stark motto its pretty badass when winter is actually coming but when it arrives what do they say winter is here no shit
gameofthrones,not_removed,while the kraken sigil is neat the words we do not sow have to be the worst being takers not makers is supposed to be something youre ashamed of
gameofthrones,not_removed,holy crap suggs they probably win for worst name too
gameofthrones,not_removed,is house suggs somehow a dig a terrell suggs
gameofthrones,not_removed,i kind of like the flying pigs
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the middle of the street our house in case anyone isnt up on their brit bands httpsenwikipediaorgwikisuggssinger
gameofthrones,not_removed,doesnt the tick fight for house hetherspoon
gameofthrones,not_removed,til house suggs house beifong
gameofthrones,not_removed,footballs are commonly referred to as pig skins right throwing a football is a flying pig idk im trying
gameofthrones,not_removed,house codd is basically the house comeatmebro of westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like to imagine house swyft and house grandison being in this really petty feud
gameofthrones,not_removed,house wode is a hedgehog wonder what its like having the cutest house sigil in westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,im hoping awoiaf took some liberties with that one
gameofthrones,not_removed,i kinda like the turtlemaybe they make it look more fierce on their actual banners some turtles are mean sobs
gameofthrones,not_removed,before the tyrells took over the reach house gardener was the major house not sure of their words but a big green hand was their sigil not sure if better of worse than a rose
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think estermonts is cool also in crusader kings they always seem to usurp the baratheons so to me that seems kinda badass
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like estermont i can see it integrated in their clothing women in sea foam dresses and armor with turtle shell prints
gameofthrones,not_removed,my lord your house banner needs to be unique and just put all of the shit on there
gameofthrones,not_removed,so many are on the nose did rail road just run out of ideas at some point
gameofthrones,not_removed,there used to be lions in the westerlands thats why they took the lion sigil
gameofthrones,not_removed,among the lords paramount that is true but a rose is still a nicer sigil than pepper shakers or a haystack
gameofthrones,not_removed,ah yes house whitehillaka not house lefford
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont you mean norway
gameofthrones,not_removed,winter is coming doesnt just mean actual winter is coming the winter in their motto also refers to the darkness of life and that bad things will always come
gameofthrones,not_removed,its also a reminder to be preparedbut a sigil of a grasshopper and an ant wouldnt be as cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,winter is coming for you is pretty fucking badass no matter what season it is
gameofthrones,not_removed,and the one member of the family we meet sucks too
gameofthrones,not_removed,george rr martin along with being a longtime fan of scifi fantasy and comic books is also a football fan when hes not blogging about game of thrones events at his movie theater or controversies in the literary world hell often write about his two favorite teams the new york giants and the new york jets on his livejournal during the regular season martin has yet to confirm whether ser clayton suggs a hedge knight pledged to stannis is another football nod but some fans seem to think that he is his name is a mashup of baltimore ravens players terrell suggs and mark clayton and his house sigil is a flying pig hes a cruel man who enjoys torturing and travels with a man known as godry the giantslayer the ravens were the only team to have defeated the giants in the super bowl seems pretty tinfoily and i dont know whether it fits the timeline but httpwwwdailydotcomparsecwunwungameofthronesgrrmfootballreferences the article
gameofthrones,not_removed,house plumm is the come at me bro their words are literally come try me
gameofthrones,not_removed,no its like a little girl talking to her known pedophile neighbor
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes but i was thinking of it next to all the major houses
gameofthrones,not_removed,holy shit i never even made the connection
gameofthrones,not_removed,also that the kings of winter are coming
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did not know that that makes it a lot more interesting
gameofthrones,not_removed,hold up hes a fan of both the giants and the jets
gameofthrones,not_removed,exactly
gameofthrones,not_removed,its going to be an old maester samwell finishing writing the great history of the war of the kings and the return of the white walkers and closing the book before putting it on a shelf in the citadel
gameofthrones,not_removed,preferred if dany survives and kings landing is destroyed as in her house of the undying vision id like the last shot be her walking among the smoking ruins of old valyria and then as everything is starting to fade a faint scream of a dragon is heard from a distance cue the ending credits realistic this is a harder one maybe it could be this epilogue type of thing with tyrion drinking his wine the imps delight with someone else that has survived it all in some peacefullooking place as the sun is setting or something like that
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like your realistic ending and i think it would fit the whole series pretty well i am concerned we will get a happy ending where dany lives and ends up on the throne it would be a pretty big disappointing to have such a straightforward ending considering how complicated and deceitful the rest of the story has been
gameofthrones,not_removed,preferred jon marries sansa after finding out that hes actually her cousin becomes king of westeros and chooses winterfell as his castle davos moves his house closer to winterfell and serves as hand to the king bran becomes lord of harrenhal because its close to the gods eye where theres a shitload of heart trees so he can keep up his duties as the three eyed raven edmure takes back his seat as lord of the riverlands jaime takes the black and becomes lord commander the nights watch becomes a force that enforces jons rule beyond where the wall was cersei dies danys dragons are dead so takes whats left of her army and sails west to conquer whatever is out there kings landing is in ruin and the kingsland is absorbed into the stormlands realistic a lot of people die including jon die in the final fight with the white walkers and whatevers left are ruled over by dany whose pregnant with jons kid bran goes back beyond the wall with meera sansa becomes wardeness of winterfell arya sails west and tyrion takes his place as the hand of the queen with davos master of ships
gameofthrones,not_removed,its threads like these that make me so thankful for grrm
gameofthrones,not_removed,preferred arya sitting alone on the iron throne drenched in blood from all the people shes killed her face is a wide smile realistic the night king sitting on the iron throne alone
gameofthrones,not_removed,the final confrontation with the white walkers takes place in a blizzard many heroes are lost who and how doesnt matter some of the dragons die too only one of the dire wolves remains the night king is defeated what remains of the wwothers flee all the wights drop dead once the night king has fallen a couple scenes with the remaining heroes sheltered somewhere from the blizzard theyre preparing for the long night the camera pans towards the horizon we get a tiny glimpse of the sun rising and then an immediate cut to black as for what type of ending we get these moments in westeros history have to mean something something has to be different than the hundreds and thousands of years before so in that regard i think the ending should be happier in the least that it is definitive progress towards a better world cause if it just ends sad and with no progress towards a better world then why tell us this story and not of aegon the conqueror or of roberts rebellion
gameofthrones,not_removed,this would be the ultimate dicktease ending but the war for the dawn is lost and the others have slaughtered almost all of the living including jon and everyone else we ever knew except for daenerys but all of her dragons are dead she retreats to the ruins of old valyria in her grief however once there she walks amongst the volcanos that may or may not have brought the doom there in a cave she finds a large amount of dragon eggs about lets say resting amongst smouldering coals one of them shakes timidly and then cut to black
gameofthrones,not_removed,any turn at the ending scene will cheapen the whole story and grrm is not a cheap writer he actually is very good at storytelling and weaves complexity into the plots few holes and has wellbuilt characters soi do not think jaqen ends up on the throne preferred jon dies he wants to die and is willing if need be he has become a great stark and theres nothing left after if he defeats the ww that leaves dany on the throne and a good and great queen with tyrion as hand camera shot of dany on a dragon flying away from the wreckage of the ice wall with the morning sun coming up
gameofthrones,not_removed,daenerys flies into the camera on drogon freezeframe on her big smiling face
gameofthrones,not_removed,preferred jon and dany are sitting in a garden talking eating cue dont stop believin by journey a carriage pulls up out walks tyrion he smiles and joins jon and dany davos is also there and gets up to go relieve himself another carriage pulls up and arya walks out she runs across the path to greet jon the camera closes in on jon he looks up the song plays dont stop cut to black end credits the internet then explodes when everyone realizes that dd trolled everyone and pulled a sopranos realistic jon or sam or somebody visiting the graveyard of all those who died during the battle with the white walkers it would be bittersweet after all the lesson being that a lot of people may have died but at least you are still alive
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei dead this is all i want in life
gameofthrones,not_removed,preferred daenerys is sitting on the iron throne with her dragons guarding the city while her husband jon snow is the warden of the north to unify all of westeros by having the king desired and the queen needed plus i really hope daenerys gets knocked up by jon realistic daenerys is probably going to die most likely after she sees kings landing completely destroyed i feel like shell either die by the hands of someone she loves daario maybe or by her own hands after seeing that she really has nothing left to live for however tyrion with the help of sam and bran learns that he is the remaining male targaryen with jon not wanting the throne and he becomes the king of westeros and all those other titles
gameofthrones,not_removed,preferred jon makes peace with he white walkers and the world is saved daenerys sits the iron throne arya is hand if the queen varys is master of whispers daenerys also marries jorah and sansa is queen of the north pregnant with jons children the world is all but saved and the last shot is of sam telling jon and sansas twin children of he song of ice and fire realistic a lot of people die in he battle against the white walkers including all of danys dragons and jon jorah sacrifices dany and pushes back the white walkers with lightbringer and defeats them sansa sits the iron throne with tyrion as hand arya is dead and wargs into nymeria and he last shot is of arya warging into nymeria and running in the snow as nymeria
gameofthrones,not_removed,this would be good tolkienesque too
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like this a lot
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope after the walkers are defeated the next scene is years later or whenever winter is over and would absolutely love if tyrion and friends idk who would still be standing but i hope bronn and jon snow are chillin in a garden somewhere sipping on some imps delight reminiscing on the epic battle that took place years before and the camera slowly pans out with a dragon flying in the distance
gameofthrones,not_removed,there will most likely be no iron throne and the ending is bittersweet as grrm has said that said at least jon as king with tyrion as hand is foreshadowed so many times by the books its almost unbelievable
gameofthrones,not_removed,you reminded me of mass effects ending
gameofthrones,not_removed,see i think that youre wrong when you say that something has to be different than the hundreds and thousands of years before all of the books and all of the histories of westeros is just a continuous cycle the good guys dont win there will always be scheming and backstabbing the throne will be fought for endlessly even if there is a period of peace someone or something will change that characters from past and present mirror each other the wheel will be broken but it will always be repaired i honestly think that we will get a cold ending there will be loose ends that arent tied up because game of thrones at its core is the plight of humans it will end and we will be left wanting more
gameofthrones,not_removed,this would upset so many a tease ending in general just wouldnt work here i dont think
gameofthrones,not_removed,preach
gameofthrones,not_removed,sounds pretty interesting
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe you misunderstood me i actually agree with you thats why i tried to use the word progress rather than happy if dany ends up on the throne and jon works alongside her in the north and they bring peace to the realm sure it might last a while but itll be bound to fall eventually as all things do that is probably the happiest ending possible baby steps because things could be so much worse and have been much worse but over the course of many years and some times just over powerful events things will get better even if just a little and i think thats what the story is about
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wouldnt be too upset by this the ends definitely going to be bittersweet for both book and show so whether that means it will be ambiguous in a way we dont know i dont think it will be a clear thing though it may leave us with certain questions
gameofthrones,not_removed,its very difficult for me to attribute these kinds of advanced thinking and complex decision making to tommen when he has shown time and time again he allows himself to be manipulated for the most peaceful resolutions and to appeal to the person he loves the most to me hes just a child that wants everyone to be happy hes simply too kindhearted right now he loves margaraey and is willing to do anything she wants
gameofthrones,not_removed,itd be nice to think so wouldnt it but no tommen being a lovable little idiot is completely intentional joffrey was a sadistic tyrant tommen is a squishy little pushover both are bad in different ways honestly i blame tywin for putting it in his head that he should listen to other people instead of thinking for himself he really took that advice to heart
gameofthrones,not_removed,i too would actually like to believe tommen is not as pathetic as everybody thinks he possesses a desire for peace and harmony which is unique to his character and unlike any other person who seeks or holds power in this series if his character develops some level of strength and diplomacy tommen may turn out to be the king that the kingdoms needs perhaps capable of ending the hatred between lannisters and starks perhaps capable of making peace with daenarys and her dothraki army perhaps somebody who can unite the against the white walkers but in the end this is all just wishful speculation more likely tommen is going to end up dying somehow as prophecized which probably means hell continue being weak and naive until then my guess is that mountain loses the cleganebowl which is confirmed and hype causing tommen to no longer have right to the throne giving high sparrow rule over kings landing while a bunch of zealots put tommens head on a pike or something prophecies suck unless you can explain to me how gold shroud does not equal tommens death im just going to say hes a throwaway character as myrcella was
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think that yes he and margaery see this as an opportunity to break free of their families power and wield that power for themselves he saw what it did to joffrey when he allowed tywin and cersei whisper in his ear he saw how the people disliked his brother and his ways he wants the approval of his kingdom and sees the opportunity to be a greater king than both his brother and his father were through this move i unfortunately believe he still underestimates the high sparrow and that tommen is still a card in his deck i feel the next move could be one that puts the faith at a higher authority than the king without tommen realizing it as well as him making a decree about it

gameofthrones,not_removed,he was blundering from mistake to the next politically sending theon back to the iron island marrying jeynetalissa taking lord rickards head not reaching out to the tyrells once renly was dead while he was skilled in war he couldnt bend and that resulted in him breaking
gameofthrones,not_removed,robbs issue was that he was too trusting like ned and that he didnt understand that his actions had consequences i dont know whats worse him sending theon north or not marrying who he was supposed to if he hadnt of sent theon north then he wouldnt have to go back north to try and reclaim it thus not needing to really go back back through the twins however if he hadnt of betrayed walder frey and lost his trust by not marrying one of his daughters then i dont think there was any way the freys wouldve turned their cloaks
gameofthrones,not_removed,if robb hadnt fucked up and gotten himself killed at the red wedding then tywin would have been too preoccupied to save kings landing stannis would have taken the throne and robb would likely have sworn fealty to him
gameofthrones,not_removed,well he still lost the support of the karstarks but yea tywin might had stayed to fight robb so he didnt save kings landing so kings landing would be lost to stannis and tywin would most likely give up but if somehow stannis didnt take kings landing robb would not have the forces to win alone
gameofthrones,not_removed,lets not forget that edmure was the one to screw everything up
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre right here no matter how much i like and supported rob he made some really bad calls
gameofthrones,not_removed,if only he married the daughter
gameofthrones,not_removed,robb was still alive when tywin took the lannister forces to kings landing to stop stannis that was episode of season robb was not killed until an entire season later during the red wedding episode of season
gameofthrones,not_removed,wrong orderthe red wedding came after the blackwater but if your looking for someone to blame its edmure for attacking the lannisters even though he was told not toif he hadnt made the lannisters take an alternative route he would of been able to smash them and stop them taking stannis in the rear
gameofthrones,not_removed,unfortunately he was too much like his old man in the wrong instances and too much like his mother in the other ones loved robb one of my favorite characters but he never thought too much through
gameofthrones,not_removed,good point my mistake
gameofthrones,not_removed,no they speak skroth which is like ice crackling
gameofthrones,not_removed,dany never won against the system in meereen she just destroyed the existing social system tried to reform it but ran out of time so she handed it over to a sellsword who knows nothing about ruling and cares even less about meereen yes she killed the slavemasters and a lot of sons of the harpy but the harpy is still out there and there is no new social system to replace the old one fuck meereen fuck the people daario naharis with this guy in charge how long will it take for meereen to descend into absolute chaos
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think she will die fighting the jonwalker alliance
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think shell take the iron throne but be ruler of a loser confederation of kingdoms than what exists currently then shell look towards the north to fight the white walkers i think drogon dies during her conquest though
gameofthrones,not_removed,she will take the iron throne definitely she has full grown dragons unsullied dothrakus of course she can win she could beat the walkers too easy
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree its a huge undertaking to do what she wants to and with so few episodes left it looks unlikely but in the same vein jon has a monumental undertaking himself if he wants to defeat the wws the wws have a huge undertaking if they want to conquer westeros every big story is a massive challenge and eventually one will win out while the other ones fall short im rooting for the walkers so i hope dany fails
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think breaking the wheel means letting the seven kingdoms kinda do their own thing she seemed open to the iron islands and yara breaking away from direct rule from kings landing so long as they didnt continue their ways that would hurt westeros reavingraping seems to me as dorne would want to do their own thing unbowed unbent unbroken and she has teamed up with elaria and the sandsnakes already and as the north has their own king in king jon i dont think they will be so keen on bending the knee to anyone in kings landing after all theyve been through also i believe shell die in the last battle with all the implications she is a conqueror not a ruler she will win against the ww but lose her life or something but the kingdom will be safe after she breaks the wheel divides the kingdoms so they may live free from the game of thrones and defeats the danger of the ww in her final act bittersweet
gameofthrones,not_removed,she conquers the south after taking kl in some form marries jon she is moon wife of son bride of fire she has a baby no clue how they do this in eps but it is foreshadowed happy to be wrong jon learns only way to save everyone is to kill her he has to chose duty over love and it is sad she may offer but i lean hell have to like the lamb and tainted meat surprise her stabs her heart and the bloody blade aka red sword of heroes lights on fire
gameofthrones,not_removed,people are free and master slave tradition is overthrown pretty sure this means she won against slavery how she did it in show was hollywoodish bs though it was one big confrontation and warning message to others i hope its plays out differently in book like inviting them all for negotiation then red wedding style or confiscates their wealth making them just normal people or lures some of them on her side promising them seat in new government counsel
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah dany is evol and frees slaves and white walkers who are good guys and kill people for thousands of years are marching south to help westeros defeat her
gameofthrones,not_removed,easy try fighting an enemy which turns your own dead against you
gameofthrones,not_removed,pretty sure she will take iron throne at some point in time but i mean her end game result will she lose and fail her mission break the wheel
gameofthrones,not_removed,nah she is not staying there
gameofthrones,not_removed,walkers were just protecting their turf take it from a cotf standpoint they made a deal with humans to have the forests for themselves and the humans get all the rest but humans keep infringing because they forgot about the deal as for dany she aint clearcut evil or good pretty much like most of grrms characters and factions but she still is leading the biggest land invasion there ever was since the andals invaded westeros years ago using dragons and arguably magic to do so magic is controlledbanished from westeros by the maesters she aint any better or worse than walkerscotf wanting none of it and acting to prevent it
gameofthrones,not_removed,itd be great but that look jamie gave cercei its him making a decision
gameofthrones,not_removed,pretty sure jaime left the twins before arya went all murdery on the freys
gameofthrones,not_removed,too stunty and totally undercuts jaimes arc
gameofthrones,not_removed,you know as outlandish as it may seem i wouldnt put it past got to pull a stunt like that
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is so crazy it just might work
gameofthrones,not_removed,in terms of plot i dont see them killing off jaime in some sort of anti climactic way such as that its interesting but extremely unlikely
gameofthrones,not_removed,wouldnt jamie have to be dead for arya to wear his face or has the show ruined my interpretation of the faceless men
gameofthrones,not_removed,in fairness arya in a jaime mask could just be deciding exactly how to kill cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,imagine everyones shock if suddenly he peeled of his face and arya was inside many people could die from heart attacks
gameofthrones,not_removed,no its just getting started
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah that is exactly what i am implying it is possible that jaime is already dead and arya is actually the person who returned to the red keep and was watching cercei in the throne room i thinks its possible though pretty unlikely as on off screen death wouldnt be fitting for jaimes story arc and redemption
gameofthrones,not_removed,hi moderator there are too many tags and categories to consider when trying to post to this subreddit from a mobile device making it unenjoyable to post it could do with a revision with mobile users in mind cheers
gameofthrones,not_removed,but then jaimes plot development is ruined itd have shock value but plenty of shock can happen without ruining character development cersei blowing up her enemies in wildfire had shock value and made sense
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think ser jorah will go to qarth to get help from quathie that mystery woman in qarthremember when in jorah came to her for help when danys dragons were missing she was kind of painting back of someone and she said that this is for safety hes going to travel through ruins of valyria i really think that she must be knowing how to cure greyscale and i think jon will get to know that hes a targaryen either through bran or maybe i think there will be some situation of fire and he will not burn just like danythen i think everyone will find out that hes a targaryen
gameofthrones,not_removed,makes sense but i doubt jaime will kill her so early in the season if at all i also doubt cersei will be at match for the dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think jaime will kill cersei to save kings landing but that hell fail to stop the explosion from destroying the city it would make danys vision in the house of the undying true it would also be a great end to cerseis arc and cull the cast before the white walkers invade him stopping a wildfire explosion a second time would be a bit predictable imo
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think its more likely sam and gilly will find something in the citadel relating to rhaegar and lyannas relationship though its not until they meet up with bran towards the very end of the season that they start putting the pieces of the jigsaw together bran and sam will start to realise the significance of what it all means i reckon theyll go looking for more evidence and find something in the crypts thatll prove jon is rhaegars legitimate heir howland reed may also show up and be the final confirmation jon will be oblivious to it all until he gets back to winterfell and i reckon the first episode of season will be about him finding out the producers will need jon to find out early on in season as theyll have a lot to get through in order to round off the series
gameofthrones,not_removed,you didnt mention how gendry would play into this season
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like the idea of jaime becoming king even for a little bit
gameofthrones,not_removed,i could be be wrong but unless cersei has more wildfire prepared the rest of her stash was blown up when attacking the high sparrow avoiding her trial
gameofthrones,not_removed,i do not think it likely he will head east very far east i dont even think they would allow him to stay in old town if they find out he has grey scale
gameofthrones,not_removed,even though this post is listed as im not going to spoil it for you reading these predictions are kinda silly after visiting a few sites dedicated to whats upcoming i wonder if there is a compilation of these predictions for all of the seasons so we can all see how wrong we were
gameofthrones,not_removed,i completely agree with you on jamie becoming king eventually
gameofthrones,not_removed,dany wont arrive until the end of
gameofthrones,not_removed,great theory on sam and jorah connecting the dots though i think thats very realistic
gameofthrones,not_removed,how would jorah and sam figure out that jon is a targaryen there isnt any evidence that they could find in oldtown edit jon not dany im an idiot
gameofthrones,not_removed,im going to be super disappointed if jorah does anything besides spread a plague
gameofthrones,not_removed,he will not burn that targaryen trait didnt carry over to jon
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think this will all happen in the first episodes i think cersei will die in episode and dany will be queen by episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,gendry with his massive back and arms from rowing for four seasons is now ready to take on the baratheon name he takes roberts warhammer and becomes lord of the storm lands and takes his seat at storms end thats my hope at least
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think she has more that was just the stash under the sept of baelor jaime said that the mad king put it in many places during his bath time with brienne
gameofthrones,not_removed,if i recall correctly the mad king kept a lot in the red keep
gameofthrones,not_removed,so you think shell spend an entire season at sea lol no
gameofthrones,not_removed,jorah already knows about dany and has heard her talk about being targaryen if u mean jon i think that at the citadel there will be proof of rhaegar and lyana having a child or being in a relationship this could lead them to believe that jon is their son or bran will come in somewhere and tell him about it
gameofthrones,not_removed,correct his hand burned in the commanders tower
gameofthrones,not_removed,technically all targaryens burn the show just gave dany fire resistance for some reason in the books she uses blood magic to survive the fire with khal drogo
gameofthrones,not_removed,that targaryen trait no such thing at least as it pertains to fireresistance the showrunners used it to simplify and further the plot she only had one instance of surviving flames in the asoiaf series and it had to do with the dark magic used to keep the khal alive for example danys grandfather burned himself to death thinking hed hatch dragon eggs and be reborn as a phoenix would the summerhall incident as its called also saw the death of a few other targs as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,so no white walkers just gonna sit on a throne and rule the small folk i feel like the throne has bern getting less and less important once dany meets jon or finds out about the others she will be defending the realm cersei will self destruct and be left out of the loop her being queen will be meaningless and no one will care not even jaime
gameofthrones,not_removed,ahh then i agree it would be stupid not to use wildfire to your advantage although daenerys wont burn haha
gameofthrones,not_removed,from what we saw so far theon and his sister have traveled to wherever she is now mereen or whatever to offer their ships i cant imagine shes going to go straight to kings landing without trying to pickup more allies along the way especially after being advised by tyrion about what happened to stannis so that obviously rules out another blackwater invasion plus for story purposes theyll obviously want to continue to drag daenerys through the mud more and let us see how she fares in westeros finally
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it will be bran who tells jon hes already learned the truth and show it to the audience theres no point of rediscovering it with sam and jorah i do believe that sam may discover the identity of the nights king show version to be someone of the stark family possibly an older bran who has traveled back in time i think that would be the most interesting plot twist old bran as the nights king and young bran interacting with each other to what end i dont know
gameofthrones,not_removed,not true drogon also fired her up in adwd in the pit she also lost all her hair again
gameofthrones,not_removed,she rolled a
gameofthrones,not_removed,drogon burned her in adwd and she felt nothing
gameofthrones,not_removed,this season will more than likely revolve around getting the kingdoms settled more than they are with season being the war to come
gameofthrones,not_removed,a while ago me and a friend calculated all her soldiers if you forgot highgarden and sunspear already joined her you can see their ships already ah the end i think in total it were man or something
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats interesting it would make sense for older bran to go back to his old visions and try to stop himself for ever becoming the night king by killing himself he could solve a lot of trouble
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think that was just a roar that was still hot enough to burn her hair off wasnt it i think she describes a furnace wind or something but never specifically mentions fire i could be wrong though its been a while
gameofthrones,not_removed,the kingdoms settled more what do you mean theres about to be a massive invasion with dragons and another massive invasion with the others the kingdoms are almost meaningless its tough because as a book reader we know that only the first book is called a game of thrones the rest of the series is not really about the throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think that season will end with jon sansa andor dany saying winter is finally here
gameofthrones,not_removed,nah winter is here already
gameofthrones,not_removed,stupid
gameofthrones,not_removed,guys im going to try to read this whole thing send backup if i dont return in minutes
gameofthrones,not_removed,i doubt that dany will divide all of the kingdoms just like that
gameofthrones,not_removed,sounds like some awesome predictions though i think euron will survive and they will go the jon vs daenerys route
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think that ramsay is not actually dead and that he will end up marrying danycheck out my post for more details
gameofthrones,not_removed,loved it amazing detail would rather see jon and dany tho
gameofthrones,not_removed,sounds amazing includes specs but also falls in line i think though that theon will live also jon and dany might marry and sansa will marry robin to secure the vale forces and castle i really dont want arya to die maybe beric can bring het back a life for a life
gameofthrones,not_removed,and uncle wille never came back from his patrol
gameofthrones,not_removed,good luck
gameofthrones,not_removed,okay no no no no no no noooooo just nooooooooooooooooo that is a dumb idea dont even support that idea at all
gameofthrones,not_removed,plus i check your post it got removed
gameofthrones,not_removed,the reason i dont think jon will marry daenerys and marry sansa is because i dont see him being okay with incest yes he grow up believing sansa is sister which is why i said he will have to which means it is a forced marriage but cousin marriage is still acceptable i dont see him marrying his aunt especially if he finds out before they meet also jon would be able to keep his position in the north as for robin well id rather see him married to lyanna mormont so she can bitch slab some manners into poor sweet little robin
gameofthrones,not_removed,wth i wonder why that happened thx for telling me
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i amwith you on the jonsa shipping but like you said it all depends on when jon finds out the truth and what dany will want fromhim i am pretty sure she is going to want marriage i think dany will die in the battle and only then will jon and sansa get together and sweetrobins rolein sansas life has been set for seasons he willbe her key to the vale and will send lf through the moon door i think i could be wrong also i am certain i saw jon fall in love with sansa the tiniest bit in season couldbe wrong again but there has to be a reason for that if jon and sansa do happen and they get to be happy which we the viewer know they wouldbe if together then it is not going to come easy i think
gameofthrones,not_removed,we will have to wait and see
gameofthrones,not_removed,da da dadadad da dada da da da
gameofthrones,not_removed,king in the north and i say it in my mind with a strong mancunian accent even if im not even british
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think of the show game of thrones

gameofthrones,not_removed,da king in da norf
gameofthrones,not_removed,the iron throne geez im the first to say this
gameofthrones,not_removed,i automatically thought of death and naked people
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned starks death it really was a welcome to game of thones bitch for new viewers it showed that nobodynot even the guy you thought was the main characteris safe httpswwwredditcomrgameofthronescommentshxiwe
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think of tyrion lannister and jon snow
gameofthrones,not_removed,dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,if im being honest as soon as i hear game of thrones a picture of sean bean as ned stark saying winter is coming appears in my head when i think about it other things take over but the first few seconds is always sean bean as ned stark im sure all the brace yourselves memes have added to that because the image of ned is always that particular one
gameofthrones,not_removed,never ever pick a favourite character because theyll all die
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned starks face as he is turning his head upward to look at cat as she calls his attention from the balcony when hes outside of littlefingers brothel throttling littlefinger dunno why exactly that image comes to mind first

gameofthrones,not_removed,the house sigils
gameofthrones,not_removed,i see neds sword
gameofthrones,not_removed,cerseis voice in the season trailer when you play the game of thrones you win or you die funny because i have always been more interested in the north the wall and the remaining starks direwolves white walkers etc but that line is still the first thing that comes to mind
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think about the hbo voice saying game of thrones before the episode airs
gameofthrones,not_removed,that sort of iron ring sun thing helioscope what is it from the opening credit of the show with game of thrones on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,a close shot of jon snows face tbh
gameofthrones,not_removed,the starks
gameofthrones,not_removed,definitely ned stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon snow

gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor and his massive wang
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know he wasnt the first character to be introduced on the show but he will always be the first person i remember
gameofthrones,not_removed,the fact that it was a prosthetic makes me laugh they paid special attention to the size of his penis enough to get it custom made
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have no memory of this from the show perhaps with good reason
gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor edit somepoint before bran went beyond the wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,what about the imps delight
gameofthrones,not_removed,the name says valyrian steel but the logo screams house bolton
gameofthrones,not_removed,you wine or you die
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats what i do i drink and i post things
gameofthrones,not_removed,the dornishmans white the ruby ford the red fork the red viper
gameofthrones,not_removed,you should post this over in rhomebrewing

gameofthrones,not_removed,i need myself some
gameofthrones,not_removed,what kind of wine is it what makes it a got themed wine i dabble in brewingwinemaking so this is a pretty cool idea to make some different beverages
gameofthrones,not_removed,the way of the color of the label looks it should be wildfire wine
gameofthrones,not_removed,its cool however if i were you given the chance i would make some arbor gold some dornish red not arbor reds which are basically just red water and maybe the wine of courage
gameofthrones,not_removed,dreadfort savingion blanc our wines are tart
gameofthrones,not_removed,is that an xbox exclusive
gameofthrones,not_removed,does it taste like offseason or obsession
gameofthrones,not_removed,the night is red and full of tannins

gameofthrones,not_removed,it looks like a dornish red but do you also make an arbor gold
gameofthrones,not_removed,how is it
gameofthrones,not_removed,you need to look up what the actual wines they drink in the book are called and make those like a dornish red
gameofthrones,not_removed,what variety is it
gameofthrones,not_removed,game of thrones themed wine you die when you drink it

gameofthrones,not_removed,ice wine winters wight
gameofthrones,not_removed,it burn so hot that it can melt livers like tallow
gameofthrones,not_removed,the wine snob in me wants to wait for the selection from dorne
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would love to drink some wildfire or perhaps a custom wine made for joffreys wedding
gameofthrones,not_removed,i want it how can i purchase it
gameofthrones,not_removed,winter is coming themed tablecloth duly noted
gameofthrones,not_removed,nice
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats a heavy pour
gameofthrones,not_removed,imp juice
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe it still need to age it might be ready when the winds of winter is
gameofthrones,not_removed,only one glass so op may not have friends imps delight is reserved for close friends
gameofthrones,not_removed,now i cant unsee it thanks for nothing
gameofthrones,not_removed,anyone who has seen this logo before will automatically associate it with that they are almost identical
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats what i saw too
gameofthrones,not_removed,came to the comments to say this
gameofthrones,not_removed,dreadforts finest red only a flayed man will spill our secret ingredients
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought it screamed xbox
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats what i was thinking when i saw it then i realized it was daggers
gameofthrones,not_removed,flayed grapes
gameofthrones,not_removed,you wine or you dine could be a great gotthemed restaurant
gameofthrones,not_removed,moondoor hodor mordor
gameofthrones,not_removed,arbor red arbor gold and whatever snake venom concotion dorne has
gameofthrones,not_removed,they would definitely love it and want recipes haha
gameofthrones,not_removed,bought a bottle once blonde ale kept the bottle
gameofthrones,not_removed,that would be so much neater and more authentic without the game of thrones label plastered on you wouldnt smoke pipeweed that says lord of the rings on the bag
gameofthrones,not_removed,probably the label
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah not to take away from the wine pictured cause damn thats awesome but when i think of game of thrones themed wine i think of spiced dornish red wine or arbor gold or something like that a nice white wine named arbor gold would be awesome
gameofthrones,not_removed,the actual wine is valpolciella and i have many different wines to come
gameofthrones,not_removed,valpolicella what specific variety or is it a blend i am not super great on itallian varietiesand regions but i believe that valpolicella is a growing region by verona and the po river
gameofthrones,not_removed,ill trade you a bottle or two for a set of custom etched wine glasses andor pint glasses
gameofthrones,not_removed,unfortunately since i make this at home i am unable to sell also hbo contracted with a winery to make like two bottles of generic got wines
gameofthrones,not_removed,i started a gofundme search iron throne wine company so i can become legit and sell to the public
gameofthrones,not_removed,unfortunately since i make this at home i am unable to sell also hbo contracted with a winery to make like two bottles of generic got wines
gameofthrones,not_removed,i started a gofundme search iron throne wine company so i can become legit and sell to the public
gameofthrones,not_removed,its so good i made it proof so it has a nice kick
gameofthrones,not_removed,valpolciella
gameofthrones,not_removed,red wedding wine will happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,so it will never be ready
gameofthrones,not_removed,same
gameofthrones,not_removed,among other things
gameofthrones,not_removed,house xbox one world one westeros and your fingertips
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would have the reins of castemere playing constantly to set people on edge
gameofthrones,not_removed,and moonboy for all we know
gameofthrones,not_removed,dornish red
gameofthrones,not_removed,then how would you know it was got beer without the label its just beer
gameofthrones,not_removed,awesome i definitely am looking forward to them fantastic work my friend
gameofthrones,not_removed,ah understandable sad
gameofthrones,not_removed,sorry but it isnt valpolicella isnt a grape its a region
gameofthrones,not_removed,uproudlymadeusa is not your bitch
gameofthrones,not_removed,yknow what westeros world needs to be created so they can showcase things like that there
gameofthrones,not_removed,have the doors slam shut at random intervals to increase the fear factor
gameofthrones,not_removed,it isnt a valpolciella this guy was talking out of his ass in rwine and its become painfully obvious he doesnt know what he is talking about
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe as the collection grows we can make enough noise and squeeze our way into the line
gameofthrones,not_removed,are you gonna die for a couple of chickens youll be glad to if its our signature spitroasted chicken why not try a glass of valyrian steel and a cleganebowl of creamy mushroom soup to go with it only at westeros world
gameofthrones,not_removed,you can still sell it just take private orders
gameofthrones,not_removed,always good to be reminded that even though ellaria makes no sense indira is still a goddess
gameofthrones,not_removed,this man was amazing in narcos and got
gameofthrones,not_removed,back when oberyn and ellaria were introduced who would have thought one would become one of the most popular got characters ever while the other would become one of the most hated although for the wrong reasons
gameofthrones,not_removed,he didnt need glasses before the mountain got to him
gameofthrones,not_removed,whole lotta excellent cheekbone
gameofthrones,not_removed,will we see a return of pedro as oberyn for the tourney at harrenhal he could probably pull off young oberyn with a spot of makeup
gameofthrones,not_removed,im a pedro fan for life after got
gameofthrones,not_removed,niobe
gameofthrones,not_removed,gosh shes normally beautiful but she makes a hideous duck face
gameofthrones,not_removed,always figured ellaria was a duck face kinda gal
gameofthrones,not_removed,they both look like they are in their late or early here just googled they are and wow
gameofthrones,not_removed,god i miss oberyn
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes and yes hes a phenomenal actor with tremendous talent
gameofthrones,not_removed,holy shit i just realised that he was in narcos time to rewatch
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually dont mind her as much as the other sand sneks
gameofthrones,not_removed,i loved ellaria in season unapologetic bastard season i thought she was an entirely different character she was dressed differently she was speaking differently and acting differently was a mess
gameofthrones,not_removed,well i certainly dont feel the same as of this community book dorne was boring as shit and involved talking more talking more talking a single fight scene and more talking people need to stop kidding themselves that it was so much better then showdorne
gameofthrones,not_removed,youd think impaired vision would be the least of his problems
gameofthrones,not_removed,did you figure oberyn was a duck face kind of guy
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont you think a lot of that has to do with the death oberyn though i saw her as a changed person after that
gameofthrones,not_removed,but the talking was good besides fight scenes arent all that great in books ill always prefer dialogue maybe thats just my poor imagination though
gameofthrones,not_removed,except that the sandsnakes and ellaria shit on oberyns grave by doing exactly the kind of shit he died trying to avenge the martells were interesting and had different morals its part of what made oberyn so endearing then they just made them into murderous cunts who in no way reflect what we liked about dorne to begin with
gameofthrones,not_removed,right book dorne is boring as hell let me prop my gout legs up real fast and tell you the reason im staring at naked kids
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i pretty much skim over most fight scenes in books i just cant visualize them book dorne was interesting because of the dialogue
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was a battle between the instinct to feed and the training to not hurt its master and instinct won out in the end
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think theres a nice parallel between that scene and theons story line
gameofthrones,not_removed,and how long had the cell doors been open providing zero barriers between the starving hounds and the ramsay tartare that was served and ready to eat nice of them to come out on cue as sansa was working in the final taunt would have made for bad television if they started attacking everyone else while they were still trying to tie ol rammyboy down to the chair
gameofthrones,not_removed,traitorous starks were probably warging the dogs with their heathen witchcraft
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was master vs slave
gameofthrones,not_removed,decision was made as soon as it tasted the blood
gameofthrones,not_removed,loyal beasts indeed side note i still think its pretty funny how this episode took away the one possible redeeming quality ramsay had left–if nothing else he seemed like a decent pet owner
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah they both have now killed children
gameofthrones,not_removed,reek draw me my bath
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like to think that maester wolkan who helped walda deliver baby roose bolton in early had a behindthescenes role here to get some justice for walda and the baby as far as i can tell maester wolkan was the only named person in the boltons employ who wasnt a complete sicko so assuming hes still alive i hope jon andor sansa keep him onboard
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wish they had sansa like pull a rope or something from outside the door that opened the cages everyone goes on about how it was her kill but like are we even sure shes the one who opened the cage doors as far as we know all she did was watch it happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,exactly if ramsays face wasnt so bloody i think it would have been a very awkward scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,exactly if ramsays face hadnt been so bloody i think it would have been a very awkward scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,starving dogs for days seems like a decent pet owner not even close
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would describe it less as a decent pet owner and moreso that ramsay appeared to actually have a level of trust and admiration in his dogs he was certainly a shitty pet owner if he didnt ruin the dogs by feeding them so many people he would never have been eaten in the first place because they wouldnt have a taste for human flesh
gameofthrones,not_removed,well the whole time he used the training method of starving for kill motivation and beating into submission the boltons kennelmaster did too
gameofthrones,not_removed,three if you count the games as canon
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes that would have made for a much more satisfying kill shot imo
gameofthrones,not_removed,my point exactly
gameofthrones,not_removed,broken human skin and blood tastes good to dogs regardless of their upbringing though
gameofthrones,not_removed,house forrester remembers
gameofthrones,not_removed,i misunderstood
gameofthrones,not_removed,so sometime this past season or maybe season i was watching an episode of got and i swear i heard the voice of the forrester daughtervoice actor from the game the scene was in the red keep and a handmaiden was standing in the doorway calling out to the lady she served either marg or cercei the lady was in the foreground with the camera focused on her the handmaiden was blurry and standing in the doorway a lot of female voices sound the same but i swear it was mira forrester i tried looking up the actor but as far as i could tell it was uncredited it was only a line role
gameofthrones,not_removed,the north remembers
gameofthrones,not_removed,silly usillichilli
gameofthrones,not_removed,its all good i read his comment and expected to see one like yours thought the same thing we don goofed p
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe it was the same voice actor maybe edit that reminds me that i cant replay the telltales game because of margeary i feel sad everytime i see her
gameofthrones,not_removed,past the show probably not before the show yes they could do roberts rebellion or dunk and egg
gameofthrones,not_removed,star wars was originally just movies star wars was originally one movie it wasnt until empire strikes back was written that it became episode and the rerelease in of a new hope that the first movie got the episode treatment putting the series into the movie arc that we know today with this new backstory in place lucas decided that the series would be a trilogy changing empire strikes back from episode ii to episode v in the next draft httpsenwikipediaorgwikistarwarstheempirestrikesback do you think it would be alright if fans began writing canon books about past events not without input from grrm i think he has setup all sorts of plot twists that fans would riot over if someone else revealed or ignored those twists just to push more content i dont care if he writes it as long as he sets the plot similar to what dd have done with going beyond the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,why not a movie about aegon is conquests would be fun
gameofthrones,not_removed,no to fans writing fanfic and probably no to any prequels sequels etc we have so many universes built around standalones sometimes to expand the story but mainly to make money when an original is a major artistic as well as commercial success star wars in was also a technological breakthrough and has become a landmark in its genre or medium hellit doesnt need extensions got is such a landmark the achievement of the original will only be watered down and somewhat erased by pale imitations or focuses on minor or previous characters i watch most of the films and some tv shows from the marvel dc star wars star trek franchises but honestly its hard to care about another cookiecutter heroheroine worse while some spinoffs good others are awful imo batman vs superman and xmen apocalypse and a few fantastic imo early iron man captain america deadpool viewers will disagree over which films fit which adjective but most fans will be disappointed in something no doubt greed and content safety the scariest scarcest thing in hollywood is originality will prevail and the studios will keep on churning out these franchises on every platform they can
gameofthrones,not_removed,i heard they were writing books too
gameofthrones,not_removed,a major recurring theme of gotasoiaf is political instability so while the series could conceivably wrap up with a larger alliance of the living against the dead theres no reason to believe that such a state of unity would be a durable longterm thing on the contrary it would seem far more likely that smallerpettier divisions would eventually rise to the surface once again the likely end result is a largely selfcontained narrative which nonetheless leaves ample room for expansion
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think a prequel of some sorts is almost a sure thing by now its been hinted at and talked about a lot recently and got is a goldmine for hbo so they would be insane not to do more with it as for showcanon books doubt it if anything they will use the books since they are much richer in terms of lore and characters
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think they should expand beyond the original show id rather take a chance at more game of thrones and have it be shitty than just saying fuck it all together and missing out on something that could be great if its bad than we still have the original series either way
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think martin has written so much history and backstories that there is a ton of stuff to go off of in successfully creating other forms of entertainment im not really crazy on the idea of a movie being made as i feel it doesnt fit well with how game of thrones is written as it really is a piece of work that needs time to be looked at dissected and thought through to be truly enjoyed i just dont see how that can be accomplished within a roughly hour time frame which is why i think this series thrives in either the form of a book or television series i definitely think they can successfully create another television show that is both a critical and financial success that leaves everyone happy
gameofthrones,not_removed,id like to see a prequel based on the events leading up to and including roberts rebellion i think that would be good to watch
gameofthrones,not_removed,a hollywood dance of the dragons would be epic
gameofthrones,not_removed,a prequel antholgoy series with different settings and timeframes each season would be great
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think grrm is capable of writing enough background and source material that can be used as spinoffs but i cant really see a place for fanwritten canon even though theres a lot of it about now on the web i think this will die off along with the series
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would like a spin off starting at the death of jon the story of his children and maybe something about dragons and shit
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wouldnt mind if they did a series of animated prequels the characters and all of the different locations would looks cool in an anime type of cartoon
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would watch the crap out of both of those
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think roberts rebellion is the more likely of the two
gameofthrones,not_removed,more than anything id love to see the dance i need me some budget blowout dragon battles
gameofthrones,not_removed,dunk and egg
gameofthrones,not_removed,that makes absolutely no sense what does making money have to do with wanting to expand on a canon universe of course your post history shows me that youre a troll so i guess your comment is to be expected
gameofthrones,not_removed,dunk and egg are the characters of short books set years before a song of ice and fire now combined to one book knight of the seven kingdoms
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh man i would watchread the shit out of those it would be interesting to seehear about the doom of valeria as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,apparently reading is not your thing because you missed one of the definitions thats widely used i might add established or agreedupon constraints governing the background narrative setting storyline characters etc in a particular fictional world
gameofthrones,not_removed,i read the first graphic novel it was really good
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wouldnt say its unseen weve been inundated with a lannister always pays his debts since season cersei has been the first lannister to be very cavalier with that obligation and it will come back to bite her the bank will probably pay the faceless men to give her the tears of lys it will completely debilitate her making it much easier for any valonquar to come along and choke the life out of whats left of her pale sick self
gameofthrones,not_removed,do you speak of the iron bank
gameofthrones,not_removed,since this is as far as spoilers i would say that given what we know to this point the iron bank will call in its loan cersei initially says no but an assassination attempt or two convinces her of the banks determination she sends jaimie to capture and plunder the reach and highgarden after tarley offers to bend the knee for the reach thats when ohlenna is captured and commits suicide after telling jaimie that tyrion is innocent of geoffreys death that it was she and petyr baelish this pisses cersei to no end as she needs the knights of the vale and lf is the lord protector and it pisses off jaimie who now realizes that cersei railroaded tyrion and that his father was exploiting the situation and that it more cerseis fault that tyrion killed tywin then as jaimie bron and tarley are escorting the plunder train to kl danerys strikes with her dothraki and dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,makes perfect sense the banks always win unless enough of the lords default on their mortgages can think of a few who might be behind at present
gameofthrones,not_removed,it would be interesting to see how the iron bank operates over the course of the show the throne has passed from robert to joffrey to tommen to cersei you could very well argue that the iron bank has funded or is funding several groups from the faith to the brotherhood without banners they may even be working with littlefinger or varys
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats a good theory however dont forget it was mentioned that the gold mines have run dry what if one day the lannisters couldnt pay their debts the fact its rammed down our throats almost screams to me one day they wont be able to
gameofthrones,not_removed,maggy the frog told cersei she would be killed by her little brother so either tyrion or jaime she was the twin who was born first will be the one to kill her maggy was right about her husband and children so theres no reason she should be wrong about this
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats my thinking
gameofthrones,not_removed,more likely the bank is working for illyrio with varys
gameofthrones,not_removed,the valonqar could refer to any little brother or sister so the best working theory is that arya will have jaimes face while killing her my personal favorite super longshot theory is that loras is still alive and will avenge his sister
gameofthrones,not_removed,i also like to think it could be lancel whos still alive and will kill her highly unlikely and that tywin slept with kevans wife which would technically make them half siblings and would fit in in the show at least with cersei only sleeping with her brother

gameofthrones,not_removed,this is great wun of a kind
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow thats a lot of work she is super talented
gameofthrones,not_removed,how does she see
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats like southparks wun wun
gameofthrones,not_removed,shouldve put and arrow in his eye
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree its wunderful
gameofthrones,not_removed,with her eyes
gameofthrones,not_removed,idk how you got downvoted i was wondering the same thing in the comments there are some pictures of her making it the view port is basically in his stomach
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn season really needs to start
gameofthrones,not_removed,wait wait wait sams mom is stannis wifes sister sam is stannis nephew by law when was this mentioned
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think a lot of us already assume that the night king is a stark though
gameofthrones,not_removed,you had me at first because your bit about craster being the white walker father actually makes sense
gameofthrones,not_removed,and as we all know of course every single wight is actually arya using a faceless man disguise shes also going to be a secret blackfyre it is known
gameofthrones,not_removed,jons dad is targaryen
gameofthrones,not_removed,are they related to kevin bacon though
gameofthrones,not_removed,bran is the night king
gameofthrones,not_removed,its going to be a looooong winter
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought this as well do you think it has anything to do with the fact that she took baby sam away from the ww instead of sacrificing him thats always been kicking around in the back of my mind
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes it was confirmed in an hbo infographic after the season rlj
gameofthrones,not_removed,long off seasons are always followed by harsh winters
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is the long night but the ptwp can break the long night by releasing twow
gameofthrones,not_removed,well ned comes riding back to winterfell with a baby from the finale we know that that baby was not his bastard but lyannas son as for who the father is it is mentioned several times that rhaegar abducted and raped lyanna of course there are claims that lyanna and rhaegar loved each other either way there is a certainty that rhaegar is the father hence rlj

gameofthrones,not_removed,well ned comes riding back to winterfell with a baby what episode can you recommend episodes i could watch to see this storyline clearly thanks btw
gameofthrones,not_removed,explains who his mother is his father is yet to be revealed in the show but hbo just revealed a image revealing who his father is
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,awesome thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,yi ti
gameofthrones,not_removed,yi ti the land of the golden empire i think near the place the zerbahorse hybrids come from that dany sees in vaesdothrak
gameofthrones,not_removed,braavos the netherlands mixed with venice
gameofthrones,not_removed,also valyria greece ghiscar persia iran slavers bay the middle east braavos rhodes dothraki mongols yi ti china lands of always winter russia siberia
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive found it difficult to be specific because the geography and cultures arent an exact fit the north northumbria yorkshire north of the wall scotland because grrms meant to have used hadrians wall as a reference but he got the harsh climate a bit wrong but then maybe if the ww are subdued the climate will improve the westerlands the rest of england and wales but the tv series hasnt used any welsh accents i think there is gold in wales the reach has to be france which is historically the home of chivalry chevaliers knights but id include some of the culture of other parts of europe mainly because the oldest universities are bologna oxford salamanca cambridge and i see the citadel as being the equivalent to a university and maesters as a source of learningadvice dorne southern spain portugal and morocco clothing climate lifestyle the stormlands has to be on the atlantic coast of britain including ireland and western scotland to match the storm part of the description the vale norway and sweden the riverlands benelux countries belgium netherlands luxemburg the iron islands orkney andor the hebrides because the retain quite a lot of nordic culture and the orkneys have few trees kings landing monaco rich and independent
gameofthrones,not_removed,kings landing is very similar to constantinople
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like your choices for the most part but for the north id rather choose the scandinavian countries the iron islands maybe iceland or indeed ireland switzerland with austria for the vale and the netherlands with belgium for the riverlands
gameofthrones,not_removed,iron islands are pretty tiny compared to even one of those countries
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is basically how i organized it when i made my game of thronesthemed civilization v map except i used the netherlands for the riverlands and austria for the vale
gameofthrones,not_removed,people that do this always pick something different for the stormlands and i figure that its always the leftover one that they put anywhere that remains
gameofthrones,not_removed,i always thought of the reach more as late middle ages northern italy
gameofthrones,not_removed,the free cities are italy during the early renaissance circa id say braavos is a mix of venice and florence
gameofthrones,not_removed,ashai by the shadow japan
gameofthrones,not_removed,obviously direct comparisons cant be made because grrm mashed they all up there are some mildly good comparison in the thread but why not list the peoplenation and the geographycountry separately
gameofthrones,not_removed,peoples more than geography wildlings picts not celts northman the rus people like to say scots but which scots ironborn vikings but not norse vale old england you have a weird francogermains thing with a off celtic thing riverlands the bitches in the middle that everybody pushes around oh yeah pre unified germany westerlands some type of british americans have a interesting relationship with fictional english crownlands la its not london its not constantinople reach francophile it just works too well between the westerlands and stormlands stormlands germanic it pretty good fit for medieval gemanic peoples dorne sicilian it is a weird caribbeanmediterranean thing essos dorathki huns not mongolian not cossaks
gameofthrones,not_removed,what cultures do you think grrm neglected from planetos
gameofthrones,not_removed,where da bud at
gameofthrones,not_removed,summer isles the carribean islands
gameofthrones,not_removed,northumbria which includes south east scotland
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre insane if you actually believe portugal had a lifestyle anything similar to dorne both us and spain would be roughly the same as france
gameofthrones,not_removed,id argue iron islands have a lot of similarities with scandinavia due to vikings and the north is like scotland because of independence and the hadrian wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,cool austria is in the alps too right
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know right robert baratheon just feels like big german to me
gameofthrones,not_removed,well northern italy did border france theres a lot of intersecting culture here
gameofthrones,not_removed,makes you think if wed be in a similar state if gunpowder didnt exist
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont know much about individual monarchs history but youre welcome to share any comparisons if you want
gameofthrones,not_removed,the westerlands is like if english settled in california
gameofthrones,not_removed,hmm thats a good question culture wise maybe russian and indigenous south american
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes there are of course overlaps as with any youi try to fit with the grrm world northumbria as an archaic region extended to below durham culturally its a fairly distinct area
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre insane if you actually believe portugal had a lifestyle anything similar to dorne parts of what are now spain and portugal were ruled by the moors and retain aspects of moorish culturelifestyle as well as having some stunning examples of moorish architecture two bits of background reading httpsenwikipediaorgwikimoorsmoorsofiberia and
gameofthrones,not_removed,well if you take hadrians wall into account then scots are the wildlings
gameofthrones,not_removed,less salt wires more salt alter boys
gameofthrones,not_removed,its close enough theres no switzerland civilization available in the game
gameofthrones,not_removed,he more closely resembles the english king henry viii of house tudor
gameofthrones,not_removed,the english like to be everywhere the sun never sets on house lannister
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats true and all but youre still insane if you think portugals lifestyle way of life soldiers armies etc have anything to do with dornes portugal was just like any other european kingdom back then also thats a pretty irrelevant writeup other than some words some architecture as in specific pieces of it architecture in general was again the same as europe but a couple hundred years behind in most cases and some food the portuguese killed moors for fun and were extremely proud of it they didnt like their culture nor did they want it in their kingdom example but hey im sure someone from the uk knows more about portugal than a native
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn scots they ruined scotland
gameofthrones,not_removed,the wildlings are more like samis mixed with native americans
gameofthrones,not_removed,scotsmen are pretty wild
gameofthrones,not_removed,true
gameofthrones,not_removed,besides being a big guy henry looks more posh
gameofthrones,not_removed,insane an emotive adjective im sure someone from the uk knows more about portugal than a native people on the internet are who and what they say they are so lets not attempt to delve into personal backgrounds we are after all merely taking part in a betweentheseasons thread about the possible similarities between reallife places and grrms fictional landmass and its warring inhabitants theres no need for battles to spill over every contributor will have a different opinion and its meant to be fun not a challenge instead of making such an effort to argue with my ideas maybe youd be better drawing up your own list of comparisons for each westeros region and then see how others agree or disagree with you
gameofthrones,not_removed,henry viii was a badass athlete in his youth who was known for being very handsome and loved by the ladies just like robert also like robert he became obese in his older age do you think the german kings were not posh
gameofthrones,not_removed,i didnt say i knew other countries well enough to make a list or even westerosi countries for that matter i just know enough about portugal and dorne to tell you with certainty that they are simply not similar at all people on the internet are who and what they say they are so lets not attempt to delve into personal backgrounds thats not how it works im portuguese and theres no denying it hell i have posts on reddit on rportugal and rprimeiraliga where i speak fluent portuguese who the hell are you to tell me i might not be from portugal lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,most kings if they reached middle age at all became obese
gameofthrones,not_removed,i said more posh
gameofthrones,not_removed,you being from portugal doesnt mean that you necessarily know more about portugal in the middle ages i think someone from england who studied the middle ages would know more about portugal in the middle ages than most portuguese today
gameofthrones,not_removed,and henry viii is one king who famously did who closely resembles robert baratheon in other aspects as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,ah yes the climate obviously completely changed in years dude you just have to realize that portugal has basically nothing to do with dorne do you really think guys have anything to do with guys get real
gameofthrones,not_removed,prophesy of pendor woah
gameofthrones,not_removed,i stood in a very long queue for a very long time practicing singing this song for pop idol
gameofthrones,not_removed,big in the uk yet another great band from manchester i think they had just one hit in the us the one where she only comes when shes on top
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love this song i was so happy and a bit scared when i heard it in the new teaser such a perfect match of music and visual i think it left me with chills
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did a fast search across this sub and nobody mentioned it i dont know if wether everyone here knows them and the song already or just dont know them or care at all james is a great band if you liked the song go check their music even though the original is a somewhat happy tune the version they made for the teaser fits perfectly with the atmosphere its amazing
gameofthrones,not_removed,seriously not a fan of this song being used in the trailer doesnt fit the tone at all
gameofthrones,not_removed,now you can sit down
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually hated it and think it doesnt fit game of thrones at all
gameofthrones,not_removed,totally fits a promotional trailer
gameofthrones,not_removed,it totally doesnt
gameofthrones,not_removed,it totally does though none of these scenes are from the show its just to generate hype i personally think the rains of castamere wouldve been the better choice but its still not a bad promo if they use this song in the actual show id agree with you
gameofthrones,not_removed,its all opinion if it doesnt fit the show it doesnt fit the shows promo
gameofthrones,not_removed,theyve used a pop song in the promos since the start

gameofthrones,not_removed,house snow words baby its cold outside
gameofthrones,not_removed,instead of the snowflake how about a direwolf riding on a dragon
gameofthrones,not_removed,the thing is you can argue this has already happened for dany as azor ahai dany sacrificed her husband and got the dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,daarios line that daenerys is destined to be a conqueror not a ruler strikes me as an ominous sign for her chances of surviving the war not sure that shell end up playing nissa nissa to jons azor ahai however with roughly fifteen hours apparently left between seasons and and a whole lot of ground to cover im skeptical of their ability to sell a romance that deep between two characters who have yet to actually meet in person
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think its totally in line with this story to have the prophecy be complete hogwash just the invention of man and this lord of light or whoever pulls the strings is just getting jon and dany to where they need to be to fulfill some onetime purpose like i would imagine this show having dany sacrifice herself and her dragons to hold off the white walkers for as long as she can to save a bunch of peoplebuy time imagine if that is what danys entire life has been building up to of course dany would be willing because shes a good person but you know what i mean
gameofthrones,not_removed,he first tempered it in water then a lion then his wife say goodbye to gendry tyrion and daenerys
gameofthrones,not_removed,the dragons may very well be lightbringer
gameofthrones,not_removed,not just her husband but rhaego too she sacrificer her son to save her husband though it was done unwittingly and that led her to sacrifice drogo and led to the rebirth of dragons in westeros daenerys is likely going to have some hard times ahead but she is poised to be victorious in many ways she may well lose one or more of her dragons in the war for the dawn but she will succeed in breaking the wheel both jon and daenerys have given so much for the world of the living that i think its forged them into metaphorical lightbringers and i think the azor ahai prophecy shouldnt be read or applied literallyit provides a motivational framework for the characters to act
gameofthrones,not_removed,i didnt think about that to be honest but yes it makes a lot of sense indeed
gameofthrones,not_removed,if you pay attention to the booksat all hell even the show youll realise daenerys is going to become the main villain
gameofthrones,not_removed,aegon was named a conqueroryet he still ruled as for nissa nissa i said it before i will say it againtheres no need for azor ahaithe same reason theres no reason for lightbringervalryian sword can kill ww whay do we need a sword that requires a sacrifice that does the same thingalso where would they get the ideado you really think jon would trust mel after what she did oh look a story told years ago about a flaming sword might as well stab the shit of somebody to see if it works to defeat the ww it requires will and skill not some ancient prophecy told by old grandmas
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed i think the prophecy is a red herring i think azor ahai is more of a story about how to create valayrian steel rather than a how to kill wws there really hasnt been too much about tptwp it is used interchangeably with aa watch the only prophecy based story is the last hero which is undoubtedly bran
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive missed that part but it would be epic indeed
gameofthrones,not_removed,what makes you say that with such certainty
gameofthrones,not_removed,because maybe in order to truly defeat the night king and ww theyll need lightbringer not just a valryian steel sword
gameofthrones,not_removed,so correct me if im wrong but isnt valeryian steel forged by dragon fire cant they make a bunch of new swords forged by the dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,the acts in which she commits are not any in which george rr martin would classify as heroic
gameofthrones,not_removed,so jon would believe the words of melisandre a witch who killed a little girl to save staniss and it didnt work so whay would he trust her it will work now editjon being azor ahai is so cliche and just too predictible same with danytrue azor ahai is jaimethat would be pretty cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,but how by dragon firewe dont know if they know the methodmaybe it needs special care maybe it takes monthssmiths can barely reforge itits prob requires something more that is now lost to time
gameofthrones,not_removed,how do you know that little girls sacrifice didnt save jon at the botb
gameofthrones,not_removed,how would it be cliche it would make sense since the story is essentially about him
gameofthrones,not_removed,or gendry he is a blacksmith after all d
gameofthrones,not_removed,its true that the weather was still clear in season
gameofthrones,not_removed,because it would be like any other fantasy hero and grr doesnt write like that
gameofthrones,not_removed,that song is one of the most haunting and evocative songs that they have done throughout the show it was the perfect setup and the perfect musical pacing for that scene the scene reminded me of how all lose ends were cleaned up at the ending of the godfather and the music in that movie was so iconic as well im just in awe of the overall musical score of game of thrones and particularly what theyve done this past season
gameofthrones,not_removed,totally agree with you on all counts i remember watching this for the first time the slow suspenseful piano was giving me chills while i was thinking oh man shit is about to go down and now i have to watch it again
gameofthrones,not_removed,is that like a styrofoam egg with coloured pins glued onto it if not id be interested in how you made these
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have one of these i picked up at a craft fair for like or bucks they made it with one of those cardboard art eggs and silver thumbtacks then lightly went over it with a blowtorch to discolor the tacks to a neat red copper and blue hue
gameofthrones,not_removed,very cute i love it and a great gift idea if someone gave me one of these id be happy
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would cover that with matte modpodge
gameofthrones,not_removed,im thinking of cutting it open and putting something heavy in the center to give it some weight then super gluing it back together great idea
gameofthrones,not_removed,these are really cool i wonder if there are larger styrofoam eggs to make them a bit closer to scale though
gameofthrones,not_removed,i want all three i need a very large army
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did the game of thrones gift exchange last year and my secret santa gave me of these
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did a few also it is very therapeutic love the colour you chose here
gameofthrones,not_removed,can i be father of dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love making these i made two small ones and a large one unfortunately for me my cat really liked them and destroyed them then i just quit making them
gameofthrones,not_removed,guide
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh yes please
gameofthrones,not_removed,i never realized this but i cannot live without some off these on my christmas tree
gameofthrones,not_removed,great job i also love your nails very pretty
gameofthrones,not_removed,we are all mother of dragons on this blessed day
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love this
gameofthrones,not_removed,hope those dragon eggs comes out topfirst
gameofthrones,not_removed,have you considered hand modeling
gameofthrones,not_removed,nice nails
gameofthrones,not_removed,are you sure it isnt too tacky
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would love to buy a set of three from ya
gameofthrones,not_removed,very well done neat
gameofthrones,not_removed,that looks awesome great idea
gameofthrones,not_removed,it would make a very cool tree ornament
gameofthrones,not_removed,but they cant return this back to walmart tho thats not fair
gameofthrones,not_removed,any instructable or youtube video on how to do this
gameofthrones,not_removed,love these reminded me of a youtube video i saw awhile ago with edible dragon eggs so i thought id share
gameofthrones,not_removed,gonna make a lot of people mother of dragons by buying them
gameofthrones,not_removed,meh save it for easter
gameofthrones,not_removed,be my friend plz
gameofthrones,not_removed,many mothers weak dragon ancient proverb
gameofthrones,not_removed,wouldnt the proper plural be mothers of dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is a styrofoam egg those are originally silver pushpins so you dont have to glue anything except the top one and then you get to customize however you want by first using nail polish on the thumbtacks so now im making a blue one for another friend but you can do all kinds of fun multicoloredetc very funsimple to make
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow thats so cool ive never used a blowtorch and cant imagine my apartment complex would be thrilled but when its for got
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks im doing the reddit secret santa this year and im hoping i get a got fan so i can include one
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats a great idea thank you
gameofthrones,not_removed,heres a good example wwwimgurcomairdwm
gameofthrones,not_removed,there are even in the set i bought there are larger ones i wanted to give this size a try because the thumbtacks work well as proportional scales but im going to give a larger one a try soon and see if i can figure something out i do enjoy my little chickensized dragon eggs though
gameofthrones,not_removed,im so excited now that i know more about the exchanges and have stopped being just a lurker i really would love to do a got one
gameofthrones,not_removed,of course
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a styrofoam egg and i used nail polish green glitter top coat on thumbtacks to make the scales you just start from the bottom in the center and layer them around in circles it was super funeasycheap
gameofthrones,not_removed,late reply but thrilled to see a kenm reply on one of my submissions
gameofthrones,not_removed,sure i would be happy to do that im really enjoying making them just pm me what colors or anything youd like
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats possessive as in mother owns of dragons so no
gameofthrones,not_removed,how do you keep the pins from falling out as someone with cats and a baby this scares me
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah they look great if it was me i would probably glue them all so none of them can be taken out
gameofthrones,not_removed,well damn i was thinking that they were mms on a chocolate egg or something
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol try a little creme brule blowtorch before you think about getting anything heavy duty haha gl nice work
gameofthrones,not_removed,ha just get a small blow torch you pyro
gameofthrones,not_removed,if i were to receive one of these i would love it in a small wooden chest
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wish you were my santa that is adorable
gameofthrones,not_removed,if youre my santa totally include one in my box d
gameofthrones,not_removed,it looks so good as is tho so who knows love it
gameofthrones,not_removed,these look awesome about how many thumb tacks did you use per egg ish
gameofthrones,not_removed,sweet thanx
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a styrofoam egg and i used nail polish green glitter top coat on thumbtacks to make the scales you just start from the bottom in the center and layer them around in circles it was super funeasycheap sweet thanks did you follow a tutorial by any chance like an online video
gameofthrones,not_removed,you overlap each of the pins on each other so they all essentially hold themselves in then just glue the very top one as its the only that doesnt have others covering it
gameofthrones,not_removed,you could always glue as you go although it would be tedious messy and would most likely change the texture of the egg
gameofthrones,not_removed,at first glance i thought they were circular sequins if youre looking for a safer alternative you might be able to use colored sequins in place of the thumbtacks or if you like to sew you could make a softer version with sequins sewed on
gameofthrones,not_removed,about i kept underestimating how many it would take haha and had to keep repainting more
gameofthrones,not_removed,i saw the idea on a blog a while back and just kinda remembered the gist of it i dont think it was this one but this is super detailed on how to do it httppolishthydragoneggsweeblycom
gameofthrones,not_removed,i bet theres some kind of resin or something you could pour over but yeah i can see that getting messy and the texture is pretty important
gameofthrones,not_removed,i see how thatd work but wouldnt it be very fragile then
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks for the idea my girlfriend would love one of these
gameofthrones,not_removed,you can always use a brush and place white glue all over the egg thats what i did to some dragon eggs i made some time ago then after its dry you paint it with spraywhatever you like
gameofthrones,not_removed,you could probably use a spray glue hair spray maybe to keep it together
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh wow ok well thanks for the estimate
gameofthrones,not_removed,i speak from experience resin doesnt go well with styrofoam it kinda eats it away
gameofthrones,not_removed,mod podge acrylic sealer or similar would probably be ok but id make sure it doesnt dissolve the styrofoam youre using before starting
gameofthrones,not_removed,i made these are couple years ago i ended up painting them with acrylic paints then spraying them with a glitter clear coat of spray paint not chipping or tacks have come out
gameofthrones,not_removed,resin will eat through the foam but you could mix waterelmers allpurpose glue and then gently brush it on and it should hold itll create a transparent shell around the thumbtacks
gameofthrones,not_removed,you cant use hair spray if you plan to paint it with nail polish the alcohol in the hair spray will split up the polish
gameofthrones,not_removed,what if you wrap the styrofoam in a layer or of foil
gameofthrones,not_removed,anarchists cookbook
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont take this the wrong way but you needed more supervision
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,arsonists cookbook
gameofthrones,not_removed,very true but the the anarchists cookbook is an actual thing which teaches people how to make explosives and stuff to that effect
gameofthrones,not_removed,burn victims instruction manual
gameofthrones,not_removed,which teaches people how to make explosives if youve read it you would know it doesnt really teach anything i recall the fbi laughing it off
gameofthrones,not_removed,udarkstarlm said everything i wouldve except that i might throw in if catelyn had a full view of how things are now looking at jon would make her insane with guilt she already blames herself for everything that ills the family because of how she treated him and then she finds out that hes not only not a sign of neds disloyalty but is also a more noble stark than any of the other children i also think that only ned would be horrified by arya catelyn might act horrified but i think arya in the show is meant to take on some of the weight of lady stonehearti think arya gets her cold blood from dear mom if i had artistic talent i would draw a picture of arya slashing walder freys throat with the ghost of catelyn behind her
gameofthrones,not_removed,robb disappointed by his foolhardiness ned married catelyn for the sake of house stark during the rebellion rob married for love guilty honor in the books and in doing so lost the war sansa proud that she grew the fuck up and handled such immense hardship to end up as lady of winterfell arya freaked the fuck out she has become strong but gone down a very extreme path to do it a young girl on a streak of murderous revenge more for herself than for the sake of house stark jon most proud beaming in fact of all the children he has gone through the most to do what he knows is right for the nights watch for the realm for house stark and never wavered even dying for it even catelyn would see that he is as true a stark as it is possible to be bran confused and overwhelmed his journey is perplexing and his new powers give him an unpredictable influence over what is to come rickon sad truly sad just a boy caught up in events well out of his control or understanding
gameofthrones,not_removed,theyd be very happy that the ones that were still alive were still alive given the events of the last years theyd be pleased at all that theyve accomplished catelyn less so since jon is so prominent theyd be a little appropriately freaked out by arya
gameofthrones,not_removed,cat grief sticken at rickons death resentful of jon for not being the on who died proud of sansa but rankled at her acceptance of that bastard jon not sure about bran and arya i think theyd seem like two strangers to her ned would feel proud of jon but it would be a pride mixed with sadness because his own sons had to diebe crippled for jon to rise up as the leader of the north he would be relieved that sansa is safe now but horrified at what happened to her he would be understand how arya become a killer but be worried that she will end up dead or a monster
gameofthrones,not_removed,robb obviously died with cat but ned would probably have wanted him to pledge allegiance to stannis that would have been very tough given the robbs circumstances i think hed be proud of robbs tactical abilities though jon was elected lord commander of the nights watch and has lead several battles and other missions no doubt ned would be proud cat would also be proud after he won winterfell back and is putting such an importance on his relationship with sansa sansa this is probably the toughest one shes obviously been through a lot and made some bad decisions early on but she also helped jon win back winterfell by making an allegiance with baelish but both her parents would tell her stay the hell away from littlefinger so she should start doing that now that she got what she wanted from him bran new eyed raven enough said except ned would tell him to keep some secrets to himself arya they would both love the crap out of arya keep crossing the names of people who wronged the starks off your list little girl youre doing great things am i forgetting anyone no one important im sure if there is another stark child im sure ned and cat forgot about them too so it doesnt matter summation mostly pretty damn proud
gameofthrones,not_removed,realistically speaking robb ned would probably feel some deep disappointment in his actions since he broke a vow of future marriage to marry another even though the red wedding wasnt his fault well his fault he shouldve known better we already know cats feelings on what robb did jon ned would be very proud of his son nephew for going up in the ranks with the nights watch i do not however think his father would be too keen on the idea of him helping out the wildlings let alone falling in love with onebeing best friends with one im sure that in neds eyes the people responsible for benjens disappearance were wildlings and we all know the north isnt too friendly with them either ned also mightve not been too agreeing on jon leaving the nights watch even though jon died and was then revived i dont think ned would see this as an actual reason to leave the watch on the other hand ned would be very proud that jon united with sansa to take back winterfell and reunite the north and that even though he could pursue other things that he is adamant on staying in the north and preparing for the battle against the white walkers cat honestly would probably feel indifferent about jon maybe shed have less hatred than before but i certainly dont think that shed think of him as her son after these things either sansa ned is honestly probably rolling in his grave with the things sansa has done sansa hasnt acted with honor and he made sure that his kids new this sansa would lie in order to appeal to the queen and she would settle for things she didnt need to settle for ie marriage with tyrion sansa acted as an accomplice to her aunts murder by littlefingers hand and covered for him although he might be a little proud that she encouraged jon to take back winterfell theres no doubt hed be totally against how she did it she plotted with littlefinger to get winterfell back without telling jon or any other commander then after that she didnt tell jon about her plan to bring in the knights of the vale thus causing many loyal northmen to lose their lives cat would probably be happy that sansa has made it out of all of this alive but she again would be disappointed in her being littlefingers minion cat would probably be livid that sansa helped cover up her sisters murder even though cat wasnt lysas biggest fan that is still her sister arya ned would be very relieved shes alive and that shes been looking out for herself and be happy that shes at least trying to stay true to herself now ofc i dont know how hed feel about her killing all of these people even though theyve wronged her family part of me feels like hed be happy shes avenging his family but disappointed at how mainly getting at the fact that she uses someone elses face although in the two revenge killings weve seen her do shes taken off the mask it is unclear whether she did that with walders two sons cat would be more pleased than ned would be about the revenge aspect of things but cat has just always seemed very against killing given the opportunities to kill the man who paralyzed her son and killed the sons of other men in her sons army she let him go cat would also be extremely relieved to know aryas alive as she died believing arya was dead bran ned would probably be the most proud of bran especially considering brans circumstances bran has done nothing to necessarily harm anyone and bran is going to make a huge difference in not only his life but the lives of the starks and may change the seven kingdoms forever cat again caring mostly about the wellbeing of her children would probably be relieved bran has made it relatively okay i have a feeling she wouldnt be too happy about him going north of the wall by himself rickon they would both obviously be heartbroken about rickon i wish there was more i could say about rickon but we didnt see very much of his character beyond him being a normal little boy rip systems are down at work and needed something to occupy my time sorry for the wall of text
gameofthrones,not_removed,well just looking at the ones that are alive theyd be pleased about jon and sansa being in charge though also upset at what happened to them along the way i suppose catelyn would be pleased that arya avenged her but now arya is kind of a serial killer so thats not cool theyd be most worried about bran
gameofthrones,not_removed,robb ned sad but proud sad he died but proud he was worthy of the title of lord of winterfell disappointed with his wife choices but understanding cat we know where she stood sansa ned proud she grew up but a bit sad that she now knows the world is harsh and her innocence is lost cat worried about her daughter but proud she is becoming a woman arya ned disappointed she is a murderer it would be almost that simple for him cat she would be worried that she could go completely to the dark side and be evil jon ned ned would just beam at the man jon has become cat still hate him bran ned would take some time to come to gripes with brans abilities but being of the north he would know of greenseers cat completely confused and scared because she is not of the north rickon going to parrot what rdarkstarlm said and just say theyd both be sad
gameofthrones,not_removed,robb saddened by his stupid mistake in breaking his word to the freys but generally very proud of the otherwise capable and honourable man he had become jon ned would realise that jon not only has the integrity that ned had but also has vision ned wouldnt have let the wildlings south but he would recognise that jon did the right thing and i think hed admire him for it sansa theyd be glad she survived but maybe not so happy about some of her choices ned more worried than cat i think arya proud of her strength and resourcefulness i dont think theyd be as appalled by the revenge killing as some people think this is a world where killing to avenge your family is accepted though theyd probably prefer it wasnt their little girl doing it proud of bran certainly and devastated by the loss of rickon
gameofthrones,not_removed,mad at jon for not saving rickon and killing ramsey himself even though it was cathartic for sansa and us jealous of ayra for slitting frey throat
gameofthrones,not_removed,good point about lsh and thats probably why they didnt feel it necessary to keep her in the show aryas going to have plenty of throats to slash on her own theres only so much time to dedicate to stark throat slashing
gameofthrones,not_removed,rickon sad the boy never learned how to serpentine
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean jon did kinda waver when robb went to war it took sam and the gang to bring him back but otherwise i agree completely edit i guess trying to help his brother would be trying to do what was right on second thought
gameofthrones,not_removed,rickon was so feral in the books like he was literally raised by wolves rickon warging into shaggy dog at such a young mustve seriously messed with his mind i feel like the boys mind and the wolfs mind started to mesh together so it sucks that they just killed him off in the show he couldve been an interesting character when he reappeared
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think so i think in the afterlife ned would have come clean to catelyn and she would have a new love for both ned and jon
gameofthrones,not_removed,love the crap out of arya i think theyd be horrified and appalled especially ned with his honor and love of justice
gameofthrones,not_removed,you forgot rickon theyd disown him for not zigzagging
gameofthrones,not_removed,i as just about to write that ned would love the shit out of ayra
gameofthrones,not_removed,why would cat hate jon still assuming she also knew jons parentage
gameofthrones,not_removed,personally id be ok with an entire episode devoted to starks slashing throats for revenge thats just me though
gameofthrones,not_removed,caught between his duty to the watch and his house even his conflicts were ones of honor
gameofthrones,not_removed,or as lord commander mormomt said honor is what brought you back and jon responds with it wasnt honor that brought me back it was my brothers and mormont responds with i didnt say it was your honor
gameofthrones,not_removed,can you imagine the young wolf and the white wolf fighting side by side geez
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean arya is a teenager that carve people into pies imagine the process if that doesnt ring a bell in your head as a parent even in westeros i dont know what will
gameofthrones,not_removed,she is justice
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah if only she was a lady like sansa then she could have come through it at the end letting the dogs of the man that repeatedly raped and sodomized her tear him apart instead of being a tough little shit all along yeah having a man torn apart by dogs and watching it is so much better than baking two guys that was complicit in breaking guest right into a pie after just killing them by probably also throat slittingor stabbing and cutting someones throat lol seriously if i was ned id be horrified that my little girl had to go through so much that she ended up capable of doing what she did but i wouldnt have judged her for it and i would have preferred that path for her instead of sansas path
gameofthrones,not_removed,to be fair the writers of the show mostly forgot rickon as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know i forgot rickon i was just making a joke since he was pretty much nonexistent and unimportant to the plot of the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was assuming she didnt
gameofthrones,not_removed,true but i think with the amount of time they dedicated to arya training montages she should handle that on her own
gameofthrones,not_removed,the only unwavering thing he did was sleep with his bae in the cave
gameofthrones,not_removed,i completely agree
gameofthrones,not_removed,she is vengeance
gameofthrones,not_removed,no not really at the end of adwd there was still no sign not a single scene with rickon in it since the branmeerajojenhodor and rickonosha splitup sooner also in book hes only talked about once in the novel a dance of dragons wyman manderly reveals to davos seaworth that osha rickon and shaggydog went to the island of skagos off the east coast of the north a semiindependent isle only nominally part of the north considered to practically be wildlings themselves feared as savage raiders and rumored cannibals wex the only survivor of the ironborn who occupied winterfell followed them and then went to the white harbor and told lord manderly lord manderly one of the starks loyal bannermen seeking to avenge his son wendel offers to pledge his allegiance to king stannis baratheon if davos brings rickon back safely lord manderly plans to overthrow the boltons and install rickon stark as the new warden of the north they are only mentioned in passing however and it is unknown if they are still alive though davos intends to sail there to retrieve them
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont worry i got your subtle hints even if some others missed it
gameofthrones,not_removed,nah he was just that deep undercover
gameofthrones,not_removed,wrist deep
gameofthrones,not_removed,it really is ive had amazing insightful conversations with coworkers and we have zero interaction outiside of the topic same goes for people at a bar its like talking politics without all the hatred and judgment nearly any theory is possible unless youve read the books then only a few are still open edited removed a word
gameofthrones,not_removed,i got my last girlfriend into this show she liked it so much there was a point where she would text me got references in our conversations for example i remember texting her in a span of hours or so and i received no reply until i finally called her and asked her why she didnt answer if i was calling her by her name she replied with a girl has no name i wasnt even mad after that i was proud
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre right but it can also be a bit weird for example there was a girl ive never met before who talked to me because i wore my bolton shirt on that day she said she was super disappointed by ramsays death scene and shed rather seen sansa torture him for weeks and cut his penis off and feed that to his dogs i wasnt sure what to reply to that d
gameofthrones,not_removed,i once hooked up with a girl thanks to game of thrones we kept talking for hours on asoiaf since we both read the books and that was at a party weeks after i saw her again on campus and asked her out since then we watched the last season together and rewatched the whole show over weekends all that thanks to this show
gameofthrones,not_removed,i recently started college and since im an insanely shy person ive been struggling with meeting new people but everytime i wear any of my got merch i end up having long conversations with random people who approach me to talk about it
gameofthrones,not_removed,my good mate is a roster manager for a tv crew we are a part of usually i dont like accepting last minute role swaps or emergency fill ins but he sent me a text saying would you be so kind to jump on x role men are short on the wall how could i possibly say no to that request
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea dude i became a super hardcore nerd about this show quick and youre right any time it comes up with people who watch it we can talk about it forever its crazy
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeh i have also pissed off people to no end telling them there was no way sansa was pregnant or that she would not betray jon haha the worst is when you speak to people who arent as crazy about the show as you and you destroy everything they say because of a thread on here or a alt x shift video lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,a large amount of my friends are of the game of thrones is war and porn crowd and even though theyre nerds they dont give a shit about retro games or even most of the games i can play on my laptopand i can run rocket league fallout and skyrim among other things but my one friend is willing to talk to me about all of it the only things i like that he wont discuss is animehe hasnt watched much and true bloodwhich every one around me thinks is like fucking twilight
gameofthrones,not_removed,it really is gives us something to talk about the number one question always seems to be how do you think itll end
gameofthrones,not_removed,i scared someone on the first date away doing the same thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love getting people into the show then we become better friends
gameofthrones,not_removed,i also got my older brother into the show we burned through the whole series my time watching the whole thing in a week and his memory for details were surprising now he calls himself the sword of the morning because thats his favorite character he quotes tywin on a daily basis mostly the you are a lannister line
gameofthrones,not_removed,woah are we the same person my girlfriend does the same she was upset about something the other day and i asked later if she was ok and if she forgave me she says yes but the north remembers
gameofthrones,not_removed,im proud and ive never met her
gameofthrones,not_removed,a girl you never met before initiated conversation and mentioned the word penis you would think people know how to respond to that
gameofthrones,not_removed,getting eaten alive piece by piece is pretty damn bad way to go
gameofthrones,not_removed,game of thrones getting geeks laid since
gameofthrones,not_removed,my first couple dates with my girlfriend were game of thrones dates she was excited about watching them i was excited about cuddling on the couch and a rewatch and its worked out pretty well so far
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats adorable and this is my goal
gameofthrones,not_removed,hey man that girl can burn in seven hells
gameofthrones,not_removed,mance rayder mance rayder aneyd dayne therefore mance is arthurs long lost stepsister
gameofthrones,not_removed,why does this keep coming up its a common westerosi phrase benjen also says something to that affect when he parts ways with bran
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel like it was a common saying
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought they both used the words good fortune instead of well
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned said winter is coming and so did olenna tyrell coincidence i think not
gameofthrones,not_removed,how can arthur dayne and rhaegar targaryen be the same person
gameofthrones,not_removed,mance was a dayne previously i really dont think hes arthur dayne or rhaegar as some people imply
gameofthrones,not_removed,nah mance is ashara dayne
gameofthrones,not_removed,good enough for me fucking confirmed
gameofthrones,not_removed,benjen just said i wish you good fortune presumably knowing that the fans would go apeshit if he repeated the whole phrase after mance and dayne used it
gameofthrones,not_removed,rayder sounds a lot like rhaegar
gameofthrones,not_removed,only because bran has no legs hes not going to be doing much warfare going forward is he
gameofthrones,not_removed,best response yet thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,lieutenant bran youve got legs
gameofthrones,not_removed,dorne for sure because they killed doran and areo like two most interesting people there they cut arianne darkstar or house dayne they had so much potential the way they used direwolves and just kill them randomly shagy killed off screen and summer suicide also bond stark kids share with their direwolves even ghost seemed to be not so close to jon and hes his spiritual animal theyre like one soul danys vision quest in the dothraki sea showing viserys rhaegar drogo more connection to rhaegar in general because they are compared to another another in the books quite often and she dreams about him one thing on barristan i do understand it a bit because they bring tyrion to her and having them both they just probably moves fast forward compare to books its very likely tho he might die in the winds of winter
gameofthrones,not_removed,dorne all of it killing off the only intriguing characters unceremoniously plus the sand snakes am i supposed to be rooting for them now they are on danys side they are irredeemable kinslayers they make me want dany to lose the north forgetting why couldnt ramsay have lost basically for treating all his own men like shit instead of the same predictable cavalry rescue that happened on the other two big human battles backwater and castle black i so wanted the umbers and other northern houses to flip from guilt when they saw ramsay murder rickon
gameofthrones,not_removed,stannis storyline towards the end poorly written
gameofthrones,not_removed,no strong belwas
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would say dorne but the blackfishes death it was just a serious shot to the cock
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think dorne and the iron islands are a tie the ironborn have just kinda been there but havent done much euron was disappointing in his entrance so far and dorne decided the sand snakes were a good idea gross
gameofthrones,not_removed,how little people seem to give a shit about the fact jon snow died and came back to life they think youre some kind of god does not sit well with them a couple episodes later doubting him about leading an army imagine how much more hyped the battle of bastards would be if they knew that one was worshiped like a god
gameofthrones,not_removed,definitely dropping jaime admitting to tyrion that tysha wasnt a whore i got genuinely mad when i realised they were dropping that and the two of them just did an awkward goodbye hug then tyrion wandered off to kill tywin
gameofthrones,not_removed,aryas storyline took way too long for very little payoff
gameofthrones,not_removed,the lack of the greyjoy storylines saddened me a lot also the lack of black brothers in the books jon still has a lot of friends left at the wall but he buggesst disappointment has to be what they did to varys his plan was so much more than just getting dany on the throne having him dissapear for two seasons then come back to kill kevan would have been bad ass
gameofthrones,not_removed,barristan selmy didnt need to and shouldnt of died when he did imo
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon not having dreams of the crypts dont know why they havnt added that in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,i didnt like sansas storyline this season i did not like her attitude jon will protect me but i dont trust jim he can t have an army to satisfy my vanity so i will tell nothing about ramsay about hiw he fights how he uses the oponents weakness to tear him down no i am a victim and i suffered enough so i think everyone should do everything for me for granted oh wait i have an army because some pedo is after my pussy so yeah i have huge character development i stood aside took winterfell back spotless and warm did not fight for hours through the bodies or had to freeze meantime the same with cersei what is up with the script they are completely changed from the previous seasons
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really wanted stoneheart in the show but i can understand why they cut her out michelle fairley is way too good of an actress to play a mute zombie also the sansajeyne switch was better because lets be honest who gave a flying fck about some friend of sansas not me in the books it worked out but portraying it in the show would be tough
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the biggest let down is the fact its going to end
gameofthrones,not_removed,i admit seeing dany ride dragons was cool but it was totally bittersweet because i knew how unrealistic it was the shower runners just seem super rushed and the show is suffering because of it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree with a lot of the others here but id add an honorable mention for the fact that the blackfish died offscreen
gameofthrones,not_removed,the tower of joy this dream from the book is some of the best writing grrm has in the entire series and without even showing us a battle he makes us wonder about the mystery surrounding this story for the rest of his series the show takes away of the dialogue and just turns this scene into a quick and easy fight because it would look cool and the scenes true power is stolen
gameofthrones,not_removed,my biggest disappointment is the lack of unicorns in the books rickon osha and shaggydog are on an isle that reportably has unicorns davos has gone to find them im disappointed that the show played rickons story out how they did
gameofthrones,not_removed,wasted potential of stannis baratheon i still loved him
gameofthrones,not_removed,smh when the kettlebacks werent included
gameofthrones,not_removed,making yara a sudden lesbian what a cliche strong woman and not conventionally pretty clearly she must be a lesbian roll eyes
gameofthrones,not_removed,just a friendly note since you only listened to the audiobooks look up the names you misspelled almost every one of them jeyne barristan dany jaime dayne grrm makes up weird spellings and it can lead to confusion
gameofthrones,not_removed,hot pie not being focused on more i want to know the secret to those pies
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought that dorne was definitely a disappointment doran could very well have the best plan to take down the lannisters and areo is one of the best fighters in westeros also the waifs death was pretty lame i understand that arya turned the lights off to use her blind fighting advantage but that wouldve been such a strong emotional battle
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just think compared to the previous seasons that were based on the books and a lot of the dialogue was taken straight from the books it was really inconsistent it seemed unrealistic that jon would act that way the outcome was predictable and i didnt like that it was predictably predictable it was like watching a different show completely changing the pacing of the show up to that point
gameofthrones,not_removed,no aegon as a show only watcher ive heard some shit about varys and just how huge his importance is to that story and its just likeholy shit how could you cut that character out
gameofthrones,not_removed,the sansaramsay marriage was the worst for me i actually lost sleep over the wedding night scene i was really enjoying seeing sansa in a relatively safe place in the books and learning from lf and learning the game and running a household i love her book character with everything that she went through she was still kind and considerate to others people think she is weak but i think she was one of the strongest characters to keep her sanity and her composure through everything
gameofthrones,not_removed,euron looking like theons older brother and not like a oneeyed pirate with a damn dragon horn
gameofthrones,not_removed,the super greyjoy bros not existing no lsh not seeing sansa get tortured for what i hope was months and dorne fuck autocorrect
gameofthrones,not_removed,the battle of the bastards was way to cliche and hollywood it was super obvious what was going to happen jon was acting completely out of character i dont know if he will act differently when he comes back to life in the books but the real jon snow is not that stupid or impulsive he was raised by ned stark he is a good tactician he proves this in the books when giving council to stannis at castle black the sansa being a victim again storyline with ramsey was a waste of time it seems like shes been able to avoid getting raped this whole time just to get raped by ramsey bolton it doesnt progress her characters plot line i wouldve preferred to see her doing something interesting in the eyrie danys all of a sudden having complete control of her dragons that was ridiculous and when two of the dragons just burst out of the dungeon theyve been kept in was unrealistic to say the least that episode made dany look like a ridiculous super hero or something
gameofthrones,not_removed,is this book to show adaptation disappointment only if not then i would have liked to see the relationship between tyrion and sansa develop
gameofthrones,not_removed,the lack of awe and running away in panic at the sight of a giant in the battle of the bastards and the showdown of death and destruction i was expecting from him also of course his lacking of any kind of weapon etc rest in tons of peace wun wun
gameofthrones,not_removed,not enough of it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think swapping sansa in the show for the arya impersonator in the book was a big missed opportunity story telling wise i also agree with stripping down how important selmy was in the bookswhich is understandable for tv
gameofthrones,not_removed,also widows wail and oathkeeper arent as impressive on tv as they are in the book
gameofthrones,not_removed,the worst change was making jon a bumbling idiot in season not only does he fuck upmiss when trying to execute ygritte he chases her miles away from his brothers then keeps her as a pet until she gets him to chase her again into a pack of wildlings this time and as a result of jon running off his brothers try to find him and get captured too so its completely his fault half hand and the others die half hand never even tells jon to kill him he just picks a fight and jon kinda seems to kill him out of spitenot really understanding whats happening then we barely got to see jon amongst the wildlings less than a handful of scenes jon is more forced to break his vows with ygritte in the book otherwise the other wildlings would think he is still loyal to the nw in the show he gets ambushed with tits and breaks the vows immediately i had a lot of trouble liking jon in season two when book two is when he became one of my absolute favorites the worst part is all the changes were easily avoidable but some people actually thought these changes were good and let them through fuck
gameofthrones,not_removed,battle of the bastards was complete fuckery from jon losing his shit over a character nobody has any reason to give a shit about to the idea of it being a very blackwhite good guysbad guys affair i mean really why even include the bit where he constructs a strategy if hes just going to blow it in some uncharacteristically reckless act could we at least have a scene where tormund chews him out for being so stupid or where sansa reminds him that he did the exact thing that she begged him not to do and nearly got himself and everybody else with him killed because of it yay winterfell never mind that jon is a fucking dolt who nearly threw everything away for an obvious plot device just to be rescued by an army he had no idea was coming were home good guys win lets all have ice cream this brings me to my main contention with bastard bowl in every other huge battle to happen so far there are people we care about on both sides of the field and it serves to remind us that these are all humans fighting for their own personal convictions just like any of us would in real life at blackwater we found ourselves not only cheering for the baratheons because fuck cersei also davos but for the plights of characters like tyrion and the hound who are on the other side when the free folk assault the wall we want our heroes at castle black to prevail yet at the same time we all found ourselves wishing that tormund would hack ser aliser in half when the two meet in combat battle of the bastards had none of that sure the piles of bodies and gritty realism were gutwrenching and the whole scene was a terrific piece of cinematography and we all held our breath sort of as tormund and jon came within inches of a gruesome death but we all knew who would win because it was so black and white and we hated every single dude on the bolton side of the conflict ramsay was pure evil and thats about as deep as his character ever got maybe now that this is all out of the way we can go back to what made thrones so exciting in the first place which is flawed but ultimately human characters being pitted against one another by the brutal circumstances of war edit also good guys losing i love that shit
gameofthrones,not_removed,people dont plot in the show they just give large meaningless speeches then battle there are no ambitious people within certain groups and people do not react to things
gameofthrones,not_removed,sansajeyne plotline i know i will get so much hate for it sansa not becoming qitn after everything pointed that direction imo
gameofthrones,not_removed,the way jon snow stupidly charged into battle against ramsay robert would be ashamed to know that his brother would do something so foolish he got even worst as we would see multiple times jon effectively dodging a wall of arrows jons behavior in that battle basically killed his character for me then theres the whole slavers revenge miniplot like what was the point if the dragons could win the battle by destroying a few ships in a few minutes with no loses then how were we ever supposed to believe the slavers were ever any threat at least when the sons were attacking the arena it looked like the dragon could be potentially be killed by infantry
gameofthrones,not_removed,seeing a younger barristan selmy would be one of the high points if we got a spin off of roberts rebellion
gameofthrones,not_removed,not having prince aegon in the show is kinda a big exclusionnot only for his story but it downplays just how big a role the spider has in the storywe see him do some in the show but in the books he is involved in so much more to the point where i wonder if he acts of his own will or as an instrument of the gods
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh the ss i think their sole purpose is to fulfill a yinyang theres a little bad poosi within danys good allies maybe dany will successfully conquer but we have to see some wellknown characters from her plot line die and they deserve to die for their collective actions
gameofthrones,not_removed,book and didnt do him any justice killed off screen is weak for a major character
gameofthrones,not_removed,strong belwas need liver and onion to make him strong again
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,where are my niece and nephew lets murder them lets murder them really
gameofthrones,not_removed,even in the books the dorne plot didnt hold much water with the most interesting thing being that mrgout had some plan instead of just being the guy from even the book plot of the prince coming and trying to game the dragons fell flat the amount of time the books spends on the ironborn elections is super dull too but at least it finds a better way to work into the plot then the mess the show gave us
gameofthrones,not_removed,agree it should factored in somehow but didnt
gameofthrones,not_removed,yep it really tones down just how fucked everyone treated tyrion instead we see him get drunk on a boat instead of having to suffer through depression and spend his time sarcastically joking about how he is a monster who kills his own kinnot having penny in it was disappointing i live peter dinklage but honestly he is too handsometyrion in the books is a grotesque little monster
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh thats a good one i hated that they dropped that i wanted that moment of tyrion promising to kill his own brother
gameofthrones,not_removed,was there ever an explanation for why the kindly old man in the house of black and white is replaced with jaquen in the show i mean i like jaquen but it confused me
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really believe it was to save money or some alternate reason instead of a pure story telling standpoint
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was sad but considering that they didnt even have anything for tyrion to do as danys advisor what could they have done with barriston selmy
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think i read somewhere that the actor who portrayed selmy was furious about how he was going out
gameofthrones,not_removed,sansas character is all over the map in the show this is not the sansa of the books sansa of the books would have been using the lessons in manipulation that she learned to try to sway jon davos and the northern lords but in the show all she does is whine and complain and bitch then she gets rude to davos and sarcastic to jon about davos that isnt who sansa is they have no concept of who this character is and it is the most disappointing thing to me
gameofthrones,not_removed,for me having stoneheart in would have just allowed more focus on the war in the river landsso much happened there and we got so little the feeling that from winterfell to kings landing was nothing but battlegrounds and carnage
gameofthrones,not_removed,if i remember rightly magic was used in the past for taming and riding dragons they missed a great opportunity to have a red priestess teach dany about the history and practicality of dragons and taming them properly
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the point of that scene was to make us the audience feel as disappointed and let down as jamie was since the blackfish was jamies hero growing up and he just died an unimpressive death
gameofthrones,not_removed,that was the worst thing about season i love this character why couldnt he escape with edmures help like he does in the books when edmure looks at him when he enters the castle was that his attempt to warn the blackfish to escape why couldnt they have a few words the writing is so confusingyet they get writing awards
gameofthrones,not_removed,lets take the sword of the morning and give him two normal swordsyah no
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea because the show doesnt have any other strong physically unconventional women that arent lesbians
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought that choice had as much to do with theon as with yara like a metaphor for his possibilities of regaining things in his life he thought were lost forever he and most everyone else assume he cant conceivably have sex ever again and then yaras like whelp i have no dick either and imma go fuck the tits off this girl
gameofthrones,not_removed,are you just going to pretend like briene doesnt exist or
gameofthrones,not_removed,great actress for a great characterbut no lets not make you interesting lets just make you sexual
gameofthrones,not_removed,yup i also typed it on the toilet as i struggle to adjust to an ios device after being an android purists
gameofthrones,not_removed,its the gravy cant give up on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,the short version please
gameofthrones,not_removed,they didnt cut him out they merged him with dany theres only so much meat you can put into the story with hours or less per season introducing new plot threads one season before the show ends just isnt an option
gameofthrones,not_removed,spoiler alert but the last book ends with varys killing pycel and kevin lanister to sow discretion between the laniaters and highgardenhe monologues about switching the babies before the mountain killed him in a grand scheme to save the realm
gameofthrones,not_removed,the mummers dragon from the prophecy as that part of the prophecy was kept im surprised the character wasnt
gameofthrones,not_removed,our views differ good sir
gameofthrones,not_removed,i completely understand where youre coming from in regards to botb but i think youre overlooking something yes botb was predictablehollywood but it was unpredictably predictable for episodes before botb the show has been nonstop unpredictable i dont think its necessarily a bad thing that botb was predictable considering how amazing it was to watch everything unfold the action was outstanding from the beginning with dany and her dragons if youre telling me that it wasnt cool seeing dany and her dragons fuckin shit up then youre absurd and the death of ramsay bolton was arguably the most satifying tv death of all time right up there with joffrey would it have been more like typical got if they threw in a plot twist like jon or sansa dying or littlefinger betraying sansajon yes but for of got fans out there botb was one of the most amazing hours of television and if youre so nitpicky about it then i feel bad for you because botb is awesome
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree with jon acting out of character in botb while i think it was the writers intention to make jon come across as impulsive which i thought was fine because a hero with zero flaws is not very interesting i dont think it was their intention to also make him all of a sudden simple which they did i hope this is rectified in season to say the least
gameofthrones,not_removed,aw bad as that writing was as long as sansa is miserable im happy
gameofthrones,not_removed,z
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would have liked this as well i loved the scene when they go for the walk with shae they could make a great couple in the books they dont even get this sansa just avoids him and prays all of the time
gameofthrones,not_removed,not even the book put much focus on their relationship though
gameofthrones,not_removed,they seemed a little closer in the series than in the books they actually have a few scenes where sansa is almost alright with tyrion talking to her which never happens in the books i like it better in the show actually
gameofthrones,not_removed,that could be said for all swords in the show really
gameofthrones,not_removed,it wasnt black and white at all northerners were defending their homes from wildlings
gameofthrones,not_removed,either way he dies or hes fake and probably not that important to the endgame ii wouldve been interesting to see him and joncon they gave aspects of his storyline to dany and jorah hes the one to get greyscale dany invading making aliance with dorne and other things
gameofthrones,not_removed,stannis is a brilliant military commander who held storms end against the might of the reach for a year you just dont destroy his supplies with good men plus brienne killing him was all about the strong women trope hes way more awesome in the books hope he takes winterfell
gameofthrones,not_removed,and dd won writing awards for this type of dialogue
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats not a monster i told cersei thats just a baby oberyn
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont know if you misunderstood the guy you replied to or im misunderstanding you but in the book they dont leave on good terms at all its not an awkward good bye so much as a ill kill you if i ever see you again
gameofthrones,not_removed,i fully expect that but i think her time in braavos could have been much shorter
gameofthrones,not_removed,to save money really those brother spent over a hundred million dollars on a single episode but they kill off selmy in order to save some money
gameofthrones,not_removed,much like selmy in may he die with the blood of dd on his blade
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i would have loved to see that story on the small screen as well sometimes i wonder how thorosberic and the hound joining jon in the north could be more interesting than the source material but at the same time i can understand why they had to cut it out
gameofthrones,not_removed,one of those swords wasnt normal it was dawn the coloring was just more subtle so it doesnt look like plastic
gameofthrones,not_removed,dawn was valyrian steel in the show certainly not normal
gameofthrones,not_removed,your point is well taken you are correct but my gut reaction to the tv revelation comes from the fact that asha was definitely not lesbian and so there had to be some impulse by the showfairly young male writers to hire a plainer looking actress gemma whelan than what the character of ashayara called for either because they intended to make her a lesbian as if a conventionally beautiful girl could never be one or they because her reading was so strong probably and then later some chauvinistic little devil on their shoulder whispered that she looks like a lesbian or rather the cliche version of one no disrespect intended toward the actress i think she is quite attractive in an unconventional way and has a great bod im very jealous of her derriere
gameofthrones,not_removed,possibly i may be making a tempest in a glass of water
gameofthrones,not_removed,i forgot about her in my outrage there is a difference though brienne looks the way she is described in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,how is she not interesting and just sexual i can remember one scene where shes being sexual and lesbian maybe there are more but i recall one but i remember way more where shes interesting and badass
gameofthrones,not_removed,good luck with the ios hope you like it i cant imagine changing to anything else
gameofthrones,not_removed,need fiber
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hear you i dunno maybe its just personal for me as varys might be the most interesting character in the show imo and his big reveal of him supporting daenerys wasnt what i thought he would really be up to when i first started watching then again we have episodes to go he could still be up to more so well have to see
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think is an strong exaggeration i didnt like botb either and i also dont get the hype about the last two episodesbut nevertheless it is good television
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the books the last we hear of stannis is the pink letter to john where bolton claims to have killed him and captured mance
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont see a difference
gameofthrones,not_removed,me too her cleaning corpses out in that grey little room was the most boring part of the whole show
gameofthrones,not_removed,well there was the scene where she and dany were eye banging each other
gameofthrones,not_removed,i take it you havent read the theon twow chapter which has been released stannis is alive and well
gameofthrones,not_removed,been waiting for the full book
gameofthrones,not_removed,so sad i looked it up and theres posts claiming the book was supposed to come out in here i am on my third run reading the books just waiting for the new one

gameofthrones,not_removed,what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever read at no point in your rambling incoherent post were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational theory everyone in this subreddit is now dumber for having read it i award you no upvotes and may god have mercy on your soul
gameofthrones,not_removed,furthermore it also makes sense too since kl has spies that would know that danerys was coming tommen is innocent and would be pushed into marriage with her and after getting margaerys punani danys sex game would be on to him
gameofthrones,not_removed,however he would most likely lose his innocence by getting coerced to kill her by cersei hge would still never get it up again though and would eventually realize his asexuality with margaerys absence hence his death tommen was always meant to die

gameofthrones,not_removed,someone messaged me asking if i was playing i will admit when i talked about this with my bros we were kidding at first but then we realized that in that situation we would have done the same margaerys pussy game cant be replicated i would kill myself if i lost that
gameofthrones,not_removed,hahaha billy madison
gameofthrones,not_removed,bro are you serious
gameofthrones,not_removed,septa unella is actually hotter than cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,okay cersei is pretty hot but if she is so hot then why did she think margary was the queen in the prophecy surely she bought into margarys hotness too
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,look margaery laid with tommen her pussy game cant be replicated or duplicated margaery died tommen cant get it up anymore tommen isnt varys he cant live with that shit also look at god damn theon hes struggling to survive

gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,ok
gameofthrones,not_removed,surprised this didnt start with did anyone else notice
gameofthrones,not_removed,been discussed ad nauseam
gameofthrones,not_removed,he does it essentially ties him to the night king the night king now knows everything that bran knows if and when as i believe that wall will come down and the magic that has held the otherswhitewalkers back will be gone the night king will know exactly when and where bran is and he will be able to plan his attack although he doesnt have to he does essentially have and op army of invincible warriors to save him drogon viserion and rhegal cannot get there fast enough
gameofthrones,not_removed,several possibilities the mark works as you say and the ancient wards on the wall are broken but there is still a big friggin wall there and thats gotta slow some zombies down the mark works better than you think and the wards were holding the wall up and it collapses killing most or all of the men of the watch and maybe bran and the dam breaks for the damned and they flood in the mark is ineffective against the wall and bran slides through and goes to winterfell in a wagon parks by the tree in the godswood there and returns to being the greenseeing junkie bingewatching the past that he is and hoping sansa brings him food occasionally and the night king or nights king or whichever is the leader of the walkers has to find another way through the wall which he probably can i think its probably that this bit of tinfoil hype is just that
gameofthrones,not_removed,okay benjen knows what happened at the ravens he knows hes marked why would benjen let him cross if he knows what happened the walls magic is perhaps too strong i honestly think the horn of winter is what will do it
gameofthrones,not_removed,just because youve seen it doesnt mean everyone else has
gameofthrones,not_removed,does that mean bran can potentially know everything about the night king
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think they cut the horn for time purposes the horn sam finds i believe to be the horn that can control the dragons but it could also very well be that they are a mixture of the two it is very possbile that a random fuckwit could grab the horn if it is still at the wall i cant remember if sam has it or not in the show but anyway someone rando brother might grab the horn when the army does reach the wall and does not know what he is doing the night king may very well know this i think we wants the wall to come down so he can get through faster i just have a hunch that he is pissed off at all of westoros god i watch altshit x too much
gameofthrones,not_removed,id like to believe that who has the horn sam if so who will seize it from him the night king whos thousands of miles away euron i dont think hell build his thousand ships quick enough to raid oldtown and the citadel before dany and her dragons land in westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,if youve been to this subreddit once per month im sure youve come across it its ridiculously common its like me saying hey i think maybe bran is the reason the mad king went mad just like hodor or better yet idk if this has been posted but i believe jon snow might be azor ahai
gameofthrones,not_removed,potentially we do do not know yet i tend to believe that bran can see into the mind of the night king my theory is that person we see get the dragonglass shoved into his is the night king and here is why benjen tells us that that he had dragon glass shoved into his chest this keeps him from turning into a mindless creature i think that only the starks have this gift an innate inborn ability they do not realize the night king was most likely a stark before he was turned i believe and agin just my theory i take a lot of influence from alt shift x on this one myself but anyway i believe that the night king is a stark not a very big leap up faith seeing as many lord commanders of the watch were starks the starks all have a naturally ability to warg bran just seems to be extra gifted with this ability and the fall probably helped to trigger it seeing as he nothing else to do once he woke up anyway yes there is probably a pretty good chance that bran can know everything about the night king we wont know until the season starts which is why it is fun to speculate
gameofthrones,not_removed,pretty sure sam has the horn he did have all the dragonglass found there he is in old town now on the path of euron i bet sam either gets abducted or books passage and the horn ends up in eurons hand euron thinks its the dragon binding horn but its actually the horn of winter he uses it against daenerys but ends up blowing the wall thousands of miles never realizing he did
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree on the other hand there are people who discover reddit every day we all started sometime and to assume everyones always been here is just wrong its the reason reposts are allowed withing certain timeframes during the season reposted content will only be allowed week after the original post due to the high fast volume of content in the off season people come here less and content cycles less frequently so we increase this window to weeks
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont have an issue with some reposts over time its not even a bad thing to rediscuss something whether it be a theory quote scene etc my issue is for example the week after brans vision where he saw the mad king screaming burn them all literally every hour someone was reposting the new theory that bran drove the mad king insane like he did hodor it was absolutely ridiculous all u had to do was click new and youd see them being constantly reposted
gameofthrones,not_removed,again i dont disagree with you but i dont think were talking about the same thing anymore

gameofthrones,not_removed,very few houses outside of the great houses and northern houses have actually been shown on tv with limited time left on the tv show i dont actually expect to see much on this im guessing its assumed all houses in dorne and the reach will follow their their liege lords having said that we have seen the tarlys they could figure into the mix somehow
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think show will go to detail on that but i think once she sets foot on stormlands and takes a few castles the houses in stormlands would bowrally to her as they dont have much force to resist and have no investment to the lannister dynasty in kings landing some crownland houses may rally to her as they were always targaryen loyalists and although worked well with robert they have grudge against lannisters however i doubt any of these will ever be mentioned in the show they have never went on to establish these houses or their relationships i think the matter will summarized as the houses who were defeated by dany or saw her force bowed to her etc
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not sure i just know that dany doesnt really need any more support to take over she has dragons and countless men fighting for her already
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think that by the end of season it will be dakingindanorfdamadahofdragons vs cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,the north wont pick a sidejon will try and stop the white walkers unless littlefinger convinces sansa to ride south with the knights of the vale as for the others the stormlands the westerlands and the rest of the greyjoysprobably support cercei that doesnt leave much as there arent a lot of the minor houses given screentime on the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,i doubt much of anyone will who hasnt already the freys might why would they stick with the obvious underdog dany vs the north is still a wildcard in my book but in the south it looks like pretty much everyone vs cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres really nobody unaffiliated at this point team cersei the westerlands the crowlands and the riverlands de jure team dany dorne the reach and iron islands asha affiliated team jonsa the north and the vale unaffiliated the iron islands euron affiliated will probably declare for cersei if only out of necessity the riverlands and the stormlands are both de facto leaderless and will most likely abide by the final outcomes rather than become directly involved
gameofthrones,not_removed,euron greyjoy will support no one except euron greyjoy why would the storm lords side with cersei they hate the lannisters
gameofthrones,not_removed,huh good point didnt think about that tarlys declare for jon lol i dont think randyll has an option hed like to take
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh come on i dont like the guy but he has a lot of respect for his wifes wishes allows her to speak pretty harshly to him and is pretty lenient with his mouthy daughter i dont think his assholishness extends to hardcore patriarchal behavior
gameofthrones,not_removed,its possible he could ally with cersei only to betray her i still dont expect him to win against dany though is there still a royal fleet in kings landing it wasnt used in blackwater only one ship dumped wildfire euron could use those ships
gameofthrones,not_removed,euron might only support himself but that doesnt mean that he cannot ally people to further his own goal he will find out about daenarys allying with his enemiesyara and theonand then he will probably ally with daenarys enemy cercei he is not dumb enough to fight alone against such a powerful foe as for the stormlands youre probably right i was just thinking that now when cercei can appoint a new lord paramount she will appoint someone more friendly to the lannisters and as the smaller lords in westeros havent had much screentime they would just make them follow their liege lord but as stated above in another comment by useinara the stormlands will probably just support dany when she lands there as they do not like the lannisters and do not have forces to put up a fight
gameofthrones,not_removed,the lannisters inherited house baratheon after tommens death since jaime and tyrion were unavailable cersei rules house baratheon now of course a ton of them will desert anyway but she does have a strong case
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think tarly went to war when the queen of thorns called the banners so hes already rolling with dany
gameofthrones,not_removed,well since randyll fought for the targaryens in the rebeillion with mace tyrell i think he might side with dany
gameofthrones,not_removed,storms end didnt side with the lannisters during the war of five kings and thats when they still had tywin lannister and supposedly roberts son id be very surprised if they side with them now itd be really cool if they allied with euron though
gameofthrones,not_removed,my belief is that randyll will be named warden of the south and will fight for cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,well im talking relatively thats a pretty standard sentiment for westeros unfortunately im sure there are lots of men and women who feel this way about gender roles who nonetheless are siding with either dany or cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,and if that is where euron dies i am the storm falling at storms end
gameofthrones,not_removed,well someone has to side with her or its going to be a very one sided war
gameofthrones,not_removed,he doesnt strike me as an oathbreaker
gameofthrones,not_removed,now thats a great suggestion considering the limited amount of options marriage wise for dany
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed
gameofthrones,not_removed,im guessing euron will make some kind of pact with cercei to further his own goals of course
gameofthrones,not_removed,strange things are afoot bro its the perfect time for randyll to seize an opportunity considering house tyrell is on the verge of extinction
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh i dont know i think for tarly theres only bad choices left all stuff he hates choose one or more oath breaking fighting for another woman fighting for a bastard
gameofthrones,not_removed,if it happens its a death sentence there is no hell way the show will end with dany married to dickon
gameofthrones,not_removed,yet its been shown he despises weakness and thats exactly what cerseis position is weak dany has the numbers the dragons with all of the reach and dorne backing her he doesnt strike me as an oathbreaker or someone whod sign up for a suicide pact hes harsh but also pragmatic
gameofthrones,not_removed,it just makes sense to me the title of wots was largely ceremonial after the dornish joined the kingdoms during the reign of king daeron ii dorne is in open rebellion against the crown once again cersei offering randyll tarly the title would somewhat mirror what tywin did with the boltons in the north we all know cersei wants to emulate tywin she even fuckin looks like him lol i may be wrong and thats half the fun but i think this is exactly where were headed
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was just rereading agot yesterday and for the first time paid attention to the kings landing nightmares too i like how you presented it too
gameofthrones,not_removed,they definitely have the budget now after that finale
gameofthrones,not_removed,k
gameofthrones,not_removed,lets get ready for jaime to fulfill like a dozen prophecies right cercei needs to die to a younger sibling hes the younger twin the sword of fire in the lord of light legends is created by plunging a valaryan steel sword into the heart of your lover the sword of fire will be widows wail created from ice a sword of ice and fire all on board for jaime being the true hero of this story
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really hope there will be a huge naval battle between euron and dany i also want some damn ice spiders theyve been mentioned a few times already so id be a little let down if they never show up also cleganebowl i still believe dammit
gameofthrones,not_removed,im interested to see if jon and dany will finally meet theyre the two biggest characters and i feel like season is when they meet
gameofthrones,not_removed,wall going down sack of kings landing
gameofthrones,not_removed,to me its all about dany vs cersei the battle for kings landing will be the most exciting thing to happen on the shot yet
gameofthrones,not_removed,clegane bowl hype
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wish u were right that would have given us eps but i sadly see it being as short as toj but i look forward to harrenhall the most jon and tyrion seeing each other again and yes i want to see old nan winter people freezing to death starving eating each other haha
gameofthrones,not_removed,you forgot littlefinger who i feel will remain in the thick of things at least in season and we will get to see how he plots against jon possibly with sansa in tow sansa seems to developed shades of grey to her character and that stare that we saw at the end of in the last season is a clear pointer to that so sansas and littlefingers moves would be equally fascinating to watch
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think more things will happen the end of the lannisters cersei and jaime not tyrion the wall falling or the army of the dead otherwise passing through it and the end of the nights watch daenerys entering the red keep and finding the empty iron throne aryas riverlands reunions which i think will come before she goes to winterfell nymeria hound melisandre
gameofthrones,not_removed,i want to see if dany will take the path of light or darkness on the one hand she was pretty good as long as there was tyrion barry or lord friendzone nearby on the other hand she went full mad queen anytime they were not i want to know if she learned her lesson and will be diplomatic and fair even without her consultants nearby or if she will eventually break with the reasonable ones tyrion jorah probably yara and theon and listen to the crazy ones bad poooohhhhseees olenna after loosing her family edit i had an idea right now for what could happen dany takes kl without problems like it is to be expected but wants to be the fair ruler so she grants cersei a fair trial trial by combat mountain kills greyworm this leaves two possibilities for her no preference from my side she or olenna or missandei or ellaria kills cersei anyway which leads tyrion affection for jon yara and theon theons friendship with sansa to walk over to the north she sets cersei free which leads to olenna missandei ellaria and the unsullied going mad and switch sides to euron i just feel that something like this has to happen because team dany is simply way too op and any battle with her forces involved including against the ww will be over too quickly
gameofthrones,not_removed,how is there no cleganebowl hype
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think we will see sansa step into the game she has kind of been a pawn so far but imo i know there are other opinions on this sansas look at littlefinger indicated that she had to play the game and that overwhelmed her not that she was jealous so sansa vs lf will be what i look forward to seeing also how the the mark of the nk plays into bran crossing the wall and greenseeing
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wanna see how the remaining part of the prophecy cersie received comes true the whole little brother killing her part
gameofthrones,not_removed,the dissolution of the nights watch whether is season or itll have to happen because a the wall will fall and their already meandering purpose will be obviated and b jon needs relieved of his vows so that he can become king of the north once sam finds robbs letter which probably legitimizes jon at the citadel which is where is likely is
gameofthrones,not_removed,showing us highgarden might be pointless unless they mean to show us tyrell v tarly but the rock id say were likely to see or at least hear of it numerous times by euroncerseidany daario had mentioned that perhaps his second sons should strike from the west taking over casterly rock while dany hits kings landing this is a solid plan and this does not require daario to execute it just a willing participant if dany hears of the king in the north then she will probably attempt to subdue the entire southern region first w iron islands that includes the rock euron could also attempt to sack the rock we werent shown dragonbinder and we dont have victarion in the show his reign is uncontested and aside from potential conflictalliance between danyjoncersei and building ships he doesnt seem to be doing much with kevan and tywin dead if jaime and cersei stays in kings landing just to bicker with one another casterly rock would be ripe for pillaging with no one left to defend it cersei may send jaime to the rock so he may assemble more troops from the lords of westerlands jaime certainly did not look like he was in full support of cersei by the end of season so we will just have to see where this will go but its not hard to see that jaime may just leave kings landing instead of killing her and fulfilling the valonqar prophecy
gameofthrones,not_removed,probably not likely but i want the mountain to run into drogon one of the classic stories is the good knight vs the evil dragon i would love to see the good dragon vs the evil knight
gameofthrones,not_removed,find a document legitimizing jon i wonder if the letter robb wrote will ever be brought up again either in books or show and whether or not itll play an important part in the show since we already know hes a starktarg would it even make any difference in the book can jon be called dakingindanorf because of that letter instead of something similar to lyannas speech and the events of the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,fingers crossed for an awkward tyrionsansa reunion
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow that actually makes a ton of sense and ive never thought of it that way would be quite the fucking twist i like it wish i could up vote this more
gameofthrones,not_removed,more like joffreys sword being the true hero of the story what a twist
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes a tyriondany and cerseijaime parlay
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel that if they meet in season seven it wont be until the very end
gameofthrones,not_removed,shades of jean grey
gameofthrones,not_removed,you think the wall can come down before jon and dany get married thats my whole thing is i dont know how they can hold all this back at the wall once the wall comes down i dont know how it wont be mad chaos and non stop war
gameofthrones,not_removed,why would yara theon missandei and the unsullied care what happens to cersei and why tf would missandei and the unsullied switch sides to euron if dany sets cersei free oo
gameofthrones,not_removed,when you think about it the mountain is like the chekovs gun of these last few seasons its gotta be used anytime now
gameofthrones,not_removed,cleganedark sister blowl ha i really want it to be arya and hound vs mountain
gameofthrones,not_removed,robb never wrote a letter in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think the word parlay is in cerseis vocabulary
gameofthrones,not_removed,that would be a good episode event episode the wall falls
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it will be the last thing in the season
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think you mixed up something missandei would stay in case one tyrion yara and theon would switch because theyd view her as a monster for killing someone who is supposed to be set free in second case because cerseis monster fucking killed greyworm missandeis lover if he could and the unsullieds leader
gameofthrones,not_removed,arya and the hound vs cersei and the mountain tag team cage match
gameofthrones,not_removed,hahah right a girl can dream but im going with dream bronnjaime
gameofthrones,not_removed,she is going to burn anyone who are feets away from the red keep at that point
gameofthrones,not_removed,season seven only has seven episodes and the wall falling wont take an entire episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wonder if it will be a big battle with edd at the helm and why jon wouldnt go to the wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,if it was a fair fight then why would they betray dany yes they would feel bad about gw dying but bad enough to leave her for trying to uphold the customs and traditions of her homeland seems like a stretch to me
gameofthrones,not_removed,and if the concession stands sell chickens thats a legend in the making
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah my bad just so used to episodes so dany and jon meet in episode the wall falls in episode and i didnt say the wall falling would take an entire episode just that that would be the big event in the finale though i imagine well get a lot of big moments in the finale
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the final battle will be at winterfell where it all began
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is already well estabished that they are lets put it lightly not too keen on traditions and it is obvious that missandei loves gw ellaria just to give an example killed the prince of dorne because he didnt avenge oberyn after he died in a fair fight
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh i love that idea i dont know if u read the books but the lore of winterfell makes you wonder how tied to all this that place really is although i do want to see the wigts invading other places
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive read all the books as they were published but its been so long ive forgotten a great deal
gameofthrones,not_removed,what if the same magic that is in the wall is in winterfell as well that is why there is a separate wall around the tree there bran can use the tree without endangering everyone inside
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats a cool idea and totally feesable that it is protected bran the builder was said to help build many castles if him being a stark is true then his home would be logical step always be a stark and winterfell would be great to tie in
gameofthrones,not_removed,oberyn and tyrion in the black cells
gameofthrones,not_removed,pretty much every one on one between varys and littlefinger
gameofthrones,not_removed,robert and cersei in season or tyrion and jaime while he was undergoing his trial
gameofthrones,not_removed,any interactions between nedrobb and jaime are always pretty rewarding also robb and greatjons arguments the greatjon only meant to cut my meat for me and call me boy again legend
gameofthrones,not_removed,the scene between brienne and jaime in the baths of harrenhall where he confess why he killed the mad king its just so intense and show us a side of him that we didnt see before
gameofthrones,not_removed,tywin and jaime tywin and olenna tywin and oberyn tywin and pycelle season deleted scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,the hounds chicken talk and jaime and briennes later conversations
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned and arya we mustnt fight a war amongst ourselves
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon and mance in castle black jon i think youre making a terrible mistake mance the freedom to make my own mistakes was all i ever wanted
gameofthrones,not_removed,robert and cersei in season think that is one of the most underrated scenes in the series when cersei talks about lyanna stark the way she describes it is beautiful in my opinion lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,particular conversation yoren telling arya the story about willem general dialogue from a particular character the hound bronn runner up
gameofthrones,not_removed,all cersei and ollenas one on ones were always great i hope to see a final one on one spat between the two if the tyrells and lannisters end up in opposition
gameofthrones,not_removed,arya and tywin so much witty banter
gameofthrones,not_removed,any dialog any character has with bronn is usually gold also many of tywins discussions show his brilliant mind and the way he worksthinks
gameofthrones,not_removed,iirc this conversation is on the talk between catelyn and robs wife about her struggles with jon snow
gameofthrones,not_removed,any scene where jaime and brienne are talking to each other
gameofthrones,not_removed,came here to say this this one scene captures oberyns heart and personality all at once it also sheds a lot of light onto the pain and humiliation tyrion has endured throughout his life other than the obvious my favorite scene of the series much less just one on one conversation
gameofthrones,not_removed,im sending one of your cusins down to kings landing with my peace terms you think my father is going to negotiate with you you dont know him very well no but he is starting to know meh

gameofthrones,not_removed,the disastrous afocadwd i beg your pardon how so because theyre split up
gameofthrones,not_removed,or he could just finish the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,just let brandon sanderson do it that guy delivers
gameofthrones,not_removed,they were horribly boring and badly edited
gameofthrones,not_removed,lets not go crazy now
gameofthrones,not_removed,badly edited so far i disagree i couldve agreed with you if you were somewhat joking that they were a disaster because they were to short
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean thats a neat box set and all but whats the plan when the next two books come out
gameofthrones,not_removed,beautiful
gameofthrones,not_removed,these look great but theyre just sosmall
gameofthrones,not_removed,was thinking of getting this too but then i find that there is no guarantee that the next few books would match this style
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh cool i saw this in barnes and nobles the other day but i didnt buy it yet
gameofthrones,not_removed,i let someone borrow my set years ago and havent seen it since these are very visually appealing is this your first time reading them
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh my days that makes me happy where did you get them from
gameofthrones,not_removed,my girlfriend got me the same collection last year
gameofthrones,not_removed,where are the last two i think you got ripped off man
gameofthrones,not_removed,how beautiful
gameofthrones,not_removed,good on you op butthose look so bigunwieldy really i have the series on kindleand despite not being able to easily look at maps now and then ive loved reading and rereading the series that way
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like how asos is purple wonder if thats intentional
gameofthrones,not_removed,everybody dies except for me you know why because i had my tray table up and my seat put back to its full upright position
gameofthrones,not_removed,implying theyll ever come out
gameofthrones,not_removed,i had a friend who had a box set of of the hps when we were all already aware that there would be i asked him why he had a box set of an incomplete series his mom yelled from the other room because they were free leave him alone
gameofthrones,not_removed,i sold all of my bluray seasons for exactly that reason i would rather have a nice box set for the entire series i will do the same with the books ifwhen they get finished
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats why i dont buy those collections maybe when its done
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have this same set which i bought on sale for as far as im concerned having the books in a nice looking set on hand over the next years at least until the series is finished is more than worth having to repurchase them later in a complete matching set think of it like this if it takes years for the full set to come out for me at least thats or or thats more than reasonable for a book rental with unlimited usage for whatever i want and then i can recoup a good portion if i resell them at that time as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,im probably going to rebuy the series so that they all match
gameofthrones,not_removed,put them at the end of the line what a stupid question
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have the same set and they look and feel like tiny bibles i often have people ask what book im reading and when i tell them what it is they look really let down and confused because they wanted to have some bible talk with me
gameofthrones,not_removed,my brother got me the set as a birthday present and i actually like the size its a good size to hold with one hand comfortably
gameofthrones,not_removed,wait for the series to be finished
gameofthrones,not_removed,yup
gameofthrones,not_removed,i got them from here
gameofthrones,not_removed,is a link to where you can get them ive had this link bookmarked for at least a year now but like some people have said im trying to wait until the final books come out to buy a decorative set such as this
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive been thinking for a while now that grrm is waiting to see how the ending of the show is received if it is less than or equal to meh he will just take his money and run edit i mean waddle
gameofthrones,not_removed,as the wife of a writer i think all the pressure on grrm to write an ending worthy of the following the show has garnered would be absolutely paralyzing dead stop hed have to not care at all and he obviously does
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean surely there would be somebody in the world who wants the box set from every point in a series history
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is the biggest reason i dont own the force awakens as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i though the same thing when star wars came out finally i can buy some coollooking set with all movies joke is on me
gameofthrones,not_removed,hahahahahahaha it will be finished
gameofthrones,not_removed,yay have fun dont throw your books too hard
gameofthrones,not_removed,theyre beautiful books though right theyre definitely going on the birthday wish list
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought his own idea was queue meme you dont have to write the end of asoif if you die first or even you cant dissapoint people with how you end asoif if you die before you can finish it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think thats it i believe he had a story a truly great one but the show crushed it not in the sense that the show is better but the show gathered a following nobody ever expected and it gave the books a popularity it quite frankly would never have seen without the adaption being so big then along with all the new readers it became a very popular thing to theorize about the future of the series he himself said he stopped reading fan predictions because of something like if they say this happens then i cant actually right that in like i planned because he said it that may be a drastic paraphrase but nonetheless id imagine the point stands he started a story that has gotten way beyond his reach and he is absolutely terrified to finish it like when is the last time the release of a book has been as big a deal as winds of winter maybe deathly hallows but even then it absolutely pales in comparison to the following of winds as palindrome has stated im way off on this and my sphere of opinionsinformation is pretty warped compared to what i knew of the potter releases now for the riskiest part of the comment i am fine with him not finishing it he gave us the world he gave us most of the story he has no true obligation to finish the series for us we did not pay him for an entire series of course its truly heartbreaking that he may never finish it but after what he has given me personally id rather he admit his plans to not finish the series and move on to something that will make him happy rather than aching and stressing over a story that because of the fanbase already has hundredsthousands of endings one of them has to be his and because its already out there somewhere i dont imagine hed ever be happy putting his own words to it
gameofthrones,not_removed,can you have a box set with just one book
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have the special edition vhs box set phantom menace vhs individual prequel dvds original trilogy dvd box set original edition original trilogy individual dvds episodes ivi bluray box set and episode vii bluray
gameofthrones,not_removed,even if grrm doesnt get to i bet brandon sanderson will finish it for him
gameofthrones,not_removed,grrm was slowing down significantly long before the show deal was even signed
gameofthrones,not_removed,i still have my to kill a mockingbird box set
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have a complete collection of every boxed set released before the first book came out
gameofthrones,not_removed,okay my bad then i guess the frequenting websitesforums can make it appear like the appeal is bigger than those of the potter books which were of course before this massagreement to share all thoughts and opinions online i was wrong ill stand by the rest of my point though
gameofthrones,not_removed,no worries i sell books for a living so im probably more aware of this sort of thing than most people winds will probably be the biggest book of the season it ships its unlikely to see hallows sales velocity because it basically excludes the entire ya market which is very lucrative

gameofthrones,not_removed,congrats on your dating of carice van houten
gameofthrones,not_removed,you cant just post a picture of mel and claim its a costume thats cheating
gameofthrones,not_removed,if your gf starts preaching about the lord of light is never cold and regularly burns humans then id start travelling north of you know what i mean
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow is your girlfriend single
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is not a picture of carice as mel it is actually my gf and yes she looks an insane amount like her
gameofthrones,not_removed,i came to the comments just to make sure that this wasnt just a joke thats uncanny i thought it was just a picture of mel
gameofthrones,not_removed,welcome to the sub guy pearce
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow even got the pose and downward smirk nice work
gameofthrones,not_removed,you lucky bastard
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean wtf this is seriously not carice van houten couldnt imagine waking up and realizing my gf looked like season sansa
gameofthrones,not_removed,uncanny and the costume is very well done do you have a picture in which the necklace is more visible is such a cool item to pass overlooked
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats cool but when she takes that necklace off tho
gameofthrones,not_removed,amazing
gameofthrones,not_removed,best got costume yet
gameofthrones,not_removed,hey guy just wanted to post and say i thought you were great in la confidential
gameofthrones,not_removed,they probably have some crazy roleplaying sessions
gameofthrones,not_removed,have you seen her without the necklace
gameofthrones,not_removed,with leeches and everything
gameofthrones,not_removed,that is the first thing i thought of like man imagine your gf just keeping the wig on and everything
gameofthrones,not_removed,she always seemed really self conscious about taking it off so eventually i stopped asking questions im sure its fine
gameofthrones,not_removed,asking the important questions here
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre right not the best in those regards but the closest to the real thing ive seen
gameofthrones,not_removed,weve been known to get prettyfired up
gameofthrones,not_removed,perception is reality friend stay the course
gameofthrones,not_removed,b they were not all killed in the fire and specifically pyat pree and three of the other warlocks went after dany they took a ship to pentos but euron raided that ship and captured them before he sailed back to the iron islands euron later tells his brother victarion whos not in the show that the warlocks told him informationstories but when one of the warlocks threatened euron he killed him and fed him to the other three thats the last mention of them so its assumed the last three warlocks looking for dany are all eurons chained prisoners at the iron islands i suspect with the way the shows written off a lot of the other plots the warlocks arent going to be mentioned again
gameofthrones,not_removed,i might be crazy but i seem to remember them all dying horribly
gameofthrones,not_removed,this submission was removed for the reasons listed below events that make changes to people places and things established at the start of the main story those are spoilers origin theory formulas like abc that rgameofthroneswtheories cant be in titles either please review the subreddits rgameofthroneswpostingpolicy and rgameofthroneswspoilerguide to better understand the content scope if you have a question or concern about this action please
gameofthrones,not_removed,book euron sounds like a badass that really made me want to read the books everything seems so much more fleshed out and deep i mean fuck
gameofthrones,not_removed,sweet thanks ive only gotten to the tv series so far
gameofthrones,not_removed,when she burned pyat pree in the house of the undying he came back in the next season did they ever reference them after that
gameofthrones,not_removed,the books definitely have a lot more depth i recommend them all the time it doesnt matter if youve watched the show or not the books are still fun to read even if you know some of the major spoilers its why people reread them too
gameofthrones,not_removed,hmm not that i know of also what about that weirdo female in the mask that used to show up periodically has she ever appeared since that time in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,quaithe i think she only had two appearances but we might get another soon g some people think jorah is going to look for her because he saw her drawing some kind of protection thing on a guy who was about to travel through old valeria where the stone men are
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was thinking about her too no clue though
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you i could not for the life of me remember her name
gameofthrones,not_removed,a viewer might think the writers dropped the ball
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha whoosh
gameofthrones,not_removed,i basically agree ahead of the premiere euron was a character who was really hyped up to play a major role going forward but for better or worse the showrunners dont seem too invested in him thus far his role in the larger showverse narrative has been knocking off balon which pretty much falls under the umbrella of housekeeping since he had already died in books some time earlier relatively speaking and acting as a catalyst for yara asha and theons big move plant the idea of allying with daenerys in their heads and send them on their way theon has been a major character since quite literally the first episode and although yara hasnt been nearly so prominent they do seem interested in exploring this unlikely dynamic between her and daenerys if i had to guess id say that euron and theon end up fighting at some point in if theon diessacrifices himself for yaras benefit its a decent way to cap off his redemption arc and likely prompts yara to seek vengeance if theon fights euron and survives then perhaps thats what gives him the confidence and the drive to become the sort of cocommander to yara the way she clearly wants him to be
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hate constantly bringing up the books and comparing it to the tv show but euron really is a more intimating villian in the books who is probably just as hateable as joffrey and ramsay but only because there are no constraints in the books and there is plenty of time to characterize him and tell his story in the books he kills a lot of characters brags about the reaving hes done and makes several cunning decisions hes also conquering parts of high garden right now in the tv show his character is so abridged that he doesnt really have an impact side note in the books he does get the boats but its mostly through stealing and consolidation of the iron fleet
gameofthrones,not_removed,im slightly disappointed with show euron first he looks like a middleaged sodden alcoholic bum before his story ends i think it would be neat but unlikely if the writers found a way to show some sort of event that led to euron having to wear his eyepatch and drink shade of the evening you know so he could at least look the part before his fate is met
gameofthrones,not_removed,honestly with only episodes left i could really care less about euron and i hope they dont drag what precious time left we have with a character that isnt really gonna go anywhere
gameofthrones,not_removed,krakenex machina
gameofthrones,not_removed,shows up w his fleet in his valyrian steel armor theon fights him one on one and jumps while hugging him letting the weight of eurons own armor drown him theon is stabbed in the gut while jumping in to the sea theon is assumed dead and so is euron as they cant find their bodies yara manages to consolidate rest of greyjoy fleets including the new ones that euron had built end of
gameofthrones,not_removed,not gonna lie seeing euron summon a kraken from the ocean to damage danys fleet would be sick
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah euron has like ships tops
gameofthrones,not_removed,a cerseieuron marriage only seems fitting yeah
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the ship thing is to rally the ironborn so that they could return to their past glory as westeross maritime power they will likely get around ships at most
gameofthrones,not_removed,so far cersei is the main human villain and she has no power resources or allies jamie hasnt explored the arc of being pushed aside in favor of uncouth and less worthy men there is an opportunity to fold euron into that story knock out several character beats in a condensed way and grant the character legitimacy and relevance against the main characters
gameofthrones,not_removed,cthulhu fthagn ia ia cthulhu fthagn
gameofthrones,not_removed,im pretty hyped for euron i do think hes going to turn out to have the dragon binding horn in season
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the problem youve got with the points about not enough trees and manpower is that youre using logic and that is just something dd have got no time for
gameofthrones,not_removed,think of this cersei doesnt have a fleet anymore the royal fleet was taken by stannis and destroyed the redwyne fleet is in rebellion the iron fleet is under danys control euron has the one thing cersei needs the most a fleet
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not signed onto it but i kinda like the theory that dragonbinder is in a vault with other antidragon measures in the citadel basement
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah euron is set to fuck shit up in the books but its difficult for me to see him doing much of consequence in the series a shame but true
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah but i feel like this will be different the battle wont only be euron vs dany it will be greyjoy vs greyjoy which is a theme i could see playing a big role in the plot also with the troops and dragons she has now dany would roll right over any opposing westerosi forces including the north if she wanted to youd have to think shell lose some of her army before she attacks kings landing otherwise it would just be a slaughter i predict euron will thin out her army dragon horn maybe and i could see some major characters not making it through the battle a greyjoy or two missandei greyworm maybe a dragon hopefully the sand snakes etc
gameofthrones,not_removed,how does he get boats it still seems like a bit much
gameofthrones,not_removed,mellisande you really confused me with this i was like whats mel doing with daenerys you mean missandai or something similar to that lol idk the spelling i know the name though
gameofthrones,not_removed,of course its going to be a cakewalk she has an army capable of giving robert baratheon a decent fight and he had orders of magnitude more troops available than cersei does now i agree with you that eurons going to be used as smoke and mirrors so that danys invasion isnt quite as boring but numerically its a cakewalk even if she loses a dragon she has two more
gameofthrones,not_removed,couldnt care less
gameofthrones,not_removed,its mostly through stealing and consolidation of the iron fleet
gameofthrones,not_removed,martin has never been good with numbers like heights weights quantities etc
gameofthrones,not_removed,very stannisy of you
gameofthrones,not_removed,a storm taking out a ton of characters would just seem incredibly cheap especially since we havent seen any storms on the countless voyages characters have made across the narrow sea yet
gameofthrones,not_removed,what do you mean by consolidation
gameofthrones,not_removed,too many confusing names in general wth is daenarys i spell it differently every time lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,missandei
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is a duplicate scene in episode season bran promises to his mother but she calls him out for lying it isnt done in an aggressive manner though
gameofthrones,not_removed,aw shit good catch if its true
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a nice comparison but unless the book could tie it together better i think it was just a coincidence its funny though i am on one too just watched that episode and somehow it didnt register at all
gameofthrones,not_removed,cool catch its also interesting that in both cases the demanded promise isnt made i dont believe ned actually told lyanna that hed keep jon safe at least not in the flashback we saw and while bran promised not to climb in the first episode catelyn immediately called it out as a lie because he had just looked at his feet
gameofthrones,not_removed,not sure why but that scene freaks me out
gameofthrones,not_removed,interesting how the title is now his watch has ended
gameofthrones,not_removed,brans storyline is one of my favorites i thought he was the main character for a while well as main as it gets i was upset when he wasnt in season their gang is great
gameofthrones,not_removed,woah
gameofthrones,not_removed,im pretty sure neds promised is implied and simply not shown on screen
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned makes the promise in the books bran also makes a promise since he utters the literal words to do so he just should have kept it like his father did
gameofthrones,not_removed,just before ned is beheaded im pretty sure he mutters i kept my promise neds definitely made that promise it just wasnt shown in the toj scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree but thats clear to us as outside viewers but to a woman dying of blood loss it may not be so clear i also would have preferred at least a whispered response the scene isnt ruined for me but its not clear that lyanna knew she had the proper assurances from ned before dying but the more sensible assumption is the nobility of ned thats something his sister would he aware of intensely if the general populace was aware of it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree that we should assume he does based on his reputation as an honorable man and the fact that it is his beloved sister whos asking still its missing i would have thought hed reassure her immediately dont want her to die while fearing for her newborns safety but i guess his hesitancy speaks to the weight he places on vows
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just finished the episode where ned is beheaded and i cant remember him saying anything if he did say that then it was probably a reference of him promising to admit treason and bend the knee to joffery
gameofthrones,not_removed,didnt he nod while holding jon
gameofthrones,not_removed,you have to listen closely but you can hear it and you can see its pretty faint but im sure he says it
gameofthrones,not_removed,pretty sure he just looks down at ned onwards
gameofthrones,not_removed,perhaps he was actually looking at his feet
gameofthrones,not_removed,im going to miss that creepy music they would play whenever they changed over to her tho
gameofthrones,not_removed,arya has very little chance of beating the waif
gameofthrones,not_removed,well they havent gotten rid of it yet we still need to see the resolution but yeah i think its safe to say there wont be any more montages of arya getting whacked by sticks im not sure i could bear another one of those

gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree but i think the kings landing thing is misinterpreted i think it symbolizes how close she will be to sitting on it but the wall is calling her attention
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree about danerys stormborn dying fighting the wws and nk beyond the wall danerys will turn from what she wants the iron throne to confront the real danger she doesnt bring democracy she doesnt really know what that is she simply wants to eliminate slavery and create a society that has a political system that doesnt eat itself alive by eliminating the great houses as competitors for the throne dividing the society between the queen and the people the queen with the advice of the people ruling well and to the benefit of the people i dont know who will end up on the iron throne but i doubt it is jon stark king in the north he has no desire to rule the seven kingdoms
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont see danny sitting on the throne i honestly dont see there being a throne in the last episode of the series
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the vision of the iron throne sitting vacant in a barren red keep symbolizes the hollow nature of the game of thrones people strive to acquire it but there is nothing but death surrounding the throne it has no meaning and has nothing of substance to surround it she then goes to the wall where death and annihilation threatens all living things and finds that it is there where she can discover true values and purpose at the time she valued drogo and her lost son more than anything she mourned for them both so naturally the vision would show her that they would be beyond the wall and that she needed to go there to find something of value or purpose the throne itself is meaningless
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think snow will back her she dies jon snow stark will become king
gameofthrones,not_removed,and so snow takes the iron throne i can dig it
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres not going to be a throne dany brings democracy and then she goes north to die the warlock house gives it away imho as does her conversation with tyrion where she claims that she will break the wheel and finally her instructions upon breaking up with daario that the people of mereen will elect their own leaders after a time
gameofthrones,not_removed,it could also be about a change in her priorities so maybe it doesnt mean that she wont get the throne eventually just that she will prioritize the wall and the white walkers it would fit with what her story has been so far there have been numerous occasions where she had an opportunity to head towards westeros but she decided to solve a different and more immediate issue first
gameofthrones,not_removed,neither did ned desire it
gameofthrones,not_removed,no get over it
gameofthrones,not_removed,not going to happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,absolutely not it makes no sense for jon and sansa to marry for political reasons and surely not for love

gameofthrones,not_removed,ones tame ones wild ones in black the other kissed by fire
gameofthrones,not_removed,the girl in the background shes either miring or judging hard
gameofthrones,not_removed,halloween is like christmas for my eyes
gameofthrones,not_removed,not sure who is she playing
gameofthrones,not_removed,you could probably do a great yara greyjoy you look a lot like her admittedly that costume would take quite a bit more work
gameofthrones,not_removed,fucking awesome
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think that expression is pretty much saying what the fuck
gameofthrones,not_removed,girl in the background could easily pull off lyanna mormont
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,or
gameofthrones,not_removed,but she is wearing baratheon crown cercei would never do that
gameofthrones,not_removed,once bran crosses by the wall the magic that keeps the dead away will be removed allowing the army of the dead to pass i think the night king will simply shatter the wall after bran crosses or the night king has the horn of winter
gameofthrones,not_removed,for the tv itll obviously be because of brans mark maybe it was all a ploy the walkers sent the wights after bran to make him think they want him dead but they actually dont since stark blood has some qualities and since benjen is mostly dead perhaps the walkers are controlling him and made him save bran so bran would trust his uncle and never doubt of the walkers ploy then when he goes beyond the wall not knowing that his mark can let the walkers through everyones gonna follow and the wall will fall or maybe therell be something related to the horn of joramun
gameofthrones,not_removed,well there is a lot of what ifsid edmure had done as he was toldrobb would of trapped tywins host and possibly defeated it but most certainly have stopped them being able to take stannis in the rear basically fuck edmure
gameofthrones,not_removed,well it sounds like there would be a second siege except with the tyrelllannister forces trying to capture kings landing the whole story would turn out different since robb and renly would probably just defer to stannis
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the loyalty of the tyrells would certainly be up in the air renly is dead and their real alliance with the lanisters is that they get to put margaery on the throne as queen far more than revenge for renly do the lannisters siege kings landing probably do the tyrells help maybe theres probably some jockeying at this point regardless stannis likely calls on the north and riverlands to come to his aid it will take them a long time to march there though and their armies simply arent as big they may not want to face the lannisters head on if you remember although the show just breezes through it that robbs armies are fairly small especailly against the huge armies of the lannisters the crown and the tyrell army the stannis renly army was the largest or at least as large as the tyrells but probably better although now injured and depleted after taking kings landing at that point either the lannisters flee or they lift the siege and attack the northern army or get caught in the middle between kings landing and the army and get it from both sides although in a practical sense i wonder how receptive the people of kings landing will be to stanniss army after they just took over the place killed all the men and raped the women it might be a hell of a struggle just to keep order let alone being sieged by a large army outside your gates
gameofthrones,not_removed,execute the bastard children but keep cersei tyrion and jamie imprison becouse it adds up to your warscore
gameofthrones,not_removed,well id like to say he kills joffrey keeps tommen and myrcella as wards banishes cersei but hed probably be better off killing all of them to secure his reign with kl taken and tywin in the riverlands the tyrells are probably less likely to stick around since margery no longer has the im the queen prospect so either the lannister surrender or be surrounded on both sides
gameofthrones,not_removed,would have
gameofthrones,not_removed,upvote for fuck edmure
gameofthrones,not_removed,by the time the blackwater occurs renly is dead remember
gameofthrones,not_removed,aye gameplay wise that is the most sound way to go but stannis is not merciful i would fully expect everymost lannisters in kl to be dead by daylight if stannis had won at the black water
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea stannis isnt exactly the banish traitors type he would put every lannister to the sword no doubt id say cersei especially perhaps he would burn her every lannister includes young tommen and myrcella in stanniss eyes they are abonations born of incest who could only cause trouble for his reign stannis has shown time and time again he will do his duty no matter what and as king its his duty to keep the realm stable to do that he needs to eliminate his pretenders before they break the kings peace
gameofthrones,not_removed,right a man can dream that he did not die so soon in this alternate timeline right
gameofthrones,not_removed,i am not without mercy thundered he who was notoriously without mercy
gameofthrones,not_removed,only problem is the black water cant happen without renlys death thats how stannis got the troops to make his move on kl
gameofthrones,not_removed,the mannis hes the one true king
gameofthrones,not_removed,selfish spiteful cersei at her best strategy doesnt enter into it margaery is making herself popular with the people cersei doesnt give shits about them
gameofthrones,not_removed,marge was working on getting the people on her side with the people behind here she would have had leverage over joff and cersei that was her game cersei saw through her play and stopped it so she got no credit cersei even goes further in that plan by hiring the sparrows it is her way to strenghten her position and also get the people on her side through power rather than seduction of the small people that backfires in her face hardcore but that was the intent
gameofthrones,not_removed,let me answer with a quote aye queen you shall be until there comes another younger and more beautiful to cast you down and take all that you hold dear maggy the frog
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i think she is totally motivated by the prophecy and it is almost selffulfilling she had opportunities to have roberts babies and that would have broken the prophecy and yeah joffery died but tommen that one was on her she will probably be driven to kill tyrion and i hope someone else will stab her and leave her only enough time to say something like but you are not the valonquar or something like that totally tragic or in her last act of ensuring the prophecy comes to be selffulfilled she will beg jamie to take her life
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei will burn down the kingdom and rule over the ashes just as long as she has enough wine
gameofthrones,not_removed,and now that shes pissed off the reach there probably wont be wine in a while
gameofthrones,not_removed,jaime they stole my sweet roll
gameofthrones,not_removed,incredibly gifted wow
gameofthrones,not_removed,this submission was removed for the reasons listed below it is not ok to try to use the nsfw mark for spoilers here it does not provide good protection please review the subreddits rgameofthroneswpostingpolicy and rgameofthroneswspoilerguide to better understand the content scope if you have a question or concern about this action please
gameofthrones,not_removed,i used to be an adventurer like you
gameofthrones,not_removed,jaime was bluffing when he said that jaime by all rights tried to appeal to edmure in other ways you will be treated better now that im here i can arrange a meet up with your wife and son i knew your sister im sorry about what happened but we are at war thats the way it is and edmure doesnt hear it he repeatedly calls jaimie evil he calls him insane so jaime decides that if edmure wont listen to anything else then he will play the evil part he threatens edmure and guess what that works edmure listens to jaimes baby launching tirade and he believes that jaime will follow through so he capitulates for the sake of his family jaime knew edmure saw him as a horrible man so jaime decided to play a horrible man jaime never intended on actually murdering every tully in the world he made a promise to brienne that he would take riverrun without shedding any blood and he kept that promise except for the blackfish but there was nothing to be done about that
gameofthrones,not_removed,we dont have the benefit of jaimes internal monologue in the show but in the books its a completely empty threat which he makes with the intention of sparing the lives of all those who would surely die in a battle
gameofthrones,not_removed,uh yeah he was threatening but he did it to stop more unessisary bloodshed and to keep his oath to catelyn that scene also had a beautiful lighting deign half of jaimes face dark and the other in the light to stress how hes doing a bad thing but for a good reason hes changed a lot and im sure hell turn more and more in the next reason after what cersei has done
gameofthrones,not_removed,then i took a sword to the wrist
gameofthrones,not_removed,good analysis changes my view on that situation
gameofthrones,not_removed,too much magic can be dangerous maiq once had two spells and burned his sweetroll
gameofthrones,not_removed,the riverrun scenes show jaimes dilemma whenever he trys to act the good guy people blackfish edmure just scoff at him because he is the kingslayer and they dont believe him but the moment he makes a horrible threat edmure instantly believes every word jaime says
gameofthrones,not_removed,tears for fears mad world could be whole show but thought of bran and jon
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion
gameofthrones,not_removed,this reminds me of the nights watch replace mountain with wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,broken crown by mumford sons reminds me a lot of ned if you interpret it in a certain way
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,to take the black by the sword is about the nights watch and is very good also the metal album brothers of the night by seven kingdoms is fantastic and is about a song of ice and fire mostly the first two books and features songs like stormborn and blackwater rush
gameofthrones,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomresultssearchquerytoholmgardandbeyond for the ironborn lyrics are about sailing to unknown faraway lands seeking glory and adventure
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know its not super accurate but this song made me think of the nights watch for some reason
gameofthrones,not_removed,love it i definitely see what you mean
gameofthrones,not_removed,and now im hungry
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont worry you are not the only one dx
gameofthrones,not_removed,do you think the books will go in the same direction as the show no the books have a lot of differences that cant be resolved do you think the conclusion will be the same broad strokes yes details no
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think that both the show and the books will end the same way margaery tyrell will not make it to the end aegon whether he is a targaryen or a blackfyre will not be important they cut him from the show jon will be resurrected and will take winterfell dakingindanorf cercei will make something explode and become queen the three eyed crow will die and bran take its place and go south littlecreeper is a creep
gameofthrones,not_removed,if you look at where the book plotlines have left off compared to how those happened in the show its very different the best example is the current jon situation in the show it was some nights watch men who rose up because he let in wildlings its simple and doesnt need much context in the books the jon situation is completely different it was three nights watch men who stabbed him but at the same time so much shit is going on at the wall as well there is no way currently that jon will simply be resurrected travel south and attack winterfell and become king if he does become king itll be completely different
gameofthrones,not_removed,many things that happen in the show will happen in the box the way it occurs might be different but itll be the same however i think the books will go a different route from the show and that lots of things will be done differently
gameofthrones,not_removed,as david and dan said maybe the show and the book will have different roads from a to b but they will both get to b and end the same
gameofthrones,not_removed,i see it as a road trip taken by two different cars they may both start in new york and their destination is los angeles but eventually they will deviate paths but they will both end up in the same location both cars start in the same place are going generally the same direction west and will end up in the same place but the way they get there will be different
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the general story is going in the same direction but there will be little differences between the books and show
gameofthrones,not_removed,its raven not crow smh imma pull a unidan over here
gameofthrones,not_removed,should put a spoiler tag on the second point for people who have not read the books or havent reached adwd
gameofthrones,not_removed,this in the books jon was in the wrong and the mutiny can be seen as just he also has some rather disturbing dreams about cutting down starks which may not bode well for rickon the real kitn
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cant detect any sarcasm but no in the books he is called the three eyed crow both could be considered right though as the three eyed crow was a man of the nights watch the crows who before joining was called blood raven and was said to have eyes
gameofthrones,not_removed,why the everything tag seems to imply that everything could be spoiled
gameofthrones,not_removed,she wouldnt have known he was alive and does she even care that much
gameofthrones,not_removed,he is family if she knew he was there why do you think she wouldnt care
gameofthrones,not_removed,they were openly talking about him being there during the party
gameofthrones,not_removed,she probably never met him and considering how apathetic she was to her aunts death she probably didnt care about him on the other hand he was fucked over by the freys and she went there to kill some freys so maybe she could have saved him
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it was less that she was apathetic about her aunts death and more that she was aware of the gooddamn bitter irony in it
gameofthrones,not_removed,she would know from the celebration of taking riverrun
gameofthrones,not_removed,fuck im brainfarting right now but youre talking about caitlins sister right when did arya react the way she did to her death
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think its both honestly of course the laugh stemed from the absurdity of their situation but at the same time its quite obvious she doesnt care that her aunt died a few moments before that she even questions if she would pay for her because she never even met her
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes the one littlefinger throws through the moon door here is the scene one of my favorite arya scenes
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes thats it haha thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,cool idea probably not the edit i would have chosen the three characters are just walking to their thrones the slow simple beginning on piano would feel more appropriate
gameofthrones,not_removed,doesnt really fit at least not for that part of light of the seven
gameofthrones,not_removed,and i think the music cutting off when cersei breathes so you can really grasp the chill in the air wouldve been cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree with you on the beginning part its a little off but the ending is what was more important to me i mainly did it as someones request
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was going to do that but you get that in the original
gameofthrones,not_removed,i still love this edit and have shared it on all my social media accounts haha this definitely beats the modern music trailer

gameofthrones,not_removed,best stark wolf pumpkin ive seen yet anyone can use a stencil this is simple and original nice job
gameofthrones,not_removed,orson lannister smashing beetles for minutes straight
gameofthrones,not_removed,a story following httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpcorlysvelaryon on his voyages around the known world from qarth yi ti and the further east i think thatd be really cool but theres not really much source material to base stuff on so it seems unlikely i would also suggest a similar worldspanning story following euron greyjoy as he reaves his way from ib to asshai and even visits the ruins of valyria but the show seems to have made him far less impressive figure than the books so i cant see him doing all that in the show continuity
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpdanceofthedragons would make an excellent movie
gameofthrones,not_removed,arthur daynes campaign against the kingswood brotherhood
gameofthrones,not_removed,gendry lands in a village far away from the fighting he sets up shop as a blacksmith he takes on an apprentice who is clumsy he flirts with the bakers daughters one who is beautiful and distant and the other who is plain and friendly theres an old man in the village who he goes to for sage advice he solves mysteries
gameofthrones,not_removed,a movie that is solely focused on valyria i want to know more about that place specifically
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would like to see roberts rebellion it would be interesting to see why he did it and what happened during it it would have many battle of the bastards esq scenes and set up got quite well with hints and the like
gameofthrones,not_removed,an adventerous selfdiscovery film of oberyn travelling the world gaining all his maester chains and visiting all the different cities and cultures the world has to offer it would be a bit similar to batman travelling around the world to learn martial arts but less combatedfocused and more about discovery within about how perspective changes a person they could do a lot of cool stuff with this thematically
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wouldnt mind a show about salladhor saan and davos during their pirating days
gameofthrones,not_removed,a series documenting the history of yi ti all the way down to the bloodstone emperor
gameofthrones,not_removed,the dunk and egg series culminating with the fire in summerhall i read a really great theory that summerhall was actually a conspiracy between tywin and aerys to wipe out the old royal familyso aerys could eventually take power and so tywin could punish the tarbecks and the reynes without interference i like that theory and would love to see a young tywin
gameofthrones,not_removed,a trilogy telling the story of the war between the valyrian freehold against the rhoynar cities it covers a lot of time it would show us how the sorrows came to be and in the end we would get nymeria sailing with her people to westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,clunk clunk clunk
gameofthrones,not_removed,yesss i would love an indiana jones type adventure movie that goes to the mysterious locations we hear about like asshai or ulthos or yi ti good idea
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes but thats not really what im asking im asking more so like something oddly specific that youd like to see that you know probably will never get made like a tyrion and bronn buddy sex comedy
gameofthrones,not_removed,i want this just to see arthur dayne vs the smiling knight
gameofthrones,not_removed,davos was never a pirate just a smuggler
gameofthrones,not_removed,add pod the rod into that and youll get what ive been preaching since day one
gameofthrones,not_removed,you right
gameofthrones,not_removed,aerys imprisoned neds brother brandon for treason when he went to kings landing to challenge rhaegar to free lyanna rickard ned and brandons father went to kings landing to represent his son in trial by combat aerys chose fire as his champion and roasted rickard alive in his armor he also tied a cord around brandons neck and put a sword just out of reach so he strangled himself to death trying to reach the sword to cut himself and his father free after this aerys sent word to jon arryn at the eyrie where ned and robert were being fostered to send the boys to kings landing to resolve the dispute fool me once shame on me fool me twice shame on you they decided not to go and the three kingdoms of the storm lands the north and the vale revolted against the tyranny of aerys ii
gameofthrones,not_removed,we dont know if she told him anything before disappear and theres more on it than the kidnapping ned and lyannas older brother brandon stark went to kings landing to demand her back the king aerys ii targaryen the mad king imprisoned him then his father lord rickard stark go to demand all of them back with a trial by combat lord rickard then goes on full armor but the mad king declares that fire is the champion for house targaryen so lord stark is tied over a fire pit to help him the mad king brings brandon from the dungeons and put a rope on his neck and a sword ahead of him but out of his reach the more he tries to get the sword to help his father more he strangled himself after father and son died and both were lord stark so the king didnt kill an ordinary person the mad king ordered jon arryn who fostered both ned stark and robert baratheon to send him the head of the new lord stark ned and lyannas fiancé robert jon refuses and call his banners and enter in open rebellion against the king so we have the arryns the starks and the baratheons and later the tullys against the king at this point if lyanna was in love or not simply doesnt matter anymore it was bigger than that
gameofthrones,not_removed,not only did ned believe that she was kidnapped but the mad king killed brutally his farther and brother
gameofthrones,not_removed,his sister was abducted by a targaryen whose father then murdered neds father and brother the honourable thing would be to kill the targaryens ned has more of a reason to kill jon than robert does
gameofthrones,not_removed,robert was his best friend mad king killed his father and brother and loads of his friends and then demanded ned and roberts heads
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned was friends with robert since childhood as they both grew up in the vale under the tutelage of jon arryn their surrogate father when rhaegar stole roberts betrothed it launched a rebellious war which saw robert make an uneasy alliance with tywin lannister while robert was not keen on the lannisterswho is he realized that tywin brought money power and military might to the table tywin also despised the mad king so a union between the baratheons and lannisters was forged rather easily lyannas relationship with rhaegar is still somewhat of a mystery which the masses assume was a kidnapping and rape while ned learned the opposite as we all did in the last episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,cmon man do your research
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt it supposed to be fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me
gameofthrones,not_removed,why did aerys want robert dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont forget the riverlands
gameofthrones,not_removed,not really jon didnt do anything against the stark family the only ones he had reason to kill was aerys but jaime was there first the reason robert killed all targaryen children is because he fears that they may overthrow him because he is a usurper
gameofthrones,not_removed,cant get fooled again
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah it is insomnias a bitch
gameofthrones,not_removed,just because he was betrothed to lyanna aerys feared the same retribution from robert as brandon had tried it was just another of the batshit crazy tyrannical things aerys tried to do
gameofthrones,not_removed,robert also hates the targaryens because he thinks rhaegar was responsible for lyannas death or at least kidnapping and rape

gameofthrones,not_removed,heres a little more background on the issue at the time robb stark and catelyn were killed at the red wedding main character is dead in the books catelyn comes back as lady stoneheart not in the show but lore wise there is people coming back from the dead next we have mel seeing thoros revive beric using words of the red god that with melisandre coming back to the wall before stanniss battle had pretty big foundation on the idea that jon was going to get resurrected so in terms of people on reddit who pick out every detail on the show id say the majority of people believed we was going to come back alive as for the average watcher well maim characters do die and grrm known for not following your standard formula of story telling season ended in about the same place as a dance of dragons did in terms of the story at the wall so people didnt know what to expect season was uncharted territory where people didnt know what was going to happen so yes there were probably some people who thought jon snow was dead and might come back under the control of white walkers or something all in all most people were fairly certain jon does die and gets revived while a small portion did believe he was dead for good
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think a lot of normies did but people who are really into the series enough to go online and talk about it probably knew he was coming back
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is scene where sam is crying about gilly in season with eddpyp grenn and jon being around at the end edd says i will be dead for good not coming back something like that and then they all drink the alethe last focus was on jons face it seemed camera was pointing he is surely coming back
gameofthrones,not_removed,the show put out statements and interviews about him being dead for good they went so far as to make a huge deal about kit cutting his hair as proof from there fan and gossip hype ramped up
gameofthrones,not_removed,initially i was shell shocked but after i thought about it i realized grrm wouldnt kill jon that way not with his progression to lead the battle against the ww will jon die again maybe but i didnt really believe he was dead at the end of it all
gameofthrones,not_removed,i understood why he died but it was strange of him to die at such a crucial time in the series with the white walkers and bob
gameofthrones,not_removed,he did die
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes jon fuckin snow the title a song of ice and fire is about him never a doubt in my mind he was coming back
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it was to free his character from the nights watch hes needed elsewhere and it was a neat way to get around the sign for life clause
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know wise guy
gameofthrones,not_removed,godsdamnnit george youve got a book to write
gameofthrones,not_removed,i speculated about this on apples subreddit but figured id speculate here as well i know people theorize about the release of these books all the time so maybe the game gets old but with recent winds of winter rumors pointing to march and yes declined the timing on these digital releases is interesting game of thrones season will start in june or july right these books will be released through march theres a nice open period in aprilmay where game of thrones usually premieres which would be the perfect opportunity to release winds of winter could this potentially be one way to build anticipation towards that release btw – just downloaded the sample its a pretty nice layout as for everyone telling george to get writing im sure he has to sign off on things like this but really how much input did he have to provide that isnt already out there for someone else to package it up im sure his main focus is still on finishing winds
gameofthrones,not_removed,just finish the winds of winter please
gameofthrones,not_removed,every time i start to read the title of a post like this my heart leaps into my throat fearing that hes finally given up the ghost
gameofthrones,not_removed,interactive sotheyre gonna stab us in the middle of a chapter
gameofthrones,not_removed,ugh ill never give apple money
gameofthrones,not_removed,if this is anything like the harry potter enhanced editions im going to pass there was not as much interactive or interesting content maybe one image per chapter and some notes every few chapters ill try out the preview and see how it is
gameofthrones,not_removed,ffsjust finish the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is a video showing the enhanced edition httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvoogpihievmfeatureyoutube
gameofthrones,not_removed,that animation really makes me want to see an animated adaptation of the series maybe by some other studio some day i feel like it could be done much more true to the books if you dont have to worry about the logistics of staging a show in the actual real world with real people acting
gameofthrones,not_removed,this looks awesome i downloaded the sample but alas im broke lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,seriously though he knows he should be finished with it but keeps on doing little side projects like this what could he possibly be thinking
gameofthrones,not_removed,interesting take with the amount of money this franchise is making id be willing to bet that there is at least some method to their madness
gameofthrones,not_removed,also if hes going to make an interactive experience give the rights to someone like cd projekt red not someone like apple
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought he did finish because there was news a few months back that he sent it to get edited was that information wrong
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,what is read may never die or something like that
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is far more involved than the harry potter enhanced editions
gameofthrones,not_removed,the book that was released was game of thrones the others will be released later
gameofthrones,not_removed,give the guy a break hell finish it when he wants to do you honestly expect him to dedicate every moment to writing it
gameofthrones,not_removed,its interactive books though not really cdprs thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,what even is cd project red apple already makes a lot of interactive books like the harry potter ibooks whats the problem
gameofthrones,not_removed,this might be one of the dumbest things i have ever read on reddit
gameofthrones,not_removed,idk
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes it was wrong
gameofthrones,not_removed,well your title does say game of thrones books to be fair but i think that guy was being pedantic
gameofthrones,not_removed,of course not but it seems like hes been stalling on it for a while now you keep hearing about him doing this thing or that every week or two or traveling to some convention or something nothing much about his writing most people would have expected at least some hint of it being close to done by now right but we havent even got that it would just be nice to hear something like im halfway done ill probably be done by next september it just worries me that i havent heard anything specific about his progress sorry i know it sounds entitled i dont mean to be
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats what i mean though rather than making a half arsed experience they should have gone all out go big or go home yknow
gameofthrones,not_removed,cd projekt red are the developers of the witcher video game series these games were based off of several books
gameofthrones,not_removed,reddit doesnt like apple
gameofthrones,not_removed,you are on reddit and you dont know who they are literally the best game ever made
gameofthrones,not_removed,this might be one of the dumbest things i have ever read on reddit this might be one of the dumbest things i have ever read on reddit
gameofthrones,not_removed,wellllllllllllllllllllllll fingers crossed
gameofthrones,not_removed,heh i took the title directly from the article
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe something bad happened like his computer was destroyed when he was almost finished so hes not motivated to write it all again idk
gameofthrones,not_removed,not to mention the fact that the deadline has been pushed back several times
gameofthrones,not_removed,whats stopping them from doing both though apple publishes books cdpr does games theyre entirely separate industries ive looked at the sample its literally just the book with some fancy extras like admittedly nice artwork and a hotlinked glossary of characters im sure theres other stuff as well but thats all thats in the sample edit theres also occasionally a little crown you can tap on that gives some interesting insight into some things or a background of one of the houses with their sigil
gameofthrones,not_removed,well if that were the case i wouldnt blame him then again youd think hed have copies on multiple devices

gameofthrones,not_removed,its not like she just went and found a fully grown random dragon shes raised drogon since he hatched and had years and years to build a bond with him
gameofthrones,not_removed,you seem to forget that dany hatched them and they are already bonded to her especially drogon the other two dragon riders probably will have their bond time expedited for the show i expect it to be different for the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,dany somehow bonded to drogon in a matter of secondsminutes when the need arose except for the years that they were together bonding she raised him from birth she was literally the first person he saw when he hatched hes followed her commands on multiple occasions in the show its not like shes some random person that just found a fully grown dragon
gameofthrones,not_removed,to me its a balant deus ex machina and bad writing i was extremely disappointed
gameofthrones,not_removed,sure but the problem is that he was still behaving like a wild animal the last time they interacted he swoops down into the fighting pit because hes attracted to the commotion she climbs on his back and he dumps her in the middle of the dothraki sea despite days of her pleading to take her home drogon completely ignores her then fast forward a few weeks with no interaction between them and all of a sudden hes behaving like a trained dog it makes no sense
gameofthrones,not_removed,they definitely had a connection in meereen dany either called him to save her or she sensed he was coming and we dont know what she actually did when she was away or how long she was gone clearly long enough that daario got worried dany seems to have some kind of instinct when it comes to magic and her dragons so for all we know she did some kind of spell maybe she didnt just feed drogon the horse but used it as a sacrifice and dany clearly went through some changes when she was in vaes dothrak too she rediscovered the dany that birthed the dragons and got back some of the confidence that shed lost in meereen maybe that change in her mentality affected drogon too
gameofthrones,not_removed,he is maturing he already looks a lot larger since the last time we saw him he also looked pretty tired and weak when he was sleeping and dany was pleading to leave or feed her he was just stuck with a few hefty spears which could be a reason for not caring at the time in the coming episodes i doubt drogon will be completely obedient
gameofthrones,not_removed,doesnt euron have a dragon horn
gameofthrones,not_removed,does he in the show i remember thinking it was weird that they didnt mention it in the last episode but i may have missed it
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe i just read something on the forum and mixed it up with the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei dead by the end of the season for sure jaime goes with her i could see davos dying maybe euron theron or yara id say of the main greyjoys end up dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think season is where the also ran candidates get weeded out this was a tournament to find out who gets to fight the night king there are just some holders on who arent the ultimate war leader type and they are going to get eliminated to set up the ultimate battle in season cersei lannister littlefinger melisandre sand snakes and the clegane brothers arent making it out of season the only ones im sure will be facing the night king are jon arya daenerys and tyrion this is their story they will get to the final chapter they may not survive it but they will get to face the night king
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think there will be a very big death early on in the season
gameofthrones,not_removed,mountain death in cleganebowl
gameofthrones,not_removed,i honestly dont know the way the booksshow have played out in the past i dont think anyone is safe the people you consider safest might die right away while those you believe to be lost causes never seem to die so really i dont know
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel cersei and jaime will die in season tbh we might have one of the stark girls die i think yara euron qyburn grey worm olenna sandsnakes many northern characters
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think of it this way who are they going to want to still be alive for the epic finally jon danny brienne jamie he dies early season i bet arya tyrin bran everyone else is fair game i see bron dying because they set the stage for him to die by him talking about how he wants to grow old cersie they have killed a lannister straight seasons maybe sansa would be main characters i see getting killed
gameofthrones,not_removed,those who remain in kings landing most probably that includes cersei and the mountain jamie would probably survive i just dont think that hell be wiped out of the show without him meeting tyrion again from danys team ellaria olenna yara and daario yeah i know basically half of her allies and thats because shes a little careless sometimes and being in westeros leaves very little leeway for her to make careless mistakes in the north at least one between sansa and littlefinger might die i dont see their alliance making it to the great war it seems immaterial to let it carry on to that point
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel like you are right but i also see jaime as one of the mains the others would also have all the armies under their command and jaime would be in charge of the lannister army maybe i dont really want it but right now i think id like to see jaime kill the nights king he shall diedoing it and from then on kingslayer will be said with a completely different tone
gameofthrones,not_removed,it seems like cersei will never die and even if she does she will probably end up being the damn night queen my anxiety is gonna be through the roof for the next two seasons
gameofthrones,not_removed,he does have one of the valyrian blades assuming he would have gotten widows wail after the death of joffrey and tommen
gameofthrones,not_removed,i bet july
gameofthrones,not_removed,imdb has june fwiw prob very little
gameofthrones,not_removed,there hasnt been one yet and theyll probably announce it with their first teasertrailer is my guess
gameofthrones,not_removed,when they say summer i think were all praying they go by memorial day as the unofficial start of summer sunday the of may would be our hope then and would make a hell of a birthday present since the of may is my nameday
gameofthrones,not_removed,not announced yet
gameofthrones,not_removed,they did say it would be later than usual since the filming had to be done during winter most seasons started early april so im guessing mid summer or september
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought it was last week of june
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt filming supposed to be done in february so i would say either july or september
gameofthrones,not_removed,when ill feel happiness in my live oh wait
gameofthrones,not_removed,why not bet something real like reddit gold
gameofthrones,not_removed,you think its going to premiere on a tuesday
gameofthrones,not_removed,i doubt it will be that late

gameofthrones,not_removed,glad to participate i am curious for the results
gameofthrones,not_removed,check out the results here
gameofthrones,not_removed,the plot lines are still despite a whole season of supposed new content about where they left off with very little and obvious progress each character has about a chapter of new information which can be summed up in a sentence whether or not george writes any of it the same is anyones guess jon tv comes back and goes south to save a sibling fights ramsay book about to go south to save siblingfight ramsay and dies may come back arya tv recovers from blindness escapes to home book overcomes blindness by tricking faceless men will escape for home soon tyrion tv meets dany becomes hand book almost meets dany might meet dany when she comes back from dothraki sea jaime tv war in riverlands still loves cersei book war in riverlands probably done with cersei cersei tv self destructing kids all die wild fyre happens book self destructing kids dead about to die wildfyre probs will happen sansa tv under little fingers mind control in winterfell book under little fingers mind control in the eerie bran tv becomes three eyed raven discovers everything we wanted to know book becoming eyed raven about to learn everything we already know dany tv fought in slavers bay making way to westeros book about to fight in slavers bay the main big points are all still in place for whatever big may happen next but the details are wildly different at this point and like i said one small step has been taken by each main character
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre not finding a straight answer because this question is really impossible for anyone but grrm to answer accurately
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think you really understood what i asking im asking where the plotlines are at by the end of adwd compared to the end of season
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres a lot of minor changes but as mentioned above much of the plotlines are from the last two books which makes me wonder how theyre gonna conpress all the action from the last two books though not completed into the show there should be at least seasons more in my opinion i agree that sams and gillys storyline has been changed a lot in the last season too much and also not necessary the way i see it i understand that the swap with gilly and mances baby can be a little too confusing looking forward to see how this goes in the books though but in the books its jon making sam go to oldtown with gilly and maester aemon even though sam feels like he should stay i dont understand why they made it the other way around in the show though perhaps it is connected to the whole sams writing the song of ice and fire theory i dont know why but it kinda bugs me i guess it just makes another impression of sam than i had from the books sorry if my writings in any way unclear or if i say something i shouldnt im not native to english and also this is my first post
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh okay dany theon jon and cersei and their associated characters are done at the end of sam is only in affc significantly but is about done at the end of his storyline was very much delayed theres some stuff at the end of that is very roughly equivalent to happenings in the adwd epilogue some of brans adwd stuff and jaimes affc stuff are sprinkled in
gameofthrones,not_removed,so at this point in the books jon is dead and hasnt been brought back and cersei hasnt went on her little rampage this makes me pretty impressed that theyve come up with original stuff like the battle of the bastards for the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,you got it
gameofthrones,not_removed,what makes you think that the battle of bastards is original it is most likely in the books given the importance in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont forget lsh is there i dont think riverrun has been taken by jaime yet and sansa is nowhere near winterfell she is still with baelish in a much better situation and is not an idiot
gameofthrones,not_removed,its most likely in the books yes and i dont know to what extent the shel runners get to read from georges material if what i think is likely and he just told them the basic outline of what happens in the battle and they didnt get to read the actual books depiction of it then they did a great job at making that episode with little source material to go off of
gameofthrones,not_removed,the destruction of the sept was important but we know it was original we just plain wont know what dd write and what grrm told them about unless they tell us and so far we only know about rlj shireens burning and hold the door
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the books will be the same as the show but it is unclear if stannis won or not in the book
gameofthrones,not_removed,riverrun was taken in affc if i remember correctly
gameofthrones,not_removed,this edmure delayed long enough for blackfish to escape
gameofthrones,not_removed,kingslayer not dragonslayer and because people thought that he killed the mad king because he wanted the throne for himself not because the aerys ii had caches of wildfire that he planned to set fire to all over the city
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think he is called kingslayer rather than dragonslayer and he got the name for obvious reasons i presume he hates it as it is often said with disdain reminding him of his treacherous act

gameofthrones,not_removed,mother of dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love the gown the sleeves make the whole thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,awesome costume
gameofthrones,not_removed,brynden rivers and aegor rivers were targaryen bastards and they got named like riverlands bastards
gameofthrones,not_removed,assuming his parents werent marriedjon was raised and grew up in the north sorry its snow
gameofthrones,not_removed,mya stone is robert baratheons daughter in the vale
gameofthrones,not_removed,i disagree lyanna and rhaegar were married under a weirwood i guarantee you they married rhaegar wouldnt have done it without doing that he was obsessed with the prince who was promised prophecy the dragon must have three heads as in three targaryens ellia martell couldnt produce him a third child so he completed the prophecy with lyanna stark giving him his third child rhaegar thought that his son aegon was the prince who was promised but really it was jon its would have been paramount that jon carried the targaryen name
gameofthrones,not_removed,congratulations you made me like flock of seagulls cool vid
gameofthrones,not_removed,eww feet
gameofthrones,not_removed,these are ridiculous lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,isis that rocket raccoon
gameofthrones,not_removed,why is ramsay the only one not shown in his death scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,lmao the ned stark one
gameofthrones,not_removed,either these are really big cupcakes or you have tiny feet
gameofthrones,not_removed,i read it as winter is cuming
gameofthrones,not_removed,my brain just realized that when jon snow has a child he will be papa jon
gameofthrones,not_removed,the feet are gross but not the bloody cupcakes
gameofthrones,not_removed,in a good way
gameofthrones,not_removed,where
gameofthrones,not_removed,its robb after the wedding
gameofthrones,not_removed,my sis said she could not find a good one of his death so she went with the torturing ramsay
gameofthrones,not_removed,or you know the cupcakes are sitting on the counter and op is standing on the floor
gameofthrones,not_removed,the cupcakes on the counter yo
gameofthrones,not_removed,its been cuming for seasons
gameofthrones,not_removed,im horny
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes
gameofthrones,not_removed,fair enough
gameofthrones,not_removed,you are correct
gameofthrones,not_removed,what about the dickbutt
gameofthrones,not_removed,he was one of the few persons who knew about the wildfire under the city and probably also that cersei tried to use it during there is a chance he would have guessed correctly what was about to happen when in the sept and since he still was the grandmaester it was possible the high sparrow might have believed him if he could clearly point at the danger instead of only thinking something is wrong as margaery did or at least enough people would be convinced to force a way through so he was a risk that was best disposed of before going to the sept also qyburn probably wanted a bit of payback for all the time pycelle looked down on him which is way he went through the trouble of being there in person
gameofthrones,not_removed,pycelle is a maester a man of logic science being so he advised against giving the high sparrow power and i dont believe he would want to be there
gameofthrones,not_removed,pycelle died the way he did because it was thematically fitting to have his death be orchestrated by qyburn a man he had openly despised and spokeout against inuniverse my theory is that qyburn went rogue he knew cerseis plans and that pycelle planned to be at the sept so he took the opportunity to exact some revenge on the old maester we dont know if cersei was complicit in his plan or if she found out about it after the fact but one could assume that she didnt care if she had planned on killing pycelle at the sept anyway lanceli dont really have an inuniverse explanation for the way i interpret it lancel would have died at the sept no matter what he was just another bird to kill with cerseis rather large stone ultimately i dont think his death had any more meaning than the rest who died in the explosion he was just an audiencesurrogate a way for us to see the threat of the wildfire before it went off essentially cersei planned on both pycelle and lancel dying a the sept their special deaths were either orchestrated by another or entirely coincidental conversely they may not have factored into cerseis plans at all and their deaths had no meaning to her her enemies were the faith and the tyrells not some old tot and an old fucktoycousin
gameofthrones,not_removed,for dramatic scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,perhaps qyburn wanted his body for something instead of it being incinerated
gameofthrones,not_removed,excruciating pycelle was shanked to death while lancel literally died in a millisecond
gameofthrones,not_removed,its part of cerseis effort to cleanse herself of her past deeds she ends her trial by destroying the sept and the sparrows but ensures that pycelle and lancel dont escape by orchestrating their murders directly this essentially erases the incest question with lancel as well as all of the knowledge that pycelle had from acting as her maester dont forget that pycelle gave her moon tea when she was potentially with roberts child put bluntly the only person left alive that has touched her lady parts is jaime
gameofthrones,not_removed,im pretty sure the writers just needed a few more minutes of screen time so they added scenes for pycelle and lancel plus they needed a transition to show the wildfire explosion i guess and having lancel chase a kid into the underground was the easiest way to do that
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think lancel or anybody had an excruciating death an explosion wouldnt leave anything left of them to burn
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think qyburn just wanted a little fun revenge
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive asked this before apparently this is the result of trying to reference the books but because the time and place is completely off the scene just comes off as awkward weird and making no sense in the books varys supposedly does this to pycelle or kevan he lures them away before fleeing westeros because he wants to create as much chaos in the region before leaving so that theyre ripe for the conquering when he returns as such he wants certain people gone in the books ok he lures someone away while he still hasnt shown his hand and has them killed where they wont be found in the show its just weird he wouldve died anyways so yeah its weird it doesnt really have a concrete logical explanation within the series itself but seems to have an explanation as subpar writing and how and why it came to light also dont quote me on the details of varys and kevanpycelle im no book reader all i know from when i asked this question is that the elements of that scene exist in the book but unlike in the show the conditions actually demand for a murder of that style the show more or less attempted to reference that scene but showed no concern for the fact theres no demand for it and thus it makes no sense
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre writing a paper about game of thrones thats sick
gameofthrones,not_removed,pycelle was smart not smart enough to survive but he had some skills i remember the scene after he had a whore in his bed he gets up and jumps out of the bed stretches and walks pretty fast to his clothes he gets dressed get his staff and start his slow ass crawl to we he goes to most people i bet they didnt catch it but its basically he showing how sneaky he is he has everyone in westeros thinks hes a slow crippled man why because if people think your slow a crippled your less of a threat you cant kill anyone because your so slow and if you have a staff you can barely stand so i could push you over with one hand so him being one of cersei top informants shown by tyrion when he ships myrcella off to dorne i think he knew how deadly she was he also probably knew about all the wildfire she had
gameofthrones,not_removed,the wildfire cersei used in wasnt aeryss wildfire she commissioned it from the alchemists guild it was all brandnew
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think qyburn wanted revenge hes not petty he actually gave pycelle some kind words before killing him i like qyburn
gameofthrones,not_removed,i perceived it as cersei knowing that as soon as she didnt show up lancel would leave the sept to come for her as he is a high ranking member of the faith so she had qyburn send one of his newly acquired birds to wait for him and lead him down into the tunnel under the sept but she didnt want him dead she wanted him paralyzed so he would see the fate of his faith before it happened so he could watch as everything he knows will be gone if you rewatch that scene the kid stabs him in the spine and then leans down and looks at him before running away making sure he couldnt get up lancel was the person who would be testifying against her she is the reason her torture and atonement happened she wanted him to suffer and she wanted to make sure he actually died in the explosion instead of getting too far away by trying to get her for her trial and not actually dying
gameofthrones,not_removed,lanceli dont really have an inuniverse explanation for he was sent to fetch cersei so he would not be in the sept when it went up the mountain could have ripped his head off i suppose but getting diverted and shanked was a back up maybe cersei put that in place or maybe qyburn had her back
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually dont get qyburn at all to me hes a greater hypocrite or more mysterious than lf first of all he was left for dead when the mountain acting under the orders of house lannister pillaged harrenhal so why then would he end up helping their kin healing jaime then he gets to kl decides he wants to help cercei heals the very monster that caused him such peril and then he conspires with cercei to blow people up like the mad king how could that possibly be better for the realm than the status quo or was he making a calculated decision that the sparrows would see his work as heretical its just a slap in the face to the mo that he perpetuated in when he had that talk with jaime about saving peoples lives being a greater good than killing and yet everything hes done to this point has been to cause more suffering
gameofthrones,not_removed,ooooo
gameofthrones,not_removed,im speaking more of crawling to his doom after getting nonfatally shanked by one kid
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn kids these days
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive asked this before apparently this is the result of trying to reference the books but because the time and place is completely off the scene just comes off as awkward weird and making no sense in the books varys supposedly does this to pycelle or kevan he lures them away before fleeing westeros because he wants to create as much chaos in the region before leaving so that theyre ripe for the conquering when he returns as such he wants certain people gone in the books ok he lures someone away while he still hasnt shown his hand and has them killed where they wont be found in the show its just weird he wouldve died anyways so yeah its weird it doesnt really have a concrete logical explanation within the series itself but seems to have an explanation as subpar writing and how and why it came to light also dont quote me on the details of varys and kevanpycelle im no book reader all i know from when i asked this question is that the elements of that scene exist in the book but unlike in the show the conditions actually demand for a murder of that style the show more or less attempted to reference that scene but showed no concern for the fact theres no demand for it and thus it makes no sense uaflyingnun
gameofthrones,not_removed,its just a few pages had to be something about a show that portrays an unexpected seizure of power the sept of baelor exploding flashed before my eyes i couldve done the rw but walder frey is boring and perverted
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion mentioned the mad king having ordered a number of caches and one of them was under the sept
gameofthrones,not_removed,he still knew about aerys wildfire though i think he was there when aerys ordered to burn them all
gameofthrones,not_removed,a lot of that wildfire came from hidden caches that the alchemists found tho
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wrote something but missed that you had put season not so i deleted the comment and replaced it with this lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,he actually gave pycelle some kind words before killing him seemed more like he was taunting him and savoring the fear imo
gameofthrones,not_removed,one of the slickest players of the game from being nearly dead to hand of the queen actor who plays him is amazing too top character for me for sure
gameofthrones,not_removed,burn its in the name
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean i can see that but i also think the scene is overanalyzed as i think youre doing i think if cersei wanted her revenge on lancel she would have wanted him to survive the sept and tortured him as she does unella i think by the point she plans the explosion lancel is like a bug to her a minor annoyance compared to the overall faith and the tyrells why waste her time on a scheme that could easily fail how would she know for sure that lancel would be the one to come find her and why would she plan her entire revenge around one little bird when she could be assured he would die anyway trapped in the sept with the others no her enemies were going to burn that day if she wanted anyone to see their faith burn it would have been the high sparrow not some afterthought like lancel that scene played out because of coincidence but it was important because it showed us the audience what was really going on because of lancel the last scenes within the sept are given an extra sense of futility that nothing the crowd can do will save them from their fate as for rewatching i believe ive seen it around a dozen times now p
gameofthrones,not_removed,sorry for the doublepost but i wanted to add a couple things first off lancel is not the reason cersei was imprisoned by the faith the high sparrow clearly had ambitions and wanted to reshape the crown as a tool of the faith as he tried to do with tommen and arguably succeeded if lancel was not around the hs would have found another way to imprison cersei as it was never about paying for her sins but to destroy her influence over tommen and the kingdom in general also lets assume that little bird was the same one who lit the candles lancel sees him leaving the tunnels and chases after him so where does the kid go back to the tunnels where he has an advantage hes able to hide in the shadows until lancel loses sight of him then runs out to attack where does he stab his pursuer right in the spine lancel can no longer chase after him and the kid runs off trying to get to safety its coincidence and arrogance that puts lancel in that spot before the candles not a miniconspiracy by cersei that shell never be able to get true confirmation of happening
gameofthrones,not_removed,if you rewatch that scene the kid stabs him in the spine and then leans down and looks at him before running away making sure he couldnt get up ive been wondering forever why that kid didnt finish him off this is a great reason why thanks for putting that to rest for me
gameofthrones,not_removed,i ask though how would cersei know that lancel would be the one to fetch her and how would she or qyburn be able to coordinate something so coincidental as lancel seeing the little bird at that exact moment occams razor when see hoofprints think horses and not zebras coincidence explains what happened to lancel far easier than a convoluted revenge scheme that ends with him dying the same way we would have in the sept
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh
gameofthrones,not_removed,who the fuck made this bot and how bored were they when they got the idea
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats so cool man good luck with the paper
gameofthrones,not_removed,the simplest solution is that it is a tv show and the writers decided it would build suspense to watch him crawl there really was no reason for lancel or anyone else to follow that kid other than drama
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think that is awesome anytime you say dont quote me it triggers
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats what ive been saying he was the audience surrogate a way for us to discover what was going on inuniverse it was all coincidence in real life it was to add drama no cersei involved in either of those
gameofthrones,not_removed,the plan is laid out better in the books there hes also backing aegon and there is some evidence to suggest aegon is actually the real person that varys wants on the throne the plan was to use dany as a backup and possibly a marriage option for aegon the show appears to have cut out aegon completely so the way varys handles dany makes less sense on the screen varys role on the council is also meant to be playing both sides to keep his position of influence there secure he was informing in a way that didnt directly endanger dany and his reports of her helped to spread the word that she was coming that a targ was still alive it allowed him to test the waters with that info to see how people responded and how they might feel about aegon too the show also has varys just up and abandon kings landing with qyburn taking control of varys little birds the books are quite different varys just steps into the shadows and never loses contact with anyone hes still clearly in control of his network and its a surprise in the adwd epilogue when varys and his birds appear and kill kevan the show version is greatly simplified which is probably helpful since the show runners want to shorten the ending but it does make varys look weak when he should be completely in control of everything its similar how show varys is a lot more likable and nice but book varys is all calculating mastermind and if anything varys appears to be in a much better position by the end of adwd than littlefinger for having his plans come together
gameofthrones,not_removed,daenerys wasnt the heir during that conversation viserys was and was still alive when the assassin was sent daeneryss assassination wouldve spurred drogo to help viserys invade he otherwise wasnt moving its weird how often people forget that viserys existed like all the threads about targaryens being fireproof that disregard that viserys burned poor harry lloyd
gameofthrones,not_removed,the assassin was sent out when viserys was still alive
gameofthrones,not_removed,you have to take into account that there is discarded story lines nowin the books the plan looks to have been to marry viserys to arriane martell who is not in the show to get the dornish to back house targmarry dany to drogo for dothrakiand for aegon to land with the golden company backing himplus any other houses still loyal to house targ
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like to think that varys sent a clumsy assassin you saw how the wine seller was way too eager and jumpy on purpose who would fail anyway
gameofthrones,not_removed,you pretty much nailed it that last scene with kevan was brilliant reading
gameofthrones,not_removed,indeed the ending with kevin made me scream and i personally reckon we will be lead to believe that varys wants aegon on the throne dany will find out that he prefers aegon and will take him out as aegons cause falters without the power of dragons behind him
gameofthrones,not_removed,but what are his true plans
gameofthrones,not_removed,exactly he puts himself in that position so he can choose he also told jorah to be on the lookout for assassins it was done to put dany on her toes because robert might send someone else
gameofthrones,not_removed,plus varys has to give robert something every once in a while so he doesnt look suspicious and i think varys probably knows about jon snow so there were contingencies in place
gameofthrones,not_removed,the only way this is possible is if the handmaidens at lyannas deathbed were or passed the message down to little birds
gameofthrones,not_removed,every thing about jon snow should of raised suspicion to anyone with half a brain rhaegar disappearing form the war for a set period of time even after he fucking caused an absolute scandal of massive proportions ned finding his sister in a tower named tower of joy by said rhaegar which was guarded by the greatest knights ever who werent in the war then ned the most honorables man in westerosi leaving the south with a bastard only an idiot like robert would of believed neds story im sure littlefingervarys would have suspicions on the story alone based on just logic
gameofthrones,not_removed,he said it himself he has birds everywhere
gameofthrones,not_removed,so the show was awesome went to the one in philly at the wellsfargo center great set up really cool stage huge screens even some pyrotechnics most of all just really fantastic music they saved light of the seven for the end and it was outstanding ramin played the piano himself during that song and another cool instrument that i cant recall for aryas song called needle they had the scenes playing alongside the music notably the stadium went wild for all of the dany and arya stuff lol and on the flip side the stadium went completely quiet when they played the rains of castamere alongside the red wedding scenes someone in the audience shouted the north remembers lol at the very end they played the bear and the maiden fair alongside an in memoriam for all the characters who have died on the show lol overall it was really great ramin djawadi seems like such a cool and humble guy and the place was packed i imagine if this tour goes well enough they will do another one of these in a few years to add in whatever great stuff ramin does for the last two seasons
gameofthrones,not_removed,sounds amazing wish i could be there
gameofthrones,not_removed,a from you uadventuresofkristin on rgameofthrones has been removed because of the following reasons content needs to provide value to the subreddit in a unique or high quality way post stuff thats cool interesting and different content should ideally promote discussions about the books or show thanks for contributing unfortunately your post has been removed as a relevant megathread now exists please review the subreddits rgameofthroneswpostingpolicy and rgameofthroneswspoilerguide to better understand the content scope if you have a question or concern about this action please
gameofthrones,not_removed,also why cant euron have an eyepatch
gameofthrones,not_removed,i guess the one change i hated was jamie raping cersei in the sept she wanted it in the books and hes supposed to be on a redemption arc the show keeps trying to realign him with cersei and i think hes over her in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,woe to the usurper if we had been why change the line
gameofthrones,not_removed,honestly them not adding all the storylines makes complete sense but they could defo done victarions storyline and young griffs but the thing the writers do which is just to be annoying to book readers is change a classic line or change an interaction just a little bit for no reason but for change sake woe to the usurper if we had been only cat edd fetch me my block il send him to you with a trebuchet
gameofthrones,not_removed,honestly when they didnt introduce the griff storyline in the first seasons you shouldve known that it was never gonna happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,why cant he do the speech he gave in the books save for the magic of the horn and the comments on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,right it seems so simple like a prop his nickname is the fucking crows eye for fucks sake just give him a badass eyepatch
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think they decided it was too cheesy and stereotypical for a pirate lord
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes i am mad that he didnt have an eye patch very upsetting
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats a big one too hes trying to better and that all happens i think lena headey said it was consensual and such but it still didnt seem like it
gameofthrones,not_removed,you know i brought this up the day after that episode and got annihilated with downvotes for it
gameofthrones,not_removed,toj such a badass line and they changed it completely lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,they always simplify lines to appease us dull show watchers
gameofthrones,not_removed,well its never for no reason its often for clarity because some viewers are more obtuse or because they think the original sounds too unnatural when spoken
gameofthrones,not_removed,at first she didnt want to but later she did
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah im also a bit upset about them changing dawn a sword over ten thousand years old blade is as white as milk unlike vs swords witch are dark and smoky in the books it was still in the show but it was pretty lame but seeing ser arthur dayne and i presume oswell whent with white cloaks on was amazing
gameofthrones,not_removed,but she really wanted it in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think they went with the decision to have arthur dayne duelwield because it probably better showcased how good of a swordsman he is
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the books too she said something like not here jamie no
gameofthrones,not_removed,they did i believe but taking dawn away from arthur dayne is like taking ice away from ned stark or roberts warhammer they could of made the fight just as good with dawn
gameofthrones,not_removed,at firstthen it was like yes sweet brother yes the others can take the septons he kissed her again kissed her silent kissed her until she moaned then he knocked the candles aside and lifted her up onto the mothers altar pushing up her skirts and the silken shift beneath she pounded on his chest with feeble fists murmuring about the risk the danger about their father about the septons about the wrath of gods he never heard her he undid his breeches and climbed up and pushed her bare white legs apart one hand slid up her thigh and underneath her smallclothes when he tore them away he saw that her moons blood was on her but it made no difference hurry she was whispering now quickly quickly now do it now do me now jaime jaime jaime her hands helped guide him yes cersei said as he thrust my brother sweet brother yes like that yes i have you youre home now youre home now youre home she kissed his ear and stroked his short bristly hair jaime lost himself in her flesh he could feel cerseis heart beating in time with his own and the wetness of blood and seed where they were joined
gameofthrones,not_removed,though ned never used ice in battle of course they just decided to make dawn less cheesy looking by not making it white and glowy its similar to them not making the kingsguard armor white because it looked too plasticlike sometimes things dont look as good in real life as they do in your imagination
gameofthrones,not_removed,well technically he did have dawn and it was noticeable as a white large blade he just had another sword too it was still a cool fight either way
gameofthrones,not_removed,ah i see its a quite a bit more willing than i remembered and the show did make some mistakes there thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,they did try the all white kingsguard armour but it didnt look good which is fine i agree on the glowing aspect but they still could of made the blade white and it be a greatsword or zweihander instead of two longswords ned never used ice in battle but if i remember right the kings of winter did fight with ice the non vs version that the modern ice gets its name from and ice is perfectly usable sword for fighting with
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i enjoyed the fight and im grateful for seeing the toj scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,apparently the propmasters and the producers didnt agree a white blade looked good
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah and grrm doesnt like painted swords so they decided to scrap it and make it look normal these are rubber swords after all
gameofthrones,not_removed,okay thank you it doesnt matter as much as some of the changes but i still would of loved to see dawn in all its glory
gameofthrones,not_removed,i recall it being said in the show that there was some kind of magical element to the wall made by the children of the forest so to me it wouldnt be much of a stretch to assume that the children of the forest helped in the construction of the wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,bran the builder
gameofthrones,not_removed,bigger reach than when brandon was going for that sword gods im going to seven hells for laughing at that
gameofthrones,not_removed,mexicans
gameofthrones,not_removed,god i hope got doesent take a world of warcraft turn with jon killing the ice king and then realizing there must always be a ice king to control the walkers from going south
gameofthrones,not_removed,its made of ice because its available everywhere up there basically you just wait for snow compress it and you get ice blocks that will stick together i their own handy as said by someone else the wall has been improved by many commanders after being initially built which is easy considering the frequency of snowfall on the other hand stone is hard to gather hard to transport harder to assemble and probably a few other inconvenience im forgetting lastly i dont see any reason for white walkers to do that why would they restrict themselves
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like your theory
gameofthrones,not_removed,well the wall is miles long and feet wideand is over feet highbut the legend is that bran the builder built it along with storms end etcand every lord commander would leave it higher then the one beforeuntill the present day were they can only maintain itso its safe to assume it doesnt need to be that high i think we will find out that bran wargs into people or can warg thru time and created the wall or whispered to someone called brandon then and gives them the secrets of the children of the forest and men and giants built it togetherid love the theory of an ice dragon to be true so we could see dragon vs dragon fights
gameofthrones,not_removed,the wildings built the wall and the whitewalkers paid for it
gameofthrones,not_removed,its actually a gelato wall made by italians tastes mint
gameofthrones,not_removed,donald j stark he made the wildlings pay for it
gameofthrones,not_removed,the wall is made of sleeping ice dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive recently come to believe that this is a postapocalyptic story and the wall as well as the citadel and some other world wonders are leftovers from a highly advanced civilization magic is essentially genetic engineering passed down through bloodlines and the leftover wonderstechnology of the time before a global collapse
gameofthrones,not_removed,one thing that grrm did that i love is that he wrote a story about magic returning to the world instead of just something that existed long ago or is leaving magic and dragons and white walkers are returning that is relevant in that i believe the wall was built by brandon the builder i just think theres more to the story than people assume i think btb had some pretty phenomenal powers and the wall needed everything he had to get built but he seems to have had to use someone else for the magic that is built into the wall i dont think they hauled ice blocks and put them in place i could see the story being revealed that the wall was built more like concrete poured in place and left to harden layer by layer the fact that the wall regenerates itself has to have something to do with magic could the wall have been actually made to keep people inside south sure maybe the free folk broke that promise and every years the walkers wake up and chase those fuckers outa their yard i look forward to eventually reading the full story i hope the walkers story doesnt leave them as some mindless brute bent on just doing evil for evils sake i know that down votes are coming dont do this dont give a fuck about that shit fuck them if you had said years ago that you think the children of the forest created the white walkers youd have been laughed at because the cotf are now trying to kill the ww
gameofthrones,not_removed,the wall has some children of the forest magic built in it so they were involved in it somehow
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont have a problem with the the idea that the ww and the cotffirst men came to a truce but the wall is a terrible vehicle for enforcing that truce because it hampers only the ww while doing nothing to prevent the nights watchmen from moving north given how it only protects the men south of the wall its fair to say that men and their allies built it of course its still an open question why the wildlings chosewere forced to live north of the wall for years but thats beyond the scope of this question
gameofthrones,not_removed,the wall is made of ice and stone
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like your theory and got downvoted aggressively for suggesting something similar previously something to remember is the wall is not simple iceit is somewhat magical in that it repairs itself repels white walkers and consists of saltwater i like the idea that in a conflict between the ww and humansa truce was reached and the humans would stay south of the wall and the wwchildren north if true this means the wws have a legit gripe with the humans for breaking their part of the bargain it also might explain why they havent ventured south of the wall even though logically they should be able to something to remember is that the wws are not the simple zombies they appear to be on the tv show in the books they are described as attractive we know they can reason to some degree they didnt kill craster a mind bending theory involving time travel is that bran is able to communicate and negotiate a peace with them their peace terms will specify that humans stay south of the wall and the wws north the nights watch will be implemented to keep out humans from the north in return the wws will help rebuild the wall which will probably come down based on the visions of winterfell flooding then in a sensetime will loop and the future will become the past
gameofthrones,not_removed,well maybe and this is just speculation guys just maybe it was built by cersei lannister via time traveling warg powers i mean it doesnt say she doesnt have these kinds of powers so maybe she does right makes a shit ton of sense to me
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean i see this as being possible but in the main scheme of things very anticlimactic i think the wall associated with brandon the builder along with our own bran all are connected in someway not bashing your theory because it does make sense just my take on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive put forth that theory a couple of times and i think its very likely it was a joint effort between walkers first men and cotf to seal a peace deal
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive read a lot ridiculous theories on this sub which of course never panned out this is far and away the most nonsensical hopefully my sarcasm detector is broken and youre just trolling
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is known that its bran the builder and spoilers but the white walkers were created by the children of the forest to preserve their land from humans
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is less a stretch and more literally what happened lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,bigger tinfoil icedragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,can you explain what he means to a poor boy like me please
gameofthrones,not_removed,ice mexicans
gameofthrones,not_removed,that cant be the wall is high whrereas mexicans can
gameofthrones,not_removed,jericho
gameofthrones,not_removed,no they just paid for it
gameofthrones,not_removed,make westeros great again
gameofthrones,not_removed,you think if it exists the ice dragon would be on the ww side i thought it would be part of the nights watch defense edit and im assuming dany is fighting with jon
gameofthrones,not_removed,if the land of always winter was the us and canada at some point that would mean craster is the descendant of southern americans theory confirmed
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think that the ww will be entirely evil for evil sake they have their reasons i am sure when has grrm ever made a purely sadistic character that is evil for seemingly no reason only one character was like that but he was poisoned by his hounds
gameofthrones,not_removed,not strictly speaking true they did manage to come to an agreement with craster
gameofthrones,not_removed,the wwothers havent shown the capacity and these are the crucial words what do we know about them they have swords which shatter regular blades they can afawk only be killed with dragonglassobsidian or valyrian steel possibly lightbringer but we dont know if that is not the process of forming vs they can transform babies into other ww and dead people into wights they were created by the cotf at least in the show sometimes they let people live everything else is pure speculation and assumption given that grrm hates pure good or pure evil i am not so shure if there is no higher motive behind the wws actions
gameofthrones,not_removed,what is their ultimate goal
gameofthrones,not_removed,when prince rhaegar kidnapped lyanna stark brandon stark ned and lyannas older brother went south to kings landing to demand rhaegar release her instead the mad king took brandon prisoner and demanded their dad rickard come to kings landing when he did rickard demanded trial by combat for their crimes the mad king chose fire as his champion so the mad king roasted rickard alive in his armor and he put brandon on a choking leash and put a sword right out of his reach saying if brandon could reach it he could save his father brandon died choking himself to death trying to reach the sword and rickard roasted to death in his armor causing the north to join roberts rebellion
gameofthrones,not_removed,there are book spoilers so bewareidk how to set those in sidebar i fail everytime when rhaegar abducted lyanna neds father rickard and older brother brandon came to kl to ask for her brandon got little mouthful so he said hell kill rhaegar aerys throws them both in the dungeon trial by combat comes rickard chooses brandon aerys choose fire and suspended rickard above burning wildfire while brandon was tied to strangulation device that choked his neck when he tried to move and a sword was placed just outside brandons reachto cut rope holding rickard and you know the rest
gameofthrones,not_removed,were called canadians thank you very much
gameofthrones,not_removed,then somewhere in the wild north theyll find a couple of ice pyramids teotihuaicean
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe they were motivated enough
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes simply because there suppoused to bigger then fire breathing dragonsso it would be vs you have dragons vs a few walkers has to be something to tip it into the ww favour
gameofthrones,not_removed,planetos cannot be earth for a myriad of reasons chiefly being that the season in planetos are caused by some sort of magic and are not natural cycles second the landmasses do not resemble each other at all
gameofthrones,not_removed,there motivation is simplethey dont like the cold and want to emigrate to somewere warmer but people dont like anything thats different and they constantly have to defend themselves from them
gameofthrones,not_removed,what weve been told about them is that they work ice like we work stone and steel ice but not like regular old ice the others can do things with ice that we cant imagine and make substances of it
gameofthrones,not_removed,to walk and wear shades of white dont ask me how many of them
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh i see now didnt get it in the context damn thats messed up lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,brandon went to kingslanding first screaming for rhaegar to meet him in the streets to answer for the crime of abducting lyanna or more accurately for rhaegar to come out die aerys took this as a direct threat to the crown had him imprisoned for treason shortly thereafter aerys summoned his father rickard stark to kl to ransom his son subsequently imprisoned him as well rickard fearing that they would be summarily executed requested a trial by combat to which the mad king agreed chose fire as his champion bradon was not rickards champion but he was rigged up to a strangulation device with a leather cord fastened around his neck he did die struggling to save his father from the fire
gameofthrones,not_removed,and im one of you as well coming out of toronto canada hbu eh
gameofthrones,not_removed,does that make mexicans fire canadians
gameofthrones,not_removed,ice dragon was supposedly equal to about normal dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,well someone was crazy enough to scale a wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,well if you think about it going over it is going to be easier than going through it the crazy part is thinking that they would try to scale the wall right where there was a castlegate if they were anticipating wall climbers youd think theyd be expecting it to be between castles where they wouldnt be spotted like where jon and co climbed
gameofthrones,not_removed,geography and weather are subject to change over time example new zealand moves metres closer to australia every year so in like a million years it will practically be touching my country
gameofthrones,not_removed,british the others are british
gameofthrones,not_removed,its well documented that canadians are wildlings the mexicans are dornish and the lannisters are tge federal reserve of america
gameofthrones,not_removed,geography and weather are subject to change over time sure but martin has said that the climate is not naturally based but magic so in like a million years it will practically be touching my country ok but we have no indication that earth and planetos are at all the same
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh look a stannis supporter thanks for bringing up the magic part yes magic is the key to weather in westeros but magic also affects geography too the land bridge that connected the two continents was destroyed by magic but dude dont think too hard on it its a joke we know that westeros isnt earth grrm has made it quite clear that planetos is orbiting uranus hence the cold weather
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh look a stannis supporter um ok
gameofthrones,not_removed,planetos is orbiting my what
gameofthrones,not_removed,that worked very well
gameofthrones,not_removed,start the video seconds ahead and it ends perfectly
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is way better suited for the mood and flow of the show i dont know what they were thinking with the music choice for the teaser makes no sense to me
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cant get this to work
gameofthrones,not_removed,holy shit the timing was surprisingly perfect
gameofthrones,not_removed,that was incredible
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks — this is so much better than the music they went with i have no idea how that made it through the approval process
gameofthrones,not_removed,im a fan of the national version myself works pretty well
gameofthrones,not_removed,ahhhhh so extremely excited now lol im gonna have to start rewatching from season again i like doing that before the new seasons so its fresh in my mind thanks for sharing
gameofthrones,not_removed,amazing work
gameofthrones,not_removed,it changed the whole meaning of this trailer imo at first i didnt think much of the trailer but the flames going out and the eyes closing obvious means their deaths cersi teams up with the white walkers and wins the song lining up to the trailer makes me wonder if they planned to use it originally
gameofthrones,not_removed,which video the trailer or the music
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks i started the music first and it fit great trailer ended with lion still has claws
gameofthrones,not_removed,trailer left
gameofthrones,not_removed,i envy that you only waited a few days to see arya avenge the red wedding compared to three years for many show watchers
gameofthrones,not_removed,wait a little while then watch it again you will take in so much more the second time and catch all the little references and nuances that you missed the first time around because you were just learning about the families and characters etc its even better the second third forth time i promise
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wish i could erase my memory about game of thrones like in men in black so i could rewatch the whole series and experience everything once again a man can dream
gameofthrones,not_removed,arya is also my favorite at this point just straight up on a murder spree i cant wait to see what she does next everyone else is fighting for honor or the throne or whatever she just wants to murder anyone who wronged her to that end i suppose i really like sandor too
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was blown away by jon snow in battle of the bastards first riding off alone to try to rescue his brother and then just saying fuck it and basically challenging boltons entire cavalry then almost being trampled and suffocated i almost had to turn it off i was so stressed to then climb above the writhing pile of people and escape finally going after bolton and smashing his face in that revenge for sansa was one of the most gratifying moments in my tv watching experience not to mention the dogs
gameofthrones,not_removed,funny im binge rewatching it now what kills me most about watching it in such a condensed way is how bran grows feet in about a day
gameofthrones,not_removed,im doing the literal exact same thing almost at the end of season within two weeks jon snow is my favorite though
gameofthrones,not_removed,when i first started watching i finished in days and i had exams during that time as well it was totally worth it
gameofthrones,not_removed,hold the door
gameofthrones,not_removed,read the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,now to watch interviews bloopers and reaction videos
gameofthrones,not_removed,now go read the books youll understand them better now youve read the show and they give times more detail about the characters lore etc and it will be great to hold you over till season comes out
gameofthrones,not_removed,idk if you read books but if you do you should give the novels a try the novels are better this isnt a knock on the show the show is great in its own right but the books are the masterpiece theres so much more in there that makes the story insane which is tough for tv production because they only have so much money and time they cant put into it food for thought
gameofthrones,not_removed,great now arya is dead thanks arya fan
gameofthrones,not_removed,im so watching for the first time started by december and im on the end of season thats a fantastic show arya ftw
gameofthrones,not_removed,fuck i started over summer and im still on season
gameofthrones,not_removed,did the same now im reading the books waiting for season fuck i hope twow comes soon before i finish adwd
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did the same thing my favorite character is tyrian though
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont get the appeal of arya at all her actions are very predictable and she makes horrible choices throughout the series the whole time are was in essos her story dragged admitivly i liked her a lot while she was with the hound interesting enough since the show has a lot less of walder freys children being trueborn aryas actions at the end of season could end up with edmure tully to be lord of riverrun psychologically i find sansa stark more interesting the amount she has gone through while not able to control it and now rising to power in winterfell brienne of tarth is so badass and heavily impacted jamie too cersei is a powerful chracter and has always been well written i cant think of a time where her story wasnt at least interesting im sure we will see the end of her soon i just hope jamie is the one to do it anyways thats just my opinion
gameofthrones,not_removed,no way me too i have always wanted to watch this show always heard amazing things my boyfriend was gifted the first few seasons in the begining of december and we watched the last of season six two nights ago holy fuck is right hands down my favorite tv show good to know im not the only one late to the game 😀😊
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did the same thing a few weeks back now i hate the wait for season
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just finished my second rewatch last night and i liked it more this time what stands out to me is how some characters in the earlier seasons later become relevant also its such a fascinating world the lore culture and traditions are so well defined for example i noticed how weddings in the north are different to the weddings in the south there is little to no room for reason many choices are made for the sake of fuck this person in particular and i guess it may correlate to what our world was in the middle ages now its on par with breaking bad for me they are different genres so i really cant compare them
gameofthrones,not_removed,valar morghulis
gameofthrones,not_removed,oi too many so and so is my favorite character getting flung around here those are the words to not be said
gameofthrones,not_removed,personally i find arya to be pretty cringey at times i dont know if thats the character the screenplay or the actress the most offensive bit for me was the scene where shes in the vale with the hound and practicing water dancing the hound asks her where she learned that shite and she dramatically turns around with all the try hard flair in the world and defiantly announces syrial forel first sword of bravos ugh
gameofthrones,not_removed,aria is a badass and psychotic i am interested to see what she is like back with her family will she be like awesome family finally well i have been training on how to kill and get my revenge on everyone who has wrong me for years and years now all i know is madness and violence and living in a castle is the opposite of what i am looking to do see ya or maybe she will just reach the end have some milk and cookies and take a nice long nap well shall see
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did in about weeks watched as they came out
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre in the game now
gameofthrones,not_removed,now you should start westworld i did the exact same and finished got really fast westworld was a nice change
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre awesome i tried showing the show to my friend and all he did was make fun of how awful it looked the entire first episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope your heart is ok
gameofthrones,not_removed,my advice go back and watch it again it is amazing how much you miss if you dont take your time with it i did the same thing as you for seasons and missed probably half of the information i have now gone back and watched it as well as reading the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,this man is a god preferably the stranger
gameofthrones,not_removed,i binged seasons to catch up to the premiere of and when season ended and i realized that for the first time it would be more than a week before i revisted westeros i literally burst into tears i couldnt handle it i cant wait a year i have to be with the khaleesi it nearly killed me but it was so worth it
gameofthrones,not_removed,arya is my favorite character too and youre lucky you waited this long to watch it i bingewatched everything from seasons and then had to wait sooooo long for season to come out and then again had to wait a whole year for season its torture
gameofthrones,not_removed,welcome to the long wait
gameofthrones,not_removed,weeks no need to pace yourself that slow s
gameofthrones,not_removed,now read the books and your mind will be blown even further
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,why this random comment gets upvotes wth people
gameofthrones,not_removed,did the same thing with my girlfriend rip my finals holy hell what a wild ride best moments blackwater fight army of the dead fight brienne vs hound fight joffrey dead ramsey dead hodor oberyn fight winterfell fight wildfire explosion i miss robb stark i wish he would meet jon happy sansa pulled through and is with jon even if i hated her spoiled ass in the beginning she went through so much shit brienne jaime needs to happen theyre awesome fuck cersei tyrion for the win i dont care about dany no matter how much the show wants me to care its all about the starks for me
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats the best way to do it i watched seasons in a few days when i started watching between season and then i listened to all books on audiobook read by roy dotrice and had to wait for season now im stuck waiting year in between seasons and martin probably isnt going to finish writing the last books
gameofthrones,not_removed,nice i did seasons in days then watched season as it aired i was laid off at the time so i had a ton of time to kill
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha i began to watch got i think when season begun watched all episodes in days in a row at my work lol yeah i wasnt very productive those days as you can tell
gameofthrones,not_removed,earlier this year i moved into an apartment by myself and couldnt afford internet just yet luckily a friend put every season on my laptop and i did this same thing i was a huge hater before and now ive been converting everyone i talk to
gameofthrones,not_removed,id like to unsee and see all seasons again i started watching it from the first season so it was a loong and painful waiting for the next season every year
gameofthrones,not_removed,i watched first seasons in days but damn ive got to rewatch it soon
gameofthrones,not_removed,when i watched it for the first time literally the last mins made me watch the next episode and the same thing happened for the next one and the next
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes that battle scene was a work of art that shot of the horses charging was unbelievable i yelled look at that all wild eyed with my arms out
gameofthrones,not_removed,weeks lol how did you cope with names and such
gameofthrones,not_removed,intense
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did something similar i had never watched the show but wanted to get into it to watch season with all my friends i watched all of seasons in days
gameofthrones,not_removed,its the most amazing way to watch it the first time i watched seasons was the week before the finale of season aired i would go to work at watch got from sleep wake up at then start again i finished the night before it aired i got to watch the finale with all my friends man it was a riot congratulations on finishing the series and welcome to the club
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i loved it it took me about a month over summer break but it was so worth it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think every single person including myself who i have convinced to watch this show has watched it in weeks or less so addicting i wish i could erase my memory and do it all over again
gameofthrones,not_removed,whoa i could only imagine how you feel
gameofthrones,not_removed,did the same got a two week trial for hbo go binge watched like episodes a day great fucking experience to be honest
gameofthrones,not_removed,weve been watching the marathon too and it really makes me appreciate how they crafted the show to see it in a continuous fashion it will always be a different animal than the books and its okay that some people dont like that but it is such great tv all the way through its very intense to immerse yourself in it for hours
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did just about the same thing and watching something that took years in the making in the span of weeks really puts into perspective how prominent some characters are compared to others for example just about every stark played a large role besides rickon who seemed kind of useless in hindsight but if i watched from season to season waiting a year between each i probably would have been more upset when he died
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did this as well never really got around to watching it finally had some time on my hands and i got the hbo go one month free trial and i watched the entire show in a week and then canceled my free trial
gameofthrones,not_removed,i watched it all in six days fuck it was so good
gameofthrones,not_removed,i kicked a hole in the wall from excitement during the battle of the bastards
gameofthrones,not_removed,one of us
gameofthrones,not_removed,i guarantee you missed something by binge watching i recommend rewarching it
gameofthrones,not_removed,my roommate just did the same thing since winter break started he basically said the exact same things
gameofthrones,not_removed,op idk if youre still talking to people but if you are heres some speculation imagine if jon ever reunited with arya what will he make of her murder talents how will she deal with her family i bet sansa will be one of the last tragic characters maybe her and little finger go down together somehow
gameofthrones,not_removed,its funny op i did the exact same thing i started on a friday night and it was pretty much the only thing on my television when i wasnt at work i dont like fantasy stuff normally not big on lord of the rings or any of that stuff so i just avoided got despite the hype i knew most major spoilers because i dont live under a rock but decided last week id give it a chance and i couldnt turn it off now im rewatching the whole thing not even feeling a little burnt out i want to soak up as much of this world as possible
gameofthrones,not_removed,this was me when season was about a month away from airing i always said i couldnt be arsed then watched a few episodes ended up watching in a little over a week
gameofthrones,not_removed,my girlfriend is squeamish but we just watched them all too she always asked me to cover her eyes when brutal things come on she insisted that if joffrey ever dies she wanted to watch it then when ramsay bolton came around once again i want to watch him suffer
gameofthrones,not_removed,have you ever enjoyed a book before if you have then do not read these fucking books whatever you do because theyre not going to be finished
gameofthrones,not_removed,i recommend watching the videos now for a greater understanding of the show if theres anything youre not clear on such as rhaegar the first men the children of the forest valyria the mad king you will completely understand them after watching these she has a great way of explaining everything house targaryen house stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,hey me too my buddy has been hounding me for years to start watching it and i always said mehfantasy isnt really my bag never did care much for lotr and the like dont kill me please finally gave in after binging pretty much everything elsei started and literally couldnt stop i was hooked
gameofthrones,not_removed,bitch my boy watches seasons in days during finals week to watch the season opener
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did something similar over the summer got an hbo now trial and binge watched it all in a week i actually ended up having got themed nightmares about days in but i kept chugging along until i finished absolutely could not get enough of it haha
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats how i spent my last weeks of the past summer so fucking intense
gameofthrones,not_removed,its hard to watch other tv now right
gameofthrones,not_removed,quality quality shit post
gameofthrones,not_removed,the battle scene with ramsey and jon is all stock footage from old documentaries and clips from braveheart they just cgi the faces on
gameofthrones,not_removed,you should listen to the first few episodes of the hardcore game of thrones podcast on howlfm for some background information while youre still obsessed with the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,arya really gets my dick hard
gameofthrones,not_removed,then watch season and get surprised how all those lovely twists and things disappear the producers just cant keep up with grrm in this regard season is like any other average show regarding plot twists its a big disappointment
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah nah fuck season and its illogical wanking fanservice
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon snow avenged the red wedding
gameofthrones,not_removed,years huh give the book readers a call
gameofthrones,not_removed,i kind of dont though seeing arya kill walder frey years later was sweeter as was jons resurrection them retaking winterfell dany finally sailing west most of everything that happened in season felt better because of how long we waited for it
gameofthrones,not_removed,the year wait made it a much more powerful payoff though didnt it
gameofthrones,not_removed,book readers have been waiting years
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn as someone who binge watched it this summer i never even thought about that
gameofthrones,not_removed,book readers are still waiting
gameofthrones,not_removed,think about how long that wait was for book readers
gameofthrones,not_removed,this concept is so hilarious to me in realtime show watchers were fucking devastated for years over the red wedding but from this guys perspective arya was just like yo hold my beer
gameofthrones,not_removed,or not having to wait years for ramsey to get his comeuppance or not having to wait years to find out who jons parents are or six years for at least one stark reunion
gameofthrones,not_removed,did people really stop watching the show for years after the red wedding i never knew it hit people so hard
gameofthrones,not_removed,this was definitely my experience i caught my boyfriend up to the show in about weeks and rewatching seasons again which is all id seen up to that point was incredible so many layers
gameofthrones,not_removed,it took me the second play through to understand how the whole series was sort of set off by little finger you catch so many little things that can really shape a better understanding of the characters each time you watch it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dug into the world really deep after watching it through the first time went and read the books dug through this subreddit read some theories and excerpts from world of ice and fire there is so much story that isnt presented directly in the first episode they talk about brandon and rickard stark who were murdered by aerys they talk about rhaegar and lyannaall the events that lend context to who all these people are and what their motivations are its incredible
gameofthrones,not_removed,also read the books it really enriches the show and your life in general i picked up the series after season and im rereading it again cant overstate how good they are
gameofthrones,not_removed,this its amazing watching the first episode again after so long seeing all those important characters in the winterfell court yard when king robert arrives makes it more special knowing theyre important not throwaways
gameofthrones,not_removed,this i liked it the first time i watched it and have liked it more every time when you think about the show in memory its easy to think about the large events but there are so many small events and even small conversations that are just as important that you may not even notice or remember
gameofthrones,not_removed,watched it all through maybe times then a read all the books knowing all the characters and story line actually helped me so fucking much with the books you pick up so much more
gameofthrones,not_removed,when i rewatched i appreciated the small talk between varys and littlefinger so meaningful
gameofthrones,not_removed,no matter how much i love a show i can very rarely watch through it a second time i just think i can be using that time to get another experience from another show so rarely ever do it maybe someday ill rewatch shows but i havent yet
gameofthrones,not_removed,wait a little while then watch it again can confirm watched the red wedding and didnt give a shit the first time almost refuse to watch it now but the acting of all of the extras as well as the main characters is amazing so i suffer through the non babystabby parts
gameofthrones,not_removed,you dont even need to wait a little while just go for it
gameofthrones,not_removed,or better yet read it
gameofthrones,not_removed,until season
gameofthrones,not_removed,and now his watch is ended
gameofthrones,not_removed,have people just given up on correcting this common error its now his watch is ended
gameofthrones,not_removed,me and my baseball bat can help it works of the time
gameofthrones,not_removed,that is why i watch blind reactions it seems silly but it makes me feel like i am watching for the first time too in a way
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres always dementia hang in there
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive thought this about so many things like game of thrones the office certain movies and a couple video games
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would never want to see ned die or the starks get slaughtered ever again the only reason i can go back and rewatch it is because i know whats coming
gameofthrones,not_removed,sandor is one of my favorites too him and sansa hes the only got character ive painted so farthere will be more but this is his portrait
gameofthrones,not_removed,when i was watching him being trampled and covered i was convinced that they were about to kill him again and was seriously pissed because of his conversation with melisandre about not bringing him back i thought they were going to force her to choose whether or not to obey his wish
gameofthrones,not_removed,that episode was all sorts of satisfying but still i wouldve liked to have seen that jonramsey sword fight but i guess it wasnt in ramsays character to do so
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was a terrible decision to charge the army it caused them to lose a lot of men and not rescue his brother either it wrecked their careful plans
gameofthrones,not_removed,so youre in an thread and youre not all the way done with season i could be a huge dick and spoil it for you i wont do that though
gameofthrones,not_removed,same i started during finals week and i just started season yesterday im a bit slower than you are but ill be comfortably finished in time for season
gameofthrones,not_removed,no you hold it
gameofthrones,not_removed,that was fucking crazy you think they planned that or did they stumble into it the hold the door hodor thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,read the books read the books read da books reada books reedabooks reedbooks reebooks reeboks reeboks reeboks
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think we need to stop blindly giving this advice to people just to get them hooked on something that well never see a conclusion to its cruel
gameofthrones,not_removed,and bonus lore videos
gameofthrones,not_removed,i used to make fun of people who make and watch reaction videos not anymore
gameofthrones,not_removed,and podcasts
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes go read the unfinished book series that will never be finished great advice
gameofthrones,not_removed,hearing more perspectives and the actual thoughts going through the characters heads add so much context to the narrative i took the dive and read all of the books i dont think show watchers realize that the show is a shadow of the books albeit a fantastic one cats thoughts as the red wedding was about to consume her are absolutely heartbreaking as are the quiet whimpering regrets several characters ponder as they meet their ends
gameofthrones,not_removed,ugh jamies chapters after he returns to the red keep and cersei just treats him like garbage are the best i feel so horrible for him in the book his thoughts were all over the place
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not sure the latest book was pretty boring i had to force myself to finish it i actually enjoy the later part of the show much more than corresponding parts in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,the novels will be times worse when they never have an ending and the show does
gameofthrones,not_removed,ill finish the books when ados comes out until then its like a tv show that wont get renewed
gameofthrones,not_removed,nah shes good i dont think they could profit at all by killing her off it wouldnt really effect anything accept for ending her story line which would be a waste
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre obviously not trying hard enough quit your job and dont leave your house until youre done
gameofthrones,not_removed,same here ive read the world of ice and fire twice since the end of the last season and the main book series im almost done with a second reading send help
gameofthrones,not_removed,lololololol
gameofthrones,not_removed,shes literally a kid growing up on her own of course she makes some dumb decisions shes driven by rage and revenge
gameofthrones,not_removed,valar dohaeris
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like her because she reminds me of my ex lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,she has to reunite with then soon right unless she goes on continuing her list
gameofthrones,not_removed,have you checked his eye color maybe your friend is just a wight without emotions
gameofthrones,not_removed,its not just taking time with it that matters but all the foreshadowing that you only notice on a rewatch because you know whats going to happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,and then utterly betrayed and disappointed when they are never finished yea bad advice under no circumstances waste your time reading the books unless ados is completed otherwise youll just be causing yourself endless pain and bitterness which will significantly affect your outlook on life in a bad way
gameofthrones,not_removed,hahah right
gameofthrones,not_removed,idk crazy right
gameofthrones,not_removed,and the one after that
gameofthrones,not_removed,good lord
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh i definitely did and i definitely will
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel like a reunion is imminent idk how its going to go down meeting with your lost sister that you thought has been dead for years and find out she is a murdering badass it will definitely be interesting
gameofthrones,not_removed,awesome thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,not cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope youre like years old
gameofthrones,not_removed,he is the white wolf
gameofthrones,not_removed,ramsay bolton avenged the red wedding
gameofthrones,not_removed,wyman manderly avenged the red wedding and they practically wrote him out of the show the best pie you have ever tasted my lords wash it down with arbor gold and savor every bite i know i shall
gameofthrones,not_removed,da king in da norf
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is known
gameofthrones,not_removed,they both avenged the red wedding
gameofthrones,not_removed,it hurtsit hurts bad man
gameofthrones,not_removed,no need book readers already make themselves known enough without needing assistance
gameofthrones,not_removed,sweet summer children
gameofthrones,not_removed,soon my friend soon
gameofthrones,not_removed,because of that wait season was by far the best season yet
gameofthrones,not_removed,afuckinggreed waiting so long for everything and then hearing the theme for the first time each season was awesome similarly waiting days between each episode of westworld and watching people go apeshit in rwestworld was great
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have to say that dany sailing west was probably the single most impactful moment of the whole show for me in isolation it doesnt mean much but after everything that happened just before and how long we waitedi had the hugest nerdgasm
gameofthrones,not_removed,idk at this point the red wedding was so long ago i almost didnt care anymore
gameofthrones,not_removed,positives and negatives of both i guess
gameofthrones,not_removed,layers like an ogre
gameofthrones,not_removed,little finger and varys the two shit stirrers
gameofthrones,not_removed,care to give some examples for those who havent dedicated the time to watching it again
gameofthrones,not_removed,i started them years ago right after the show started and had trouble keeping track of everyone and where everyone was picked books up again started from beginning have watched all the episodes and now i find the books incredibly entertaining
gameofthrones,not_removed,i said wait a little while because sometimes you need time to let all the feels sink in binge watching is like overload on the brain thats just from my personal experience
gameofthrones,not_removed,slow down neegan
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes the only got character ive painted so farthere will be more my mind immediately jumped to that wedding crashers scene when i read this
gameofthrones,not_removed,came out really nice
gameofthrones,not_removed,everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face gtcaught between watching their brother die or going out to save him mike tyson
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was a terrible decision for rickon to keep running in a straight line after the arrows started falling
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe it would have been smarter for sure but the north might not have looked kindly on jon doing nothing to try and save the presumed rightful lord of winterfell and warden of the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,gandalf isnt dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,as a third person who just did the same thing though for me i finished it all in one week and two weekends and im currently rewatching again the deaths had all already been spoiled thats the other side of the not having to wait coin weve heard all about the red wedding what happens to ned joffery jon ygritte and pretty much every single other person on the show for me personally the spoilers didnt take away from anything it actually gives it an interesting perspective to watch and know the outcome but not how or when it happens
gameofthrones,not_removed,good to know
gameofthrones,not_removed,seriously op watch them they are amazing and provide a lot of background to the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,recommend any
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea she knew early on what was happening and when she hears the rains of castamere it was bone chilling being inside her head at that moment
gameofthrones,not_removed,jamies story is my favorite its such an emotional roller coaster
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre probably the first person to ever say that or at least that ive heard in my opinion the books get better with each reread because you pick up on new info with each reread
gameofthrones,not_removed,that is what we said about all of the north heroes
gameofthrones,not_removed,true i mean she is only or in the books i guess its easy to forget when the actress is approaching her that she is making decisions like a year old even if dismissing her flaws to her age and rage i think all her training to become a faceless man was pretty lack luster it would have been cool if we didnt see her from the moment she walked in those doors till the death of walder frey that would have been bad ass plus that would have freed up time to have the dorne story line edit another good replacement for that time lady stoneheart
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would imagine she seems to have a good lay of the land and is knocking some heavy hitters off her list the only thing that could get her is the whole white walkers attack and jon heading south i can only imagine that winterfell is going to get swallowed by the white walkers and everyone is going to be pushed to take a stand down near kings landing where everyone surviving will be reunited
gameofthrones,not_removed,around ten hours a day i didnt sleep much or do anything else
gameofthrones,not_removed,shes only years younger than me
gameofthrones,not_removed,the king in the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,geralt of rivia
gameofthrones,not_removed,geralt
gameofthrones,not_removed,poison avenged the red weddingpoison from their enemies
gameofthrones,not_removed,and tyrion
gameofthrones,not_removed,practically
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,how do you know someone reads asoiaf they tell you how long they have been waiting
gameofthrones,not_removed,right
gameofthrones,not_removed,yup i jumped out of my seat and screamed when jon opened his eyes i knew it was coming but god it felt so fucking good after that wait and in the reveal of sandor still being alive exact same reaction i was fucking ecstatic
gameofthrones,not_removed,the tinfoil in there was reminiscent of rasoiaf so glorious
gameofthrones,not_removed,i understand that it was like a weight being lifted off of your shoulders im bummed to say that it didnt really hold that much passion for me and i think thats the fault of danys storyline prior to the beginning of her invasion i never really cared for danys story i knew shed make it over but to me she had always represented someone that wasnt attached to the main story which i felt was more based around westeros and the white walkers obviously i like many others look at the starks specifically now jon snow as the main characters of this story and thats why events such as the red wedding neds execution jons murder and resurrection and the battle of the bastards and jons eventual coronation all held so much emotion for me but in that same episode seeing tyrion be named hand of the king after following him on that whole journey and seeing dany interacting with him in that whole way something about that just instantly brought the triumph in for me he was hand of the king and just scenes later they were on a boat to westeros with her fleet behind her and allies that i knew and i swear to god i was fucking ecstatic
gameofthrones,not_removed,at the same time in isolation it might be the biggest moment in the show so far queen with dragons is headed to westeros with an army of dothraki and unsullied and is backed by the tyrell martell and part of the greyjoy fleets has westerosi advisors in varys and tyrion
gameofthrones,not_removed,thenorthisfuzzyonsomeofthedetails
gameofthrones,not_removed,how dare you
gameofthrones,not_removed,no like an onion
gameofthrones,not_removed,nah more like a cake
gameofthrones,not_removed,and the best players of the game
gameofthrones,not_removed,at least varys has principles hes devoted to the city and it seems like he has a soft spot for outcasts probably because he is one littlefinger is an arrogant power hungry sociopath who is in it solely for his own gain
gameofthrones,not_removed,and the best players of the game
gameofthrones,not_removed,leans back
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you i have a framed canvas of this hanging above my makeup vanity people are like interesting choice i tell them its a reminder that is what is on the inside that counts because awwwww
gameofthrones,not_removed,he has responsibility as a leader his brother was a goner
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is not new he was a goner
gameofthrones,not_removed,but bruce willis is
gameofthrones,not_removed,dumbledore is though
gameofthrones,not_removed,darth vader is robb starks real father
gameofthrones,not_removed,got any links
gameofthrones,not_removed,bald move and history of westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,true but i was thinking about the moment when the man grabs her from behind by her hair to cut her throat im paraphrasing here but she thinks to herself no not my hair ned always loved my hair
gameofthrones,not_removed,shes been trained to fight in the dark for a reason long night course lets forget grrms jon scene spring find her frozen with needle in her hand
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned needed to die to kick start a war robb was shocking as fuck though
gameofthrones,not_removed,we know no king but the king in the north whose name is stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,kingindanorf
gameofthrones,not_removed,dakingindanorf ftft
gameofthrones,not_removed,da king uh duh norf
gameofthrones,not_removed,norf ftfy
gameofthrones,not_removed,kingindanorf ftfy
gameofthrones,not_removed,dakingindanorf ftfy
gameofthrones,not_removed,dakingindanorf
gameofthrones,not_removed,am i too much of a fan if i got goosebumps just for reading it
gameofthrones,not_removed,da king of da norf
gameofthrones,not_removed,the king in the north king in the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,the white doggo
gameofthrones,not_removed,that metrosexual fruitcake
gameofthrones,not_removed,frey pie avenged the red wedding the rat cook lives
gameofthrones,not_removed,well they had him in long enough to have lyanna mormont accuse him of refusing the call to come to the aid of the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive done my waiting
gameofthrones,not_removed,i only finished the whole read through for the first time a week ago this scares me
gameofthrones,not_removed,the episodes name was the broken man i threw a wild guess that it means well see the hound or beric again
gameofthrones,not_removed,and after jon opened his eyes i couldnt wait to find out what everyones reaction would be as always davos didnt disappoint you were dead and now youre alive and that seems fucking mad to me
gameofthrones,not_removed,i put a link to rwestworld on rconspiratard it was so bad
gameofthrones,not_removed,this season really put down some major roadblocks for dany too captured by dothraki entire fleet burned seemingly no way to leave slavers bay without it reverting immediately back to slavery in the end she gets all of the dothraki the masters fleet pretty much solidifies the end of slavery in the bay of dragons oh she also gets iron born men and ships dorne and tyrrell allies control over her dragons it started off seeming like another dany stuck in essos season and instead turned into a season where she becomes even stronger and starts to integrate with various westerosi houses
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought it was like a parfait i love parfait
gameofthrones,not_removed,like an knight
gameofthrones,not_removed,up with you
gameofthrones,not_removed,watch season again varys openly implies that he wants the iron throne for himself to oberin in the throne room
gameofthrones,not_removed,down with you
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was bummed when i found out rollins wouldnt be playing him but jdm is doing a hell of a job
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha above the make up vanity definitely interesting
gameofthrones,not_removed,to be fair ramsay was a hell of a shot with a bow and arrow but that was still a ridiculously good shot it would have been just as realistic if he tried to hit him anywhere with all those arrows and didnt connect once let alone kill shot after toying with him
gameofthrones,not_removed,he was only a goner because he apparently had a full ride to the prometheus school of running away from things
gameofthrones,not_removed,he died hard
gameofthrones,not_removed,han solo died
gameofthrones,not_removed,anything from this guy also alt shift x httpswwwyoutubecomuserjaiwbio
gameofthrones,not_removed,in addition to what others have mentioned is an exceptional youtube channel for got discussion because geek and emergency awesome also have some solid got content
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea true shit was pretty depressing if only ned wouldve smartened up and played the game of thrones house stark wouldnt be in so much trouble
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,snow
gameofthrones,not_removed,slams sword into the fucking stone floor
gameofthrones,not_removed,dakingindanorf
gameofthrones,not_removed,gawd i love this fandom
gameofthrones,not_removed,that amuses you
gameofthrones,not_removed,daking in the north now im just imagining dak prescott dancing in the north he really needs a signature celebration so it can be called daking
gameofthrones,not_removed,gary
gameofthrones,not_removed,huh when did that happen was it the scene at winterfel when they make jon king
gameofthrones,not_removed,years of it in azkaban
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh i spoil myself a bit before the season airs and i like to read about what they may be possibly filming or what actors they had cast for new roles and there was only one report of rory mccann being near the filming locations but there was something in me that knew wed see him again
gameofthrones,not_removed,i knew the hound wasnt dead because they didnt show his death my general rule of thumb is if they dont actually show them dead then they are probably not dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,i absolutely adored davos finding jon first a lot of people have been very critical of davoss immediate hop to jon but i see it with full reason and i love them as a team
gameofthrones,not_removed,bro maybe ill take this up in a decade or so when im driving across america when my midlife crisis comes early
gameofthrones,not_removed,openly implies pick one
gameofthrones,not_removed,his motives are still better than littlefinger varys would restore the kingdom littlefinger would suck it dry
gameofthrones,not_removed,he indicates that hes interested in the iron throne but i got the idea that he means influencing and manipulating the person who sits it rather than being the king himself
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes asked what he wants he gestures toward an empty throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,he might want the throne but no more than any normal person would daydream about being king i dont believe those are his ambitions i think hes smart and he realizes that as a eunuch hes gone as far as he can go i think he just wants to maintain what he has
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn demons posessing john winchester
gameofthrones,not_removed,yup with a rosary hanging off the corner i thought it was appropriate
gameofthrones,not_removed,i pointed this out to my friend while watching it but it looks like the burning men are put apart so that could have made a difference rather than ramsey just freeballing it
gameofthrones,not_removed,he was confident in the shot ramsay did not take chances he knew he had him under control
gameofthrones,not_removed,it did not matter he was going to wind up wearing an arrow shirt
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh yea how hard was he
gameofthrones,not_removed,who was father to kylo
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would also recommend watching if you want to learn more about the world outside of westeros and the war of the five kings timeline
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned could never play the game of thrones he was too pure for that world the best man westeros ever saw his honor would never have let him become a player
gameofthrones,not_removed,she doesnt care if hes a bastard
gameofthrones,not_removed,sand hes from dorne
gameofthrones,not_removed,targaryen actually
gameofthrones,not_removed,the line is stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just rewatched thia episode last night and thought the same thing the fuck are you guys doing youre gonna ruin your swords you see so many minor things the and time through sansa rode away prior to ramsay mentioning his dogs hadnt eaten in seven days yet she repeats that fact during his death scene thats really not the type of thing that someone wouldve told her after the meeting was done so what did i miss in the seconds i rode off prior to you guys finishing well he said he hasnt fed his dogs in days and theyre gonna eat us when we lose bunch of other minor stuff
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love long big cock
gameofthrones,not_removed,daking in the north in a one horse open sleigh oer the fields he goes laughing all the way
gameofthrones,not_removed,runexpectedhogwarts
gameofthrones,not_removed,always am i doing it right
gameofthrones,not_removed,people didnt believe it when imdb said that benjens actor will appear this season well shit
gameofthrones,not_removed,stannis was just hiding out this past season waiting for the right moment
gameofthrones,not_removed,so do you think stannis is alive
gameofthrones,not_removed,links to the right at the top of the sub search for edit your flair
gameofthrones,not_removed,both they are not antonyms if he was subtly implying it he would have said something along the lines of where are we right now to openly imply it he averted his and oberins gaze towards the iron throne not explicitly saying it hence implying but still making it glaringly obvious hence openly smartass
gameofthrones,not_removed,dead hard
gameofthrones,not_removed,my favorite vids i really liked his one on aerys ii
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes but it wouldve saved himself and him being alive wouldve been better for longevity of his entire family he besmirched his honor for the sake of his family before his sister idk why he wouldnt do it again to save his family again sons wife and daughters i think if he had more foresight of the future he wouldve done things differently in a second because he lied before and besmirched his honor even though the lie to protect family was probably the most honorable thing he ever did i think if he changed his ways to protect his family and play the game while to the rest of westeros his honor wouldve taken a hit those of us as readers would know it was truly an act of honor i think at that time he cared more about the appearance of his honor rather than being actually honorable
gameofthrones,not_removed,clearly so is jon he only gets crowned bc ppl loved him
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes her king from this day until his last day
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned starks blood runs through his veins
gameofthrones,not_removed,well said i wonder if shell care when hes revealed as a targaryen time will tell
gameofthrones,not_removed,noble bastard are named by region not origins of noble parentage
gameofthrones,not_removed,dorne hes a black fire if anything a illegitimate targ
gameofthrones,not_removed,excellent point
gameofthrones,not_removed,bastards are named for the region that they are raised in
gameofthrones,not_removed,only if rheagar and lyanna were married
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know what the line is duh right now though his name is snow in westeros soon it will be targaryen p
gameofthrones,not_removed,i could see sansa overhearing someone mentioning that remark or even jon telling sansa after the battle jon where is he in the kennels careful down there ramsey said he hasnt fed his hounds in days
gameofthrones,not_removed,catchy
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean i guess it wasnt that unexpected i inadvertently brought it
gameofthrones,not_removed,to be entirely fair on that front imdb is sort of like wikipedia anyone can enter information thats how they cover things so broadly stuff like that has happened for seasons shit michelle fairleys been listed for every penulitimate episode and finale since the red wedding nearly
gameofthrones,not_removed,and syrio nbsp for the last five seasons
gameofthrones,not_removed,nah i dont think brienne would lie about executing him
gameofthrones,not_removed,just because words arent antonyms doesnt mean they arent clunky together
gameofthrones,not_removed,clearly implying would have worked better openly implying is actually an oxymoron
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats not going to be awkward later
gameofthrones,not_removed,sansa is still in winterfell maybe she will rule the north while jon goes off to fight the white walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,lyannas blood is neds blood he is a stark even if his daddy was a targareyan
gameofthrones,not_removed,shes still named after his mom regardless though
gameofthrones,not_removed,the tower of joy where he was born is in dorne
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon was born in dorne just a joke about his birth region
gameofthrones,not_removed,not all targ bastards were blackfyres bloodraven is a good example of one who was loyal to the crown despite being a bastard
gameofthrones,not_removed,twas a joke
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes a bastard and theyre named by region not noble parentage so still snow unless legitimized
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is blood in his veins which also ran through ned stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,to be fair he does have stark blood
gameofthrones,not_removed,even though hes half targ i dont think he would ever consider himself anything other than a stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,perhaps
gameofthrones,not_removed,if jon is smart hell make that suggestion provided he or anyone else besides bran finds out the truth
gameofthrones,not_removed,true dat
gameofthrones,not_removed,born there but not raised there
gameofthrones,not_removed,bastards are named based on where they were raised not born
gameofthrones,not_removed,fair enough
gameofthrones,not_removed,when the truth comes out about his parentage hell be legitimized i expect well find out that rj rl had a nice quiet little marriage ceremony somewhere
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel like hed be legitimized as a stark if anything even if dany conquers westeros with his help and someone like varys reveals his true parentage to them hed probably prefer to be a stark especially once he realizes exactly what ned did to keep him alive plus it would mean dany doesnt have a potential threat to her power in another targaryen
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats fair he does at least have rickard starks blood
gameofthrones,not_removed,if i am correct we will not hear about game of thrones sending out casting calls resembling rhaegar as he is such a huge character and was casted much earlier whether jared leto got the role or not
gameofthrones,not_removed,for a long time i actually thought jared leto played viserys i think theres a strong resemblance between jared leto and harry lloyd enough for them to be brothers id love for someone to post a side by side of the two i would if i could figure out how to on mobile this is the best i can do httpimgurcomstuotxf
gameofthrones,not_removed,please no got has a great track record casting lesser known actors
gameofthrones,not_removed,please no
gameofthrones,not_removed,well i think he would fit the role if he is able to do an authentic british accent i dont really like him but with long bleached hair and contact lenses he looks pretty much like the illustrations
gameofthrones,not_removed,if they do show rhaegar in the next season i hope they make him look like a targaryen sephiroth
gameofthrones,not_removed,that would be amazing hopefully its true
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would hope they got someone that was actually good in the role
gameofthrones,not_removed,does jared do a british accent trying to remember a role he had with onethere may be one
gameofthrones,not_removed,how many oscar winning actors are in the show none theyre not going to hire one either way too expensive theyre going to hire someone less hollywood and more british my hope is luke evans
gameofthrones,not_removed,i always thought ben barnes would be a great rhaegar hes famous but not that famous and he resembles harry lloyd a lot plus he already worked with kit and look how much they resemble each other also check out this fanart of him as rhaegar its very neat imo
gameofthrones,not_removed,hmm i see them as more likely to get some cheap nobody like they did for young ned stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt he too short i mean rhaegar is supposed to be a big guy right and leto is
gameofthrones,not_removed,i seriously hope not there is no amount of writingacting that could convince me that jared leto is a better knight than brandon stark ser arthur dayne and ser barristan selmy rhaegar was a real badass i think theyd be missing the boat completely to throw in such a well established actor
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope you are right hes a great actor
gameofthrones,not_removed,it also has a bunch of big names too
gameofthrones,not_removed,max von sydow the threeeyed raven is an incredibly decorated actor there are lots of incredibly successful decorated actors with long careers they just all happen to have made their career in the british film television industry so americans are not as privy to who they are
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre right but they did bring in ian mcshane for one episode so not out of the realm of possibility to bring in jared leto for one or two flash backs
gameofthrones,not_removed,they were specifically going after an actor that looks like sean bean because the audience sees two neds they get bigger actors every year after all this is the father of jon snow the noble and loved prince rhaegar who was obsessed with his grandfathers jaehaerys belief in their prophecy saying that his bloodline will produce the prince that was promised not to mention his love story that started a war and ended a dynasty
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon is supposed to be tall and look at kit
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think theyll do something similar to arthur daynewell respected actor but not someone world wide famous also has to be quite athletic and maybe a good singer so narrows the field downbut someone on the london theatre circuit would be a good choice luke roberts who played arthur dayne is a lucky bloke as well since his gf is freema agyeman dr who companion martha jones and also on law order uk httpwatchersonthewallcommoreconfirmationoflukerobertsnathalieemmanuelarrivesinpeniscolaandnewsetphotosfromspainandsaintfield
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would really rather see someone that we as an audience are going to be unfamiliar with i dont want to be taken out of the show by seeing some huge hollywood actor on screen
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn orlando bloom would be spot on
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dunno about bringing legolas into westeros granted he looked the part of a targareyan but so do most lotr elves besides orlando bloom in another swordyielding role i mean hes been in at least half a dozen of those roles a bit of type casting dont you think yawn
gameofthrones,not_removed,riiiggghhhtt and in other newsall of great britain even sometimes as is the case with david tennant the northern part called scotland soon to be a separate country has learned that they speak with a gallifreyan accent
gameofthrones,not_removed,mcshane hasnt won any oscars has he
gameofthrones,not_removed,they get bigger actors every year not really since the biggest name ever to appear on game of thrones was sean bean theyve definitely never engaged in stunt casting getting a big name actor for a minor role
gameofthrones,not_removed,and id say the second biggest name was charles dance my guess is someone like bradley james but if they kill off the rest of the wolves and theres no more giants and get rid of a dragon or two to free up the budget a cgi version of rik mayall in lord flashheart mode would be better
gameofthrones,not_removed,kit is about foot and looks like considers that not tall
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,cane of thrones
gameofthrones,not_removed,santa stark king of the north pole
gameofthrones,not_removed,if anyone is interested in buying it its under
gameofthrones,not_removed,did jamie really think about the repucussions of pushing bran out the window or is he just an impulsive head of hair with a chin
gameofthrones,not_removed,my dad and i are watching game of thrones for the first time and right now were on episode all i can think is how god damn annoying viserys is
gameofthrones,not_removed,jaime and neds sword fight is dope i love how jaimes a little bit cocky at first but then once they start swinging he realizes this is neds fucking stark the men who he believes killed the person who trained him
gameofthrones,not_removed,after finding out about the targaryens love of incest all of the viserysdanaerys scenes have gotten really awkward for me
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont know if i could experience this much loss again i need a good excuse to watch the series again
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn no one died in lord snow i gotta say theres probably only or members of the no casualties in this episode of got club
gameofthrones,not_removed,alright i wont be rewatching every single episode i just dont have the time right now but i guess i will write a few thoughts on each episode every week since i love this show and like talkingwriting about it winter is coming as an introduction to the series i think it serves fantastically it gives you just enough to make you interested but it doesnt make your head explode dont get me wrong its a ton of information for newcomers and if you are not used to so many characters plots etc you will probably get confused but its not too terrible it shows off the main elements of the show the fantastical the scheming politics and it includes a pretty shocking moment at the end if you are not ready for it truly nice intro into the series on a rewatch i did notice some flaws its clear the show was just starting to take its shape with minor inconsistencies like tyrions hair the dialogue is also very exposition heavy many times the characters talk in a strange way to explain the audience their relationships like when jaime is talking to cersei he starts with as your brother or when bran is shooting with his bow jon says something like your father is watching close up of sean bean and your mother close up of cat these are irrelevant things but they kinda stick out on rewatching the episode overall great start to the series best scene robert arriving at winterfell kingsroad not much to talk about here its a very slow episode we are just starting to know the characters and their motivations there are some great character moments and interactions the whole aryasansajoffrey thing that happens at the end is kinda strange but it serves its purpose well outside of that some good dialogue and hints of things to come overall slow character building episode but its needed before shit hits the fan best scene jon giving arya the needle lord snow once again a slower episode but i like it better than the previous one almost every scene is great from neds arrival to kl and the introduction of the small council to tyrion pissing off of the wall to arya having her first dance lesson with syrio good stuff through and through it also sets up very nicely that kl is a very very dangerous place and that no one is really safe daenerys is still riding i am not a huge fan of her overall another great character focused episode which is the case for most of season best scene tie between ned confronting arya and the war stories conversation cripples bastards and broken things the pace is starting to pick up here with the unfolding of the mystery of how jon arryn died but its still mostly character focused episode neds investigation is intriguing so is tyrions journey south jons story in season isnt very interesting tbh but you can see his character growing throught it dany is being dany we have some interesting moments with her and viserys overall the season is picking up the pace we have some great scenes best scene tyrion at winterfell the wolf and the lion this is where the season trul picks up we have the escalation of the conflict between the starks and the lannisters there is also the tourney going on and a ton of scheming and ploting in kl the whole episode is situated in kl which i feel was season strongest story mostly because of ned ned quits being the hand and it all ends with his fight with jaime its definitely not my favorite fight there are far better fights in the later seasons but its still cool to watch also a bit of a cliffhanger of an ending also no dany overall probably the best episode so far great kl best scene robert and cersei discussing stuff i believe its a show only scene and its one of the best written scenes in the entire show i think woah this got way longer than i wanted it to will make it shroter next time
gameofthrones,not_removed,a shows pilot episode establishes the tone of the whole show and got is no exception it ends with the attempted murder of a kid that has discovered brothersister incest the show is telling you yeah we will make brothers and sisters fuck and kill kids in this show prepare for a whole bunch more of this kind of shit
gameofthrones,not_removed,benjens scenes are so good maybe its just knowing that hell disappear for five seasons but watching him not to mention yoren in winterfell and at castle black is so satisfying its really a shame that he doesnt get more to do i know he has to go because jon snow cant have a badass uncle looking out for him and still be jon snow but joseph mawle was meant for the role
gameofthrones,not_removed,nice a recent thread i can actually participate in just did a review on and watching the final episode of tonight looking forward to doing the survey when i get home tonight d
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean i feel like they live in a world where they can do just about anything they think of so pushing a kid out of a window who just caught you have sex with your sister is probably pretty logical for a man who stabbed his king in the back
gameofthrones,not_removed,he is not a think first kinda person
gameofthrones,not_removed,or attacking ned in the middle of the streets
gameofthrones,not_removed,i doubt he knew how gifted bran was at climbingparkour let alone that others would suspect foul play especially those with some knowledge of how good he was at climbing or that hed actually survive
gameofthrones,not_removed,jaime is an impulsive person by nature he really doesnt think of the consequences before acting
gameofthrones,not_removed,season jamie is such an unrepentant bastard of a villain you can really see he was meant to be the primary human antagonist when things were first being put together
gameofthrones,not_removed,the jaime we had in season one was a very impulsive easily manipulated person he assumed cersei would want bran dead based on their previous history the jaime we have now would likely not kill bran based on that alone we saw his negotiation with edmure hes still capable of manipulation and coercion for sure but jaime would have followed through with his threats jaime only needed the castle
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean what would you do
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the book he comes to regret it basically because cersei was pissed off about it and bitches at him a lot for it haha
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah hes pretty hotheaded
gameofthrones,not_removed,careful not to wake the dragon
gameofthrones,not_removed,nonsense there is whispers of great support for his return to throne the people will it
gameofthrones,not_removed,hope youre enjoying it so far for your own safety make sure you look through the subreddit rules on spoiler tags if you dont want to see spoilers this post is tagged as so anything season is up for discussion
gameofthrones,not_removed,he really was a cunt
gameofthrones,not_removed,because of the way the show operates making the audience suffer villains like joffrey and ramsay for seasons i really expected viserys to last longer his death was a welcome gift during a season that spent more time building villains up than giving them what they deserve
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah after they have their initial sword exchange jaime backs up and looks so happy like wow ned stark finally a challenge then they fight some more evenly matched and ned even starts to overwhelm jaime a bit then they separate and jaime looks seriously flustered like holy fuck this guy seriously might actually beat me
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree completely that was a brilliant scene the anticlimactic ending of the fight is classic got but watching jaime slowly lose the smug look on his face as he realizes that ned may actually make him bleed before things are done was great ned may not be the greatest swordsman who ever lived but hes a seasoned warrior who walked away from a fight with three at this point it was still three kingsguard and thats back when kingsguard were actually worth something gerold hightower was nearly as fearsome as arthur dayne and they both died alongside oswell whent when ned and his men rode to the tower of joy not to mention his other feats in war such as the battle of the trident and the battles of the greyjoy rebellion i think theres something to be said about the exchange they have early on in lord snow jaime boasts that people have been swinging at him for years but always seem to miss and ned comments that he must have chosen his opponents wisely ned is used to fighting uphill battles whereas jaime has always been gifted not in just in battle but in life i like to think jaime is revisiting that conversation in his head when he starts to realize that ned is better than he thought
gameofthrones,not_removed,try the books its even worse
gameofthrones,not_removed,my excuse was season it finally delivered on a lot of the shows longterm story and character arcs and as a stark fan i was elated to finally witness a time for wolves rewatching the show when it was just three seasons was not very enticing season was excellent by my count and not a bad note to go out on but then season was another rather poor way to end a rewatch i want to rewatch the series now while i can before they make another crappy uneven season that kills my enthusiasm for the series again
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats definitely a big trope of the lannisters but if he hadnt done that all of kings landing would have been burned down
gameofthrones,not_removed,and he was just stabbing his sister from the back yep thats a valuable contribution to the discussion
gameofthrones,not_removed,hmmm who else do we know whos impulsive blond rich suspected of incest and wields significant political power
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would have played it off like oh sweet sister here is your contact lense
gameofthrones,not_removed,some of his lines are pure gold
gameofthrones,not_removed,hell never be the head of a major corporation
gameofthrones,not_removed,fire cannot kill a dragon
gameofthrones,not_removed,the old houses will flock to his cause right
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you lol ive read the books so i pretty much know what to expect but even still its nice to put faces to the names
gameofthrones,not_removed,dude spoilers he hasnt watched that yet
gameofthrones,not_removed,currently of the way through book already uncomfortable
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt season the end
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol i like to live in a world where the starks shove the north up the lannisters ass i can take ned being executed but oh hpw bad i wanted rob to lead the north to victory thanks for the nightmares grrm
gameofthrones,not_removed,his obsession with being crowned might rub people the wrong way
gameofthrones,not_removed,wouldnt it be awkward watching with your dad around the danydrogo part
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres season coming next year with episodes
gameofthrones,not_removed,i meanif youre getting off to it in front of your dad yes otherwise just make a joke about how awkward it is and itll be done in seconds
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh awesome i was worried this was gonna be the end so its like the sopranos with a split season
gameofthrones,not_removed,not a high opinion of drogo i see
gameofthrones,not_removed,controlling the wights is a mutant form of warging so it makes sense that there should be a biological host one doesnt simply warg into inanimate objects
gameofthrones,not_removed,at one point in hardhome you see a wight with an arrow through its head poking through the wooden palisade i think what happens when you kill them is that they are stopped for a bit
gameofthrones,not_removed,the one who gets shot in the face with an arrow stuck out to me too what i want to know is when the nk and jon have their stare down and the nk raises his hands did that wight rise again or were only the freshly dead turned into wights we saw all the wights jump off the cliff too and seemingly die from that then they all got back up again it seems like anything that would kill a human will temporarily shut down a wight but then theyre available to be resurrected again
gameofthrones,not_removed,the only thing that truly kills a wight is fire because it counters the ice magic inside them other stuff just slows them down at best
gameofthrones,not_removed,my best answer to this is its magic i think this theory gets a little too scientific when the night king is not scientific it makes sense to me that a skeleton would stop moving if you crushedseverely damaged its head
gameofthrones,not_removed,it doesnt have to make sense no everything has too
gameofthrones,not_removed,tv magic and audience expectation skeletons are a lot like zombies to most people explain a lot of the points that youre making in the books however the only way to kill a wight is with fire you can disable a wight with total dismemberment but the limbs will continue to act on their own fire however seems to destroy whatever binding spell is keeping the wight mobile so basically how does a wight move without skeletal muscles magic
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is a valid point like you pointed out only one in the show though at one point in the books the nw took a wights hand that was still moving in a jar to kings landing to show the king and try to get support and resources for the nw but before it got there it degraded too much and rotted to use as proof of wights this never sat well with me especially after the fight before the entrance to the cof cave when they were fighting skeletons if bones can fight then why wouldnt the bones in the jar still be struggling i know someone will argue that the magic that animates wights doesnt work that far from the north but dont think that is the case
gameofthrones,not_removed,its magic that is reanimating the wights it isnt like zombies where a virus needs a central nervous host so when dealing with magic you need to accept some degree of the illogical but if you were to attempt to look at it logically there is a difference between telekinesis and creating beings to do the actions for you if i were to make robots each could operate independently with my initial instructions however if i were to remotely control an object there would feasibly be a limit to what i could control at once as to flying axes perhaps their magic only allows them to control certain types of organic matter and not inorganic matter similar to hacking you can only control electrical devices and not a door window or person so perhaps the nights king is able to hack certain types of organic matter
gameofthrones,not_removed,not that this matters but arent those bones as inanimate as an axe or sword when there is no muscle ligament or tendon in place to connect and move them
gameofthrones,not_removed,pretty sure that skele wun wun pancaked is dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree on all points and my extremely unnecessary point is that if magic can substitute the effects of muscles and ligaments initiating motion then why cant the magic just initiate the motion of the weapon itself
gameofthrones,not_removed,because its the difference between boiling some water in a kettle and holding water above a flame until it boils just because you can use fire magic to boil move some water skellies doesnt mean youre capable of doing it without a vessel
gameofthrones,not_removed,literally as soon as the camera panned to heartsbane i yelled at the tv take it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the real question is whether dd will dedicate screen time to their escape from horn hill or will sam borrow littlefingers teleporter
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres a chance that he will meet some confrontation on his escape but i dont think they will dedicate much if any screen time on a clean escape
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe but i think they just showed us the three main kingsqueens in the show along with the night king
gameofthrones,not_removed,i had the same thought and thought that would have been brilliant because tywin always went on about how he hated tyrion and it would have been ironic is tyrion was his only real son that all this time he was hand to targaryens it would probably mean that jamie is going to die rather soon but that also got me thinking about the valonqar prophecy maybe hes turned and he kills cersei it probably isnt true but its interesting to think about
gameofthrones,not_removed,it has been speculated that king aerys was cersiejaimes father this could be true
gameofthrones,not_removed,wheres the basis in this theyre very consistent lannister like in their looks
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is some textual evidence that the targ features can be genetically inferior to others through the form of descriptions of targ bastards this coupled with the twins mother joannas description blond and green eyes and some hints that aerys took some liberties with joanna and fancied her is the main basis of the theory
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes for tyrion theres an almost plausible theory not the other two
gameofthrones,not_removed,having a scene where bran witnesses robb signing his will would be cool but i doubt the will makes it into the show jon has already been declared king so theres not really any need for robbs will as for little finger he knows the worth of a piece of paper theres going to be little finger fuckery no matter what

gameofthrones,not_removed,only secondsbut its really worth the look
gameofthrones,not_removed,no it really isnt
gameofthrones,not_removed,link to the amazon version i was asking about in case you needed it
gameofthrones,not_removed,from what ive read they seem almost perfect if i thought of how many times ive been reading while simultaneously referencing the world book or pulling up wiki pages wow
gameofthrones,not_removed,it looks like the kindle enhanced version is just got not the other books
gameofthrones,not_removed,he also hinted at maybe finishing a song of fire and ice
gameofthrones,not_removed,duncan and egg that one
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah he already wrote something of a prequel that takes place like a little less than years prior to got pretty strong hint thar
gameofthrones,not_removed,truththat definitely needs to happen first
gameofthrones,not_removed,he outright said he would be finishing the books firstand the shows before he would even consider it your title is misleading perhaps listen to the mans speech
gameofthrones,not_removed,remind me has their been any mention of aegon being alive in the show or only in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,i believe that jamie being the one valonquar to kill cersei would be better for the overall plot of the show while seeing ayra scratching another name from her hit list would be satisfying jame killing his older twin sister to potentially save the population of kings landing would be more satisfying
gameofthrones,not_removed,i still hold jamie to kill her same as he did with the other mad king
gameofthrones,not_removed,first we know that valonquar means little brother but in high valyrian terms are gender neutral we know the word for princeprincess is gender neutral kepa means father muno means mother haedar means little sister mandia means older sister valonqar means little brother just because nouns are gender neutral doesnt mean they have no way to differentiate between brother and sister
gameofthrones,not_removed,does arya count as the youngest shes the youngest still alive but rickon was younger than her
gameofthrones,not_removed,many believe jamie will kill her but now that tyrion is coming back to westeros i think hes gonna deliver the final blow
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is an irresistible symmetry inherent to jamie and cersei dying together the particulars are less important she could die with his golden hand choking her out as the throne weeps molten iron amidst green flame they could go out the highest window in kings landing together as a throwback to their son and bran perhaps we are misinterpreting the prophecy in terms of the valonquar murdering her maybe his hands are at her throat to stop the bleeding after arya slits it regardless of the details jaime and cersei will leave this world as they entered it together the rest matters not
gameofthrones,not_removed,i guess its jaime who will kill cersei just because he hates the term kingslayer and now he has to do it again to protect westeros shut down the mad kingqueen again its simply more likeable
gameofthrones,not_removed,what if arya takes the face of the valonquar either jamie or tyrion to kill her thus satisfying the prophecy while simultaneously satisfying her list
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would be really disappointed and left unsatisfied if arya was to kill her
gameofthrones,not_removed,couldnt you have searched for this topic before posting its been discussed more times than you have letters in this paragraph
gameofthrones,not_removed,and with that glare at the end of the season theres definitely something about to go down
gameofthrones,not_removed,it has to be jaime
gameofthrones,not_removed,potentially save the population of kings landing i think he kills her for other reasons jamie and her never cared for other people fuck other people or some such thing he said to her last time
gameofthrones,not_removed,queenslayer
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont forget his lover it would be tragic as fuck
gameofthrones,not_removed,if jaime is the one to kill her i dont see the duel with ser gregor going well assuming jaime has to fight him
gameofthrones,not_removed,welp there goes my theory maybe bran anyone
gameofthrones,not_removed,valonquar means younger brother not youngest you just need an older sibling to forfill the prophecy thats why jaime is a possibility
gameofthrones,not_removed,i honestly didnt know that and came up with it all by myself
gameofthrones,not_removed,that glare cant believe we have to wait ages for season now c
gameofthrones,not_removed,well i think its not about to go down right away maybe episode next season
gameofthrones,not_removed,he killed the mad king because he was going to kill everyone with wild fire so id say its certainly a possibility plus jamie is very different from who he was in season episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,queens layer
gameofthrones,not_removed,patent application a rounded device mounted on an axle to facilitate rolling
gameofthrones,not_removed,cerceis been arguably the main villain white walkers excepted of the show since season she deserves an episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,there are no more episode short seasons
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn it for a few blissful minutes i forgot about that
gameofthrones,not_removed,the maester samwell meets in oldtown is using what i assume are glasses when he first walks up to the desk
gameofthrones,not_removed,there are myrish lenses in the books that act as a telescope and binoculars depending on setup and there is a character known as the reader that is known to use one to help him read so at least some people use them as rudimentary glasses as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,glasses were invented in the real world sometime in the late but were very uncommon for a very long time they didnt become more common until the far after the time period of game of thrones
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont believe glasses even rudimentary single lenses were common until late in the middle ages long after the equivalent time period got is set in even then they would have been restricted to the very rich due to expense and fragility not something you would expect a commoner to be able to afford
gameofthrones,not_removed,i had similar thoughts when sam told jon about how bad his eyesight was the scene atop the wall when sam first joins the nw i thought why doesnt anyone wear glasses in that world i believe its because glasses only became commonplace in the real world in recent centuries and were not common in the middle ages the era on which got is based
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was just thinking about this last night when i was watching season for the first time shortly after i saw the scene where sam went to the citadel library for the first time and the librarian was wearing reading glasses that was good enough for me during the battle of the bastards i found myself wondering how so many men are able to fight in armies without any ailments holding them back from participating in combat
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think you need to realize that things like dental hygiene spectacles and all that similar stuff was pretty far flung from most people who werent rich or well off enough to even know and pay someone for something like that if you needed it no insurance providers in westeros in the traditional sense i think back then even a lords first thought upon realizing he has poor vision would be to get glasses he would just be like eh thats my lot in life who needs glasses when you have gold and men to fight for you if you were a soldier or peasant who got whacked in the head and went crosseyed you just learned to fightlive while seeing funny maesters are helpful to small folk but they arent everywhere i imagine if anyone would be making spectacles it would be them otherwise youd find them maybe in some foreign places outside westeros but again there would probably be some guy whod just invented them for his son or something and then started trying to more
gameofthrones,not_removed,that spoiler tag was fine lenses are invented they do have some telescopes or spyglasses having lenses small enough to wear on your face but still be effective as glasses is the trick they havent done that in westeros but i think one of the books says lys or something makes better lenses they might there
gameofthrones,not_removed,i had this revelation after reading the series that there is no male masturbation or sandwiches lotsa mysteries in westeros that i really need gurm to get to
gameofthrones,not_removed,no one told tyrion about having vision problems so glasses havent been invented
gameofthrones,not_removed,they are a hassle to work with because of all the fake lighting coming from everywhere during shooting my guess is that they simply didnt bother unless it was necessary
gameofthrones,not_removed,using them to read a book thats why i think the last chapterscene will be samsome maester closing a book and saying and that younglings was the game of star thrones wars wait a sec
gameofthrones,not_removed,good info but i would call it a technologically equivalent time period or something since this is not our earth or our history and also that got has apparently been stuck in the for thousands of years just a small thing that always pops up in my mind ever since first watching the show with a friend who is a music teacher that complained that a song someone sang or played was not relative to their time period for stuff like reading glasses however i think your way of thinking can be applied
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah glasses and mobile phones are totally comparable
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree i was just pointing out that it looks like glasses to some extent are used in got world
gameofthrones,not_removed,it also just could be because glasses read as modern to tv audiences even in time periods where they were legit just like it looked weird to op it may be a conscious choice on the part of show producers to avoid something that reads as anachronism

gameofthrones,not_removed,nothing that major interesting stuff anyway
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow
gameofthrones,not_removed,spot on holy crap
gameofthrones,not_removed,what can cersei expect to gain from this without the reach as allies with winter coming and with daenerys holding most of winterfell kings landing will just be a starving desperate trap where many of the citizens have seen the queen naked and everybody is hungry and fearing dragons and wishing they were somewhere else anywhere else it wont do anything but buy her some time it wont make daenerys go away
gameofthrones,not_removed,why would daenerys care her greatest advisors are from casterly rock naarth bear island and the summer isles sure kings landing has some significance for tyrion and it is the ancestral seat of house targaryen after dragonstone but tyrions final memories are of being secreted away after murdering his father and lover after seeing one of his few allies brutally killed in a trial by combat that only happened because his sister accused him of murdering his nephew and it would be a greater parallel to aegon the conquerer if daenerys had to build her own city sure there are the people about a half million who are going to possibly see daenerys as evil because she is bringing thousands of raping barbarians to their doorstep
gameofthrones,not_removed,this seems pretty solid no tinfoil required here
gameofthrones,not_removed,sure there are the people about a half million who are going to possibly see daenerys as evil because she is bringing thousands of raping barbarians to their doorstep im not convinced that shes willing to write off half a million innocent smallfolk lives just because theyre not rooting for her
gameofthrones,not_removed,and she also has allies from highgarden and sunspear as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,she would care because destruction of the entire city means death to a huge number of innocent people
gameofthrones,not_removed,shell try to make common cause and sway them like she did the citizens of meereen then cersei will burn down the city or the lannister loyalists reveal themselves and daenerys burns down the city herself theres no way the city doesnt burn
gameofthrones,not_removed,neither of which have anyone of import within kings landing
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think shell finally realise that if she wants to secure the throne sacrifices have to be made at some point
gameofthrones,not_removed,lannister loyalists thinking about itthis show needs another red weddingesque betrayalthe last one was amazing to watchpetyr
gameofthrones,not_removed,in other words i jon snow the guy that you all named king in the north as my first decree as king make it possible for me to be king wait wut point is he doesnt need to be legitimized the lords of the north have pledged fealty to him thats enough
gameofthrones,not_removed,he doesnt need to be legitimized as a stark ever the houses of the north already follow him plus the wildlings if he wanted the iron throne he would need proof and yes it would be hard until someone howland reed steps forward with information leading to the whereabouts of the wedding cloak or silver harp etc etc
gameofthrones,not_removed,my theory is that rhaegar had the mad king draw up a quick legitimization for jonno when the rebellion started then once it became clear that robert would kill every targaryen he could find rhaegar decided to keep it secret then through some conspiracy possibly involving rhaegar aemon benjen andor pycelle it was arranged that the document would be hidden in the citadel until it was safe to legitimize him and make him king however by the time robert died jon had already taken the black so the letter still resides unopened in the citadel where sam will find it
gameofthrones,not_removed,uh jon stark sounds so weird
gameofthrones,not_removed,someone else brought this up earlier even if jon could i doubt he would as far as he knows his father didnt legitimise him or make any effort to and jon would probably see his legitimisation as contrary to ned starks wishes
gameofthrones,not_removed,rhaegars father was the king at the time so couldnt he have allowed rhaegar to marry lyanna while still being married to elia or sign a proclamation that rhaegars child be legitimized if they were not married this is also assuming rhaegar told his crazy ass father he got her preggers
gameofthrones,not_removed,occams razor it seems like in a show like this that this principle seems unfathomable but jon becoming jon stark doesnt seem like it would be hard to accomplish
gameofthrones,not_removed,they didnt call him jon stark they called him jon snow
gameofthrones,not_removed,rightits helpful if hes going to unite the kingdoms not just the north into following him isnt that why people were talking about if there was a letter from robb stark legitimizing jon while robb was also the king of the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,more to the point the northern lords have effectively legitimized him
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes jon snow the king
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon snow just sounds like such a good name for a northerner thats why i always type his full name even though hes the only jon in the story at this point i hope he doesnt change it to stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah but that was before we saw the lords uniting behind him now it doesnt matter what mattered about that letter was that robb legetimized him which could make the lord rally behind him in the battle of the bastards but since they have done that already well after the battle but still it really doesnt make any difference i had a theory that the blackfish was gonna tell him because as far as i can remember he was in robbs council and knew about this decision i had a dream scenerio where the first thing he does when he sees jon is bow down before his king but alas blackfish had a different destiny
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah fuck it start house snow and come up with another northern bastard name kinda like argilac did
gameofthrones,not_removed,inanorf
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn poor jbear i need to rewatch the series to catch up on all the foreshadowing i missed
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe the reason quaithe has a mask is because she had greyscale
gameofthrones,not_removed,this man must sail past old valyria all who travel too close to the doom must have protection as a skeptic i would say its just a way to make some money and gain some power and influence in the local region without having to actually do anything if jorah recalled that conversation perhaps he will seek out quaithe or another shadowbinder from asshai while in search for a cure just because shes selling condoms doesnt mean she can cure an std the other problem with this theory is that the book character that has greyscale is already back in westeros with a shorter season i think they have to start converging story lines and its more likely jorah goes to the citadel to find a cure and meets sam
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like the theory that he will replace victarion from the books and will end up with his own red priest who will heal his hand but make it a flaming one and convince him that hes azor ahai
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes i remember hearing somewhere that some changes were planned from quite early on for example i heard they planned ramsaysansa as early as season
gameofthrones,not_removed,i personally dont think we will be seeing essos again so they either dont show him getting cured and he will just pop up cured all the sudden or he will seek the cure in westeros perhaps he will go to the citadel and meet sam thatd be cool jorah is kind of a mystery to me in terms of how he will end up
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh how i would love it if we got to see quaithe again this foreshadowing makes me wonder if dd had planned since early seasons for jbear to adopt part of the plot of jc in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,good catch always catching new tidbits or things that relate to the books on rewatchesmy watch has not ended yet also wish quaithe had a bigger part in the show as in the books you get explanations in the books where in the show leaves you wondering wtf sometimes if you didnt read the books first
gameofthrones,not_removed,good observastion
gameofthrones,not_removed,i do agree that it is more likely that jorah will seek out the cure in oldtown however discounting quaithe as some snake oil salesmen is a little rash she is a shadowbinder from asshai for one more importantly in that same conversation she asks jorah if he will betray dany again the only people who knew of jorahs informing at that time were roberts small council while its possible quaithe has ties to varys and that he told her about jorah for some reason it is much more likely she obtained the information through magic means in the book she communicates with dany while she sleeps aboard her boat balerion it is assumed this is done via glass candle so it is possible she learned of jorahs treachery through the same means i defiantly do not think that connington will seek out quaithe in the books if jorah and quaithe ever spoke in the books we did not hear that conversation which is why i think the showrunners added it as possible foreshadowing for jorahs show arc
gameofthrones,not_removed,except that we know this std is curable because stannis clearly found a way somehow for his own daughter and right now there is really no one else in the realm who has shown to have as much knowledge of the doom as she has
gameofthrones,not_removed,as a skeptic im going to lean towards a natural explanation than magic when both are possible which is why i think the showrunners added it as possible foreshadowing for jorahs show arc i would say its just to introduce the idea of greyscale so later on when jorah gets it it doesnt come out of nowhere so it is foreshadowing but its only foreshadowing a character getting greyscale not the eventual cure
gameofthrones,not_removed,because stannis clearly found a way somehow for his own daughter actually we dont we know that she stopped showing symptoms other than the scarring and she wasnt currently contagious but does that mean she was cured or that the disease was just dormant if you look at real diseases like chickenpox the virus can remain dormant for decades and then reappear as shingles httpsenwikipediaorgwikishingles shingles is due to a reactivation of varicella zoster virus vzv within a persons body chickenpox is due to an initial infection with vzv once chickenpox has resolved the virus may remain inactive in nerve cells when it reactivates it travels from the nerve body to the endings in the skin producing blisters risk factors for reactivation include old age poor immune function and having had chickenpox before months of age how the virus remains in the body or subsequently reactivates is not well understood westeros doesnt appear to even have a the germ theory of disease yet so i think its silly to throw the term cure around
gameofthrones,not_removed,but we have shireen to introduce greyscale
gameofthrones,not_removed,stannis blames a doll for giving it to her if you dont have other modes of transmission explained you need to explain who gave jorah a doll p
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont need to explain anything jorah says himself while he and tyrion are sailing through valyria that the stone men are the ones to give others greyscale make sure not to touch them theyve been sent here in exile to not infect others thats all the explanation that is needed shireen just gets us accustomed to seeing it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont need to explain anything i was using you in the sense of the show runners who we were talking about not you specifically i should have been more precise with my wording when you used we but we have shireen i thought you wanted to have the conversation as if we were the show runners jorah says himself while he and tyrion are sailing through valyria if its introduced at that point its clumsy story telling that seems like they just made it up and now have to explain it referencing it earlier shows that they were thinking about it for a while it also helps to give an air of mystery and intrigue to the rest of the show if they mention something in season only to use as a plot device several seasons later that means the rest of the show could have all sorts of references that we havent connected yet
gameofthrones,not_removed,right i get what youre saying im just saying that with all the discussion about greyscale with shireen we already have a very good idea of what the disease is even without quaithe mentioning the doom which is still unclear for many viewers including me when i first watched so assuming we take out the quaithe scene its still not a foreign concept when tyrion and jorah sail through they dont have to do any introducing they just have to clarify how the greyscale can get transmitted the actual point of all this discussion on my end is that i agree that quaithes scene was put in for a reason other than introducing greyscale i dont think weve seen the last of her for that reason
gameofthrones,not_removed,god that whole scene was so awkwardi loved it
gameofthrones,not_removed,g they go through the whores entry the ho door
gameofthrones,not_removed,couple of things going on first of all hes distracted and absentminded his troubles with women are constantly on his mind he might be a little nuts frankly second of all what he learned from that line from tywin is that none of the nobles actually have a clue what happens to whores when they arent well whoring nor do they care i read that as an implication of his question which is never answered iirc
gameofthrones,not_removed,and thanks guys i didnt think this posted it told me it failed lol guess not but i really feel like tyrion took it literally and tywin just gave him a smart ass answer
gameofthrones,not_removed,the link was a blank page
gameofthrones,not_removed,its not a link its a spoiler just hover over the green bar to read the text

gameofthrones,not_removed,you mean just hi rez
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah wow he really does look like he could be related to emilia clarke harry lloyd and kit harrington
gameofthrones,not_removed,httpiimgurcomvfntqpzjpg
gameofthrones,not_removed,hmm he has starred in fantasy before but it was the eragon movie still if memory serves he was one of the stronger parts of it
gameofthrones,not_removed,my god as a male i wish i was that attractive lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think he was murtagh eragons brother i read the books back in the day murtagh was supposed to be a cool character early on and they raped the entire story in the movie haha that movie was as bad as the last airbender
gameofthrones,not_removed,id say the eragon movie was utter shit but its nowhere near as bad as the last airbender for starters last airbender had far stronger source material yet ended up as bad as it did and the acting in eragon was at least competent where airbender might be the worst acted big budget movie ever
gameofthrones,not_removed,i liked how firelord ozai was just some clean cut looking dude who wore black in the show firelord ozai was the epitome of evil fucking scary looking hair buff and ripped and super powerful with his bending

gameofthrones,not_removed,no storyline could make that work
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually looked up constellations once to see if there was a giant in our sky somewhere the westeros planet could be the giants eye i wanted to see if there was some mythos that would shed light on the story i cant remember what i found specifically though i do recall there being a few constellations where it could have worked thats all conjecture in regards to season i think well just find out that the night king has been watching and possibly manipulating everything
gameofthrones,not_removed,like that idea that the eye story is related to a constellation or just a myth of some sort maybe grrm found a myth from some older culture with a similar tale dunno but if it is important to the show question could then become why do the westoros people have that story and was that myth inspired by the abilities of the night king in the first place perhaps even as an encoded warning to future generations whatever the case i think that giant eye story is one oddest details in asoiaf
gameofthrones,not_removed,it makes more sense for this to be margaery since they already call each other sister and hate each other
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres no mention of valonqar in the show maggie didnt tell the same prophecy that is in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,another possibility but with tommen being dead what will she gain by killing her yeah she hates her but with enough bitterness as arya
gameofthrones,not_removed,i meant it that she will be cerseis killer not in the sense of the valonqar prophecy come true but just because she is one of the people that could

gameofthrones,not_removed,no walder frey is old af and had wives and tons of kids hes at no shortage of heirs
gameofthrones,not_removed,too many freys they are like roaches you can never kill them all
gameofthrones,not_removed,the freys are one of the most prolific houses in westeros in the books some frey kids get sent to winterfell to be wards as part of catelyn and robbs deal to get passage at the twins those kids when theyre talking to bran are trying to work out where they stand in line to the lordship i think it was like somethingth look how many daughters and grand daughters the guy has hes not craster there are sons and grandsons around too lothar and black walder were just his most senior two in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,hell yea man i was so lost at the end of season because there were so many unanswered questions at least now they didnt leave too many plotlines open jon is king cersei is queen dany left mereen arya is in westeros bran is at the wall etc etc i am still hyped up but ive been able to control myself so farbut i know when that trailer drops i will lose my shit
gameofthrones,not_removed,i started reading the books after season so now and then ill do a casual scene rewatch whenever i feel excited about ill just read another chapter in the books its sort of new for me the real problem begins after ends
gameofthrones,not_removed,this next season is going to be some of the most awesome scenes from game of thrones
gameofthrones,not_removed,ust the simple nedrob conversation did you know the king like that lol jk jk p
gameofthrones,not_removed,last year was pretty bad too knowing the show had caught up with almost everything at that point it was a new feeling not knowing in what general direction we were going with huge answers that no one knew the answer too anymore like is jon actually dead so in that way i guess this wait is alright because weve been through not knowing what lies ahead i would love a release date though
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive been so hooked since season it hasnt left my thoughts at all im afraid of the void it will leave when it ends
gameofthrones,not_removed,im still fortunately in the middle of a series rewatch with a friend of mine who had never seen any of it were on episode of season so we still have some show to watch especially since we only get episodes in per week its keeping me sustained and im still picking up on new things that i missed
gameofthrones,not_removed,id love to see which clips you watched
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have been particularly excited for the new season lately i think its because were past the half way mark and we should be due a trailer soon
gameofthrones,not_removed,well my phone background is back to being something got related so hell yeah its about that time again
gameofthrones,not_removed,i am still hyped up but ive been able to control myself so farbut i know when that trailer drops i will lose my shit id imagine thats of this sub
gameofthrones,not_removed,bran is at the wall wait what did i miss something from last season
gameofthrones,not_removed,just started reading the books after season as well im currently on a storm of swords i love all of the extra details and mythology in the books compared to the show the books keep reminding me how awesome the show is casted though i always imagine the actors when im reading the characters lines
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,wanna show what it is ive been in need of a new wallpaper
gameofthrones,not_removed,benjen dropped meera and bran off at a wooded area right by the wall right before bran finds out what happened in the tower heres the clip
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah by my calculations wow might i know might come out when im caught up with the books chances are that i find a wife shell bare my children and my children will read ados before ido because by the time it comes out im old and fragile and not a quick reader anymore
gameofthrones,not_removed,neat thank you
gameofthrones,not_removed,the same part where jon and samm took their nw vows
gameofthrones,not_removed,poor meera still has to drag him about a km across open ground lets hope the nw sends rangers their way
gameofthrones,not_removed,inconsiderate benjen could he have not dropped them a bit closer to the wall i understand benjen cant cross the wall but cant he get within a hundred yards of it
gameofthrones,not_removed,not exactly sure what youre asking but bran caused it to happen if bran never channels his greenseeing ability hodor stays wyllis sp and basically a number of events never happen its all kinda confusing to explain but hodor starts hodoring bc of branmeera unless i interpreted it wrong
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a weirdly confusing time travel paradox you see what happens is while bran hodor and meera escape in real time bran is still asleep experiencing a vision of winterfell in the days when hodor eddard lyanna bran and benjen were still children ned is leaving to be fostered at the eyrie by jon arryn back in present time the skeleton army is gaining on them and theyve just made it out of the tunnel into the open in order to keep them from persuing meera instructs hodor to block the entrance with the phrase hold the door young hodor then hears this through brans ears somehow maybe because the vision is in his head and proceeds to spazz out having a seizure while shouting the phrase hold the door which eventually slurrs into the word hodor from which his nickname stems so young hodors speech function of his mind possibly shocked by the trauma of witnessing the nature of his own death years before it happens becomes focused only on that one word of hodor because it ultimately becomes his grand purpose in life of protecting his lord bran stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not an expert searching reddit but if you can search for posts on this topic from the day after the original aired there were quite a few good ones one in particular was a handy venn diagram of sorts that let you visualize how bran was warging in two different times and how hodor got pulled in etc
gameofthrones,not_removed,you didnt this is it bran is visiting the past with his greensight and when he wargs into hodor wyliss senses cant handle being in two places at once and hearing meera say hold the door causes him to hodor
gameofthrones,not_removed,its pretty much like what came first the chicken or the egg its just one of those things
gameofthrones,not_removed,that was incredibly in depth im shocked thank you
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like how hodor is a noun and a verb now
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you very much
gameofthrones,not_removed,the hodor or the hodor obviously its the hodor
gameofthrones,not_removed,the egg came first its always been the egg whatever birds were use to breed chickens made the egg that we became happy with and stopped selective breeding so chicken is only right if we are saying the proto chicken is the same as a chicken so rather who is the egg hodor or bran
gameofthrones,not_removed,once we make it an adjective were all set
gameofthrones,not_removed,and stopped selective breeding if you think we ever stopped selective breeding then you have no idea what happens in a barn
gameofthrones,not_removed,its bout to be a prepositional phrase
gameofthrones,not_removed,robert in the books was and strong as all fuck mark addy as good as he was at playing the older fatter drunk robert didnt really do a good job of painting the picture of robert once being a great and imposing warrior when robert said gods i was strong then he wasnt lying
gameofthrones,not_removed,robert was an animal at fighting rhaegar had never been in a fight robert strength is mentioned a lot i doubt rhaegar could block a hammer blow and in water it would be hard to dodge
gameofthrones,not_removed,none of the actors who played a baratheon really represented their characters appearance well i know how large robert was but size and strength arent always the advantage to skill and speed im not saying robert wasnt skilled but theres a good possibility rhaegar was the better fighter if the fight were on dry land rhaegar would be able to move faster on his feet to dodge and counter the swing of a hammer in the water robert would have a much easier time getting rhaegar off balance to slip and catch a blow robert may have bested him and he may have gotten lucky truthfully all that matters is he lived and rhaegar died im just curious of what actually happened
gameofthrones,not_removed,warhammers became popular because armor kept evolving to the point where swords were hard to get a kill with every armor has weak spots but when someone is swinging a giant hammer at you its going to be very hard to precisely land a thrust into an armor gap i also think i remember hearing grrm say the fight was on horseback never indicating they dismounted and fought this would explain how the killing blow was so hard it knocked all the rubies out of his armor you arent going to get a sword into a gap while riding a horse in full gallop
gameofthrones,not_removed,looking into it more youre right it doesnt sound like they dismounted at all warhammer vs sword armored on horseback sounds like shit odds for rhaegar
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont know if you have seen it or not but there is a really cool image depicting their clash httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpfiletwoiafbattleofthetridentjpg
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think theres nothing to it being plural theres a lot of implications in taking in jon as his own bastard son hes lying to his wife and telling her she has to live with the proof of his infidelities and hes lying to his best friend about lyanna and rhaegors child hes allowing the world to think lyanna was raped and not in love theres so much wrapped up in taking jon in as his own i dont think its just one simple promise
gameofthrones,not_removed,he would also need to keep the secret and never tell anyone that he remained faithful to his wife or wild obi wan theory here she had twins
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah ive heard that theory saying that ned took jon and then howland too meera right i think that would be pretty cool because i like meera but its not likely
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like the metallic shading you did on the mane continue that on the face too
gameofthrones,not_removed,painter here depends on what youre looking for personally the number one issue i have it that your light source seems to be a bit uneven you need to visualise the light hitting your object in your mind and paint light and dark accordingly for this reason id suggest lightening the top to the neck and fading that into a much darker lower section id look to blend in the brush strokes a bit more and depending on whether youre going for more of a stylised sigil or a more realistic wolf id maybe consider using a wide rough bristled brush to pull out the suggestion of hairs overall though a really bold design and a good starting point
gameofthrones,not_removed,actually asking whats left to do whats unfinished about it in your eyes cause it looks amazing great job
gameofthrones,not_removed,here i finished it free of charge
gameofthrones,not_removed,try adding a bit of grey to the head like youve done to the neck
gameofthrones,not_removed,sign your name in the lower right corner thats it
gameofthrones,not_removed,with all the great shading to the neck plates the bottom of the jaw looks a little plain and empty and the top of the head is a little mono in shades as well almost as if you go from black and white to a greyscale as you go down the neck if thats the artistic intent it works well but since your fishing for some critique i figured my cents wouldnt hurt besides adding a touch of depth to the head i would say your good to go if you think it still needs something else maybe some snowflakesash to fill or balance the background
gameofthrones,not_removed,the shading on the mane in the middle is a little uneven i would brighten up the pieces that are all there and maybe define some of the edges a bit more but it looks really great and i love the way you shaded it just make the shading a bit more uniform and youve sold me
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe just a little more titanium white edging to make all of the individual polys pop out
gameofthrones,not_removed,a link to the image i think youre recreating
gameofthrones,not_removed,nonartistic person here so take anything i say with skepticism i think the top left corner is to much black imo unfortunately i cannot think a way to improve it maybe the canvas it to high maybe the subject is to low it tend to the former
gameofthrones,not_removed,no words maybe snowflakes falling to signal the winter
gameofthrones,not_removed,thick red acrylic paint splatters done
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not an artist so take my opinion with a grain of salt but since the wolf is on the lower part and there is an unused black area on top what if you added a skyline of pine trees a weirwood tree and some mountains or something but just lightly and kind of faded so that the wolf remains the main part of the painting or somebody already said just red splatters of paint i think that would look cool maybe since ice is their family weapon you could use blue instead idk hope i helped
gameofthrones,not_removed,needs purple eyes if you k ow what i mean
gameofthrones,not_removed,id add a racing stripe and flames for maximum coolness
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it looks good the way it is dont want to over do it
gameofthrones,not_removed,let me know when you are putting it on sale highly interested
gameofthrones,not_removed,some snow falling from above because the wolf is lower on the canvas you need something from above to balance it all out looks good so far
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would love to own a copy of this would it be possible to sell an art print of this on
gameofthrones,not_removed,if you change anything on it please share
gameofthrones,not_removed,hang on wall looks great
gameofthrones,not_removed,sign it
gameofthrones,not_removed,small line of blood dripping from the mouth
gameofthrones,not_removed,the face needs a bit more contrast theres too much white with not enough gray or black to break it up
gameofthrones,not_removed,i suffered from never feeling like my paintings and drawings were complete for a while getting opinions like this is absolutely the way to go now since youre doing this youll likely get a lot of opinion so id recommend you putting this into photoshop and making minor additions slowly that way you dont make any that cant be undone on a personal note i think just a touch of blue would really set this off
gameofthrones,not_removed,you need to finish the head reflections man look up images of the silver surfer for help with what reflections look like on organic material
gameofthrones,not_removed,not a huge fan of lettering on something so simple in nature but theres juuuust enough space under the chin to write something like the north remembers
gameofthrones,not_removed,as a painter myself you could just add the stark name in got style letteringhouse stark or the north remembers or winter is cominghas come in the lower right to take up negative space as a fan of paintings i like titles on my novelty items so if done with the got show lettering style it could look really good
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is finished hang it enjoy it one day if you decide differently you can revisit it and finish at that time
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe you could put jon snows face behind the wolf probably a dumb suggestion i just think that would be really cool also it looks absolutely amazing fantastic job
gameofthrones,not_removed,best thing is to put down the brush and move on to the next project then come and look at it with fresh eyes you might be happy with it as is
gameofthrones,not_removed,add snow falling to it
gameofthrones,not_removed,that things done dude i love it
gameofthrones,not_removed,dickbutt paint dickbutt on there dont actually do that it looks amazing as is
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe winter is coming on the top
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe a clear coat to certain features of the direwolf to enhance its depth although it looks great as is
gameofthrones,not_removed,send it to my address
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe try defining the edges and outlines everywhere and maybe play around with blending here and there to add some interesting bits i would agree now that i look closer that there are parts that feel unfinished but overall its in a good place in your shoes i would probably add more paints in the fur area first blend it haphazardly with my fingers step back repeat or refine until i felt like there was enough texture or movement i take forever to get to the point where i feel a painting is done though
gameofthrones,not_removed,personally id finish filling in all the blocks but keep that only one shade in a block kind of thing so each block is a different shade of grey fifty shades of dire and is only that shade of grey no gradients within the block i think its called a prism effect not sure too sleepy
gameofthrones,not_removed,add more depth to the face its too flat more shadows and highlights i like the idea of the red splatter if you go with that id put red highlights in the sigil too nothing to heavy just super slight so it blends but isnt too noticeable
gameofthrones,not_removed,a splash of color somewhere
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe you could fill the extra dark space with the branches of a weirwood tree disclaimer not an art guy just though the red would contrast nicely with the grey and black
gameofthrones,not_removed,sign it and hang it up
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think cleaning up the lines in the face would help making them sharper as you have nice points on the neck fur but when you look up at the front most of the lines are rounded at lease somewhere i agree it looks unfinished in the face as the rest has shadingdifferent tones of grey i would also say make the eye more distinct aka bit more black around the outside
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think maybe lighten up on some shading around the neck some of it looks too dark and uneven other than that i think it looks awesome
gameofthrones,not_removed,looks great as is but maybe a background that looks like wood grain it would clash with the metalish looking direwolf
gameofthrones,not_removed,the colours are quite monochrome near the eye and ear maybe add a bit more shading around there
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe add some snow
gameofthrones,not_removed,needs a top hat
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it looks unfinished because the black of the background is showing through in areas and so it looks as if patches are unfinished like a paint by numbers that has some bits left blank atleast i think thats why it is looking like it needs somthing more i have no idea how you would remedy it but thats the reason i think dont get me wrong looks awesome but i understand where you are coming from that it does not look quite done
gameofthrones,not_removed,the picture is not balanced the sigil sits more to the bottom and left of the canvas if you were to add anything id focus on the upper right hand side so it will feel more balanced
gameofthrones,not_removed,it looks great as it is but if you still want to add to it you could put a sweet as quote on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,need more greys like the neck in the face once thats balanced out its perfect
gameofthrones,not_removed,it doesnt look cold enough everything to do with the starks revolves around winter coming and snowy cold stuff maybe add some snow falling or maybe ignore me cause i havent gotten an artistic bone in my body p
gameofthrones,not_removed,i face this dilemma a lot myself as an artist sometimes its done but im having fun and just dont want to be done painting it
gameofthrones,not_removed,the snout and face of the wolf is much flatter than neck which has more depth and shading maybe continue that theme on the face and snout also you could maybe have something going on in the background some kind of theme otherwise it looks too uniform imo
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont know much about painting but i do graphic design with this i would first shade the head same way as the mane also im not sure about the background the gradient is nice but somehow i feel the relation of colors or something is kinda off hard to put a finger on it also i dont know how hard its to do but it would be kinda cool if you added snowflakes and embers like snow falling down and embers rising up
gameofthrones,not_removed,leave as is or make it more official the direwolf should be more grey and the background white but if the stark banner wasnt what you were going for then i would leave it as is looks pretty cool maybe just leave it as it is and move to another got house sigil
gameofthrones,not_removed,get a brush and some crimson red with a mix of water let the brush soak for a while hold it vertical about away from the top left corner and with your index and middle finger ruffle through the bristles and let the paint fling onto the corner do that twice with a full brush each time then the time dont refill the brush and start from the same spot but glide your hand diagonally to the bottom right while slinging paint i saw someone do that once and it looked really good to add to it you can take some unmixed paint and dip your fingers in and fling it like that for more texture
gameofthrones,not_removed,you have shading in the fur but not as much in the face i would add similar color to the face to match relatively to the fur if you follow it backwards if that makes sense im not very good with words
gameofthrones,not_removed,my suggestion is put house stark in the bottom right corner other than that id say its great as is
gameofthrones,not_removed,for filling the space maybe make some of the lower metal pieces orange real hot as if they just came of the forge and some sparkles as when you hit the metal with a hammer it would bring in a fire aspect as in dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think youve done a good job with this if you want to work on it some more i would say focus on what your original vision for it was are you trying to make it match the silver gray of the promo images or trying to keep this sharp contrast between the dark and light colors
gameofthrones,not_removed,add the guy rowing
gameofthrones,not_removed,put it in a frame
gameofthrones,not_removed,put a dark bold outline around it and paint a wintery background perhaps beyond the wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would add some red or a deep crimson to the background to really make the wolf pop the wolf looks great but something looks missing from the background just too much empty space in my opinion
gameofthrones,not_removed,it looks perfect but if you are trying to sell it maybe paint a windsnowstorm effect in the background i think that will make it amazing
gameofthrones,not_removed,splatter blood on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i imagine you dont want replies from people afraid to apply constructive criticism its a great start here are some thoughts on how to finish it up a bit the head is black and white there is a lot of texture and depth to the neck that just isnt there in the head take a step back and you feel differently about the two halves also im not sure about all the scales of the neck some are brighter or darker than i think they should be in the middle but i cant put my finger on it lastly im not so sure about the white outlines at the bottom of the jaw the teeth the white outlines of the head cheapen the realism you achieved in the neck great start but dont let the internet compliment you into thinking its done i hope this helps
gameofthrones,not_removed,add some blue and red
gameofthrones,not_removed,looks complete to me and also amazing work maybe some house words or a stark quote that really speaks to you
gameofthrones,not_removed,my recommendation if youre savvy with the photoshops is to scan or take a picture of it and take it digital mess with the back ground mess with putting streaks through it fucking around on photoshop and not having to commit to anything helps a lot
gameofthrones,not_removed,add a darker shade of black to deeply shadowed areas
gameofthrones,not_removed,a frame
gameofthrones,not_removed,nothing
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe a light silhouette of winterfell
gameofthrones,not_removed,eat it it looks delicious
gameofthrones,not_removed,make the background a banner
gameofthrones,not_removed,put a snowy bloodbath scene in the background
gameofthrones,not_removed,honestly op i think you should just leave it it looks incredible
gameofthrones,not_removed,as a nonpainter it feels like the white head has a too big plain white maybe some highlignts ore some bright grey can fix that
gameofthrones,not_removed,so youve got some extra space at the top maybe paint the words winter is coming across the top
gameofthrones,not_removed,i might be a little late here but i think this looks amazing as is i wish i had your talent
gameofthrones,not_removed,consider adding a fancy border in some metallic paint
gameofthrones,not_removed,i bet the black canvas makes the painting feel more empty than it is i really like the mouth area looked so that i zoomed in to see if you pasted the painting to the canvas lol but making the ears a little more crisp as well as adding the metallic would go a long way great job
gameofthrones,not_removed,paper stencil over the dire wolf and flick dark red paint over the uncovered areas
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe you can change the texture appearance to look like fur ps i am bad at art stuff
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the wolf looks great dont change a thing id change the background though especially around the face of the wolf the white streaks look like you ran out of paint
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is looking pretty good i like dimensionality youre creating if you were to do anything more to i would definitely continue adding some depth try standing it up like across the room and youll start to see where youll want add or adjust when i was taking art classes i had to push myself to go bolder dont be afraid to push it a little its looking really cool though
gameofthrones,not_removed,a good artist knows when to stop i dont see what more you could add without making it look too busy
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont know much about art so this might be trite but how about a bit of metallic red blood on the teeth or mane its very clean and crisp as is id hang it now but a tiny bit of color could be a nice contrast
gameofthrones,not_removed,perfect as is dont overdo it
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe add the house motto across the top but do it in the same style as the dire wolf maybe make the house motto out of snowflakes so the winter is coming motto is rendered in a way that leaves no doubt that winter has come
gameofthrones,not_removed,perhaps some ice blue accents
gameofthrones,not_removed,man id say stop right there thats badass only thing i can think of is maybe a winter is coming in the bottom right but id almost prefer it with out maybe a bit of shading in the whites on the facenose but other than that great job
gameofthrones,not_removed,possibly a dark forest in the background with the light casting onto a heart tree could add a dark pool giving off some steam before the weirwood couple lichen covered stones and bedded pine needles no other shrubbery required other than the one for the knights who say ni
gameofthrones,not_removed,retake winterfell from the bolton bastard and proudly hang it in the great hall
gameofthrones,not_removed,two options a put it down b sell it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i say maybe go with a different light source and shade his face like you did with his body too like others have been saying also id touch up the patches of fur with maybe some blackwhite theres a couple of areas that just look a bit splotchy and some touching updetailing would go a long way regardless youve done a great job so far and even if you stopped now it would look good
gameofthrones,not_removed,the effect on the mane is well done i think the teeth stand out right now as two dimensional because of the strong white outline try playing more with value there to match the rest of the painting well done so far id hang that up on my wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,its done frame and hang it nice job
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it would look super cool after youve got all the detail done to spatter some dark red paint across it like a splash of blood
gameofthrones,not_removed,art teacher used to tell me to fill in the blank space try that
gameofthrones,not_removed,trees in the background all ways look nice
gameofthrones,not_removed,i may be a bit late but just red eyes and leave it at that
gameofthrones,not_removed,sometimes when you run out of ideas the painting is done
gameofthrones,not_removed,more paint
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes pack it up and send to me
gameofthrones,not_removed,more black
gameofthrones,not_removed,winter roses for lyanna or some red for jon
gameofthrones,not_removed,have a three year old finger paint on top of your work and sell it as alternative art
gameofthrones,not_removed,sick draw those shades are awesome
gameofthrones,not_removed,add a border
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean id buy it
gameofthrones,not_removed,clean up some of the raggy white brush lines near the teeth and eyes with black outline
gameofthrones,not_removed,fire and blood
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe more white on the fur just like you did on the face otherwise looks good
gameofthrones,not_removed,blood splatter
gameofthrones,not_removed,winter is here in silverwhite metallic calligraphy
gameofthrones,not_removed,its done looks awesome enough as is
gameofthrones,not_removed,by no means an artist but what i notice immediately is that it seems the base of the neck should be a bit wider
gameofthrones,not_removed,if i were you id go back in and add more shadows and highlights
gameofthrones,not_removed,paint the eye red
gameofthrones,not_removed,splatter some blood red paint on it in one or two hard swiping motions like youre chopping neds head off with your brush
gameofthrones,not_removed,paint the north remembers in got font either all above the wolf or just the north on top and remembers on the botom right under the wolfs face
gameofthrones,not_removed,tbh i think it looks great asis
gameofthrones,not_removed,looks finished to me
gameofthrones,not_removed,straighten up the edges change the shading to match the light source add more grey to allow the white to pop but otherwise very good effort
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,if youre still looking for suggestions id paint banner fabric behind it
gameofthrones,not_removed,king in the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,touch of blood red in the eye
gameofthrones,not_removed,have you considered adding more paint
gameofthrones,not_removed,id give the eyes a blue shine
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually did something similar years ago a wolf that transitions from realistic to a more tribal design what i ended up doing was a splatter paint design in the background loved it at the time
gameofthrones,not_removed,red eyes wpuld be cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,after all the detaim work put unto the neck and fur the head looks a bit flat adding more of the same style of details would help otherwise beautiful work
gameofthrones,not_removed,it needs fast moving snow in the back drop
gameofthrones,not_removed,a crown bronze would look cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,get a thin brush and even out some of the line work in the head with black the whiskers for example bascily just a little clean up here and there overall its a solid piece great job
gameofthrones,not_removed,make the mane and teeth similar with shadowing and texture maybe add a layer of teeth behind
gameofthrones,not_removed,do a picture of brans face below the dogs snout in the shadows
gameofthrones,not_removed,some snowflakes please great job
gameofthrones,not_removed,id say its already finaished its a phenomenal painting
gameofthrones,not_removed,wew it sure helped me finish 😉😏
gameofthrones,not_removed,some sort of smokey background perhaps with the silloettes of the stark family in there somewhere or maybe a dash of red somewhere i wouldnt add any type of text the north remembers and winter is coming are pretty played out and are on every other stark got picture i see but hey im not an artist do what you feel looks great so far i like the sharpness of the wolf almost makes it seem like its wearing plate armor
gameofthrones,not_removed,personally i think its fantastic as it is
gameofthrones,not_removed,if you dont know what else to do to it i think its finished karmawhore
gameofthrones,not_removed,i kind of like how it is just fill in the leftmost spikes with a bit more of that metallic look and a few of the rightbottom spikes as well leave the ones under the chin dark then give the lower jaw a bit of the same medium metal shade and darken up some of the white on that ear and upperjaw
gameofthrones,not_removed,more shading on the top of the head
gameofthrones,not_removed,please update us after youve continued your work
gameofthrones,not_removed,color the eye perhaps
gameofthrones,not_removed,if youre feeling really ambitious you could try to make it look like its a close up shot of a stark shield or breast plate or something cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,its awesome as is but if you feel you must do more with it maybe make it a little more like the current bastard wolf sigil ie more white
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes sign your name on it and then let me has it good advice yes
gameofthrones,not_removed,you need some edges paint the corners like its in a frame or picture holder or something it would make it look more finished also you can add more layers of shading like they do with religious icon painting layer after layer after layer giving it more depth
gameofthrones,not_removed,what about some silver paint
gameofthrones,not_removed,deleted
gameofthrones,not_removed,cut its head off
gameofthrones,not_removed,can you make it rainbow colored
gameofthrones,not_removed,write in a cool classic font the wolf hunts for its pray
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe some of the starks in the background or like jon in battle that would be sick good job though nonetheless
gameofthrones,not_removed,part of me wants to see a small gold or rose gold crown floating just above its head but i know thats not how its truly supposed to look looks great
gameofthrones,not_removed,an ominous flayed man in the background as an homage to our true wardens of the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,you forgot robbs body
gameofthrones,not_removed,give it a crown dakingindanorf
gameofthrones,not_removed,draw a dick on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,you mean you werent getting a stream of positive feedback from people with talent and skill or professionals so you came here to get upvotes instead to massage your ego
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree add some more depth to face and teeth
gameofthrones,not_removed,agree the neck looks well defined while the facial area seems black and white without the contours i would also try to add something in the background
gameofthrones,not_removed,exactly this repeat both the metallic in the face and the light color in the mane area to make the piece feel more balanced and unified overall great job
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would start with making the whiskers above the mouth metallic as well as the eyebrows i think those too alone will give it some good contrast and may be enough to complete it awesome job
gameofthrones,not_removed,carpenter here carve one out of wood to test how the light works on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,designer here about the lighting the shades of grey dont have to represent amount of light it couldve been done on purpose to portray a shaggy fur that consists of differently shaded tufts of hair i think overall the light parts of the neck balance out the whiteness of the face
gameofthrones,not_removed,tiler here i hope you remember to seal it after your finished
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree it looks great already no need to overcomplicate things
gameofthrones,not_removed,snowflakes that transition to to ash from right to left winter is coming to winterfell is burning white flakes to grey ones yup i think im done here
gameofthrones,not_removed,i second the no words sentiment text always seems to cheapen art for me
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,white paint splatters around it would be cool too
gameofthrones,not_removed,bloody fangs or a bloody claw mark maybe even a targaryan dragon in subtle red in the background
gameofthrones,not_removed,totally agree that the uneven black space is disturbing unfortunately i feel like there is one too many rows on the mane not enough space on the lower left is it possible to go back over them or fade it out
gameofthrones,not_removed,cant believe this is all the way down here its the stark sigil why not put the house words on there it appears you left the perfect space to do that at the top a cool red splatter streak but other than that winter is coming is the only other thing i would even think about putting on there
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it would just turn it into a poster at that point
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn religious wolves cant they just hunt for their prey like they used to
gameofthrones,not_removed,i disagree dont turn it into a collage
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel like it would ruin it completely the reason the direwolf looks so nice is because the metalic colour on a black background take away the black and put too much detail in the back it just looks out of place
gameofthrones,not_removed,i disagree but im not going to negate your karma for your opinion
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont be an ass theyve worked hard on their work
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed there is a lot of depth in the mane but the face is just black and white its very stark use the technique used on the mane to make it the face look more metallic but well done i am a keyboard critic i couldnt make a painting that nice well done also there is a fine line between unfinished and over done good luck repost your results
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed also upper skull area
gameofthrones,not_removed,magician here pull a real wolf out of a hat to see how the light is cast on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,id say a combination of both you want variation and contrast between sections of fur but at the same time realistically portray the lighting hes right that some parts of the neck are too bright and offputting
gameofthrones,not_removed,how about one splashing streak of crimson blood right across the glorious bastard great painting too
gameofthrones,not_removed,the wolf looks good some of the other comments gave you really good suggestions for it too i think you may see it as incomplete due to your use of space on the canvas itself the wolf is closer to the bottom leaving a larger space at the top creating a bit of an uneven maybe even unfinished look snowflakes or something to balance out the piece would definately help create the finished look you are striving for
gameofthrones,not_removed,just future advice if your work often looks unfinished but you get stuck on how to complete it try stepping back and doing sketches doing a few rough color sketches gives you ideas and the freedom to see where you could take things
gameofthrones,not_removed,in its current state i would buy it and hang it on my wall its incredible
gameofthrones,not_removed,what if you painted some snow falling in the background it does look a little plain since starks are wardens of the north then the snow makes sense idk im certainly no artist
gameofthrones,not_removed,im like that with my paintingsdrawings too the only thing i can think of for you is putting some whiter highlights on more of the neck fluff but regardless thats some stunning work 😊
gameofthrones,not_removed,a little color contrast get the blue of the white walkers eyes and do very thin contrast lines in the head and neck
gameofthrones,not_removed,subtle framing imagery in the lower right and upper left corners like a battle scene or winterfell in silhouette for bottom right and something decorative in upper left but not all four corners bottom left is already crowded and upper right you dont want anything to draw the eye away from the head
gameofthrones,not_removed,id totally buy this
gameofthrones,not_removed,i sort of agree i do like it a lot and think it looks better than the wolf in the show but something about it could jump out at you more perhaps white paint to make it looks like the light is hitting off of it in a certain way i dont know what thats called edit i see you did that actually
gameofthrones,not_removed,can you post it once again before selling
gameofthrones,not_removed,what are you gonna sell it for
gameofthrones,not_removed,my thing and this is just me the eyes dont really stand out im not artistically inclined so i have no idea what could be done but this is a really well done painting
gameofthrones,not_removed,possibly a winter is coming quote under the jaw of the wolf i dont paint so im not sure thats the only part of the canvas that does quite feel alive though
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe some calligraphy you could put winter is coming or the north remembers in the blank spaces above the wolf head
gameofthrones,not_removed,insightful i would like to hear about what op is trying to communicate in this work whats the vision or whats the philosophy message purpose i have no doubts about ops ability to express these emotions through her work its just to give a few tasting notes monochrome searching or probing fading well maybe thats what she was going for
gameofthrones,not_removed,so why did you comment just to be a dick
gameofthrones,not_removed,itll be a big seller next holiday season
gameofthrones,not_removed,i made a comment off someone elses where i thought making your flakes go from white to grey snow to ash would be a little poetic as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,hey man your painting is great try to bring in those gradient tones that you have blended into the mane especially notice those beneath the curled upper lip its not just plain white the lack of gradientmetallic finish blending is what sticks out to me the most keep going
gameofthrones,not_removed,these jokes will always be too soon 😢
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe even a targaryan dragon in subtle red in the background s i had a similar thought as a grey wolf on a black field would be the bastard starks banner and now that it was revealed as to his true lineage that would make sense
gameofthrones,not_removed,id go for or in this state right now i agree with you it looks a little empty at the moment just needs that final touch to finish it then it might be worth
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you ser the north will remember
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre absolutely welcome as a fellow artist you know you did it for karma and you dont have to operate under the guise of oh i dont know what else to do with it oh my thank you for all of your positive responses its pathetic you got your karma now scamper off and feel good about yourself
gameofthrones,not_removed,id buy a house greyjoy one if the price was right
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed also the nose area
gameofthrones,not_removed,realist here that might not end well
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would totally have to repaint everything if i tried that but then again i cant paint to begin with
gameofthrones,not_removed,even better go the extra mile and use your own blood for realism
gameofthrones,not_removed,definitely this dont try to paint the splash just let loose and actually splash it
gameofthrones,not_removed,especially where the neck ends
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was thinking some red would make it popmaybe a hint of a weirwood tree in the background
gameofthrones,not_removed,everything about the spacing is giving me anxiety left and right sides of the canvas arent balanced either
gameofthrones,not_removed,to answer the op giving constructive criticism while not providing a solution is not the same as being a dick
gameofthrones,not_removed,sounds like constructive criticism to me snowflake ever heard of it op didnt come here for people to fawn over it and stroke their ego the best art is the result of criticism and honesty not blind praise and circlejerk
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed also the jaw area
gameofthrones,not_removed,blood magic to be precise
gameofthrones,not_removed,wolfs neck or painters neck
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre totally right i didnt even notice them right away
gameofthrones,not_removed,do you have an estimate i have no idea how much art costs lmao i do know the supplies are expensive tho
gameofthrones,not_removed,send me a link when you put it on etsy
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre underselling yourself you will have spent a long time on it by the time its done be proud of yourself and ask for more thats cheap for a painting
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed also the ear area
gameofthrones,not_removed,bartender here get the wolf drunk and try not to let its boyfriend know youre hitting on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,that should help make sure when you add that extra something you get under the wolf as well maybe wind or snowfall moving in the negative space could help the additions can add movement and draw your eye away from the uneven borders
gameofthrones,not_removed,cant you paint some background on the bottom left genuine question
gameofthrones,not_removed,what about a weirwood tree in the background or some red leaves coming through
gameofthrones,not_removed,as a girl who plays video games i get a lot of guys who speak to me strangely because they think im a year old boy in reality im a year old female dude seems to be most common they always say it with a very specific tone that immediately alerts me to the fact that they are not using it as just a laid back or chill term it gets a bit irritating having to hear someone speak to me with a condescending tone that magically transforms dude into little dude im normally very timid but i cannot not say anything usually turns out to be a good ice breaker when i inform them that im a girl out of the dozens and dozens of people ive met that i was suspicious of making incorrect assumptions were always doing exactly that my assumptions regarding their assumptions have yet to be wrong if im ever called sir instead of dude i may have to pirate your clever joke not likely though since they base their assumptions on my voice and probably wont address a kid as sir funny how sexist the internet isby by i love your painting by the way i think you should try the blood splatter snow may be too much i think that would do more favors for your composition since if its off center
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed also the background area
gameofthrones,not_removed,bolton here destroy all the wolf sigils in the castle and replace them with the superior flayed man
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think a good first step might be to check places like etsy and see what other pieces of similar size are going for might be a good way to guage yourself a bit i do hope it finds a home
gameofthrones,not_removed,is your time worth only i would try to sell it for first and drop the price if you dont get any buyers if you value the time you put into it you should expect buyers to value your time as well and pay accordingly for it i understand art is subjective and timeputin might not translate directly into how much a piece of art is worth however i think you should put a value on your own time and go from there seems like a good starting point
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed also the roll of paper towels behind the painting area
gameofthrones,not_removed,alcoholic here fuck this shit go have a drink
gameofthrones,not_removed,if you can do the splash of blood try that too unless itll look overloaded snow first blood last i guess
gameofthrones,not_removed,data i think we ought to get together and compare notes
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed also the wall behind the painting
gameofthrones,not_removed,lawyer here add a superscript tm in the bottom left hand corner
gameofthrones,not_removed,fair enough lmao i only buy pins off of it p
gameofthrones,not_removed,especially when painting
gameofthrones,not_removed,hehe gotcha
gameofthrones,not_removed,runexpectedknowledge
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed
gameofthrones,not_removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gameofthrones,not_removed,student here just wait til the last minute and pass it in just how it is now
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre way better than me lol i only bought a grinder on there
gameofthrones,not_removed,͡o ͜ʖ ͡o
gameofthrones,not_removed,the scales fell from my eyes is a saying that means you saw a truth that you had otherwise been ignorant to this looks like a nautical retelling of that idiom so i doubt it has anything to do with greyscale
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is a prayer to the drowned god used to anoint the king of the iron islands and has nothing to do with house tully or greyscale
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought they were talking abut eyecrust
gameofthrones,not_removed,the off season is long and full of tin foily dumb theories
gameofthrones,not_removed,this makes sense
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is a mistake it says joffrey baratheon that blonde fuck aint no baratheon
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn theon what a change not just the attire but just sort ofrocking an older look
gameofthrones,not_removed,the last appearance picture they used of theon is from
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats not the dragon queens first appearance
gameofthrones,not_removed,not sure if it was posted before
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon still cant grow a proper northern beard
gameofthrones,not_removed,arya and bran were so cute

gameofthrones,not_removed,not much opinions so far it seems im a huge fan but id say that roleplaying in crowfall will be like roleplaying in eve online unless one wants to focus on eternal kingdoms and build his own world but then the question of resources and maintaining emerges
gameofthrones,not_removed,that sounds logical without a huge city or hub people have to find instead of meeting each other and the art style will make character customisation less in depth and rping less as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,i heard once that its a pity that so awesome lore is wasted on a pvp game but one can always rp casually ie during downtime chatting etc going in and out of character namely i believe that direct fights will be happening of time maybe even less meantime there will be lots of roaming escorts buildingcraftingmininggathering things such as animal husbandry caravans exploringscouting just hanging on forums info will matter a lot making deals and all kinds of such things in other words its good that crowfall will be much more than a huge battleground as many seem to see it especially after first glance at these mobalike early test videos with very small mapsteams zero customization cloned characters and still it will have strong pvp flavor
gameofthrones,not_removed,sorry this took a while to post my internet is going in and out tonight i believe that brans visions are a visual representationinterpretation of the song of ice and fire a few of these scenes only occur once or twice for just a couple of frames and probably dont have a ton of significance brans fall the weirwood roots the original raven from his dreams at winterfell then there are several other sequences that are quite important and make up a theme and often these scenes would always follow each other in the visions some of the scenes belong to more than one theme theme ice crows in snowy forest at night snowy tundra images from hardhome creation of a ww by the nk theme fire pyromancers under kl aerys screaming burn them all the wildfire explosion in the vaults drogon in a stormy sky dragon shadow over kl sunrise theme death brans fall crows in a snowy forest at night the killing of aerys the execution of ned the murders of robb and catelyn the death of lyanna attack on jon at hardhome the death of the man sacrificed by the cotf theme birthrebirth a snowy sunrise birth of danys dragons birth of a ww baby lyanna at the toj robbs death scene where he is saying mother the creation of the first ww by leaf theme kings targaryen kings aerys danaerys stark kings night king king in the north targaryenstark king jon snow one scene always repeatsfollow each other or are in very close proximity in the visions i think it has special significance pyromancers below kl drogon against stormy sky dragon shadow over kl always follows drogon birth of danys dragons specifically drogon always follows the shadow image birth of a ww baby always follows the birth of dragons predictionstakeaways lots of people primarily starks shown being killed with bladed weapons i think that lyanna will die from some sort of wound either csection suicide or an attacker and that the man leaf turned into the nk was also a stark i think bran will come to the conclusion that only a stark can defeat him while i dont think the image of drogon on a stormy sky is near kl which is usually sunny i do think it is somewhere in westeros not essos possibly seen from on deck of a ship hence the cordline in a few frames and possibly at pyke or maybe storms end edit uavatyler caught that this is actually footage from when tyrion and jorah sail through valyria its been reversed as a mirror image for brans vision watch the footage here the images of kings landing aerys pyromancers and wildfire juxtaposed closely with the pictures of drogon either his birth his shadow or him in flight make me think that the explosion is a future event with his flame accidentally setting off the rotting jars of the substance secreted under kl jon snow while not really a featured player in the visions is central to all the main themes the depiction of lyannas death along with aerys and danerys appearances give further credence to rlj hardhome is shown including an attack on jon he has died and been reborn i think bran will not only discover that rlj but he will come to the conclusion that jon must be tptwp even if he doesnt know its called that but he will determine that jon must be the one to battle the nk his is truly the song of ice fire edit additional thoughts i compared the pictures of the pyromancers in brans vision with images of hallyne from when tyrion works with him before the battle of the blackwater and im fairly certain that hallyne is not any of the pyromancers seen in brans vision unless it is as a younger man the vault with both jars and barrels is also not the same as the one tyrion saw i found the scene where sam kills the ww and the crows flying through the snowy forest as seen in brans vision is definitely from that footage you can see it here it was also used in brans vision in dragon over kl this footage a longer cut originally appeared in brans vision in the sunrise scene comes from brans vision in the weirwood roots scene also comes from as does the raven flying through a green forest
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cant stop thinking that is a csection scar on lyanna at the top of the tower of joy which is just a very sad image
gameofthrones,not_removed,just gonna note the only ones that for sure havent happened are drogon over kings landing unless its not drogon and its years ago the wildfire explosion in the vault
gameofthrones,not_removed,pretty sure that the shot of drogon against the cloudy back drop is from season when tyrion and jorah see him flying while sailing through valyria
gameofthrones,not_removed,i noticed last night rewatching the episode with headphones on that in most of the visions where there are ww you can hear the mks voice shouting burn them all not sure if thats anything significant but interesting at least
gameofthrones,not_removed,are we sure its drogon and not a flashback to the old dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,seems to me that the linecord in the frames with drogon flying are the ropes of a ships mast drogon is flying above the ships dany is sailing to westeros in its a vision of the future
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive been thinking about the fragmentation and repetition in these images and wondering why is it to fill ample time with only enough the showmakers wanted to reveal or is bran repeatedly visiting same times modifying somethings in the time sequence checking the effects in another and so on very well put together sequence though thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,im pretty sure this has been done around times and most have the actual frames in an imgur album for ease of viewing
gameofthrones,not_removed,danydrogon accidentally burning kings landing is an interesting theory lots of talk that people will really behind the rightful targaryen kingqueen being heir to a certain mad king liking fire a bit too much and as first act burning the capital would not sit well with the common people i would think
gameofthrones,not_removed,well done i would only add that some of the images which we might think are future events are probably past events which are significant to the future for instance dragons flying over kings landing im kind of assuming the wildfire explosion is the tragedy at summerhall and that were being reminded of it because something similar is going to happen to kings landing
gameofthrones,not_removed,holy shit youre absolutely right i didnt recognize it because the entire image was reversed for brans vision great catch
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it is significant and will probably factor into brans eventual plan to deal with the ww and wights
gameofthrones,not_removed,the black and red coloration is pretty visible in the shots so im sure it is him
gameofthrones,not_removed,actually uavatyler caught that this is actually footage from when tyrion and jorah sail through valyria its been reversed as a mirror image for brans vision watch the footage here
gameofthrones,not_removed,the first line of my post links to an imgur album its the thing that says link
gameofthrones,not_removed,the images pretty clearly show jaime killing aerys
gameofthrones,not_removed,while wildfire was possibly involved in the tragedy at summerhall i dont think the vision is of that it makes no sense to be storing that much wildfire in a residential castle and there were pyromancers in the vision adding to the stores i think it has to be a large storeroom below kl belonging to the alchemist guild
gameofthrones,not_removed,that was a good catch at least i knew it was a ship lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres only so much we can deduce from the few frames weve seen of brans vision we see three people involved in handling wildfire in a dark place – one pouring one receiving and the other holding a light separately we see an explosion ripping through a darkened hallway all we know about summerhall is that the king was trying something unorthodox to hatch dragon eggs i dont think its a stretch to think he might have tried to incorporate dragon fire in the process especially since we know whatever they tried caught the whole place on fire
gameofthrones,not_removed,heres the two different shots of dragons on a sky head size and length appear to be the same the second shot appears a little larger just because its wings are spread more if you flip between the two its clear they are part of a flying sequence of a single dragon you can even see the same light patch of cloud in the upperleft part of the frame actually move slightly right as the camera pans left and catches the possible ships rigging in the left edge of the shot the dragon is drogon in all the pictures
gameofthrones,not_removed,nah they didnt even bother introducing bloodravens backstory youre not gonna see dark sister but his ice sword is better against humans in every way
gameofthrones,not_removed,why would he need one if his ice sword can shatter normal steel and iron unlike valyrian steel
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wouldnt discount it the sword is mentioned by name by arya in season when talking with tywin definitely the possibility it shows up
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe to have power over the other white walkers like the leaders crasters bastards
gameofthrones,not_removed,the showll need a bit more backstory to explain why the nights king has it
gameofthrones,not_removed,no she took the throne by conquest if cersei dies it goes to jaime then tyrion then tyrek if he is still alive to genna and house frey of riverrun
gameofthrones,not_removed,the easiest way to look at it note i said easiest not necessarily correct is that with how screwed up the line of succession has gotten what with illegitmate children and secret parentages and what have you cersei essentially took the throne its that simple tommen died the previous king rightfully or not and cersei basically just proclaimed herself queen without any justification and no one has the balls or right mind to challenge her this could easily turn into a giant essay of who should or who legitimately has claim to the throne but those arguments are as irrelevant as tommen or joffrey not being the rightful heirs they still were kings carried out their kingly duties were recognized by many as the king and served as kings until they deaths the proper line of succession are just laws and words on paper what actually matters is who is sitting on the throne convincing the people that they are the right person to be sitting there cersei has decided that is her and no one appears to be challenging her at least as far as her coronation so if cersei has established a new line of succession that starts with her her heir would be jamie obviously very doubtful it would come to that
gameofthrones,not_removed,succession doesnt matter for cersei the other power players besides her crony in the city were killed so she took the throne jaime is arguably her heirapparent but her line will probably collapse after she dies anyway
gameofthrones,not_removed,varys in a room sit three great men a king a priest and a rich man with his gold between them stands a sellsword a little man of common birth and no great mind each of the great ones bids him slay the other two do it says the king for i am your lawful ruler do it says the priest for i command you in the names of the gods do it says the rich man and all this gold shall be yours so tell me—who lives and who dies he ultimately concludes that power resides where men believe it resides and so the new king or queen will be whoever men believe should be king and i think the show has done a fine way of proving this joffrey was not a son of robbert and should never have been king jon should never have been made king of the north by all rights etc etc
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei took the throne by coup until recognized as the legitimate monarch by all the seven kingdoms and she produces children as heirs she has not established a dynasty that means at her death while jaimie would technically be her successor the throne will belong to whoever can take and keep it if she accepts a political marriage with euron he would not be satisfied with the position of consort so a power struggle begins between the two of them if he wins regardless of whether she lives or not euron is king and the greyjoys the new protectors of the seven kingdoms which means euron wont kill cersei because he needs her to produce children to secure his succession and dynasty like henry vii and henry viii why cersei shes a lannister and the only other available single females of the great houses are sansa arya and danerys and he would probably have to kill danerys to secure the throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,whoa thatd be crazy iron throne in the grasp of house frey technically lannister i know but her children
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes she definitely doesnt care about the state of the state lol after shes gone she only cares about herself in the now
gameofthrones,not_removed,they show it they show all of it because whats the one major thing missing from all tv shows these days guys full penetration
gameofthrones,not_removed,a meteorite crashes into the ground as the final battle starts and wipes everyone out
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei wins the game of thrones
gameofthrones,not_removed,the twist will be that danys a blackfyre or baelish is a reyne
gameofthrones,not_removed,probably that the whitewalkers arent the evil things we think they are
gameofthrones,not_removed,it turns out that it was old man aerys all along he was warged as ser pounce plotting the lannisters doom while he ate lemon pie in the hidden tunnels when he retakes his throne he names the harlem globetrotters as his kings guard thats another mystery solved gang
gameofthrones,not_removed,i believe his comment was that he came up with a twist for a certain character that the show couldnt do for reasons and that most readers would not see coming he implied that the twist will occur in winds about the ending hes said it will be bittersweet so idk about an ending twist but im partial to the idea that its about jon i think either jon will not resurrect not very likely but we wouldnt see that coming or that he will resurrect as a villain consider jon is killed jon comes back characters notice that jon is different jon becomes obsessed with saving the north jon rallies the north everyone north of the neck is united jon reveals his true intentions and gives the north to the others i dont think thats necessarily likely but it would be shocking
gameofthrones,not_removed,personally i think bran is going to warg around through time and undo everything back to a certain point perhaps before ned stark leaves winterfell perhaps to prevent the mad king from becoming the tyrant he would become not sure when that point will be but there will be a big reset
gameofthrones,not_removed,its too late ive seen everything
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think id cry
gameofthrones,not_removed,the and he woke up and it was all a dream ending eh
gameofthrones,not_removed,bran cant change past events that have already happened past events are already written brans actions in the future that have not happened yet in his timeline are what changes the past for example he altered hodors life through an action he made in the future by going into the past the catch here is bran was in the past before his timeline made him travel into the vision past with the three eyed raven i hope my description is not too confusing or jumps around too much
gameofthrones,not_removed,not exactly more like he went back in time and undid everything theyre not completely the same though i see the similarities edit to elaborate dream can end anytime and has no inherent effect on the narrative other than simple termination the undo it all carries with it a sense of hopelessness the situation is beyond all saving and must be undone it might not be most peoples including mine favorite option but its not the same as a simple wake up
gameofthrones,not_removed,ah yes youre probably right i wouldnt put it past grrm still though
gameofthrones,not_removed,honestly i would recommend you stop watching the show and just finish the books it took me about months the read all and i started watching the show when i finished im about half way through season right now while i think the show is great in definitey very happy that i decided to read first you get a way better connection to the characters and to the universe itself also the books are dauntingly long mine total just less than pages if all the main plot points and twists and cliffhangers are spoiled by the show you may not feel the drive to finish reading
gameofthrones,not_removed,im currently watching the show and sooon will be done with it and at the same time started reading a game of thrones and hope to read all the books untill season im slow reader but having seen the show doesnt ruin my experience with the books they have so much detail and new stuff even in first book and for me at least having seen tv show it helps to understand better the plot and all the characters id recommend to choose one of the mediums book or tv show and go through all of it and then pick up other
gameofthrones,not_removed,pages of a million my friend i found myself getting bored because a lot of the keep you invested spoilers were already played out
gameofthrones,not_removed,i tried doing this and it worked relatively well for the first two seasons but season split book and theres definitely some mixing between the two seasons so theres no one place to stop after that it totally turns on you and a lot is taken out of the books in favor of hastening the plot so theres really no way to read books with a show timeline i read all the books before watching the show but thats just because thats what i like to do for adaptations
gameofthrones,not_removed,i say go for it i read the first book and then dove right into the show while also reading the rest of the books it was a glorious time of full got emersion but honestly i am the kind of person who does not care at all about spoilers
gameofthrones,not_removed,so im reading through the books for the first time now but have rewatched the show all the way a handful of times i think because watching the show will go faster you should watch through season and then read books
gameofthrones,not_removed,sounds like solid advice i just want to be up to date with the show when it comes back the summer i definitely can see the magic of grrms description and its hard not to picture the events in the show when thinking of them id be able to use my imagination if i read events before seeing them
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree although i think reading the books first would be a good idea since they give a deeper understanding of everything i often found myself a bit confused watching the show at least in the beginning
gameofthrones,not_removed,regardless of which medium you choose the story and the universe george created is incredible and very easy to fall in love with and its been beautifully brought to life with the tv show i hope you continue readingwatching because it is an incredible experience
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah pretty much him and his second sons
gameofthrones,not_removed,the people of meereen are holding elections daario and the second sons are remaining behind as a standing military to keep the peace
gameofthrones,not_removed,once mereen has a stable government of the people daario and second sons will move on basically daeny asked him for one last thingto make sure the elections were carried out peacefully with the masters and the harpies essentially wiped out everything willrun smooth there for the most part once hes fullfilled her last request of him i would assume they go back to being mercenaries unless daario has more ambition after being around her for so long but like he says who comes after daenerys stormborn he will go back to being a drunk merc who sleeps around for the rest of his life always dreaming of his queen
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha cue the sad daario memes
gameofthrones,not_removed,unless euron shows up at meereen i think that storyline is over for the most part
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes left with the second sons to oversee the changes in meereen
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes aka the meereen plotline is fully abandoned and i dont expect to see anything related to it in the future
gameofthrones,not_removed,no but the quick resolution of daario ruling meereen either means he is going to fail miserably and quickly or meereen isnt important anymore and its the last well hear about it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel like theres a possibility he disobeys danys orders and goes to westeros to join up with her again
gameofthrones,not_removed,while part of me always holds out hope for the rogue and romantic daario to stow away on one of the ships and just kinda pop up either on the way to westeros or when they get there the logical got side of me says thats a no in reality i imagine he will remain with the second sons oversee the elections and dip out they will probably go back to just being roaming mercs this show has just conditioned us all so well at this point to realize in this world romance is virtually nonexistent it would be adorable if after the elections he loaded everybody onto a ship and surprised khaleesi in westeros sadly not going to happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah if i had to take a guess im betting dario is gonna be like fuck it and go look for work in the free cities def not the stationary ruling type
gameofthrones,not_removed,you mean stormcrows
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wouldnt say abandoned i would say that its run its course and theyve moved on abandoned makes it sound like their was more planned that they gave up but i dont think this is the case here
gameofthrones,not_removed,did jorah remain in essos to find a cure for his greyscale or did he sail back to westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,we can only hope
gameofthrones,not_removed,but he is not going to be the ruler he and the second sons are just going to see that everything goes as planned as the meereenese choose their own leaders
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the show its second sons books its stormcrows yes this gets unnecessarily confusing sometimes
gameofthrones,not_removed,ya thats better wording
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wouldnt doubt if we do see him again itll be in oldtown
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes leading an army of sell swords i honestly dont see his character caring all that much now that hes been sptied by dany
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wonder why maybe its because they didnt want the casuals to get confused by having more than one kind of crow
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think its because earlier in the show tyrion gets the help of shagga son of dolf and he belongs to a mountain clan called the stone crows it may have been seen to be confusing if daario is with the stormcrows reading and watching something can obviously be a whole different experience and less clear if you only ever hear the two names on tv and not written down like in the books you could see why it might be confusing

gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is awesome
gameofthrones,not_removed,love the snow details well done dude
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cried when they clipped hodor onto that wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,too soon man
gameofthrones,not_removed,did you win a prize its so well done
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did hodor too but mine was carrying a stuffed bear version of bran well done
gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks i liked this hodor raisin bran as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,hodor
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought about doing that too but i wanted to do something a little more original since ive seen that one online alot clever idea whoever thought of that
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think aemon knew that said i love the symbolism of jons two hands blood emotion on one weight duty on the other
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a popular theory that he did know i subscribe fully to it myself not only him but benjen knew as well that discussion was just way too precise to be coincidental it would be bad writting if he didnt know
gameofthrones,not_removed,the only thing that dissuades me from thinking maester aemon knew is that he openly lamented not being there for his family particularly egg and then the younger generations if he knew then we would rest a little easier knowing that guiding jon was fulfilling his familial duty its more bittersweet that he never knew this passage also makes me wish we had heard more of jons internal monologue on the show book jon is more of a thinker and i like the way he rationalizes his thoughts show jon feels more like a warrior and i miss the intellectual moments i wouldve liked to see jon openly engaging this small voice questioning the nature neds honor it would also lend some dimension to his brooding in the show that being said i love show jon too god its gonna be a long winter
gameofthrones,not_removed,he knew what exactly
gameofthrones,not_removed,excellent now go make joke for tyrion
gameofthrones,not_removed,lovely well done
gameofthrones,not_removed,even nailed the mannerisms
gameofthrones,not_removed,you look good it is known
gameofthrones,not_removed,cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,looks great did you make the dress yourself what was the process
gameofthrones,not_removed,great outfit ignore the bot its like jon snow it knows nothing
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is awesome did you sew this yourself
gameofthrones,not_removed,you did an awesome job have fun girl
gameofthrones,not_removed,looks great nice adaptation of the outfit
gameofthrones,not_removed,nice job beautiful
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre so gorgeous
gameofthrones,not_removed,you look beautiful
gameofthrones,not_removed,you look great
gameofthrones,not_removed,nice

gameofthrones,not_removed,that hair piece looks fun
gameofthrones,not_removed,i absolutely love this costume so cute
gameofthrones,not_removed,perfect
gameofthrones,not_removed,or grey worm he mek gud jok
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is known
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive had the season soundtrack practically on repeat the past weeks ive found and to be quite epic
gameofthrones,not_removed,my favourites d
gameofthrones,not_removed,is definitely the best imo is a close second
gameofthrones,not_removed,nope reign is
gameofthrones,not_removed,the inaccurately titled king of the north is my favorite its perfect knowing its context of robbs crowning after neds death with that cool mix of triumph and sorrow its even better considering robbs tragic fate then again i love any song with the house stark theme especially winter has come the tower i have to go north and two swords
gameofthrones,not_removed,from which scene is that one when dany rides drogon out of meereen
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like it a lot i try to avoid competitive comparisons with subjective material
gameofthrones,not_removed,nope is
gameofthrones,not_removed,blood of the dragon the only downside to it is that it is not long enough ridiculously good
gameofthrones,not_removed,ramin is a genius
gameofthrones,not_removed,of dragons warrior of light winds of winter forgive me breaker of chains rains of castamere
gameofthrones,not_removed,hold the door still gives me chills
gameofthrones,not_removed,i quite like but light of the seven is definitely a new favourite
gameofthrones,not_removed,i kinda prefer rains of castamere since it can be used in a variety of situations ironic echoes in defeat quiet undertones in victory the terror that was the red wedding and straight with just the beautifully crafted lyrics but i do think light of the seven is a better song so i see what youve been saying then again ill back the lannisters over the targaryens any day so maybe im biased
gameofthrones,not_removed,light of the seven is a masterpiece it has just the right amount of space and pacing for my tastes the balance between darkness and light in it is perfect
gameofthrones,not_removed,i completely agree with this reign is basically the best parts of dance of dragons mixed with a fantastic buildup and other badass bits of music
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i agree with this
gameofthrones,not_removed,should we tell him
gameofthrones,not_removed,are you new here
gameofthrones,not_removed,nice catch
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow unbelievable theory always thought ned stark fucked wylla because he said he did s
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,also you know the random kids that help bran theyre howland reeds kids the guy that was with ned when they found lyanna
gameofthrones,not_removed,so adorable
gameofthrones,not_removed,rasoiafcirclejerk
gameofthrones,not_removed,deleted
gameofthrones,not_removed,woahi think thats a strech
gameofthrones,not_removed,nice catchtm
gameofthrones,not_removed,youve got it op r l j confirmed youve probably spotted by now that a large portion of this sub suspected this but its impressive that you found all that supporting evidence yourself now for the hard part ifwhen jon finds out how does it happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres members of the kingsguard
gameofthrones,not_removed,what am i missing do tell
gameofthrones,not_removed,well op has a twoyear award but never posted this sub before dont think she is trolling but loss for words as how to respond maybe he havent seen
gameofthrones,not_removed,no i agree with op jon isnt neds son
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol i think your the only person not criticizing me in some way unless of course you too are being sarcastic at this point i can not tell
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is by far the most commonly believed and heavily discussed theory of all the asoiaf theories and there are thousands but this one has been the most obvious one and therefore most commonly believed one ever since the books first came out and it has been since the people have been discussing this mindblowing discovery on forums devoted to the asoiaf books and later the got tv show since at least while the books have been hinting at it very heavily from the start the show has officially confirmed the theory in the final episode of season
gameofthrones,not_removed,as i have asked others apparently i am missing something obvious what is it
gameofthrones,not_removed,he talks about season episodes in his post though
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not criticizing you i dont think you should be criticized for not having known i actually wish i could have figured it out on my own too lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,why is everyone making weird comments though like im in the dark about something obviously it may have been a discussed theory but i was simply making a post that confirmed it it was only these past few weeks that it was actually confirmed by both the season finale and by hbo itself while a lot of people may have already known and i might have been one of the last to figure it out it still does not account for why all the comments are the way they are like if im a week late on figuring it out who really gives a fuck i was thinking there was someting else i was missing out on something huge
gameofthrones,not_removed,true i have decided not to comment anymore heee
gameofthrones,not_removed,imagine if you went onto a geography subreddit and posted something along the lines of mind blowing revelation and then followed it up with i think the earth is round it sure is true and when you first realize this whenever you do it is truly mindblowing but its something that has been discussed a thousand times by most people on the subreddit and everyone is well versed in the subtle nuances of the arguments it makes it very obvious you havent been discussing it online or thought too much about the books for very long this isnt a big deal as its just a book but thats why you are getting some condescending responses its not that you are missing anything its just that everyone hear has known this theory backwards and forwards forever and were all waiting for the confirmation on the show and they finally did a few months ago to most this isnt mindblowing as much as ok cool its official now like that couple that dated for years then finally got married it wasnt a big suprise that this was going to happen and if it didnt it would have been a much bigger uproar
gameofthrones,not_removed,ok tell me wtf i am missing lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,best response ever lol truly though this is the exact explanation i needed now i completely understand thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont even get what your question is
gameofthrones,not_removed,the whore forcemen man the places i could go with that maybe its because i live in los angeles but i can think of so many rule got scenarios and you just added to that thank you sir
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol id have to see some pictures to see what you mean this is such a weirdly written post i like it but what
gameofthrones,not_removed,well harry the heir isnt in the show because of the rescue i could see sansa marrying robin getting pregnant and then something happening to him and then jon warden of the north sansa warden of the east yara warden of the east replacing the lannisters in that role ellaria warden of the south replacing house tyrell which kind of doesnt exist anymore
gameofthrones,not_removed,harrold hardyngarrryn
gameofthrones,not_removed,someone is going through that moon door not sure if its robyn or littlefinger
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow somehow completely forgot about that
gameofthrones,not_removed,he doesnt as claims dont transfer through marriage but only blood so lysa was never lady of the vale in the first place she was as a consort to lord arryn and was only regent in robins name after arryns death they would have to search arryn parentage to find the nexter kin if not found it would be the kings or queens prerogative to assign the lordship of the vale to a new family in most european history the kings usually just added it to their own family possession without appointing a new lord
gameofthrones,not_removed,there are other tyrell men willas and garlan who dont appear in the show but did appear on an hbo family tree
gameofthrones,not_removed,im sure little finger mentioned harry the heir to sansa in season
gameofthrones,not_removed,he didnt bookonly
gameofthrones,not_removed,if a kingsguard lives that long hes a ridiculously good fighter
gameofthrones,not_removed,well considering the time its set inand there occupation id say the more likely thing is a year old kingsguard falling off there horse and breaking there hip and being put down with the horse
gameofthrones,not_removed,the other white cloaks pick up the slack they also have other sworn knights who perform some of the guard duties
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was under the impression that joffrey relieving selmy of his position was irregular but maybe that wasnt the first time
gameofthrones,not_removed,your impression was right it was very irregular kingsguard are not supposed to be dismissed joffrey started a new precedent
gameofthrones,not_removed,you dont trust the sand snakes
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope theyre all thrown overboard otw to kl so we dont have to suffer throughwaste anymore screen time on them
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wanna see them die violent deaths
gameofthrones,not_removed,thatd require screen time i was thinking a passing comment from grey worm about their departure from the ship would suffice although now that i think about it seeing frankenmountain tear them apart sounds rather nice
gameofthrones,not_removed,fuck yeah would love to see that
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive probably had about friends that caught up on thrones in the last year before season best reactions points were after baelor obviously garden of bones mel ending blackwater and now his watch is ended unsullied kissed by fire red wedding the lion and the rose the trial and the next episodes hardhome mothers mercy
gameofthrones,not_removed,ahhhh the sweet sweet innocence i just finished last night im about to rewatch to fill the got shaped hole in my heart
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh the innocence i had my little brother watch the game of thrones marathon with me on hbo this winter during december he couldnt stop watching when he saw the red wedding oh the anger the anger
gameofthrones,not_removed,if you never like anyone then you wont be sad once they die
gameofthrones,not_removed,burn them all
gameofthrones,not_removed,a list of posts that should be voted off as soon as possible this one
gameofthrones,not_removed,and then the final episode starts with the disney opening with the shooting star over the castle
gameofthrones,not_removed,sansa stark a naïve twit either you havent seen past season one or you need help
gameofthrones,not_removed,clearly i need help
gameofthrones,not_removed,jons hand wasnt on fire he just burnt it on the metal dont stretch this far youll burn yourself out before even starts the children of the forest blew up his body probably just what it was foreshadowing but its kind of shitty imo because meera ended him not the cotf
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the flame on his hand just foreshadowed that he was going to die not by any particular method unlike the others who were not on fire i guess greenseers can predict when people will die
gameofthrones,not_removed,he was sensing his death
gameofthrones,not_removed,hi i posted this same thing days ago and pretty much all people said was he is the lord of light here was my post if you are interested
gameofthrones,not_removed,this has been driving me nuts since i did a complete rewatch of all the seasons i think that it was him giving us a clue as to what the end will be for bran and probably meera too in my opinion i think that bran will be caught up in the fighting area and be a casualty of dragon fire when the ww and dragons finally go at it
gameofthrones,not_removed,but jojen talked about bransand maybe meeras death not his
gameofthrones,not_removed,he saw a flame on his hand the whole trip he talked about how he wasnt important and how he was just getting bran to where he needed to be it was foreshadowing but it was weak
gameofthrones,not_removed,no need for two threads me thinks
gameofthrones,not_removed,if tommen is deemed a bastard there is no heir left to inherit the throne and the faith will essentially be left in control of the seven kingdoms yeah this
gameofthrones,not_removed,actually cersei is accused of adultery and incest with lancel not jamie so the legitimacy of tommen as heir to the throne is not yet at risk
gameofthrones,not_removed,conversely another point to be made is that if tommen is deemed a bastard there is no heir left to inherit the throne and the faith will essentially be left in control of the seven kingdoms sounds like that resolves the plot hole you mentioned
gameofthrones,not_removed,she is accused of regicide killing robert baratheon by instructing her cousin lancel lannister to keep roberts cup full of wine while out on his hunting trip your plot hole had been filled
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think she has been accused of sleeping with jaime it was regicide and possibly hooking up with her cousin which may or may not be considered incest in got
gameofthrones,not_removed,you seem to be forgetting about a certain bastard named gendry
gameofthrones,not_removed,sansa is also legally married to two men at once by now the show itself is a plot hole
gameofthrones,not_removed,first of all i believe margery is manipulating the sparrow she had no way of knowing an army was coming to her aid so to save herself from a walk of atonement she converted tommen who lets face it would jump from the wall if she told him she liked the idea if tommen is deemed a bastard and the crown is empty it wouldnt go to the seven kingdoms thered be a full scale war for the throne andor gendry could reveal himself
gameofthrones,not_removed,all i can think of now after reading this is writing some lyrics for tommen to scotty doesnt know poor kid is going to lose his mind when this all comes to light
gameofthrones,not_removed,right to rule is not as important as who has the biggest army
gameofthrones,not_removed,well technically as far as most of the kingdoms are concerned stannis is well and truly alive unless i missed a detailing expressing otherwise
gameofthrones,not_removed,exactly i dont think its a plot hole either way cercei loses tommen is dethronedcercei wins tommen continues to reign the high sparrow wins
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe you just figured out the sparrows plan holy balls
gameofthrones,not_removed,the problem with that theory is that the faith isnt strong enough to rule the seven kingdoms by itself with no army and several powerful enemies its hard to believe that the high sparrow doesnt realize this
gameofthrones,not_removed,correct she has not been accused of incest with jamieyet
gameofthrones,not_removed,its possible that shes only accused of twincest in the books though she was loosely accused of it and denied it before the high sparrow so its still open to interpretation
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah but the second time she got married in front of the old gods which is sort of different
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i dont buy that margery went from man up bro to i love sparrows that quickly pretty sure she is conning them
gameofthrones,not_removed,err tommen is stripped of the crown because hes a bastard so gendry another bastard becomes more legitimate somehow i get that hes roberts bastard rather than cerseis bastard but i dont think that would necessarily place him higher in line than the guy whos already been crowned
gameofthrones,not_removed,i assume since varys and littlefinger knew about it that word had gotten out
gameofthrones,not_removed,nothing to see here folks just smile and nod
gameofthrones,not_removed,the faith militant is an army
gameofthrones,not_removed,she actually was accused of it by the high sparrow last season but she denied it
gameofthrones,not_removed,it the books shes accused of ordering the murder of the previous high septon i think lancel also admitted to killing king robert on her behalf and sleeping with her of course but im not sure if that ever became an official charge against her as far as i know sleeping with her brother never came into it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i am pretty sure in the show when she admits to sleeping with lancel the high sparrow specifically says she still has to stand trial for regicide i dont think its that open
gameofthrones,not_removed,she didnt want to let them win so this is a way of saving her own skin
gameofthrones,not_removed,it would because they focus more on the blood of the father than of the wife he is a direct descendant of the king formerly robert tommen isnt
gameofthrones,not_removed,varys is out of the loop as we know from previous episodes varys hasnt heard from his little birds of the north in some time and lf and the boltons are allied to the lannisters so wouldnt make sense for either of them to alert the faith militant that this is the moment they can take control of the throne but then again it is lf were talking about
gameofthrones,not_removed,the faith militant is a small paramilitary organization similar to the gold cloaks they have barely any men and couldnt fight any army that came to take the iron throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,the matter was never pushed probably because of a lack of evidence
gameofthrones,not_removed,she still has to stand trial for regicide but wouldnt that mean that lancel also has to be accused if regicide im confused
gameofthrones,not_removed,as we know from last episode he does know about stannis losing neither lf or the boltons are actually allied with the lannisters
gameofthrones,not_removed,you underestimate the power of faith the smallfolk will rally to the banner of anyone who promises peace and food these are the things the high sparrow offers whereas everyone else just promises more war
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know it was never pushed but it definitely was brought up and she was technically accused of it
gameofthrones,not_removed,the high sparrow seems to be rather conveniently selective about who gets charged for what to which degree
gameofthrones,not_removed,he knows about stannis losing but in no way does he know hes dead surely and the boltons were allied to the lannisters for the red wedding which allowed them to take control of the north afterwards lf has allied with the lannisters in the past but lets be honest nobody knows what on gods earth littlefinger is upto
gameofthrones,not_removed,this whether it works out for the high sparrow or not i think he expects common people around the seven kingdoms to rally around the faith it may take a while but the hs is a patient man and i think as long as he has control of kings landing he wont mind waiting for the other lords to fight amongst themselves weakening their armies to the point where the common peoplefaith militant can overtake them
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean everyone pretty much knows that kings landing is going to be destroyed soon anyways
gameofthrones,not_removed,never officially accused just questioned and she denied it no evidence no trial it doesnt mean the case is closed but the sept has no evidence the evidence died with aryn and eddrd but is still in that boring book
gameofthrones,not_removed,the boltons openly defied the lannisters by marrying ramsey to sansa stark and know that they are enemies now lf is friends with the lannisters when its beneficial but plots against them behind their backs
gameofthrones,not_removed,and how do they know that have the people of kings landing been watching game of thrones
gameofthrones,not_removed,boltons married ramsay and sansa in hopes to gain full control of the north although defiant it would eventually make sense lf plots against everyone against there backs and is probably plotting against sansa right now
gameofthrones,not_removed,hey if bran can do it in his visions i mean why not
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really dont think so she will just sorta be there in the dosh kahleen but wouldnt see a second of screen time
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was wondering about that they focus a bit on her maybe the last season she show up
gameofthrones,not_removed,i believe she helped dany set up the fire the way the place caught flame it looked like the floor was coated in something flammable and someone barred the doors to escape after running into jorah and daario dany had said something along the lines of and youre going to help me to the other girl with the shortened seasons i doubt we see her again unless dany wants her to be some sort of liaison to the dothraki maybe not officially grant her that title or anything but use her kind of like varys little birds to gain gossip from the dothraki camps
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think she got any more focus than various other bit characters that i dont expect to see again the riverlands farmer that arya and the hound stayed with the molestown madam etc
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think that was just the oil in the lanterns spilling
gameofthrones,not_removed,why would the northerners want to take dany down that just seems like more pointless bloodshed and the north has had enough of that already jon being warden of the north should be more than enough their priorities wont lie in the south especially when they still have the white walkers to deal with not to mention how betraying dany like that wouldnt really be their style
gameofthrones,not_removed,after this jon will receive a raven from dany to insist her in the battle for kl jon with some bannermen howland and his bannermen davos ghost and lord manderly and yes i said lord manderly and his men will go to fight along side dany seems incredibly unlikely it would take months for northern armies to reach kings landing and they really have no motivation to go south when they are aware of the threat to their north
gameofthrones,not_removed,the grand western conspiracy cersei qyburn resurrect orson lannister qyburn yes your grace cersei now make him times as big qyburn certainly your grace cercei now give him an abnormally big rock qyburn of course your grace
gameofthrones,not_removed,link for the lazy
gameofthrones,not_removed,is there a grand northern conspiracy to restore the starks to power is there a plot in winterfell against the boltons is stoneheart working with maege mormont galbart glover and howland reed will jon snow be king in the north in the books in education views since feb ryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
gameofthrones,not_removed,show umbers book umbers
gameofthrones,not_removed,it would be awfully silly for them to revive sandor clegane as a member of the faith and then not use him in the trial by combat
gameofthrones,not_removed,loras fought the mountain in season and the hound jumped in to stop the fight could that happen again
gameofthrones,not_removed,the mountain is also seen in a trailer killing a faith militant so his probably going to kill a group of them which is when he gets the damage on his armor i doubt thats the trial by combat
gameofthrones,not_removed,stop wasting your time with silly theories the return of the hound has already been confirmed
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually had a similar theory and then a bat shit tin foil theory come to mind a while ago the first was that the faith would get champions representing each of the gods and that loras would indeed be one but that hed die frankengregor would win battles and lose the against the strangers champion sandor bat shit tin foil the faith simply chooses tommen after cercei chooses the mountain and he mindlessly kills him before cercei can reject since tommen will have labeled himself an enemy of cercei by sidding wthe sparrows
gameofthrones,not_removed,slight spoiler maybe saw an interview hbo did where the actor that played loras had a shaved head which could mean one of two things a he joined the faith militant and they want him to fight against cerci in her trial or b he had to do the shame walk edit wrong name
gameofthrones,not_removed,tommen may be naive but he is not stupid
gameofthrones,not_removed,the mountain fighting loras i could definitely see that happening good idea
gameofthrones,not_removed,or he is killed off in some other way and shaved it off because of ironfist
gameofthrones,not_removed,that would be very interesting too bad the show hasnt explained how amazing of a swordsman loras really is
gameofthrones,not_removed,false with how thoroughly hes been indoctrinated by the sparrow i could see him accepting after all a trial by combat is supposed to be judgment from the gods not a test of skill between two fighters i dont think thatll happen though just saying
gameofthrones,not_removed,that almoast happaned in season but the hound saved loras
gameofthrones,not_removed,he did a lot of fighting in seasons and but yeah they focused more on his relationship with renley than his swordsmanship no pun intended
gameofthrones,not_removed,gods favoured gregor clegane when he was born
gameofthrones,not_removed,they used him a few times to show how good other fighters were like brienne ans the mountain but i think they forgot to establish how good he is first

gameofthrones,not_removed,dragonstone will be important when the whitewalkers come
gameofthrones,not_removed,dragonstone is the ancient seat of house targaryen its where aegon visenya and rhaenys retreated to plan their invasion and was the launching point of the conquest its where dragons were born bred and kept its a place that has dragonglass in significant quantity i believe there might be other treasures located at dragonstone that stannis baratheon never discovered that might prove useful in the wars to come
gameofthrones,not_removed,no idea i think youre right perhaps they are going out of their way to keep it in our minds because they spend a lot of time there in season
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,dragonglass
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah but why is it shown in the opening credits i dont think any scene takes place there in
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is the ancient targ throne for the targ rightful heir so it makes sense dany would go there maybe jon too
gameofthrones,not_removed,obsidian
gameofthrones,not_removed,formed by a volcano just as obsidion is here
gameofthrones,not_removed,because dragonstone looks awesome and they needed to have a certain number of locations in the opening credits to make it work with the music
gameofthrones,not_removed,same thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats not usually how the credits are i doubt theyd just show it randomly they usually only show whats going to be shown during the episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,i tried to pull a stannis joke but nobody took the bait
gameofthrones,not_removed,fewer
gameofthrones,not_removed,it really only works if youre correcting someone that said something incorrectly
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is dope very nice
gameofthrones,not_removed,really good you should share to rlistentothis too
gameofthrones,not_removed,we wont see him they have for sure combined his role with danys
gameofthrones,not_removed,young griff in the show is now as likely as aron santagar
gameofthrones,not_removed,varys is a loyal dany supporter rather than a triple agent tyrion didnt talk to illyrio about griff jon connington is merged with jorah faegon is merged with dany the most well see of aegon is if dany invades the stormlands first
gameofthrones,not_removed,there isnt enough time to do griff i think thinks are going to start moving very rapidly from now on unless the battle with the wights is another shaggydog and doesnt amount to anything
gameofthrones,not_removed,its too bad he wasnt introduced he seems like a very intriguing addition in the books theories related too dont think the show does very well showing blackfyre aspects
gameofthrones,not_removed,she spent a lot of time on the makeup which i think looked amazing she did all but the base layers of the costume tunic leggings by hand
gameofthrones,not_removed,got and christian theology
gameofthrones,not_removed,a certain drogon which drogon be more specific
gameofthrones,not_removed,sindragosa watch as your pathetic magic betraaaaaays you sorry i couldnt help it
gameofthrones,not_removed,its possible would be epic i will happy settling for ice spiders please do ice spiders
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have this scene in mind where dany post retaking the throne is all gung ho i got my dragons and shit and in her arrogance rides drogonsp into battle the ww and he magic blizzards them into a submissive position and drogon is killed then she screams nooo while laying in bloody snow and the night king does his hand wave and drogon starts getting up while other two dragons swoop in to save her or something to that effect but regardless of what happens i anticipate dany and her druggies to underestimate the power of the wight side
gameofthrones,not_removed,ice dragon sounds epic though
gameofthrones,not_removed,frost wyrns eh were goin full boys
gameofthrones,not_removed,big ups for the yugioh reference
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt there also talk in the books about an ice dragon laying dormant inside the wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,dude even if drogon turns white wight one dragonfire from rhaegalviserion and he dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,not if you use trap hole when he tries to resurrect him
gameofthrones,not_removed,picturing drogon rising from the dead and attacking dany i couldnt get the halo guys voice out of my head betrayal
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres actually a short story about an ice dragon by grrm
gameofthrones,not_removed,blue eyes wight drogon
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really fucking hope so
gameofthrones,not_removed,the one with the humon owner
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think its a yu gi oh joke
gameofthrones,not_removed,this shit still rings in my ears till this day
gameofthrones,not_removed,im down for ice spiders however if budget constraints are an issue i wouldnt be surprised to see them pull a watchmen and replace their big magic monster with a modified dragon model thats assuming that grrm intends on writing ice spiders in when that book comes out in years and has shared that with the writers at this point my understanding is that he clued them in with his intentions of where the story goes but gave them permission to get there however they see fit for the show not saying i would prefer one over the other but ice spiders havent been alludes to up until this point as far as i recall possessing a wight dragon is more within the realms of possibilities in the show canon but gimme something cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,i definitely hope so they better not have the dragons just wipe out the ww after seasons of hype building
gameofthrones,not_removed,im thinking undeadwight dragon however i do think that fire breathing wight might be an issue maybe it can use blizzards forgoes fire only crastors kid has been shown to transform i was thinking wight resurrection vs ww transformation of the dragon
gameofthrones,not_removed,this thought crossed my mind but i think the dragon would be resistant enough through its recently living biology to sustain some protection also i was thinking the cold winds and blizzard would make the other two dragons struggle to do what is obvious scorch all of the wights including the wight dragon and the ww as is common sense the ability for dragons to do what they do would be limited by weather and ww magic otherwise any this point dany can cut through westeros and fly north and just burn all the ww and wights with little difficulty
gameofthrones,not_removed,not in the asoiaf world its another world
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think sindragosa was that large
gameofthrones,not_removed,gotta give my gf credit for the pun i was personally a pokémon tcg kid
gameofthrones,not_removed,its wow
gameofthrones,not_removed,second best fight in the expansion tbf
gameofthrones,not_removed,im fairly sure the ice spiders thing is meant to be a myth a bit of chinese whispers or exaggeration mixed in with the truth about the white walkers which has also become a legend to most people just like gumpkins and snarks
gameofthrones,not_removed,the wiki days that theyre as big as hounds maybe nymerias and her army vs pack of ice spiders
gameofthrones,not_removed,then thens mentioned the ice spiders at hardhome
gameofthrones,not_removed,at this point i am shocked if they struggle with budget issues the show is a colossus that is my hope anyway
gameofthrones,not_removed,the publishers would disagree with you on that one the inside panel of the cover claims it does presumably for marketing reasons while there is mention of a place called land of always winter in the book there are some possible inconsistencies in regards to geography and weather if it is set in the asoiaf world it is either much earlier or much later by thousands of years possibly than the events in asoiaf
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know just saying
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i was too but i did sell a ton of yu gi oh cards to other kids at recess so i got to know them well
gameofthrones,not_removed,deleted
gameofthrones,not_removed,sindragosa is from wow blue eyes wight dragon isnt a play on that though its a play on the best card from the original yu gi oh card game
gameofthrones,not_removed,nah lk yogg mimiron and sarth were better it was definitely the funniest fight though the whole raid getting blocked was hilarious
gameofthrones,not_removed,ah didnt recall that it was mentioned in the show im not discounting ive spiders i just suspect a dragon fight demands itself to be shown and this is one method to achieve it
gameofthrones,not_removed,its not that they dont have enough theres plenty of money but costs go up all around production and they have to use the budget wisely
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont believe its a play on exodia
gameofthrones,not_removed,whos the brown haired one supposed to be
gameofthrones,not_removed,shouldnt they finally start to wear winter hats preferably with pompons
gameofthrones,not_removed,what
gameofthrones,not_removed,all three are syrio in disguise
gameofthrones,not_removed,pretty sure its ned
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it is tormund and the bald guy is davos
gameofthrones,not_removed,tormund maybe

gameofthrones,not_removed,he does the best milk of the poppy in the whole north
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah two extra cheeks too
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre gods damn right
gameofthrones,not_removed,they would think it an abomination that the gift of death was so strangely appiled to these people and their faces not avialable for stealing yuck necromancy how are we supposed to conduct our necrophelia if they are animating them all the time

gameofthrones,not_removed,hey man if youre gonna steal my video without crediting me dont
gameofthrones,not_removed,who the fuck uses dailymotion dude upload your shit on youtube
gameofthrones,not_removed,this sub should ban dailymotioncom other subs have already done this
gameofthrones,not_removed,the hype is real honestly but dont try to take credit for something that is not yours
gameofthrones,not_removed,u
gameofthrones,not_removed,people who want to avoid copyright issues although the op isnt one since the video is also on youtube
gameofthrones,not_removed,fun fact this aint his video source i made it
gameofthrones,not_removed,care to explain why
gameofthrones,not_removed,take a chill pill
gameofthrones,not_removed,anytime bby loved the video d
gameofthrones,not_removed,this video is ridiculous i loved every second of it
gameofthrones,not_removed,people steal youtube videos and then upload them to dailymotion just like op here
gameofthrones,not_removed,people theorize that the hounds in that episode were merely tracking hounds that werent bred for combat like the other ones ramsays known for otherwise they would have torn sansa and theon apart when they found them
gameofthrones,not_removed,tracking dogs instead of mr burnss usual hounds why would ramsay want reek salsa stark to finally die and be over with it if they were captured oh boy would ramsays sausage wiggle
gameofthrones,not_removed,podrick bigdick payne i like it
gameofthrones,not_removed,ramsey wanted sansa and reek back and alive so he sent men and tracking dogs instead of releasing his hunting dogs
gameofthrones,not_removed,they did look to be or something similar while and ramsey mentions myranda is the kennel masters daughter so theres a decent chance he has his own separate dogs just like the bastards boys
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes the hounds that were used for that scene werent the same ones that received the ramsey feast later
gameofthrones,not_removed,possible plus theres a good chance ramsay is the only one who could handle the really mean ones and since he wasnt there they werent either
gameofthrones,not_removed,okay that makes sense thanks for the quick responses
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats pretty cool juxtaposition whats the photograph from

gameofthrones,not_removed,mance rayder the show significantly reduced his role in the books hes still alive and plays an important role in the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,ser barristan selmy while i love the character in the show i feel like they have not conveyed what a badass he actually is
gameofthrones,not_removed,dorian martell tywin is my favourite character brought to life though
gameofthrones,not_removed,euron greyjoy in the books hes an unholy combination of littlefinger and ramsay but in the show hes everyones racist peaked in high school douchebag uncle
gameofthrones,not_removed,doran martell in fact i ended up disappointed with much of the dorne storyline in the show the lack of arianne didnt help i think i preferred book sansa too id say she garnered more sympathy from me
gameofthrones,not_removed,the biggest dissapontment for me was euron greyjoy right now in the books it seems like hes gonna be a major player in the final arc and has warlocks and magic meanwhile in the show the only magic he seems to have is his ability to tame dragons with his huge cock
gameofthrones,not_removed,loras tyrell pardon me if im wrong but i believe the books mentioned his extraordinary sword fighting skills but in the shows the only time we saw him fight was a sparring match with brienne where he lost
gameofthrones,not_removed,ellaria sand turning her into an evil vengeful bitch that doesnt care at all about her lovers principles and desires once hes gone they spoiled a few other charactergrowth moments jons recruitment in the wildling ranks robbs marriage but they werent enough to spoil the whole character
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion lannister now dont get me wrong tyrion is still a very wellwritten and complicated character in the show but i will always disappointed that they omit his darker side in the show im hoping they start having him lose it in these last couple of seasons give him something to do otherwise
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont take it as some giant criticism but there are few things they could¨ve done differently with jon and mostly dany theyre trying to show us this badass queen to regal icy at times but shes just a girl in the tough world scared and lonely she wishes for a family a house with the red door most of all the whole point of pursuing the iron throne is because of how she owes it to her family it comes with a self doubt on her part and this is lacking on the show if i look iam lost shes doing epic stuff and rarely shows vulnerability jorah scenes and her dragons are the only examples where she showed her true bookdany emotions emilia is perfect in those scenes but its with how she been written on the show show is missing key factors in danys character with jon being dumb to plain and simple soldier weiss and benioff said as much in commentary to one of those episodes jon in the books is actually a smart lad not acting out of emotions too often skilled at planning helped stannis with his campaign show where to start as deepwood motte and to whom he should go to showed a bit of skill negotiating loan from iron bank and mainting the wall repairing it and manning it with the wildlings for many people boring stuff but this what kings do dany is at this further as she managed meereen and day to day basis on the show hes a very good swordsman average in the books as mance or rattleshirt bested him but thats about it theyre main character and missing key things i understand if they dont want to spend too much time with secondary or teritary characters but youre main characters should be on point in all aspects
gameofthrones,not_removed,doran martell petyr baelish barristan selmy quorin halfhand mance rayder
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah but thats one of the few changes i liked i think its fit her to not be as attractive as described i know it would have been hard to do but i would have liked it if tyrion lost his nose
gameofthrones,not_removed,daario hes meant to have blue hair and a blue beard
gameofthrones,not_removed,daario is such a creepo daario is much better
gameofthrones,not_removed,could you give a quick summary of what hes currently doing in the book
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes i definitely agree with this one as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,it seemed a lot of talk about how badass he is but they didnt show much i would have loved a few extra scenes of him kicking ass
gameofthrones,not_removed,they raped and murdered dorans character in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,in regard to sansa i think there was a deliberate decision in the show to give sansa a weaker more naive basis of character than in the books to garner more animosity towards her childishness in the viewer this just makes her transition to the stronger sansa we see in the later seasons that much more satisfying which could not have been achieved to the same degree if we felt sympathy for her naivety in earlier episodes
gameofthrones,not_removed,damphair as well i dont even know if thats supposed to be damphair in the show or just some random water priest
gameofthrones,not_removed,the only one thing i like about the shows euron is that he have nice friendly mutton chops thats it
gameofthrones,not_removed,as someone whos never read the books can you give a brief example of his darker sides from the book
gameofthrones,not_removed,daario resembled the character in the book far better as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,everything tag everything tag okay so basically while theon is doing his thing mance is sneaking into winterfell with a bunch of spearwives to slay boltons and this is happening while stannis is still approaching were left with theon escaping and things are pretty unclear in winterfell but were certainly told by ramsay at least that the stannis battle played out much as it did in the show and thats the last we heard about it but mance is a pretty big deal around the watch think basically tormundlevel mance is a lot more like tormund in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,instead of burning him alive mellisandre actually switches him for someone disguised as mance later mel and jon send mance to winterfell which is under bolton rule in the books sansas friend jeyne poole who is pretending to be arya is the one who marries ramsay and is subject to his torture when theon and jeyne escape mance gets captured at winterfell by ramsay where he currently still is theres another side plot about jon switching mances infant son with gillys to protect him and his kingsblood mance being king beyond the wall qualifies him from being sacrificed by mellisandre when word of arya being married to ramsay gets to castle black jon uses mances son as leverage for mance to go to winterfell and save her he does not know that jon is in fact passing gillys son off as his own the differences in the show from the books probably caused mances storyline to be reduced but in the books he initially seems a much greater threat to the nw because he allegedly possesses the horn of winter which apparently can tear down the wall after the wildling army is defeated rather than kill him i think its implied that mel believes mance still has a role to play in the war to come
gameofthrones,not_removed,he did manage to kill thirteen guys on his own before going down that was a pretty badass scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,tbf he was badass but dude is old as fuck now
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes because the fucking book dorne was so awesome and not page after page of boring arguments
gameofthrones,not_removed,dorans character was perfectly fine it was dorne itself that sucked
gameofthrones,not_removed,i started with the show and i hate show sansa book sansa is far more sympathetic and her transition to alayne stone is far more interesting and satisfying basically they failed at making me like sansa in the show and most of the show watchers i know and many ive talked to online agree with me
gameofthrones,not_removed,one can be a leader without being blood thirsty and delusional and yes thinking that this is in oberryns name and that he would somehow approve of this is delusional i was disappointed the whole purpose of the dornish was to show that revenge never leads to anything good and never solves anything doran and ellaria supported this with everything they did and oberryn died precisely because his revenge blinded him to now have ellaria go against everything that defines her in the book not just change her a bit negate everything she was and negate the whole moral of the story was shitty
gameofthrones,not_removed,certainly in the books not only is tyrion a dwarf but he is quite deformed he has a stunted leg a large brow his nose was cleaved off in the battle of blackwater bay and he is an allaround unpleasantlooking man as we know tyrion has always wanted to find true love he wanted a woman to genuinely love him in the show he gets that and he forces himself to send her off because he has a duty to fulfill for his family and shae is a liability we know how that story ends and the depression tyrion accrues as a result his alliance with danaerys has given him purpose and meaning once again like i said tyrion is still a complicated character in the show in the books however things are much worse and thus have a greater impact on tyrion shae does not love him though she acted like she did tyrion being the cynic he is kept reminding himself that she always wanted his money but he fell in love with her anyway she sold him out in the trial just like she did in the show and he still finds her in tywins bed unlike the show where tyrion kills her after she tries to pull a knife on him in the books tyrion outright strangles her in anger and grief even while she begs for her life honestly in the show it would have been jarring for tyrion to do this to a woman he did genuinely love as opposed to what happened in the books context is everything after all and not only that but before parting ways jaime tells tyrion the truth the girl tyrion married years ago who his father had him believing was just a whore out looking for his money and was set up by jaime that was a lie the girl really was almost raped she did really love tyrion and tywin actually had all of his guards and then tyrion rape her to teach him a lesson this is what makes tyrion seek out tywin in the books whereas in the show he sought tywin of his own volition in a sense it was kind of a trade the show omitted this tragic reveal but made tyrion seek tywin on his own anger and betrayal seeing shae sealed the deal after this throughout adwd tyrion is depressed and vile he drinks himself into a coma as soon as he arrives to pentos and makes bedslaves and whores he sees in his travels service him until he passes out he assaults his own senses his only thing driving him and im not kidding is when he finds danaerys he vows to do anything she asks of him even to serve as her footrest all he wants when they conquer westeros is the honor of raping cersei before murdering her
gameofthrones,not_removed,but were certainly told by ramsay at least that the stannis battle played out much as it did in the show and thats the last we heard about it was this not proven wrong by sample chapters of twow and just another one of ramsays flagrant lies to manipulate people the battle of ice is still on man
gameofthrones,not_removed,dude was almost when he unhorsed sandor clegane in a tourney he was a badass even when old
gameofthrones,not_removed,dorans character was exactly what book doran would want you to think his character was like
gameofthrones,not_removed,annnnd he lumps jamie in with his sister of people he will kill when he is back tv tyrion does not seem capable of killing big bro book tyrion is planning on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,o wow i need to fucking read those books now i like this darker side of my favorite charactor
gameofthrones,not_removed,side question but i thought only knights could compete in tourneys guess thats not the case
gameofthrones,not_removed,some tourneys limit entrance to knights only but not all of them
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah lena headey is great at showing a thousand different emotions with an expression
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really want to see a tyrionsansa reunion dont even know if theres a real possibility of it but i would love to hear tyrion make some witty oneliner about missing his wife
gameofthrones,not_removed,do you think she will resort to poison when all is almost lost she almost took out herself and tommy boy at blackwater
gameofthrones,not_removed,personally im excited to see the fall of the wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,another best scene is the sex scene with jon snow and dany
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon finding out about his real parents
gameofthrones,not_removed,what about cersei seeing dragons that might be good also jon finding out about his parents or white walkers bringin dwn the wall could be amazing hard to choose becaue were potentialy for many fantastic scenes but how they bring down the wall would be interesting if it goes down like the whole structure or just part of it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel like it will either be full insanity or just deadness like stannis where she knows its over
gameofthrones,not_removed,i am not sure i dont think anyone has ever lived to confirm this
gameofthrones,not_removed,better her reaction when she sees danys dragon or even better tyrion riding one of the dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,shes so good its bittersweet
gameofthrones,not_removed,if she decides death is her only option i dont think shell want to go alone she might go full mad king and give the order to burn them all
gameofthrones,not_removed,nope i think jamie will strangle her before she gets the chance
gameofthrones,not_removed,no idea im sure whatever it is it probably wont be very rational
gameofthrones,not_removed,this i hope they do it really well
gameofthrones,not_removed,or jon and dany and sansa
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is the only series in the history of tv and print that has ever made people outright root for incest
gameofthrones,not_removed,so the show starts and ends with incest
gameofthrones,not_removed,season most likely theyll meet but not straight jump into bed ill give them more credit than that marriage needs to be consumated tho so yeah on this front
gameofthrones,not_removed,and what if theyll show it off screen emilia agreed to nudity last season because it was big fist pump moment for her character burning down khals not sure shell want to do it since even her bedroom scenes with daario they never show them in the way like with drogo
gameofthrones,not_removed,give her the emmy goddamit
gameofthrones,not_removed,idk i think deep down she knows what happens when you start saying that shit
gameofthrones,not_removed,very true but do you think she will burn or poison her self so she doesnt feel the pain personally i would like to see her get bad poison that doesnt work and she feels it all
gameofthrones,not_removed,and my axe
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not going to rule this out
gameofthrones,not_removed,and bran sees it in his vision
gameofthrones,not_removed,that was a body double from what i heard
gameofthrones,not_removed,bran is heading down south and guess where is next weirwood tree yes winterfell he needs to know full extent of jons parentage including rhaegar and then tell jon most logical thing to do and could include howland reed just like with dany you got it all wrong dany in the south and jon in the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,on the other hand it would be full circle for jaimes arc and it would be a fitting and pietic end for cersies
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not sure you even feel pain with that amount of wildfire normal fire is known for being so overwhelming you dont actually feel it until its been put out because of the adrenaline and people in the sept didnt get much of a chance to feel anything anyway id think
gameofthrones,not_removed,you saw script i guess no did dd or actors said that or hinted at it no dany got her arc with cersei and euron before moving to white walkers jon with sansa and lf which was said and hinted many times it was hyped by producers and actors kit liam sophie white walkers are endgame enemy and not cersei euron or lf were shifting from politics to supernatural element where everybody needs to be united against this threat of them
gameofthrones,not_removed,emilia did that scene with dothraki khals she talked to about to ew and there is even video behind the scenes showing her in front of green screen they probably shoot that at belfast

gameofthrones,not_removed,in the show no way in the next game in a way that doesnt really impact the main story
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe after gared and gregors bastards go to ironrath and see it was taken theyll go to jon for help assuming battle of the bastards has already happened when they reach ironrath but then which lord forrester would be canon its really confusing
gameofthrones,not_removed,but in the game gared left the north grove so it seems like we may never see it again
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont know it seems like theyre playing around the events of around the last half of season i doubt the battle of the bastards would have happened during the duration of the game
gameofthrones,not_removed,its hard to say especially since rodrik rekt duncans ass in my game oops

gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think it will make it into the show considering they havent introduced it yet i also have doubts that the horn of winter will bring the wall down
gameofthrones,not_removed,do you think the showrunners will ignore it even though its a big game changer yes the only people that are aware of dragonbinder are fans like us the majority of viewers arent aware of it to introduce it just before he faces dragons would be incredibly corny oh look what i have here this horn by the way can bind dragons to me and since theres dragons i suddenly pluck out this here horn just no
gameofthrones,not_removed,although i cant cite a source i dont believe greenseer and wargs are the same thing i dont believe jojen could warg i think its just bran thats both as for inside the weirs more likely to be children of the forest in there if anything
gameofthrones,not_removed,interesting take i really like the idea and i never seen this theory before while it would be hard to say for sure right now i would be satisfied with such an explanation of the old golds
gameofthrones,not_removed,that is what the old gods seem to bethe lingering remnants of greenseers that live on in the weirwoods
gameofthrones,not_removed,the children of the forest when they died are said to have transferred their consciousness into the wirewoods as a collective consciousness
gameofthrones,not_removed,believe the book bit is that in a thousand are skinchangers and in a thousand skinchangers are greenseers
gameofthrones,not_removed,it seems like most greenseers are probably able to warg though since bran clearly can and the seems to at least be able to warg crows to use them as eyes and ears since the only two greenseers we know have the ability it stands to reason that most people who can connect to the weirwoods can warg as well youre right though that doesnt mean that the two are necessarily the same thing just that they are possibly likely to coincide edit and i dont know that jojen was an actual greenseer he just had what they called green dreams
gameofthrones,not_removed,wasnt jojen a greenseer just not on the level as or bran i remember in the show it was said he knew hed die if he went north and he did anyway because he had to get bran to did warg into a crow i thought he was the crow and then the crow landed on the branch and the crow became the kinda like a vision and reality overlapping didnt see your edit when i posted soooo edit difference between green dreams and greenseer is probably training
gameofthrones,not_removed,jojen wasnt a greenseer he just had greendreams small amount of ability but not the full capability
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cant remember specifically the relation between green dreams and greenseers but i know that the way jojen talked about the ability made it seem like he was almost in awe of bran having it and not like he had it himself he said that having the ability to warg was something that only in people with the old blood could do and that only in wargs could become greenseers if i remember correctly i think that green dreams might be something totally separate that are simply the ability to have prophetic dreams we know that prophetic dreams are possible even without northern old blood because a targaryen girl hundreds of years ago dreamed the doom of valyria before it happened which led to the targaryens leaving valyria for dragonstone so i think jojens dreams are probably somehow connected to but not the same as greensight
gameofthrones,not_removed,im pretty sure its said that all targs can have visions of the future isnt the the eyed crow in the books and actually a blackfyre their was a post to youtube video about this that was crazy informative either way i dont think targs visions of the future are derived from greenseer abilities
gameofthrones,not_removed,replying to my own post im pretty sure dd butchered most of the stuff about the
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah in the books he is bryndyn rivers a targaryen bastard called bloodraven im not saying targaryens have greenseer abilities just that prophetic dreams like jojens doesnt necessarily make you a greenseer since prophetic dreams seem to come from multiple places
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah in the books he is bryndyn rivers a targaryen bastard called bloodraven im not saying targaryens have greenseer abilities just that prophetic dreams like jojens doesnt necessarily make you a greenseer since prophetic dreams seem to come from multiple places
gameofthrones,not_removed,jojen was a greenseer warging is something different the came to bran in his dreams iirc not through warging look it up
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed getting to the other part of the theory about second lives there is no evidence either way but its a good theory
gameofthrones,not_removed,no he wasnt you should check your sources it is very plainly stated that he has green dreams and he even described the difference between his dreams and true greensight not at all the same thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,its been a while since i read the books but this is exactly how i recall it httpgameofthroneswikiacomwikigreensight httpgameofthroneswikiacomwikigreenseer
gameofthrones,not_removed,the most goosebumping scene for me was when oberyn came to tyrions cell and recalled the story of when he first met tyrion as a baby and proceeded to tell him i will be your champion
gameofthrones,not_removed,joffrey i am the king i will punish you tywin any man who says i am the king is no true king ill make sure you understand that after ive won your war for you joffrey my father won the real war he killed prince rhaegar he took the crown while you hid under casterly rock silence falls upon the room as tywin gives the death glare to end all death glares tywin the king is tired see him to his chamber
gameofthrones,not_removed,the one scene that i cant forget is grenn and some other brothers of the nights watch reciting their oath as mag the mighty is charging towards them that scene always send shivers down my spine
gameofthrones,not_removed,got chills in that transition shot between babyjon and jon it just looked really good other than that the battle of the bastards comes to mind the way that entire thing was shot probably the best battle scene ive seen on tv
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon charging into battle of the bastards has to be my favourite but one that i really love which is without fighting is when jaime tells brienne about why he killed the mad king
gameofthrones,not_removed,that quote from tyrion to jon is really memorable tyrion let me give you some advice bastard never forget what you are the rest of the world will not wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you jon what the hell do you know about being a bastard tyrion all dwarfs are bastards in their fathers eyes
gameofthrones,not_removed,ramsay eating the sausage in plain view of the recently circumcised albeit took a little to much off the top theon greyjoy the moment i fell in love with the sadistic little fucker
gameofthrones,not_removed,gods help you theon greyjoy now you are truly lost they were boyz jon snow avenged the red wedding chaosh isnt a pit chaosh is a laddharr i will be your champion the king in da norf and last but not less important promise me ned edit part and i kow ill get no justice here so i will let the gods decide my fate i demand a trial by combat tywins voice youre a lannistah kill me and be cursed youre not king of mine youre talker but you jon snow youll be fighting their battles for ever sorry i cant get enough of got
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon ordering janos slynt to ride for greyguard and beheading him after he told jon the stick his orders up his bastard ass classic
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think its really difficult to pick just one but id probably go for tommens suicide even though it was strongly suggested that he was going to die i didnt predict that he would kill himself so it had a huge shock factor also i was deeply impressed by the way the scene has almost no dialogue and none at all from tommen and yet it so clearly shows his emotional state his distress and yet cool resolve all in one go its a truly heartbreaking thing to see after that you get the shot of the now destroyed sept through the window and you just know in that moment that the game has changed entirely
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrions speech during his trial
gameofthrones,not_removed,the hound and arya laying claim to all the fucking chickens
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think most scenes from hardhome battle of the bastards and the winds of winter are fucking amazing miguel sapochnik spelling is truly a genius the cinematography is beautiful and he can just build up suspense amazingly ie battle of hardhome and the first scene at the sept of baelor in twow
gameofthrones,not_removed,a lot of scenes from season were just incredible both from a storytelling point of view as well as cinematography obviously almost everything in the battle of the bastards was amazing but i also loved the tower of joy scenes the transition from the baby to jon but i think my favourite this season were the first minutes of episode almost no dialogue the music the images everything was so unusual and new for got to narrow it down to one favourite scene from all of the seasons would be impossible edit i forgot to mention the door that sad moment of realisation damn forgive me hodor
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion being made hand and finally being appreciated
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrions trial where he goes off on kings landing and pretty much says fuck yall before demanding a trial by combat
gameofthrones,not_removed,robb hacking at the tree after learning of neds execution
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow thats too hard i gotta say say the parlay in bob was brilliant and king of da norf speech im in love with but small scene that im obsessed over this might be the best written scene of the show the chair small counsel scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,the scene where arya is throwing away all of her possessions in the water but cant let go of needle the pause the music and her just standing there holding needle and remembering her past is so powerful to me the best moments of this show are the ones with no dialogue and only the expressions of the actors and scenarios its amazing edit i am getting downvoted for saying what my favorite scene is nice
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really like jaimes discussion with catelyn right before she sets him free so many vows they make you swear and swear defend the king obey the king obey your father protect the innocent defend the weak what if your father despises the king what if the king massacres the innocent its too much no matter what you do youre forsaking one vow or the other really defines jaimes character hes the dishonorable kingslayer yet the act that gave him that name was probably his most honorable act jaimes whole persona and character arc challenge notions of honor and duty
gameofthrones,not_removed,tojnedlyannababy jon to adult jon to king of the north jaime and brienne in the bath jon and sansa reunion
gameofthrones,not_removed,bath tub scene with jaime
gameofthrones,not_removed,first season second episode when ned and jon say goodbye you may not have my name chokes me up every time i think about it because the implications have resonated throughout pretty much every episode for all six seasons httpsmyoutubecomwatchvelahmlrxy
gameofthrones,not_removed,joffreys death was a pretty epic moment for me not that impressive as a tv scene but i had waited for that moment intensely and it was great to finally see it happen otherwise the colonel sandor scene was perfect lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,lots of people name their swords lots of cunts
gameofthrones,not_removed,when drogon lands beside dany in
gameofthrones,not_removed,blackfish taking the arrow shot and walking away after he fires shame they did a poor job in season with his death
gameofthrones,not_removed,the four white walker horsemen on the hill
gameofthrones,not_removed,probably when we see the night kings land just before he corrupts the baby the landscape kind of gave me chills and gave a sense of fear of the unknown like they were so far north that the mountains eventually flattened out into smooth icy landscapes with the aurora borealis overhead i personally think the scene was awe inspiring but there are many who dont like the night kings inclusion into the story because it contrasts the realism of the medieval theme of the show and i get that but i just personally think it was a neat scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,dracarys
gameofthrones,not_removed,there have been way too many great ones to count but the one that got me the most hype was probably the initial tower of joy scene lets face it the moment that scene started is the moment when we all realized that rlj was a go
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon being declared kingindanorf
gameofthrones,not_removed,the original da king in da norf i miss the greatjon
gameofthrones,not_removed,every scene with my sword and axe swinging chicken eating wine drinking corpse fucking hero
gameofthrones,not_removed,a lot of the good ones were taken but the throne room scene when joffrey demands to be crowned within the fortnight and takes oaths of fealty ned comes in with kings orders cersei ripping them up and barristan selmy saying those were the kings words shit was crazy also ned and varys you think my life is something precious to me to trade it for what you grew up with actors you learned their craft and learned it well i grew up with soldiers i learned how to die a long time ago did my best to remember exact quote
gameofthrones,not_removed,kunhh kunhh kunhh kunhh orson lannister is azor ahai confirmed seriously though very deep scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,every scene from battle of the bastards winds of winter and hardhome
gameofthrones,not_removed,its really difficult to pick but i love the somewhat normal moments between jon and ygritte ygritte here sit down brought a pair for you ygritte theyre too big for you but theyre good jon snowyou kill someone for them ygritte nah i didnt kill him but i bet his balls are still bruised ygritte he wasnt good to me the way youre good to me well he didnt do that thing you do with your tongue jon snow yeah can we not talk about that here ygritte can we not talk about that here oh im jon snow ive killed dead men and qhorin halfhand but im scared of naked girls jon snow did i seem scared the other day ygritte you were trembling like a leaf jon snow only in the beginning ygritte only in the beginning jon if youre impressed by a windmill youd be swooning if you saw the great keep at winterfall ygritte whats swooning jon fainting ygritte wwhats fainting jon when a girl sees blood and collapses ygritte why would a girl see blood and collapse jon well not all girls are like you ygritte well girls see more blood than boys
gameofthrones,not_removed,petyr baelishs chaos is a ladder speech everything about it gives me chills it was so well done
gameofthrones,not_removed,id say either the scene where dany gets the unsullied and they trample the staff or the scene where part of kings landing blows up and tommen kills himself
gameofthrones,not_removed,arya busting up laughing when she finds out that her aunt is dead fucking gold jerry gold
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion and the dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,i enjoyed watching walder frey die but thats just me being serious hardhome any episodes with flashbacks winds of winter final scene between baby jon and the king in the north bob oberyns fight scene aside from his face getting squashed
gameofthrones,not_removed,red wedding or the shot when jon is leaving the shore of hardholme and starring into the nights kings eyes the lack of music or dialogue is what makes the scene sometimes the best noise is no noise and the directors exemplified that well has to be one of my favorite shots in tv
gameofthrones,not_removed,season finale had a lot best episode of the show imo jons parentage reveal based lyanna mormont tommens suicide etc the slow lead up to the wildfire explosion was fantastic great soundtrack too
gameofthrones,not_removed,the scene in hardhome when jon edd and tormund run from the wight charge at the end of the battle
gameofthrones,not_removed,tie between the hound telling arya about how his brother burned him and when jaime was saying goodbye to tyrion after letting him out
gameofthrones,not_removed,drogo throat rip
gameofthrones,not_removed,any and all of the scenes involving tywin and arya from season those scenes are the stuff dreams are made of
gameofthrones,not_removed,hardhome is the best action scene i saw it right after botb and just preferred it for quiet moments cersei awaiting the results of blackwater with the children and ladies so tense the sinister preparations already made for cgi danys rescue by drogon in the fighting pits he flew around making terrifying noises smoking people alive getting hit losing half a wing and then in a subtle bit of action on his part silently communicating we gotta get the hell outta here to dany
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei blowing up the sept and all the build up to it that music tho
gameofthrones,not_removed,ctrl f hodor results click through them and realize theyre all in the side bar shame
gameofthrones,not_removed,after a read of all your comments i love the diversity between passive scenes and fighting scenes it shows how well the show is made when they put so much anticipation into both factors
gameofthrones,not_removed,the fight scene between the mountain and the viper it was what pictures in my head as i read it but this one bit where the viper jumps in the air and theres like cuts before he lands the editing makes me feel things
gameofthrones,not_removed,but sir the wildfire were to far from the gates fire their archers hundreds will die thousands this was the scene that instantly made stannis my favorite character
gameofthrones,not_removed,the watchers on the wall battle favorite episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,when sansa and jon reunited
gameofthrones,not_removed,came in to post this that scene is fucking incredible such great acting and apparently that was oberyns first day on set
gameofthrones,not_removed,so fuckin good entire trial hit me right in the feels
gameofthrones,not_removed,but what about what i waaaaaaaaaaant
gameofthrones,not_removed,sometimes i just watch it to remind myself of how good the show can be
gameofthrones,not_removed,i miss tywin so much
gameofthrones,not_removed,so good i like to imagine how that combat went down since we didnt get to see it the gods arent down here its the six of us you ear me and then grenn came from a farm when jons talking to mance after
gameofthrones,not_removed,looked and sounded check it out again and note the way the music builds up they really did a great job with that critical scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,jamie in the bath with brienne such a good scene good acting lots of character insight there
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would have to agree that tense build up during the stare down everyone knows what is about to happen and there is no stopping it the dread that slowly sets in and you cant help but get hyped
gameofthrones,not_removed,one of my favorites as well really inspiring when i think about the ways that asoiaf has helped me grow and mature in my own life this one always comes to mind
gameofthrones,not_removed,come home to the rdreadfort your kind is welcome here
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would even say that the scene marks the end of the game of thrones entirely for sure there will always be scheming but what we know as the game of thrones the vacuum of power that started when jon arryn died is over cersei won the game of thrones but she is as good as dead now the fight that in the grand scheme of things starts living vs the dead night vs light in some ways i felt a huge relief when she finally did what she did daenarys is at westeros doorsteps and she has three huge dragons that are fairly well trained as well there is not a lot of room for scheming and playing games when a wall of absolute power is coming at you
gameofthrones,not_removed,surprised i had to go down this far to find this my vote as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,lots of people name their swords
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,aye brans expressions through that whole scene were heartbreaking
gameofthrones,not_removed,that one is glorious than a thousand lying whores
gameofthrones,not_removed,robb youve ruined your sword
gameofthrones,not_removed,another great silent arya moment is her leaving westeros at the end of season i especially love the music in that scene but its beautifully shot as well and make for a great ending to a great season
gameofthrones,not_removed,the jon and sansa reunion is super powerful one of the most emotional moments in the series
gameofthrones,not_removed,always makes me giggle
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed showing him fight to the death would have been great screening
gameofthrones,not_removed,another great character unceremoniously killed off screen part of me hopes it was a bullshit throwaway line that hell make a comeback
gameofthrones,not_removed,when jaime was saying goodbye to tyrion after letting him out probably the most butchered scene of the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,i gave an audible fuck yeah when i first saw it the words leaving him right as he walks out of the shadows great character
gameofthrones,not_removed,justice
gameofthrones,not_removed,truly a scene worthy of reward storytelling atmosphere and a triumphant answer of hopeof course only to be crushed the next episodelike literally crushedhis head got crushed by that dudes hands
gameofthrones,not_removed,me too man the only thing that kept him from being my favorite character in the show was how he treated tyrion
gameofthrones,not_removed,loved that scene in the tunnel and jon remembering grenn awesome
gameofthrones,not_removed,he means a tv show
gameofthrones,not_removed,how was this better than botb its less impressive as a whole the tension is nowhere near the levels of botb its not shot as well theres barely any real battle strategy bigger yes but better i dont even think its close honestly
gameofthrones,not_removed,dude i like lotr but compared to got its pretty dated those special effects were awesome when the movie came out but looking at it now the cgi is pretty bad battle of the bastards not only had much better special effects but it really brought you down into the dirt and showed the horrors of war that cavalry charge was spectacular not to mention the chaos of the aftermath
gameofthrones,not_removed,too glorifying too much pathos and a total disregard of basic tactics imo
gameofthrones,not_removed,god that stark music chills
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre absolutely right
gameofthrones,not_removed,second this this is where you realize how tragic of a character jaime really is
gameofthrones,not_removed,lots of cunts
gameofthrones,not_removed,but the reaction would be the same as it was to selmys death selmy killed a dozen people before going down and people still complained it would be the same with the blackfish what is done is done i will not complain because he died offscreen we cannot see everything
gameofthrones,not_removed,this pepper with arrows use spears through the gate or just stand there and wait yeah that sounds like a good plan also the gate was broken the wrong way itlooked like the giant pulled it in instead of breaking through
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes i did mean a tv show also she d
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree got excels at making relatively smallscale shots look much larger i think they said there were or so horses charging towards kit harrington but it looked like all the horses in the world this was done to less effect in the battle of the blackwater when i read that sequence in the books it seemed immeasurably more vast and epic instead of beach where the fighting is
gameofthrones,not_removed,the complete battle of the pellenor fields longer and bigger than this youtube clip was great with amazing stakes
gameofthrones,not_removed,because its minutes of a minute total siege scene it is pure hopelessness in the city until the rohirrim arrive this is evidenced by the clip at the very end of the steward preparing to burn him and his son alive
gameofthrones,not_removed,ohhhhh spicyd
gameofthrones,not_removed,right and botb is minutes of high stakes high tension and plenty of hopelessness as well ive seen lotr i still dont think this is better its on a larger scale but that does not equate to being a better piece of art
gameofthrones,not_removed,the hot dog chilling on the couch is the star
gameofthrones,not_removed,i bet somebodys putting their drogo in that tonight
gameofthrones,not_removed,im sure the writers left the stars in danis dreams to distract of any foreshadowing
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha well in the vision there was basically nothing
gameofthrones,not_removed,they choose to made it all happens offscreen i agree with that decision and everyones plate is full right now they really dont care about whats happening half world away
gameofthrones,not_removed,lyanna mormont does mention it as does ramsay
gameofthrones,not_removed,people blame the show for not making it clear it was so obvious that ned was not the father and all you have to do is listen to the dialogues
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually typed on google did ned stark and did ned stark sleep with his sister came up as an autofill suggestion you are not the only one who thought this i assure you and youre not stupid for thinking so either
gameofthrones,not_removed,what would make you even think that he was ned and lyannas child come on now
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought the same thing when watching the show the hints to rhaegar and lyanna were sprinkled so lightly throughout seasons that i couldnt piece it together i thought for sure he was lyanna and neds baby then i hit the internet and was like oh that makes more sense
gameofthrones,not_removed,my question is how did he get black hair 😂
gameofthrones,not_removed,heres something that is sitting not quite right with me people are saying the hints are all there that rhaegar did not rape lyanna for real everyone talks about what a nice guy he is duh well guess what rapists can be nice people on the outside women get raped all the time by someone they thought they trusted who on the outside appeared to be a sweet and gentle person that other westerosi citizens besides robert had nothing but good things to say about rhaegar says nothing of his ability to rape not that im saying he did rape lyanna im of the opinion that he did not but thats because ive done a lot of reading online outside of the episodes also its super subjective to say the show made it obvious that rhaegar was the dad his name is only ever mentioned in passing besides for the one conversation dany and barristan have about him which has nothing to do with jon or lyanna close to the end of season they should have reiterated the story of him running off with lyanna or in the tower of joy scene ned should have made a clear statement before going into the tower perhaps to howland the thing is they place a couple indirect context lines right before this huge swordfight and by the time its over half the viewers dont even remember who is in the tower with this much material packed into each episode its no wonder that its hard to retain information such as the rhaegar and lyanna story when it doesnt seem to be important to the story line when my boyfriend first saw the finale he thought jon was roberts bastard by lyanna i only knew it was rhaegar because i read about rlj online its really not as clear as it could be
gameofthrones,not_removed,when would ned have had the time or the chance he was being fostered in the eerie since what he probably didnt see her until the tourney at harrenhal even if that did happen there it still wouldve taken months for him to go to the riverlands marry cat and also return north gather his men then march south fight a few battles be there for the sack of kings landing and lift the siege of storms end by the time he found lyanna jon wouldve been a few months old not a new born babe
gameofthrones,not_removed,not to mention hbos notorious infograph which is easily found on the internet
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh shit i totally thought it was incest too so neds blood doesnt run through the king in the north after all interesting
gameofthrones,not_removed,but wouldnt it be nice to see some stark incest going on
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol his baffled face i fucked my sister
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon snow is lyanna starks baby from the tower of joy game of thrones season six episode ten finale in entertainment views since dec ryoutubefactsbotwikiindex
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think some people get locked into something and neglect to unlearn it even when it stops making the most sense their brain got locked into ned being the father and they just waited for the mother reveal
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the show rhaegars mentioned like times half of those were in season episode add that to the fact that literally everyone in westeros thinks that ned is jons father and youve got a really easy mistake to make if youre an average viewer
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah lyanna had brown hair and rhaegar fucking gold neon fluorescent hair
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre spot on about how rhaegars really nice persona could be a facade i know most people agree that it wasnt rape but for me a consensual elopement doesnt seem like it tells the whole story either why wouldnt lyanna tell her family at least her brothers maybe in a letter about what she was doing why would the two of them allow her family to believe shed been kidnapped at the very least rhaegar was selfish in taking lyanna away and letting her family think she was in danger even if she did want to go with him he shouldve anticipated the chaos and harm that would cause but it seems like he didnt care
gameofthrones,not_removed,it comes up a lot that lyanna was bold strong and more like arya ive always thought the assumption that she was prisoner was dumb considering everyone knew her to be this wild force rather than a meek maiden im surprised more people didnt assume it was consensual but maybe that was more for the protection of jon
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea it does lyanna and ned are siblings jon is lyannas son thus stark blood and neds still run through jons veins
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned is jons uncle so they still have the same blood
gameofthrones,not_removed,no
gameofthrones,not_removed,kind of i mean the way she said she loved ned and the whole raping stuff with rhaegar led me to believe she would hate jon not make ned protect him
gameofthrones,not_removed,ok characters viewers yes the characters thought that ned was jons father why would they have any doubt although stannis did doubt that in and pretty all those other times its stated that he was caring and what not its all there for us to see that theres more to the story that rhaegar kidnapped lyanna but with being about lyanna i can almost guarantee it that they will have be about rhaegar and other types of flashbacks
gameofthrones,not_removed,everybody has darker hair in the north because of the camera filter they use compare melisandres hair with her hair same wig in interviews kit has dark brown hair
gameofthrones,not_removed,the targaryan genes were regressive and the whiteblond hair was not passed on outside the family which is why the targaryans engaged in incest to keep the blood pure and maintain the purple eyes and silver hair which is why jon takes after lyanna and looks like a stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres no reason to believe the raping thing that came from robert who was heavily biased against rhaegar everyone else that knew rhaegar and talked about him says he was a good guy that was an intentional clue the tower was defended by kingsguard under rhaegars command another clue
gameofthrones,not_removed,we only get information from the characters we literally cant get information from a source other than a character and every single one of them is saying ned is jons father or by the old gods and new my head sure aches having been impaled onto the walls of kings landing
gameofthrones,not_removed,we only hear rape kidnap from robert all of the other stories we hear about rhaegar are that he was kind and caring and even lfs face when sansa is talking about him makes it seem that the story isnt entirely accurate
gameofthrones,not_removed,but still ned rescued her he actually had to kill those kingsguard men even while being her own brother
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes but ned is is father maybe not his biological father but he still raised jon since he was a baby rhaegar may be his dad but ned is his true father they say that because they dont know the true events that only ned and howland reed know so yes they all think ned is his actual father only because nobody knows what happened at the toj and when ned went south but we as a view do the seeds have been planted since edit the dialogue between robert and ned while on the kings road hints at it ser barristan talks about how loved rhaegar was by the people and when maester aemon is talking to sam about dany being the last targ being alone in the world who happens to walk in directly after that statement jon and like i said stannis makes the comment about how fathering a bastard and cheating isnt neds way its never directly said or confirmed that rhaegar is his father but the hints are there
gameofthrones,not_removed,because they were ordered to protect rhaegars child from the rebel leaders
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think you remember what youre arguing my original point is that the average viewer would not be able to piece things together and it is understandable that people would think ned was the biological father meanwhile youre off talking about parenting do you have any idea why people care about provingdisproving rlj were talking about blood lineage you know the single most important trait a westerosi would have next youll tell me that targ blood isnt all that important
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes and im talking about how the hints have been there for the viewer to know that ned wasnt jons father i know plenty of people that have watched the show and was able to follow the hints to realize that ned isnt jons father so no youre not giving the average viewer enough credit
gameofthrones,not_removed,targaryan blood isnt important when the child carrying it is an unacknowledged bastard with no name or family rights which is what jon will be if his actual parents become known rhaegar made no provision for publically acknowledging the child and elisa was till alive when rhaegar died so he cannot have married lyanna under the faith which is the only way of the people living south of the neck would accept jon as a legitimate heir
gameofthrones,not_removed,the average viewer dont even remember who robert was
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was almost too hard for most of the characters in the show to accept that honorable edard stark would make a bastard son so how can anyone believe he would have engaged in incest with his sister not to mention the story of the abduction and rape makes it plain that too much time passed between the abduction and birth for the baby to be anyones but rhaegars unless you posit a lyanna fling with ser arthur dayne or hightower
gameofthrones,not_removed,black keys howlin for you
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you very much you shall be one of my good men
gameofthrones,not_removed,team cleganebowl
gameofthrones,not_removed,whole thread full of them a few days ago
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks for the suggestion
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,bran tyrion davos jorah and jaimie have all survived the numerous wars andor sieges despite their disabilities or dwarfismgreyscale as the case may be in an era where disabilities usually meant you were left for dead jon snow had to die before becoming a man maester aemon and its hard to conduct your first war when emotions are so very high defend your sisters honor try to save your brother rickon and family home etc etc littlefinger is as cunning and conniving as ever varys is still the spider the hound still has his bite dany was abused by her brother and sold into marriage that marriage gave her power which she immediately drank up and used to free herself from viserys grasp and has since attempted to do the same for all the oppressed people she has come across in her travels back to westeros brienne endured a humiliating childhood because of how she looked she rose up to become a great knight sansa was humilated in front of joffreys court married off twice for someones quest for power abused and raped and managed to finally make it home arya was blinded by sexy jesus oops is that sexist and beaten senseless by the waif she made many mistakes and will probably make some more before all her names are crossed off her list i am trying to figure out how overcoming disabilities abuse rape and humiliation is too feminist are these women all supposed to continue being subjugated to the wills of insane men until they die are these disabled men not smart enough
gameofthrones,not_removed,the story is not about women taking over its about the weak the cripple the bad son the commoner the woman the bastard the maimed the fat the sick all of them supposed to be reduced to victims underdogs or at best royal wombs taking over all the ones that were born to rule or be powerful eventually gets destroyed
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wonder do you notice when a show depicts several powerful andor intelligent men overcome their struggles and the women only play minor throwaway dimensional roles as completely normal unfortunately that thing is a regular occurrence why is the one time that the roles reversed it is now sexist
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah dd are clearly manhating feminists that explains the lack of gratuitous female nudity in the show oh wait
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the show is pushing its feminist agenda a tad far maybe but honestly men are doing just fine jon snow aka got jesus or tptwp has been reborn in the battle of winterfell and made king in the north littlefinger has played himself into a position of power as protector of the vale one could argue hes smarter than any of the women you mentioned without being criticized varys isnt infallible but hes consistently more well informed he got surprised magic does that but he still cobbled together the alliance between dorne danaerys and olenna qyburn is the only character in the show who seems to have any interest in studying science and hes quite good at what he does as for women theyve had their share of fools too lisa arryn comes to mind is it a tad ridiculous that major houses are led by women now yes is it ruining anything no so let it go it could be like of network television where the guy is always wrong about everything even if his point makes more sense
gameofthrones,not_removed,tywin lannister nuff said andthe present is not pastfor a long time it was the men who were nearly entirely in charge including stannis and others you also dont mention tyrion jorah davos samwell podrick bronn etc instead you mention about all the women in some sort of power role and an about equivalent number of men though theres a lot more men both living and dead that are in the tv show at least
gameofthrones,not_removed,idk how this even got upvoted you realize that al the part youve quoted about negative thngs that have happened to women are from the books right while most of the positive parts are from dd writing and stuff that didnt happen in the books its dd that took the freedom to make women rule everything and men incompetent
gameofthrones,not_removed,minimizes the intelligence and achievements of every male character on the show complains that the show is sexist against men
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is more male nudity in the show than female and there is almost exclusively violence against males in the show ever since dani told her brand new bff that only men must die ive kept count far more topless males about the same number of bums and pubic hair exclusively male genitalia not one single snootch shown and the graphic violence almost exclusively against men and boys even when the wildlings attacked the village and they made a point of saying kill everyone you only the the violent deaths of the men so the op has a good point
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think its ridiculous that major houses are led by women now because in war many die and arguably more men than women because they are in high positions not women if it were a tale in the time of peace then it would be weird but given the circumstances i dont believe so
gameofthrones,not_removed,you should do a rewatch everything i mentioned has been mentioned or seen in the show it honestly feels like some people just want to make connections where there are none to promote their own bigoted agenda over a fantasy series
gameofthrones,not_removed,whats a snootch
gameofthrones,not_removed,well have to agree to disagree there given the overly prejudiced against women system in place and its longstanding status i believe its hard to fathom separate major houses all accepting a woman as their leader slightly hard to fathom anyway just my opinion i think its great that strong female characters exist and i enjoy the heck out of watching the show but just as it might tug at the edges of your suspension of disbelief to see the hero win all the time it tugs at my suspension of disbelief to see so many women in power at once in a world where they shouldnt have it that said bring on queensbowl get hype lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,eveyrthing youve mentioned was written by grrm and adapted in the show all the women take control and rule while men are incomptent is dd creation theon doesnt come to yara and say she should rule in the books cersei isnt anywhere near the freaking iron throne in the books doran didnt get himself kllled by ellaria in the books mace tyrell isnt dead in the books and even he died willas and garlan would still be there to rule if needed all the pro feminist shit is from dd this is a fact just like how tyrions character has been turned to shit since he met dany as he became as servant instead of the very interesting individual he once was
gameofthrones,not_removed,is that not a common word where you are snootch gobbler someone who engages in cunnilingus its right up there with norks you get your bras from nork supplies
gameofthrones,not_removed,did you complain during when men had all the power and all women were weak slaves to them
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh k
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was grrms plot not dd who are massive feminists
gameofthrones,not_removed,no its just a tease doubt the footage will actually be used in the show watch it and youll see what i mean
gameofthrones,not_removed,at the end of the trailer cersei breathes and its cold so winter comes to kings landing guess the whole show is ruined now
gameofthrones,not_removed,why so serious
gameofthrones,not_removed,nothing definitive is shown only stuff that leads to people speculating
gameofthrones,not_removed,the first thing that came to mind was they are foreshadowing the three heads of the dragon im sure someone more knowledgeable on the matter will explain why this cant be a thing just saying its what popped in my head
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just watched it thanks for your answer
gameofthrones,not_removed,im pretty certain there will be the footage of dany waking into the throne room on dragon stone theres no way theyd only use that in the tease
gameofthrones,not_removed,if only there was some way for us to know that winter was coming
gameofthrones,not_removed,anything the point of trailers is to get people to want to watch something i already know i do i dont want to know anything i avoided all trailers for last season and it felt so much better not knowing i would read the threads and people were like oh so this was the horses from the trailer and im glad i didnt know those things
gameofthrones,not_removed,they need a weather man canada could probably give them one
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is precisely one piece of new information in the trailer that i noticed though its not explicit a lot of people didnt seem to catch it or understand it seems like an episode spoiler too so nothing major but if you dont want to see anything you should probably skip this trailer for now
gameofthrones,not_removed,canadian here winter is here winter is here to stay
gameofthrones,not_removed,seems like we have found theons sausage on the bolton helmet
gameofthrones,not_removed,well you should be aware going in its longer than the bible approximately times longer so far
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like the show and its what i started with but the books are what i prefer the show does a decent job at recreating the books but there will never be enough budget or time to completely do it also a lot of characters arent perfectly transferable jon for example has a constant internal struggle which cant really be shown on tv the books are great to get into if youve seen the show because agot is very similar to season while some characters are left out its the most linear story and has the least amount of povs i believe ive heard about people getting confused about characters when first reading agot but as i had seen the show before i had an understanding and a picture in my head of who was who
gameofthrones,not_removed,i had the privilege of getting to read all the books prior to the show coming out and the show was just that much more enjoyable to watch going into the show having read the books made the experience a lot more fun considering you have a ton of knowledge about the world and the tiny things that make one scene mean much more
gameofthrones,not_removed,i watched the show times over before i tackled the books recently i do enjoy all the extra info and plots in the books and would recommend reading them it can be a bit of a slog at times because you already know the big plot twist moments if you run into this problem i would recommend world of ice and fire as well as a knight of the seven kingdoms as they are both awesome and have new material but are still relevant to asoiaf reading the books actually made me appreciate a lot of the things the show did to properly adapt the material for tv i love them both for different reasons
gameofthrones,not_removed,i watched the show first then read the books getting through agot and the first half of acok was a struggle because the show is nearly identical to those but once you get past them its deffintly worth it agot took me ± months acok months and then asos affc adwd took me only ± months combined absolutely worth the struggle
gameofthrones,not_removed,i watched the first seasons and bought the books i read a game of thrones in about months and really really loved im at of a clash of kings the books can be very massive somethings but the amount of rich details you can get reading the books really worth it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i powered through the show in weeks so im glad its super long more content to process combined with the fact that im a pretty slow reader should take me close to the premiere of season
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did the opposite of you and funnily enough the opposite is just as true i feel like seeing the show before the books helped me a lot in keeping everything organized most chapters in the books are shown in the show so it really helps me visualize whats happening when i can just picture the scene in the show and when the two do differ its glaringly obvious and super interesting to see where grrm went with it originally
gameofthrones,not_removed,started in the summer after ended currently at page or so in asos
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah im going through the books now after seeing the show and im loving it because a i know theres a lot of newdifferent stuff in the books im only at the beginning of acok and theres not much so far but i know its coming and thats exciting and b since i know whats going to happen more or less i can really savor the backstory and lore i feel like if i read the books first i would be impatient with the lore since id be more interested in learning what happens next
gameofthrones,not_removed,my favorite thing about book vs show is i get to see a different perspective my version vs somebody elses imagination i dont ever think book or show is better because i get to see somebody elses interpretation of a bookstorynovel that i enjoyed from another like mind its always fun to analyze the difference of interpretation between people reading the same story
gameofthrones,not_removed,because i saw the show first ill always seem the characters as they are on the show but i like the indepth of the books what they think and why they do things
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was said that cersei made up the story of her firstborn black haired child just in order to comfort catelyn he never existed
gameofthrones,not_removed,i get that she had a child to robert but isnt part of the prophecy gold will be their crowns meaning golden hair the three children joff myrcella and tommen with golden crowns all die
gameofthrones,not_removed,the most interesting part of the prophecy is how the queen will die
gameofthrones,not_removed,but she and robert talked about it when they were alone in kl
gameofthrones,not_removed,no it means they will all be crowned kings and queensthe show didnt do it but in the booksthere is a faction in dorne who plan or planned to crown myrcella as a queen
gameofthrones,not_removed,wasnt that showonly
gameofthrones,not_removed,i totally misremembered that but its still possible that it is a double entendre for golden crown
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes the books had cersei chugging moon tea to get rid of unwanted baratheon uterus usurpers
gameofthrones,not_removed,unwanted baratheon uterus usurpers ouch
gameofthrones,not_removed,so he exists then
gameofthrones,not_removed,you my friend have a way with words
gameofthrones,not_removed,no he doesnt exist in the books if she became pregnant from robert in the books she drank moon tea in order to abort the unwanted baratheon uterus usurper cersei never gave birth to a baratheon in the books i think the show added it to show cersei has somewhat of a human side because she appeared to be saddened by the babys death and also maybe to show that she did at one point love robert and wanted to have his children she grew to despise him later on
gameofthrones,not_removed,ohhh ok i havent read the books yet but i figured she still mentioned the unwanted baratheon uterus usurper
gameofthrones,not_removed,sound crazy
gameofthrones,not_removed,bit is better

gameofthrones,not_removed,or he might find himself thrown off another tower
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i assumed that was foreshadowing him warging into a dragon i predict hell have to warg a dragon thats fallen under the night kings control or something like that
gameofthrones,not_removed,this theorys been around since before the show even came out it was only a song of ice fire readers ruminating about bran the future
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol thrice you will be thrown off of towers and thrice you will deny me also if you want to fly that way you couldnt do much better than the wall right
gameofthrones,not_removed,the things i do for hype
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah the dragon thats inside the wall or in the pool at winterfell
gameofthrones,not_removed,and
gameofthrones,not_removed,if the ice dragon inside the wall is on the king of nights side it could lend credence to the theory that the white walkers are only back to defeat the danger posed by the real dragons and that maybe they arent evil but are just returning to save the realms of men from the power of dragons that once decimated the land
gameofthrones,not_removed,and🎤
gameofthrones,not_removed,and they said it was the first time hearing this theory
gameofthrones,not_removed,well the walkers were already attacking the nights watch before the birth of danys dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,arya has to marry george rr martin
gameofthrones,not_removed,they said exactly the opposite im sure that this isnt the first time somebody has proffered this theory
gameofthrones,not_removed,its possible that they have some foresight though they can see the future since they were created by the children
gameofthrones,not_removed,this was my first time making a costume from craft foam and i think it came out great the total cost was about dollars i only bought the craft foam paint shirt toy sword sword belt and leather shoelaces

gameofthrones,not_removed,i think she should give ramsey another shot
gameofthrones,not_removed,just gonna say his cousin sansa isnt nearly as cool as his aunt danny
gameofthrones,not_removed,so its a ship war eh jonsansa vs jondanny vs sansaagon vs dannyagon vs dannysansa fly your banners the war of five ships has begun
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive never thought of a daenerys sansa marriage but now thats just all i want to happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,httpimgurcomadjphc
gameofthrones,not_removed,short answer no
gameofthrones,not_removed,nah its not like jaime and cersei where theyve always been in love and more than that jon and sansa genuinely did grow up as siblings and nothing more you cant really find out someones not your sister and then be like automatically attracted to her and forget the years you spent being related i know theyre all accepting of jon now because even though hes a bastard hes neds bastard once it comes out that hes a targ i dont believe there will be much support behind him or behind an arranged marriage to sansa
gameofthrones,not_removed,with how widereaching game of thrones tv audience is i wonder what hbos stance on a brothersister relationship like this would be im sure a large portion of the viewer base would be taken aback seeing the two kiss on screen let alone get married we all remember how so many websites reacted to that sansaramsay rape scene obviously i believe in their will to stay true to the books if a sansa jon relationship is what grrm has planned but it also begs the question how much they care about viewership
gameofthrones,not_removed,that was a reach tbh
gameofthrones,not_removed,sansa is in marriage with tyrion theyll meet again tyrion was the only person in kings landing who treat her nicely and it means something for the future when jon and dany will meet tyrion and sansa will as well these two will be the peacemakers between jon and dany and he most likely aeryss bastard hbo confirmed that jaimesand cerseis real father is tywinwith that roberts rebellion picture where jons father was also confirmed so only tyrion could be a targaryen bastard
gameofthrones,not_removed,i can just imagine the wedding night a quick dry closed mouthed kiss followed by an awkward moment followed by jon running off to his own chamber
gameofthrones,not_removed,i usually love these videos but the starting premise of the lady ashford lineup is just so weak even he admits it doesnt work but then maintains its too close to be a coincidence and carries on
gameofthrones,not_removed,i could see this happening but i hope it doesnt even after jon finds out about his heritage i hope that he comes to the realization that ned is his true father and the starks are his true family in that scenario he would find it gross to marry someone he considers his sister even if she is his cousin
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon really needs a show love interest who is not related to him
gameofthrones,not_removed,my bad meant osha but missandei heyyyy gurl what yo digits
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really believe that this will happen in the books for all of the reasons stated in this video also sophie turner does say that sansa finds out about jons parentage and that it effects their relationship but on the subject of jon and sansa marrying she says i couldnt do those types of scenes with kit i would laugh too much so unless she is trolling us again this isnt happening or at least not this season
gameofthrones,not_removed,ughh
gameofthrones,not_removed,nnnoooooooo she wont
gameofthrones,not_removed,id ship it but i just havent recovered from ygrittes death not quite sure why im so fond of her character in the books and show but she has consistently been one of my favorite characters since she was introduced
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think we just stumbled upon pornhubs top parody
gameofthrones,not_removed,they said there always has to be a stark in winterfell doesnt seem like bran arya or benjen are gonna carry on the stark line so it would make sense for jon and sansa to keep the starks in winterfell
gameofthrones,not_removed,snow will marry danaeries producing tygarian heir
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually would like this to happen i just dont see why it would need to happen with episodes left im not expecting a fight in westeros after danys against cersei and possibly euron i could see this happening if jon decided to take the throne as the rightful heir but i dont believe it is something he or sansa would want atm they just want peace if they did though it could be a decent plan to break danys army imagine they the army find out they have been fighting and risking their lives for the wrong heir im not saying they would join jon but they could just leave maybe and dany couldnt do anything against it because they are supposed to be free
gameofthrones,not_removed,everyones crazy who thinks anything but dany and jon getting together
gameofthrones,not_removed,if his heritage was made known i could see this happening
gameofthrones,not_removed,ew god i hope not
gameofthrones,not_removed,really short video i wish it was longer thats what she said
gameofthrones,not_removed,i ship it which means it probably wont happen because this show kills all my ships sobs
gameofthrones,not_removed,too bad for jons wife that hell have to temper lightbringer
gameofthrones,not_removed,i predict that sansa will die next season mainly because her wolf was killed
gameofthrones,not_removed,ew thats nasty
gameofthrones,not_removed,theyre cousins at best you sick fuck
gameofthrones,not_removed,shell probably marry robin if shes smart she will anyway
gameofthrones,not_removed,i always figured that sansa would stay unmarried for the rest of her life kind of like elizabeth i i suspect that shell be the lady of winterfell while jon and dany get married and rule from kings landing
gameofthrones,not_removed,hey babe uh sorry i tried feeding u to the dogs i swear it was out of love i mean i didnt think theyd really eat you since theyre loyal beats and all my bad
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah and she should use his bow
gameofthrones,not_removed,cough song of ice and fire cough
gameofthrones,not_removed,he likes redheads though
gameofthrones,not_removed,what makes you think shes not as cool as his auntie but either way incest yuck not that this story is forbidden of it but incest never made things easier
gameofthrones,not_removed,well those targ boys do like having two wives
gameofthrones,not_removed,most erotic episode of family ties ever
gameofthrones,not_removed,this would definitely explain the slight lesbian vibe that was intentionally put in the asha has a dany audience scene from a storywriters perspective we already have dany experimenting with a girl at the drothraki camp she has stated that she didnt feel anything after breaking up with daario and now the lets agressively flirt with the girl from the iron isles thing seriously this screams setup to me not to mention that aegon the targaryen in the books who is with varys and invading westeros was merged with dany in the show so i would set my money on sansa marries aegon in the books and dany in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,or jonaegon right
gameofthrones,not_removed,the fuck lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,delet ths
gameofthrones,not_removed,long answer nooooo
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes still half stark and he backed up his supposed birth right with actions worthy of their respect in the show the lords dont kneel to him because he has the right but because he is male has proven his honor proven his reputation in battle multiple times and was raised by eddard and alongside robb he fits enough prerequisites for them and hes also a selfless visionary leader which is too bad because by rights they should be acclaiming sansa as queen of the north she won the battle by bringing in the knights of the vale she has the existing familypersonal connections to the north the vale and the riverlands and is the unquestioned trueborn daughter of eddard stark and jon is a rare war leader who would follow her as his reigning queen without any marriage she let the conversation in the great hall go too far without inserting herself into it and the lords declared for jon including royce and some vale knightslords that last part is going to be tricky
gameofthrones,not_removed,totally agree with jaime and cersei but jons half targ half stark no matter what this shouldnt change the norths support
gameofthrones,not_removed,they are not going to be attracted to each other that is the catch they will marry to strengthen their hold on the north when the north finds out about jons parentage his marriage to the eldest stark girl will help them to keep the north united they will not like it at all but like cat and ned they will grow to love each other they are ned and cat
gameofthrones,not_removed,well we at least know that hbo is willing to show brother forcing sister into rough sex over the corpse of their dead incest baby so im thinking an onscreen portrayal of a sansajon romance isnt out of the question
gameofthrones,not_removed,with how widereaching game of thrones tv audience is i wonder what hbos stance on a brothersister relationship like this would be im sure a large portion of the viewer base would be taken aback seeing the two kiss on screen let alone get married didnt we see jaime and cersei fucking in the first episode of the series
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wonder what hbos stance on a brothersister relationship like this would be are you serious
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is a valid point and while people will point to jamie and cersei as obvious examples of this not mattering consider this jamie and cersei both as actors and their characters are adults remember we first see sansa when sophie turner was barely and i cant remember how old shes supposed to be on the show but her getting her period on the show suggests shes supposed to be when the show starts now even though sophie turner is now so there isnt an issue people still view her and sansa as a teenager so if you couple that with the incest angle i think its unlikely you see that happen on the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt it clear they are not brothersister now anyways empire strikes back
gameofthrones,not_removed,theyre technically first cousins which in this universe would make them incestuous than many characters in fact the most obvious pairing the serie books anyway is heading for in my opinion is jon and daenerys which is nephewaunt and therefore more incestuous than this pairing by far
gameofthrones,not_removed,incest only works if its people we already dont like jon and sansa are protagonists who the vast majority of viewers like they also grew up as brother and sister and their reunion was made more emotional because of that so no incest would not work
gameofthrones,not_removed,did you watch the first episode lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,believe it or not but through the idea of jon sansa got more attention day by day and rlj confirmation just make it more comfortable and encouraged more people to wanted to happen it is already know by the media internet and hell even the producers that just some people want jon and sansa together
gameofthrones,not_removed,but their marriage was never consummated so im sure by that alone nobody would consider them married certainly i dont think sansa and tyrion consider themselves to be married particularly because they were both forced into the marriage i know thats just how that works in medievalesque times you dont really get a say but at this point whos even going to enforce the point anyway
gameofthrones,not_removed,all of this seems good and makes sense except for that tyrion targaryen theory no offense to you but i think its a pretty bad theory thats just a tad bit too close to fan service for me one secret targaryen is enough and if anyone should be a secret targaryen it shouldnt be tyrion being the son of tywin lannister adds an interesting dynamic to their relationship that would otherwise be well not as interesting if tywin wasnt his father
gameofthrones,not_removed,not to mention that jon and tyrion have already met and bonded together at the wall they were fond of each other no doubt
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would love it if they ended up together but that just seems too good to be true
gameofthrones,not_removed,sansa and tyrion are no longer married sansas marriage to ramsay cancelled her marriage to tyrion i dont know why people think sansa can be married to tyrion when she married someone else legitimately in the show at least and consummated that marriage
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like it good theory
gameofthrones,not_removed,awesome foursome this is got after damn mami gonna be hot
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think its weak at all including house hardyng in that is an obvious tell that it referencing sansa hardyng is like he said a very obscure house he says theres a possibilities he doesnt say its set in stone
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,meera but not that popular
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dunno i think going after nonfamily is a bit of a red hairing for him
gameofthrones,not_removed,well dany isnt any better
gameofthrones,not_removed,my digits are
gameofthrones,not_removed,hair
gameofthrones,not_removed,eh dany is so op that shes destined to be an antagonist imo
gameofthrones,not_removed,no arya and gendry she can be his family
gameofthrones,not_removed,lady has been dead forever now though all of the other stark childrens deaths have occurred much closer to their wolfs death well really just rickon and rob summer died and i think bran is in it for the long haul
gameofthrones,not_removed,technically sansa is his cousin would you prefer for him to marry his aunt danaerys
gameofthrones,not_removed,sorry my bad
gameofthrones,not_removed,sounds about right for royal families then
gameofthrones,not_removed,wrong elizabeth sansa is basically an expy of elizabeth of york tied via family alliances to the north the riverlands and the vale of arryn her fathers untimely death kicked off a war her two brothers were imprisoned in a tower and vanished mysteriously and various competitors in a civil war conspired to marry her the marriage of elizabeth of york and henry tudor aka henry vii ended the war of the roses
gameofthrones,not_removed,ramsay isnt dead him and stannis crawled under the dumpster
gameofthrones,not_removed,and my axe
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe its referring to danys icy heart and the series will end with them melting it with a cool island song
gameofthrones,not_removed,poor melisandre never got her chance
gameofthrones,not_removed,if i have attractive people surrounding me like jon does i would be all up on the incest hype train
gameofthrones,not_removed,you have to keep that dragon blood as pure as possible though
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes half targaryen incest is in his blood
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think for me dany would be the clear choice even though her bloodline is closer to his sansa is like a sister to him in his head even though shes a redhead the idea of sister marriage is still grosser than aunt also targaryens regularly intermarry and it keeps the dragon blood powers strongest if he does
gameofthrones,not_removed,but the targaryens have been marrying each other for years so dany would be more cool with it than sansa stark in theory
gameofthrones,not_removed,but quieter this time so sansa married jon snow
gameofthrones,not_removed,good point but my first still stands do you really think jon and sansa would agree to that sansas already been forced into one abusive engagement one abusive marriage and one that simply had no future potential i dont see her being gungho about entering into another one especially if its with a man shes spent her life thinking is her brother
gameofthrones,not_removed,but again its not like ned and cat grew up thinking they were brothersister
gameofthrones,not_removed,and that scene wasnt even rapey in the books so it seems like the show writers are not that careful after all
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes but the audience has never been encouraged to root for jaime and cersei you can sympathise or even like but you rarely want them to succeed in the same way as jon and sansa
gameofthrones,not_removed,that scene wasnt intended to be rapey i think it was just a problem with editing and acting
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah but are they gonna risk their golden boy
gameofthrones,not_removed,but did they kiss
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon and dany are also much more closely related than most nephewaunts because of targaryen history of incest
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the marriage not being consummated is part of rhards point tyrion was kind and didnt pressure sansa after being raped by ramsey she will appreciate tyrions kindness even more doesnt mean shell want to reopen the idea of marriage with him but she will definitely try to convince jon to trust this wise man that showed her warmth and care during a time where everyone around her was cold and manipulative
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the books they mention that the only person who can annul the marriage is the high septon the current book high septon doesnt seem the annulling type and who knows if there will even be new high septon
gameofthrones,not_removed,look for tyrion to recommend consummating that marriage now
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was never consummated yes but if theyd meet again tyrion would totally deserve a smart kind beautiful girl who knows how the game played and sansa knows nowthanks to lf and like i said tyrion was always kind to sansa who would evaluate tyrion now that she grew
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,honestly if jon and sansa got together would people really be like whaat thats gross like come on weve seen worse
gameofthrones,not_removed,you hate him that much
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats what i get for doing the audio book i have no idea how to spell half the names or places
gameofthrones,not_removed,its not that theyre related its that sansa is a dweeb dany is not much better id rather he married the red woman
gameofthrones,not_removed,if sansas story line follows elizabeth of york its going to end sadly with her losing those she loves
gameofthrones,not_removed,touche
gameofthrones,not_removed,walking dead fans will never let that go nor should we
gameofthrones,not_removed,like a prom night dumpster baby
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really hope you can row a boat under a dumpster
gameofthrones,not_removed,they were poisoned by their enemies
gameofthrones,not_removed,you carry the fates of us all little one
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought we were cooling her hot heart with a fresh island song
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is exactly what will happen it will then lead to the liberation of ser hat
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon a singer well see about that if hes like his biological father
gameofthrones,not_removed,ocean man
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe he could melt her heart with his firey sword lightbringer
gameofthrones,not_removed,disneys game of thrones
gameofthrones,not_removed,almost banged mel plus all the redheads in the show have told him he knows nothing
gameofthrones,not_removed,banged one almost another two ros and mel he mentioned her to sam during season he seems to be attracting redheads but thankfully he never banged mel
gameofthrones,not_removed,she had her chance she just got burned like lucerys targaryen
gameofthrones,not_removed,so like if you had a hot sibling youd hit it nice
gameofthrones,not_removed,well jon raised as a stark would hardly care to keep bloodline pure you know ice zombies up there beyond the wall also can dany even have a children in the books she might be but on the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,while hes half targaryen but he was never raised with this tradition unlike dany starks like others do married cousins between themselves but jon could easily view incest as not so good thing i think while they could be in love eventually but when he finds theyre family he could be sort oh wait a minute kinda moment it would be even funnier if they get married and he finds out theyre related
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon was raised as stark and not targaryen and he might not care to keep the dragon blood pure he would need to have emotional connection he would barely meet her only one is aemon idea of marrying his cousin is not grosser than his aunt i think when people who want jon with sansa say his marriage with dany is gross its just hypocrites and vice versa
gameofthrones,not_removed,they are not siblings so its not gross cousins marry in westeros they never had a close sibling relationship to begin with they made sure they showed that more than once on the show sansa apologizing to jon for treating him like an outsider and jons discussion to melissandre how he would never sit at table with his family jon was looking at sansa in a not very brotherly way when they reunitedonce they find out they are cousins they will marry jon and sansa will reunite through marriage targs and starks
gameofthrones,not_removed,they did that but jon was raised as a stark whiley they do marry cousins but its not on the level of targaryens dany was repelled by idea on the show of marrying viserys but maybe it was because of his nature in the books she was content with it
gameofthrones,not_removed,sansa wants more than anything her home and her family some say she will marry robin arryn and i just dont get why anyone would think sansa will ever marry and leave the north she wont do that she wants to stay home and marrying jon will help her to keep her home for herself and her family
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh hell naw they would not marry i imagine in the books she will marry hardyng who will die in battle by being reckless or cause littlefinger will off him at that point maybe shell marry faegon or no one maybe shell end the series ruling areas under her own authority
gameofthrones,not_removed,no they were complete strangers when they married
gameofthrones,not_removed,allegedly they didnt mean for it to come across that way in the show either it was apparently a misstep in the editing process and they didnt realize it would present that way
gameofthrones,not_removed,speak for yourself kind sir i happen to want sir jamie to end up with brienne of tarth someday
gameofthrones,not_removed,the audience sure as hell was supposed to root for jamie one of the many many criticisms of the scene was that it stalled or even ruined jamie s character arc
gameofthrones,not_removed,i am sure jon wont rape sansa if they do decide to get together
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah it was a problem with the editing directing acting and dialogue how wasnt it supposed to be rapey again
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was a problem with the writers
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh please jaime and cersei were more of siblings than jon and sansa ever were the latter pairs on screen interaction until recently was limited at best and when they were reunited people were joking about the sexual tension between them more than anything
gameofthrones,not_removed,and were definitely supposed to be grossed out by it since theyre both shown to be pretty evil people although i think jamie is more of a ruthless pragmatist
gameofthrones,not_removed,sansa shouldnt be treated like a price for the good deeds of some dude her character has been knocked around enough i want her to become her own person
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really dont see tyrion marrying sansa though sansa doesnt seem to like dwarves much in the books or the show so i see no reason why would she suddenly want to marry tyrion
gameofthrones,not_removed,lets not forget about sandor it seems more likely given hes heading north george said that something might be in store for them in the books show might follow it he would deserve some love too tyrion seems to be falling for dany i cant blame him but when he gave that look to dany about how daario is not the last to love her man he looked a bit in love it could be admiration but it might be him developing feelings for her basically everyone is falling for her
gameofthrones,not_removed,i said the same thingin jest sansa always wanted a ser like loras i think she ends up with a certain strong boy like bull who happens to be rowing still
gameofthrones,not_removed,weve seen worse from morally fucked characters jon is as close to a good guy as this show gets
gameofthrones,not_removed,nope he is my favorite character i was just sayjng that cersei can be the love jnterest whk isnt related to him id like to see jon and daenerys together but it would still be a relationship between relatives since she is his aunt you know
gameofthrones,not_removed,happy days created jumped the shark which will live on for eternity for when a show runs out of reasonable ideas for a story and turns to ridiculous gimmicks walking dead created crawled under the dumpster which will live on for eternity for when a character is possibly killed but the death wasnt explicitly shown
gameofthrones,not_removed,no you shouldnt
gameofthrones,not_removed,his name is db
gameofthrones,not_removed,that wouldnt stop gendry from trying
gameofthrones,not_removed,one does not simply walk into kings landing
gameofthrones,not_removed,no no we were warming her icy heart with a hot island song
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a south park reference
gameofthrones,not_removed,take me by the hand
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt lady stark a redhead in the books i think deep down his attraction to harsh redheads is because he has mommy issues
gameofthrones,not_removed,please remind me who was ros
gameofthrones,not_removed,who
gameofthrones,not_removed,if he lived in a fantasy world where cousin marrying was the norm sure he would
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah dany cannot have children i believe this is true in both books and show so i guess there no worry of another inbred madman
gameofthrones,not_removed,starks dont have the tradition of inbreeding targaryens do also there is nothing special about stark blood they are said to have the blood of the first men but that is true for all northerners and even if starks were somehow special in the past they have mixed with other families to much for it to matter targaryen blood on the other hand is special targaryens are tied to magic in various ways and they belong to a race that is dying out
gameofthrones,not_removed,i also think shell land there with little to no knowledge of how real the others threat is similar to the typical southern belief that its all a mythwhich tyrion may also still believe i cant remember if he actually saw anything when he was briefly at the wall so its crucial that he makes peace with her so he doesnt wind up with an enemy on each front and what better way to ensure peace in the got world than with marriage sansa may be up to her own schemes but she also knows what the real threat is shell kneel to jon as soon as icy monsters threaten her way of life as far as whats grosser i simply mean that theres a difference between being raised seeing someone not as a lover but as a sister and trying to change that versus seeing them as a lover from the beginning cercei and jamie for example according to book canon were copying what they saw dogs and horses do before they even hit puberty so as you can see im not saying its gross to me im saying it would probably be gross to jon snow he doesnt need a deep connection to danybut i mean a hot babe riding a dragon turns me on if he knows that marrying the most powerful woman in the world is a good strategy move
gameofthrones,not_removed,hmm good point thats the other side to what shes been through at this point shell do anything to have her home back and keep it and shes far more cynical and involved in the game than she was before i can see how things have changed her to the point that shell do anything to keep it i still dont think jon would give in though he doesnt care about the game he just wants to survive and not have the world end i think id see him step down from his role and just let sansa have the crown rather than marrying her for political reasons i genuinely cant see jon choosing to marry her he may be pressured he may at least consider the proscons in terms of the dilemma at hand but ultimately it would be abandoning a big part of his whole honorable deal to do so what would ned think he was willing to betrothe his daughter to the future king he knew that that was the game to be played and how things worked but do you think he would stand by and watch his daughter marry the man he raised as his son and her brother but who also happens to be the bastard son of his deceased sister and his sworn enemy and i think jon would have that on his mind when presented with the scenario
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i remember reading something about that still seems to suggest that they arent that careful about avoiding scandalous material though they did water down tyrions murder of shae by making it self defense
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah in the books cersie kinds of encourages it by the end acts like nothing rapey happened after
gameofthrones,not_removed,httpsislimgxzkikkgifv
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the books cersie seems to encourage and enjoy it
gameofthrones,not_removed,eh in all likelihood her attitude towards tyrion was partially childhood shallowness partially medievalera superstition people with deformities were often immediately looked upon with suspicion and considered to be agents of the devil and partially the fact that he was a lannister and she hadnt yet met one of those who didnt grow up to be a total shit plus she was like in the books and he was most certainly not i would have been creeped out by him too
gameofthrones,not_removed,if it became politically advantageous sansa might go through with it she knows that shes safe with tyrion that if she never wanted to have sex again he would respect that after what happened with ramsay that has to have its attraction
gameofthrones,not_removed,they are already married her marriage to ramsay is not valid even if she didnt consumate her marriage with tyrion it still hasnt been anulled by the high septon so in the eyes of the gods they are still husband and wife sansa was a shallow little spoiled cunt but after a few weeks with ramsay she got back to her senses i think i fancy more a jonsansa relationship but with tyrion it would make much more sense
gameofthrones,not_removed,huge sansan fan here but no way would it be anything official she is a slave to her house name and they would gain absolutely nothing by bringing together the starks and the vanishing house clegane i think sansans best luck is if she keeps her marriage with tyrion becomes a lannister and sandor goes back to honoring his houses tradition of guarding the lions and protects sansa lannisteryoucanreadallaboutitonmyfanfic
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion seems to be falling for dany i cant blame him but when he gave that look to dany about how daario is not the last to love her man he looked a bit in love its funnyi didnt catch that until about the third time i watched that scene and i just told a friend of mine about it last night she was really taken aback i told her to go back and watch it againits subtle but its there
gameofthrones,not_removed,that would be awesome but i see gendry with arya
gameofthrones,not_removed,sansa too actually the only person she killed thus far was ramsey and it was totally understandable and he totally deserved it anyway so having the two most morally sound characters get into an incest marriage is probably going to just alienate a lot of the audience including me tbh
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean i wouldnt rule it out as a possibility would jon and sansa being together really be character assassination if its played out right you might get a few awwws like when they were reunited in terms of jon being a good guy well does that really mean he cant be with sansa is that really a villainous act im not a huge jonsa fan really but i can definitely see it happening hell theyre setting it up to parallel brandon stark catelyn and littlefinger with the conflict next season
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know just joking yeah i am not so thrilled with a prospect of jon and dany it will probably happen as political marriage but just hoping it wont turn into not some love story i want them to focus on what is against them and some interesting conversations
gameofthrones,not_removed,some might even say twd jumped the shark when he crawled under the dumpster
gameofthrones,not_removed,what is this referencing its on the tip of my brain
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love the yigrette dont care enough to look up the spelling was like fuck it im eating these french fries while you sing at me i do what i want
gameofthrones,not_removed,i pull these out everytime someone posts this video but
gameofthrones,not_removed,i lasted almost seconds with that the dancing alone made me cringe
gameofthrones,not_removed,i kinda figured that out but it brings me to rhaegars love for singing can you imagine jon to bring out a harp and start playing on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,lead me to japan
gameofthrones,not_removed,shes definitely a redhead in the show too
gameofthrones,not_removed,she was a hooker from winterfell who theon was quite fond of she left to go to kings landing got in with baelish and was then given to joffrey where she met her fate by being crossbowed to death
gameofthrones,not_removed,she was a whore and theon had sex with her during season and then she left for kings landing and got involved with lf also was the one cersei found and thought she was shae and let her to be beaten then she got killed by joffrey with a crossbow in season too
gameofthrones,not_removed,could just move to shelbyville
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was hinted pretty heavily that she was experiencing a miscarriage by the end of the last book she tried to remember the last time she had her moons blood and i think she estimated around months and then she started experiencing cramping and heavy bleeding
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think she had a miscarriage at the end of adwd so she can get pregnant but question if she can bear a living child anyway this is in the books but what about the show she told jorah and khal moro shell never have another children other than dragons or bear another to any man
gameofthrones,not_removed,a tradition not really a history of inbreeding when politically convenient absolutely the last sansa stark about a century before the series began married an uncle and that sansas sister married their other uncle
gameofthrones,not_removed,any incest would be gross to jon based on his moral status but i do acknowledge marriage is likely to happen like for jon and dany i just said he wouldnt care to keep bloodline pure because any marriage from his point of view would be about white walkers he has no or little connection to targaryen to care about keepig bloodline pure in fact funny enough if it means for them having children jon and dany is more of a incest than sansa he shares with dany about percent of genetics and their kids could be well mad etc with sansa about genetics just since were debating them theres this post here on on asoiaf about genetics and it was mentioned there if we speak abot emotional incest then yes they grew up together but they were never that close listen i dont support any of that but if one camp accuses the other that is a bit grosser both of them are its in the story and incest is part of this world and culture its not really that relevant argument
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think jon might see it as the right thing as he and sansa are now more practical because of their life experiences if the north is not united as davos said to little lyanna it will be hard to defend against the real war the north learning that jon is not neds son and whatever lf cooks up could start to fracture the north and this could be the political solution as this whole season in the north is about politics and the resolution will need a political solution i remember maester aemon asked if he had to choose between the honorable thing and the right thing he would choose the right thing to do that is basically the same choice that ned had to make when dealing with keeping jons heritage a secret ned choose what he thought was the right thing to do and dishonored himself in the process
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think ned would be ok with it because ned has always known that they are not siblings i also dont believe that jon is a bastard it doesnt make sense to the story for jon to be raised a bastard just to find out he is someone elses bastard no jon does not care in the least about the game and that is why i dont see him marrying dany he doesnt give a hit about the it but he does care about the north he also cares about his family and i dont know but he doesnt look at sansa like a brother looks at a sister i think they are playing a little romantic angle it may not be but there is a sort of vibe there also i dont believe that either jon or sansa would ever come up with this idea themselves someone else is going to suggest it probably davos they are going to be completely shocked and also disgusted but over time they are going to realize how they can unite the north and the vale and the riverlands with their union they will suck it up for the greater good and then they will fall in love over time
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean it definitely started out super rapey on jaimes part and we dont see it through on the show and cersei definitely acts like it wasnt okay afterwords once i got to that part in the books i was honestly really confused that people were upset over the show portrayal
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the books shes hitting him in the chest as hes pulling her clothes off it isnt until hes disrobed her that she changes and welcomes himin yes terrible joke
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is really only sort of true jaime absolutely forces it on her and then towards the end which we dont see in the show she slips and reveals shes enjoying it afterwards she regrets it and berates him heavily for it its really almost exactly the same it just lasts until the end
gameofthrones,not_removed,book tyrion wasnt exactly that nice to her like show version i must reread the books but something tells me he was not that nice
gameofthrones,not_removed,she knows that shes safe with tyrion she is safe now
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion would probably not marry someone he cant fuck hed respect sansa but he would want to fuck his wife
gameofthrones,not_removed,if she keeps her marriage with tyrion becomes a lannister shes a stark and always be one dont think she would be willing to be lannister maybe marriage is not on her mind anyway i dont think its about what he brings george and dd even in early seasons brought them up and hinting at them also a good amount of foreshadowing from the books iam not a fan of them but just going by what they said and evidence
gameofthrones,not_removed,where can i read a fanfic like that
gameofthrones,not_removed,its subtle but it might be one way like jorah or daario they love her but she might love someone else or simply not love them not in that kind of way too
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think its a matter of jon being a good guy or not for me it has more to do with it not being realistic that hed be like ive spent my whole life being raised as your brother but now that i know im not bam lets get married
gameofthrones,not_removed,well since she wants a political marriage for alliance in westeros it is either jon or petyr i guess so probably jon but as it is called the song of fire and ice it could make soarks between them and we could see them being more than just a political marriage fire being dany and ice jon
gameofthrones,not_removed,but if they meet and are smitten with each other then it opens up the possibility of jon being aa should he have to kill dany for some reason
gameofthrones,not_removed,so meta
gameofthrones,not_removed,southpark free hat
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think its ygritte not correcting you just for future reference edit auto correct thought i meant gutter actually meant future
gameofthrones,not_removed,really her hair always seemed brown to me but yeah thanks for the heads up
gameofthrones,not_removed,well said played by esmee bianco
gameofthrones,not_removed,i never knew that was the same woman in those three scenes the more you know
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah but wouldnt a miscarriage essentially confirm that
gameofthrones,not_removed,i always took that section to mean that she was having her first period after not cycling since her miscarriage of drogos baby and was therefore fertile again
gameofthrones,not_removed,really i havent finished the books but i could have sworn there was a passage implying she couldnt have any more children
gameofthrones,not_removed,with all the trash talking going on about cersei and jaime in the entirety of westeros dont you think the fact that jon and sansa were raised as siblings would incite somewhat of the same reaction we got a bastard king marrying his sister whats the north coming to its the targ in him
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah it made me wonder if id just misperceived that scene on the show but it really didnt come across the same way as in the books however on the show after that goes down nothing really changes she doesnt hate him for it and though i dont think its related entirely they seem to grow more passionate about it or careless about it than wed seen before
gameofthrones,not_removed,she berates him a little but honestly i think thats part of her kink shes all like of youre such a bad boy jaime like it seemed to me anyway that that was actually part of their routine
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion was more dismissive of her than anything else though i get the impression that he tried at least to not be actively cruel or make her feel bad but even his smile is described as being kind of terrifying iirc i can imagine that even if he tried to be nice it might come off more as a scary lannister lion playing with his food especially given sansas previous interactions with cersei and joffrey who seemed nice to her at first
gameofthrones,not_removed,he can always go to brothel
gameofthrones,not_removed,if sansa didnt mind him seeing prostitutes hed probably be ok
gameofthrones,not_removed,well it might not be great lets bone it might be more that jon and sansa fall in love with based on some of their interactions this seasons i wouldnt rule out even with the raised as siblings argument they werent close so i dont think they really have much of a brothersister relationship as say jon and arya
gameofthrones,not_removed,george already described it as ice white walkersothers and fire daenerys and dragons as the main reason for the title might not be the only one i dont think there is a really a room with what is coming up they will probably meet at the end of the season or start of the season it might turned out to be rushed mess besides it kinda has that disney feeling to it but i could go on with it unless they wont let them beat white walkers rule together
gameofthrones,not_removed,if dany is aar she already killed her nissa nissa jon pretty much could be his mother or ygritte
gameofthrones,not_removed,much obliged
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like gutter reference better since i hate her character entirely
gameofthrones,not_removed,but yeah thanks for the redheads up ftfy
gameofthrones,not_removed,not really no danys mother rhaella had so many miscarriages children dying shortly after birth preterm births and stillbirths that aerys thought someone in the red keep was poisoning them and rhaella first he thought they were his mistresses at the end he thought rhaella herself was drinking moon tea aerys made a pact with the faith and took a fast and swore to never have a mistress again coincidentally a year after rhaella then had viserys a list of all the children can be found here httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphprhaellatargaryenmarriedlife rhaella died from complications from childbirth with daenerys personal theory of mine jon and dany both necessitated csections that cost their mothers their lives
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought so too apparently some folks dont know that women can go ages without menstruating for loads of reasons though hence the miscarriage theory theyve clearly never gone off depoprovera
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is a prophecy that essentially says she will not have anymore children until certain seemingly impossible conditions are met
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree and i honestly think it is going to be something very hard for both of them to do this is not the fairy tale version of their lives that either of them wanted but at this point i dont think they actually believe that exist anyway i know that sansa wants security and to stay in winterfell and jon wants a united north to face the the real war he said they need to have winterfell as they couldnt defend the wall with the walkers on the north and then ramsey south in winterell and they had to take it winterfell is also a good place to make a stand as once the walkers come castle black is the first thing gone i feel many are putting too much emotion in it and not seeing the as a practical matter that needs to have a political solution to it as this northern storyline in season is about politics
gameofthrones,not_removed,i gingerly thank you
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion as a secret targaryan confirmed then
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed the uterus and ovaries have a mind of their own and after a magical miscarriage things taking a while to return to normal seems perfectly reasonable also i thought she believed herself infertile and the only reason she should have to suspect that barring actively trying to get pregnant and failing which shes unlikely to do with a lover would be to not be getting her period i should go back and find the lines in the books edit missed word
gameofthrones,not_removed,more like a curse not a prophecy
gameofthrones,not_removed,totally but thats basically what im getting at when it comes to the north rallying behind him i dont see it as being widely accepted or accepted with open arms by the north are we the targs now the lannisters a man and woman who spent their lives raised as blood siblings now sharing a bed because theyre cousins instead bah
gameofthrones,not_removed,theyll meet around episode how exactly since dany is landing south probably in dorne and fighting cersei and euron jon is in the north i would say theyll meet at the end of season episode or most likely
gameofthrones,not_removed,hair puns
gameofthrones,not_removed,depends on how you interpret it if you think it means she will never have children again then you see it as a curse but at this point i think most people see it as a prophecy of her having more children jon is also widely considered to be the likely father their stories parallel each other beautifully it also makes the most sense politically for jon and dany to marry i really dont get why so many people seem to want to push jonsansa it makes no sense she brings nothing to the table jon already has the north the wildlings the knights of the vale and will almost certainly have arya and brans backing once they make it back to winterfell a marriage between jon and sansa gets them nothing whenever i see someone pushing it i wonder what the fuck show theyre watching or books theyre reading it sure as hell isnt game of thrones i was shocked to look at that vid and see it was an altshiftx one
gameofthrones,not_removed,hair buns ftfy

gameofthrones,not_removed,dont read this comment if youre not caught up thats what im going for and what i pointed out to my friend after the finale i envision them meeting maybe half way through next season maybe professing love right before they defeat cersei i also think jaime will killer cersei to go with the prophecy cersei heard as a girl and then jon killing dany to make lightbringer
gameofthrones,not_removed,that is my optimal ending they are of my favorites
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon wouldnt resist a united westeros backed with a foreign army and three dragons not even without the threat of the white walkers looming overhead the king in the north bent knee just to avoid his people getting burned the first time nevermind when he is sandwhiched between two armies he has no hope of defeating while marriage is entirely possible it is by no means required for a peaceful reunification only the white walkers have the ability to threaten dany at this point and maybe euron if he has his magic horn

gameofthrones,not_removed,where in the seven kingdoms might one procure one of these fine imbibing challaces
gameofthrones,not_removed,i found mine on etsy by eolovedesigns though its just vinyl on glass so i am sure the lettering will get messed up in time hand wash only for sure but it looks great and the glass is nice and thick ill make sure to take good care of it to make it last
gameofthrones,not_removed,season episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt he burned in castle black when saving mormont from some wights way back when it happened in the books at least a curtain catches fire and he has to grab it with a bare hand burning himself if i remember right it takes a while to heal too
gameofthrones,not_removed,the whole dany being fireproof thing is a show dealtargaryans definitely arent fireproof the tragedy of summerhall is a testament to that also in the books when jon burns his hand the wound comes up a lot in later chapters i believe even grrm commented on how shes just got a higher tolerance to fire the whole dragon eggs hatching instance probably had more to do with magic than her lineage the whole dothraki hut burningidk what to think of that
gameofthrones,not_removed,they dont really have an immunity to fire grr martin confirmed this her surviving those flames was just blood magic targaryens only have a tolerance to heat
gameofthrones,not_removed,pulling longclaw out of the fire in mormonts tower azor azai and lightbringer anyone
gameofthrones,not_removed,k thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,didnt dany get burned in the books i cant remember its been a while since i read them but i believe she does get a burn in her hand
gameofthrones,not_removed,danny being fire immune in the show but not the book would be a huge departure i think its safer to assume grrm just lied about it at that time to not give away future plots
gameofthrones,not_removed,i do remember her complaining about something being too hot to tolerate in the books but i dont remember what or when
gameofthrones,not_removed,i believe youre referring to when she takes a bath and the extremely hot water before she weds drogo she explained that she liked the feeling i dont remember her ever being burned
gameofthrones,not_removed,i guess i just dont see a reason she needs to be fireproof at what point does it serve her any use going forward ive heard everything from oh well she can survive cerseis wildfire attack well say for a minute it comes to that and she does survive okay cool for dany but everyone else around her burnsso i mean i just dont see how its more than a way to deus ex machina dany out of a hot situation
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dunno maybe something about the prophecy that involves a lot of fire doesnt it of course it could be a fabrication of the show but that would be a pretty big difference between the two versions of the character
gameofthrones,not_removed,just the part about a burning sword other than that its about being born amongst salt and smoke waking stone dragons being from the line of arys and rhellaplus its gotta be jon snow right
gameofthrones,not_removed,hahathey do that constantly basically every character is different now
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe danny herself is the burning sword or the one born amongst salt and smoke because that specific scene really was the birth of danny the queen
gameofthrones,not_removed,alt shift x has an azor ahai prophecy video thats really good you should check out
gameofthrones,not_removed,hbo has released an httpwwwmakinggameofthronescomproductiondiarygotconnectionsnedpromisetowerofjoyinfographic which shows how rhaegar is jons father
gameofthrones,not_removed,rhaegar abducted lyanna and was keeping her in that tower ned and co approached the tower which had rhaegars kings guardsmen at the bottom of it and asked for his sister lyanna mentions that if robert knew hed kill him so you have to protect him we know from season that robert has a weird fetish for wanting to kill every single targaryen so its fair to assume that the baby is rhaegars but no youre right no one actually says outright that hes rhaegars baby for viewers who dont follow the plot as closely they will be wondering who it is until a later reveal when the rest of westeros find out about the other targaryen
gameofthrones,not_removed,an infographic by hbo said that rhaegar is jons father and its heavily implied in the show yes they didnt just spell it out but it isnt too difficult to connect the dots rhaegar abducted lyanna who he named the queen of love and beauty hid her in the tower of joy after the war ned goes to the tower of joy to find some members of the kingsguard there and lyanna has a baby who could that baby possibly be with it would make no sense for anyone else to be the father and it would be anticlimactic
gameofthrones,not_removed,well it is mentioned a few times in the show that rhaegar raped lyanna after abducting her and while there was a war going on and all targaryens were being killed two of the kingsguard were in dorne rhaegar wouldnt have had two kingsguard to protect lyanna unless it was important putting those two together rhaegar is the father
gameofthrones,not_removed,who else could his father possibly be
gameofthrones,not_removed,i get what you mean and see your point of view on this its made pretty clear over the course of the show to me it seems that its common knowledge in westeros that rhaegar kidnapped and raped lyanna its been a topic since season and weve given clues about it but its spoken about so rarely that people most likely have forgotten about the whole story when they hear about it again almost none of my friends realized who jon actually is other than hes not neds bastard which makes me kinda sad because i felt it was the climax of the episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,clear indications jon must have been conceived well into roberts rebellion this excludes everyone that is not closely related to rhaegar as his taking of lyanna started the events that led to roberts rebellion lyanna made ned promise because robert wouldve killed him there is no need to kill a kid that is no thread at all only to kill a targaryen
gameofthrones,not_removed,it didnt those paying proper attention could guess it easily enough but the big reveal in the episode was that ned isnt jons father and his mother is lyanna theyll flesh out the rhaegar thing next series presumably it wouldnt have been a big reveal that rhaegar is jons father as he hasnt really been mentioned all that much in the show

gameofthrones,not_removed,this i wish they would post this image on the main page for a month would eliminate thousands of posts asking about it
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont get me wrong it is very extremely likely that it is the case
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the books they do
gameofthrones,not_removed,they are massively expensive and the price rises exponentially the more important the target is itd be cheaper by half to buy a mercenary unit army than pay the fm to take out a great lord
gameofthrones,not_removed,that makes sense and it also explains how the younger actress could pay for them to kill a simple woman thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,are you going to give us any context relevance anything
gameofthrones,not_removed,a man in dark armor and a pale pink cloak spotted with blood stepped up to robb jaime lannister sends his regards he thrust his longsword through her sons heart and twisted
gameofthrones,not_removed,roose and jamie edit i havent read the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,sorry didnt think this would need context this is jaime talking to roose bolton as bolton is sending him on his way back to kings landing
gameofthrones,not_removed,this exchange also happens in the show the bear and the maiden fair episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,this does not contain any spoilers so why ban
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think when he was rowing he tore his bicep unable to do anything other than row in a circle he stayed in the middle of the ocean drank his water until he ran out became dehydrated then drank sea water and inevitably died mel will find his skeleton and hump his bones to bring the mannis back from the grave s this is more likely to happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,there isnt enough show time to introduce all that it still sounds cool though
gameofthrones,not_removed,seriously if we never hear about him again ill be so pissed
gameofthrones,not_removed,the show and books are not the same and all indications are that they will diverge even more in whats left based on the first seasons and how they matched up to the published source material the show should be creating full seasons for both seasons and with enough book content for a few more episodes after that thats what the last two books should provide if they end up close to the average length of the other asoiaf books instead were getting short seasons and apparently more plot lines cut out that suggests grrm has given dd few details if any from the book manuscripts and for the most part the show is rushing to the final main climax without dealing with all the other loose threads im sure there will be a few matching points since dd discussed the end with grrm but its possible nearly all of the rest will not match the books when theyre all done
gameofthrones,not_removed,nobody really knows except for grrm its said that grrm has told dd how to finish the series also that both books and series will have the same ending or conclusion but frankly i think well find this is stretching the truth i think that both books and tv will with the same overall theme but routes will be different and perhaps even with different characters alive and functioning in the final scenes i think the series will miss out a lot of detailangstanguish that will be in the books in much the same was as lotr films did so i dont think the series will spoil everything for readers because there will be plenty of surprises en route to the final chapter
gameofthrones,not_removed,the books and the show are different roads to the same destination it really starts diverging in season the roads will probably intersect along the way
gameofthrones,not_removed,has it been mentioned at all that the last tv seasons will be basically the same as the book i wouldnt worry too much there is no guarantee the books will ever be published we have been waiting for book for about years and if book takes as long to publish we are looking at at the earliest the one thing i am certain of is that if the books are published they will be far richer in details making it new enough that it wont be spoiled by the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,cool why is this newsworthy
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh no but what about the enthralling plot and characters
gameofthrones,not_removed,jeeztell him not to botherhe doesnt need to see the dorne plotthe fucked up ayra plotthe weird cotf thingetc
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn this is all the spoilers i am so glad nobody showed me this before i started watching the show

gameofthrones,not_removed,haha yeah this is only meant to be enjoyed once youve seen the show otherwise youll pretty much hate life
gameofthrones,not_removed,my theory is that dany will let this happen during her crowningwedding knowing that she will survive as a way of purging most of the great houses and as a result breaking the wheel without implicating herself in the process will be seen as cerseis fault its a dumb theory but its the best i got
gameofthrones,not_removed,why wouldnt she be fire proof
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats brutal i love it
gameofthrones,not_removed,she could survive the flames but will she survive the blast
gameofthrones,not_removed,shes immune to regular fire but its possible that shes not immune to wildfire or dragonfire for that matter
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not sure why but i think the art would look nicer with a little more padding between each piece
gameofthrones,not_removed,what kind of dog is that
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats one fine christmas present may i ask where did you get it
gameofthrones,not_removed,is your dogs name really ghost
gameofthrones,not_removed,looks more like house godzilla still damn cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,so cool nice find
gameofthrones,not_removed,that looks awesome man

gameofthrones,not_removed,this is nasty where did u find that multipiece adornment
gameofthrones,not_removed,man that dog reminds me so much of my old dog jasper we had to put him down a couple of months ago
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed thats the point of pieces like this
gameofthrones,not_removed,looks like whoever made it did it wrong it doesnt look like any strips were taken out of the graphic which means there shouldnt be any spacing between the pieces
gameofthrones,not_removed,i only clicked the comments to see if someone said this also very nice artwork
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think op should put them in random order it would be very edgy
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a dire wolf
gameofthrones,not_removed,he is half husky and half lab
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats a couch
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a tortoise
gameofthrones,not_removed,siberian husky
gameofthrones,not_removed,i get ads for these on facebook all the time hold on i should just have to scroll posts before one pops up
gameofthrones,not_removed,the dog or the art
gameofthrones,not_removed,this particular format would be called multipanel art so i googled house stark multipanel art and the first result was enjoy
gameofthrones,not_removed,why not i have a dog called ghost
gameofthrones,not_removed,gojira is coming
gameofthrones,not_removed,httpswwwoctotreasurescom

gameofthrones,not_removed,yes
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow thats cool as shit they have quite a few nice ones under that movies and shows category did you see that battle of the trident one would go good with your house stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,i havent actually gone to fb yet
gameofthrones,not_removed,me too thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,easier just type art into amazon
gameofthrones,not_removed,if tyrion saw the hound again hed be like wtf bro you ran from the fire at the fight for kings landing i got my face sliced open from that where the fuck were you kingsguard more like fire pussy
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks for putting this together op nice thread
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope dany and her unsullied and dothraki get fucking wiped out
gameofthrones,not_removed,please define we all
gameofthrones,not_removed,that would be an awesome interaction tyrion would absolutely call him out on leaving the battle it would be awesome
gameofthrones,not_removed,fair enough i just dont see it happening
gameofthrones,not_removed,more like i assume most people want to see
gameofthrones,not_removed,made me think of terry gilliam saying its only a model but thats cool is it made of metal or other
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is in a warehouse guarded by top men top men
gameofthrones,not_removed,i read somewhere a while ago that gandalfs sword was put there at some point cant seem to find it did i dream this
gameofthrones,not_removed,that looks like a super lame prop thanks for ruining the illusion
gameofthrones,not_removed,that cant be the real show prop because it that looks like the cheap plastic one the show sends around for press photos
gameofthrones,not_removed,as someone else pointed out thats not the actual throne they use on the show its a replica which you can actually purchase the replicas are pretty damn expensive though if you go to any got events like ones at comic con they have these for you to sit on and do photo ops
gameofthrones,not_removed,so you sat on it right
gameofthrones,not_removed,i am an underwriter in an insurance company in bulgaria and i insured it when it was visiting here it costs
gameofthrones,not_removed,why is it in a warehouse sitting next to pallets of large sushi chef lids
gameofthrones,not_removed,it shouldnt be in storage they should be using it to film the next season damnit
gameofthrones,not_removed,you mean the real iron throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,hate to break it to you mate but the real throne ie the throne room set piece has never left that room this is a replica
gameofthrones,not_removed,hey guys do you think i could get like a cushion or something doesnt need to be temperpedic or anything
gameofthrones,not_removed,so the iron throne gets repod next season
gameofthrones,not_removed,it looks a lot shittier under normal lighting looks magnificent on the show though its kinda like me i look terrible with the lights on
gameofthrones,not_removed,the one from the show is so disappointing after seeing what its supposed to look like in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,looks super uncomfortable
gameofthrones,not_removed,where was this
gameofthrones,not_removed,how was he in person
gameofthrones,not_removed,looks like its from a local halloween shop
gameofthrones,not_removed,did you get its autograph
gameofthrones,not_removed,you mean the weakass tv show version iron throne is the real iron throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think its way bigger than that in real life southerners talk it up like its huge i think the tv show shrunk it a bit still a dumb chair to me either way though
gameofthrones,not_removed,if i was a king id want something much more comfortable
gameofthrones,not_removed,i left my throne in el segundo
gameofthrones,not_removed,amazing what set lighting does to make something obviously fake seem real
gameofthrones,not_removed,what can i do for you my grace
gameofthrones,not_removed,why do pictures of it always look pasticy but it looks pretty legit in the show itself
gameofthrones,not_removed,i sat in that very throne in belfast ireland years ago
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually really dig this interpretation
gameofthrones,not_removed,since ive been watching a lot of forged in fire on tv i wonder how its possible to forgeweld that thing using tech from the middle ages
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt that just the iron chair i mean the throne was is huge
gameofthrones,not_removed,hey ive seen that chair too
gameofthrones,not_removed,i read this as game of thrones cast to meet the real iron throne today and i was really confused about why there were two
gameofthrones,not_removed,it felt heavy duty and well built the pommels at the end of the arm rest were cool to the touch and did have a metallic feel to it but i believe its fiberglass i didnt have a lot of time to inspect it due to being in a clients warehouse i will be going back next week and ill attempt to get a closer look
gameofthrones,not_removed,to camelot wait kings landing to kings landing
gameofthrones,not_removed,all you really need to guard it is twenty good men
gameofthrones,not_removed,yep top men that wear bright yellow vests and drive forklifts haha i walked into the warehouse and there she was sitting there and i did use it to break the ice with my pitch to the warehouse manager i said something along the lines of she called to me so here i am the thrones rightful owner
gameofthrones,not_removed,bureaucratic fools dont know what they have in there
gameofthrones,not_removed,stencils in top secret army intel do not open on crate and watches an old man pushes it inside warehouse in area on a cart
gameofthrones,not_removed,no bottoms in the raiders of the lost ark gay bar i guess
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes its the one near the middle just to the right of the one with the green gem in the pommel
gameofthrones,not_removed,its name is glamdring in case youre curious
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha glad i wasnt the only one thinking it looks like cheap plastic
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt it because that is one of the fiberglass replicas this is not the real iron throne this is one of the ones they bring around for press things
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is why i never look at behind the scenes stuff
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt the actual iron throne supposed to be like fifty feet tall it was created from the swords of an entire army this looks like a kids version made for joffrey
gameofthrones,not_removed,proper lighting is a helluva drug
gameofthrones,not_removed,almost everything behind the scenes looks incredibly cheap and lame they do a lot with the photography to make everything look nice this is almost all shows btw not just got
gameofthrones,not_removed,can confirm have a pic of me on fb sitting on the cheap plastic press tour chair this is it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think youre right and now i want some clarification
gameofthrones,not_removed,a theater i worked at had michelle fairley for a qa and we had a plastic iron throne that people could take pictures of themselves on and it looked exactly like this
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would agree they look different enough
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres apparently an event going on this weekend in carlisle england with the real throne though theyre probably just saying that to get people to go
gameofthrones,not_removed,i believe it is a replica however it is owned and used by hbo it is the second is in las vegas nv i was informed
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did sit on the throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,the company i visited stores it and transports it around for hbo they also have the round bottom piece that goes under it
gameofthrones,not_removed,depends on what scenes theyre filming i would guess
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,if not for the thumbnail i might have thought someone was crazy enough to build that
gameofthrones,not_removed,there are two of these both owned by hbo if it is a replica its an official replica and not one made in someones dirty old shed somewhere in the boonies
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is quite comfortable tight squeeze for me being but surprisingly comfortable
gameofthrones,not_removed,the iron bank will have its due
gameofthrones,not_removed,me too thats why i didnt post the pic of me in it haha
gameofthrones,not_removed,a king should never sit easy
gameofthrones,not_removed,its in a warehouse that transports it i work for a logistics company and i go out and prospect walked into this companies warehouse and there she was
gameofthrones,not_removed,no but it touched my butt
gameofthrones,not_removed,hell even littlefinger calls it out in a later season he says hes counted there cant be more than there
gameofthrones,not_removed,that is why you are not a king
gameofthrones,not_removed,gold bring thine king gold pieces
gameofthrones,not_removed,digital video editing is amazing these days
gameofthrones,not_removed,im and its bigger than me im thinking its close to around maybe a little more
gameofthrones,not_removed,what other stuff do they have in there
gameofthrones,not_removed,nice username mate
gameofthrones,not_removed,never mind its a silly place
gameofthrones,not_removed,ser twenty goodmen strikes again
gameofthrones,not_removed,well i know what ive got here
gameofthrones,not_removed,now this just makes me realize why are all the swords the same color did they rust perfectly over time
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats amazing never knew that gotta give respect to the designers for sneaking that in i wonder if zeldas master sword is hidden in there somewhere
gameofthrones,not_removed,there was a time when i knew all this stuff its slowly fading from memory i remember narsil flame of the west or something like this
gameofthrones,not_removed,the magic of cinema
gameofthrones,not_removed,fisher price plastic
gameofthrones,not_removed,without the cinematic lighting it has a very franklin mint meets hummel quality to it
gameofthrones,not_removed,its the iron thrones stunt double
gameofthrones,not_removed,i usually really like behind the scenes stuff but i avoid it with got the world is just so immersive i dont want anything to ruin that
gameofthrones,not_removed,the one thing that only gets better up close for me at least is the clothes some of the dresses in this show are absolutely stunning and i never appreciated it until i saw them up close in person
gameofthrones,not_removed,like this
gameofthrones,not_removed,the book version yeah i got excited too thinking someone had made the real iron throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,me too thats what made me think of it saw it in a mall in poland once
gameofthrones,not_removed,there are several made from the same mold that travel around for various events this is not the show prop but one of the many traveling versions they also give them away to folks as contest prizes
gameofthrones,not_removed,i got your reply and laughed here we stand did you sit surprised no one else got that so heres an arrow up for you
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would like to think all of kings landing is just cersei sitting in the throne and fucking shit up
gameofthrones,not_removed,full disclosure i was show watcher first but even then i didnt think shows version of iron throne looked particularly interesting but then when i read the books and saw the description and picture in there it just felt so much more impressive
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a replica regardless the actual prop never moves
gameofthrones,not_removed,ah im sure youre at least better looking than that chair
gameofthrones,not_removed,a later season like winter or spring are you some kind of traveler from the future
gameofthrones,not_removed,ooooh i like that it sounds like an exchange with tywin and renly or something
gameofthrones,not_removed,as you wish
gameofthrones,not_removed,no in the books it actually over meters high
gameofthrones,not_removed,the ark of the covenant
gameofthrones,not_removed,i didnt walk the warehouse much but i was pointed out the bottom circle stage that the throne sits on top of which at the time was divided into two half circles
gameofthrones,not_removed,same to you buddy we are the xecutioners
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont you worry your pretty little head thats what i do i drink and i know things
gameofthrones,not_removed,well seeing how they had to technically be reforged to make the throne and assuming they were all forged at roughly the same time they should all be around the same level of rustiness
gameofthrones,not_removed,whats more concerning is that hilts look like their grips are still covered with whatever there was to make a sword more comfortable to wield wood leather even wire and would have burned off under dragonfire treatment they should look more like
gameofthrones,not_removed,probably dont want a link to your personal facebook buddy
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha yeah imagine being one of the designers theres so many swords you could sneak in there and i wonder why glamdring and not anduril master sword would be a great one to get in there
gameofthrones,not_removed,close the sword named flame of the west was anduril which was forged from the shards of narsil
gameofthrones,not_removed,i bet they dont even use real dragons lame
gameofthrones,not_removed,see i dont find the show world to be that immersive the book world true but the show its kinda obvious there just filming in old castles in europe and cgi people in some scenes in dublin like the show is great but i dont think people realize it doesnt even touch the books harry potter was the opposite movies rised to the quality of books got is unfortunately ran by idiot writers and directors who make terrible scenes like the arya chase d and d wanted to do got at first but now you can tell they are tired of it its no longer a labor of love and its just a money maker for hbo
gameofthrones,not_removed,i met mine at lokrum island off the coast of dubrovnik which was pretty neat i kind of stumbled upon it out of nowhere
gameofthrones,not_removed,he said that because of his name uimsittingrightnow
gameofthrones,not_removed,or season of the tv show it precedes the chaos is a ladder speech i believe im trying not to spoil too much
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was somewhat playing off of something else i read in this thread about a king should never rest easy
gameofthrones,not_removed,cool can i open it
gameofthrones,not_removed,its also said they were fused together with dragonfire so there has to be a level of warping and charring that caused a colour change
gameofthrones,not_removed,the tetanus throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,you got a sweet name though
gameofthrones,not_removed,honestly i think you have the love of labour thing backwards they may not be as good as writers as george but dampd actually do love making the show where i feel that george is kinda getting bored with westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,the downvotes prove it
gameofthrones,not_removed,which iirc was a tywin line
gameofthrones,not_removed,do you want melty face because thats how you get melty face
gameofthrones,not_removed,only if you look inside
gameofthrones,not_removed,no theyve got top men working on it right now
gameofthrones,not_removed,that was kinda the point though the idea was that no king should ever rest easy on his throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,tetanus is a bacteria found in soil and feces it has nothing to do with rust
gameofthrones,not_removed,wasnt joffrey constantly getting little nicks from it in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,the iron throne in the book is not supposed to be comfortable in fact it can cut you if youre not careful so the chair is a problem just not in the show cause the show iswell not as good not for a lack of trying i just hate show choices because its always about aesthetics my own brain makes cooler crap
gameofthrones,not_removed,all he had to say was yup and hed be in good shape
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought that was only if you were a nazi
gameofthrones,not_removed,top men
gameofthrones,not_removed,they did nazi that coming
gameofthrones,not_removed,im sure the dragons fire sterilized it well
gameofthrones,not_removed,that must be it thanks its been a couple of years since i read the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah and kings who got cut all the time were thought to be not worthy of it
gameofthrones,not_removed,awesome i have the same one only with a portrait of tyrion
gameofthrones,not_removed,nice i like it
gameofthrones,not_removed,you nailed it well done 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
gameofthrones,not_removed,that was amazing thank you for posting that it made my day
gameofthrones,not_removed,can you perform at my wedding
gameofthrones,not_removed,sick
gameofthrones,not_removed,beautiful
gameofthrones,not_removed,lit asf
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you im glad you liked it
gameofthrones,not_removed,game of thrones and weddings are a pretty perilous combination
gameofthrones,not_removed,i can play the crossbow
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the scene where sexy jesus drinks poison and dies is dds way of telling us this isnt the one arya first met in harrenhal he was no one but a face on the wall to use and if he dies while being used his face can be passed on to be used again all the dialogue each of them use a girl a man can simply be how all faceless men talk to avoid names but arya mistakes this for familiarity and possibly affection from sexy jesus
gameofthrones,not_removed,the bear and the maiden fair
gameofthrones,not_removed,a quick google search can give you everything you need httpgameofthroneswikiacomwikicategorysongs
gameofthrones,not_removed,a from you ugreypiano on rgameofthrones has been removed because of the following reasons content needs to provide value to the subreddit in a unique or high quality way post stuff thats cool interesting and different content should ideally promote discussions about the books or show please review the subreddits rgameofthroneswpostingpolicy and rgameofthroneswspoilerguide to better understand the content scope if you have a question or concern about this action please
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,short answer we dont know until characters from different storylines interact we have no way to gauge how far advanced one storyline is to another this is why people throw a pissfit every time littlefinger has to do something his story necessitates travelling the seven kingdoms setting up secret deals and playing people off each other but in reality what weve seen in one story line could easily be happening weeks ahead or behind another one that said i think they just accelerated the boring sea voyage of danys army so that theyre essentially almost at westeros for the end of season and will be landing start of season rather than having episodes of dothraki trying to not vomit up their horse jerky before we see a battle scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,on the show the only way to know the exactrly timeline is when plots interact with each other so its hard and often irrelevant to say when exactly something happened
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn nice somehow i dont think you put this together as a response to op in the last hour
gameofthrones,not_removed,you should post this as its own post
gameofthrones,not_removed,really nice work thanks for sharing
gameofthrones,not_removed,no they said during inside the episode that the final shot of danys armada is them leaving slavers bay
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks ive been working on it for two weeks or so
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh ok so the martell and tyrell ships went to help ferry the dothraki across then makes sense
gameofthrones,not_removed,awesome work you did here and it actually makes sense everyone laughing at littlefinger and varys should see this
gameofthrones,not_removed,varys brought the fleet back and then they load up at the horses unsullied etc and then head south and then west
gameofthrones,not_removed,theirs references to a night queen as for society i sincerely doubt it when bran had his vision when he got touched by the night king we just see them all standing around waiting and waiting and waiting i think you may be humanising them a bit too much
gameofthrones,not_removed,if the ww are crasters sons it seems unlikely that they have changed genders so i wouldnt think those regular wws are females
gameofthrones,not_removed,in think the only thing well ever see will be that mountainstronghold with the altar where we first saw the night king
gameofthrones,not_removed,they were humans though we have no idea if they kept qualities from being a human when they turned
gameofthrones,not_removed,they do have a language they have art mance even says always the artists in the show they have their own clothing style after one got killed at least all of which suggests a culture they treat humans like cattle but would you say all humans are mindless monsters because we treat cattle like well cattle there is just so missing information about the white walkers theyve been around for a really long time and they could adapt quickly to a new threat getting armour after sam killed one so it is very possible they have as much of a culture and society as any other people on the planet just one that evolved for very different purposes
gameofthrones,not_removed,what if the night queen died and the night king came back to get a new queen sure it could be daenarys but the dont sleep on sansa
gameofthrones,not_removed,human qualities like compassion caring i know everyone keeps quoting grrm and saying he doesnt write completely evil characters and that they believe wights are misunderstood but i just cant see it edit punctuation
gameofthrones,not_removed,they didnt have armor until sam killed one huh interesting
gameofthrones,not_removed,and that they believe wights are misunderstood but i just cant see it there are no misconceptions about the wights they are nothing more than a mindless army of dead the wws on the other hand yeah i do expect more from them other than being nothing more than locusts however i dont think were gonna get much more than that on the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the show it seems likely that the other while just be pure villains but in the books there is more evidence to suggest that they are more than that and maybe that they are good in there own way we simply do not have enough information to know what they are trying to do and why as in imagine if you will how you would view the north and starks if you only saw the story from the point of view of the cersei joffery and tywin you would think that ned stark had tried to usurp the thrown after kidnapping tyrion and then his son tryies to get revenge for the killing of his father despite him giving rob a chance to make peace it is all a mater of how much imformation we have and whos perspective it is being told from
gameofthrones,not_removed,i recall grrm saying that the ww are not pure evil but have their goals i suppose on the show well see them invading and being defeated im fairly certain well get more info on them in the books though if the books ever come out that is
gameofthrones,not_removed,if i wasnt clear i meant white walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,the one sam killed didnt wear any as did the one he met near the fist just some rags to hide his private parts only after the incident did they come up with black leather armour that was rather effective against obsidian as shown in the battle in cave
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the books they have their own language and culture maybe even a settlement where they live thats only the white walkers of course the wights are stupid
gameofthrones,not_removed,the wws are actually trying to get south of the wall from an even bigger looming threat further up north
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually meant ww my bad my main objection is exactly what you say lack of screen time so i guess were in agreement yay
gameofthrones,not_removed,your general point is true i agree though being really picky i think tywin and joffrey would think that cersei on the other hand knows for a fact joffrey has no claim to the throne even cersei must know shes a cunt
gameofthrones,not_removed,well they certainly arent doing what the children of the forest want anymore so something is motivating them gods it going to be a long wait for more material
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i got that my mistake sorry
gameofthrones,not_removed,ahh yes when one of the children stabbed a ww to no avail then meera threw a spear at his neck then he died wow i never noticed that
gameofthrones,not_removed,my point is that we dont have an impartial view on what the others are doing and want we only see it from the point of view of there enemies so there is least a lot we dont know on the other hand the others could be sympathetic good people characters we just dont know
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know i said i agree with you lol thats why ive been up voting p also remembering that they recast the night king from an actual actor to a stunt man and making it a complete nonverbal role pretty much confirms in the show the ww are going to be completely evil
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,cutest ever also best parent award raisin em right
gameofthrones,not_removed,the outer walls of winterfell are in height the inner walls the great hall can seat people and the godswood covers three acres
gameofthrones,not_removed,itll be much bigger once the starks tear down the dreadfort to further renovate winterfell
gameofthrones,not_removed,hogwarts
gameofthrones,not_removed,rtheydidthemath
gameofthrones,not_removed,theyre hundreds of leagues away from each other dont understand what you mean by renovate
gameofthrones,not_removed,my guess is they mean theyll use the stone to build winterfell up
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a far fetched idea but itd be more symbolic than practical youd be destroying the dreadfort and using the last thing that remains of house bolton to strengthen house stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,they should just put a wall that encircles both
gameofthrones,not_removed,and the karstarks will pay for it
gameofthrones,not_removed,karstarks bring murderers and rapists need to be seperated
gameofthrones,not_removed,stannis preferred burning girl festival

gameofthrones,not_removed,too soon
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cant understand most of what you wrote but i can address the gendry thing gendry will not be leading any baratheon army because he is an unrecognized bastard no one that can prove it knows that he is roberts son meaning the lords of the stormlands have no reason to follow him
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think it will be a repeat of past event just a continuation of it but i dont think that dany will fight jon i think its cersei she will contend with and that cersei will want to attack the north because littlefinger claimed allegiance to house stark she has no kids left doesnt care about family name at this point she just wants to destroy her enemies so she is going to want to gather as many forces as she can to attack the north but now dany is on her way so she is going to have to contend with that first my thought is cersei will send jaime and the lannister army to the north to squash that and be left to deal with dany without him she has a habit of sending him out of town when she ends up needing him the most sansa is still stuck in the mindset of the game of thrones and so are littlefinger and many others they havent seen whats out thereyet the war that matters isnt the game of thrones like was the last generation its now the war between the living and the dead the last generation was setting the stage for this generation to essentially battle to save mankind
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is no one in westeros including gendry himself who is interested in legitimizing gendry and restoring the baratheon line he has been kidnapped leached imprisoned and nearly killed several times for his kings blood he is not ambitious he just wants to be a blacksmith davos is the only one vaguely interested in him and cersei daenerys tyrion baelish and jon snow all of the movers and shakers would have no interest in restoring him or the baratheons theyd rather elevate someone else they can trust to rule the stormlands kinglordwhatever gendry aint happening now as a blacksmith he may be useful when sam figures out valeryian steel hes going to need a good blacksmith to help him exploit that knowledge and prpare the white walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cant remember how did stannis and company know gendry had kings blood melisandre is going south and she might be able to convince someone of gendrys baratheon genes
gameofthrones,not_removed,stannis knew gendry before ned did
gameofthrones,not_removed,because ned found out that gendry was one of roberts bastards maybe he told stannis about him
gameofthrones,not_removed,melisandre knows but she cant prove it and no one has any reason to believe her
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cant recall the exact scene but stannis was aware he was robs bastard i remember a scene where he remarks on his looks
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah im on like my rewatch and i just finished that episode a few days ago
gameofthrones,not_removed,im on my first but im on acok so im gonna just loops seasons for now as i get through the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i just started again but im also reading the first book with the show on in the background
gameofthrones,not_removed,ne of the things included in the prophecy is that she will be killed by her valonqarlil bro so this would mean either jaime or tyrion not exactly maggy says that the valonqar that means it could be everyone we most likely think it will be jaime now and when your tears have drowned you the valonqar shall wrap his hands about your pale white throat and choke the life from you
gameofthrones,not_removed,she thinks jaime loves her and she hates tyrion shes probably nearly certain tyrion is the valonqar so she wont kill jaime just my theory
gameofthrones,not_removed,mind linking me to the scene that says valonqar i dont seem to remember it
gameofthrones,not_removed,you are quite right about the valonqar although in the show there is no one knownreferred as little brotheror something like that so i just assumed that maggy was talking about cerseis brother my theory hinges on the assumption that grrm used the word the intentionally so that a lot more candidates are there for the prophecy thats why i like the to think that cersei will kill jaime because right about now people think that the prophecies in the shows are accurate and is surely going to happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,hands can it be jaime
gameofthrones,not_removed,well its a theory and you never know what a character would do when she is mad with power its one of those twist that i would like to see even though a lot of people think it wouldnt happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,the valonqar is not used at all in the show youll never wed the prince youll wed the king youll be queen for a time then comes another younger more beautiful to cast you down and take all you hold dear the king will have children and you will have three gold will be their crowns gold their shrouds as for how cersei will die also not mentioned then comes another younger more beautiful to cast you down and take all you hold dear is the closest to a prediction pertaining to cersei herself it can be argued that the prophecy already came true she married the king she was cast down as queen by marqaery and her kids are dead she has also lost everything she valued without realising it the last being jaime she is left with the thone i doubt whether shed get any pleasure from that
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think so you know that song that gets stuck in tyrions head when he kills shae hands of gold are always cold but a womans hands are warm i think thats foreshadowing cerseis demise
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah it is in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,or now that she is queen dany will be the younger more beautiful one to take that away
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree but my point is that other than materialistic stuff the throne cersei has already lost everything and she only holds the throne through bluff with her kids dead she has no claim to the throne either
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think kings landing will be gone and no one will be able to claim the city of ash i think cersei completes what the mad king intended and burns kings landing to the ground when dany is in the house of the undying and walks into a destroyed throne room i think its a vision of the future jaime will try to stop her and will kill cersei completing that prophecy but it will be too late cersei is not going to give up the throne she would literally kill everyone in kings landing before she lets anyone have it you have to remember she only lit the wildfire under the sept of baelor wildfire is under the entire city in different sections it will be tragic
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree kl will definitely go up in flames whether its wildfire or dragonfire or maybe both is still hard to say im sure dany has no problem with moving to dragonstone besides its kings landing not queens landing anyway insert terrible tommen joke here
gameofthrones,not_removed,romeo and juliet
gameofthrones,not_removed,dolly and sam pickles
gameofthrones,not_removed,shakespeare doesnt exist in this universe perhaps a braavosi play about rhaegar lyanna they seemed to have the truthful version about what happened to king robert and crew
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah thats what i assumed the first time i watched it i was rematching with a friend who was catching up and thought maybe there was something from westeros past it was referring to
gameofthrones,not_removed,already been posted
gameofthrones,not_removed,so different you get so much more insight in to it there are moments when its like wait thats what they were trying to show internal monologue kicks the shit out of facial expressions when it comes to exposition
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrions trial speech deserves a mention

gameofthrones,not_removed,stannis speech to shireen
gameofthrones,not_removed,easily theon s speech in winter fell
gameofthrones,not_removed,aerons speech in deep voice was brilliant let euron your servant be born again from the sea as you were bless him with salt bless him with stone bless him with steel listen to the waves listen to the god he is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but euron greyjoy let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away let the old euron drown let his lungs fill with sea water let the fish eat the scales off his eyes what is dead may never die but rises again harder and stronger
gameofthrones,not_removed,not really a speech but by what right does the wolf judge the lion
gameofthrones,not_removed,not so much a speech but theres a line from stannis that really gets me we must do our duty no great or small we must do our duty
gameofthrones,not_removed,robbs one victory does not make us conquerers speech
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon snows speech in hardhome we will give those fucker a fight
gameofthrones,not_removed,low key loved jons speech at hardhome
gameofthrones,not_removed,euron greyjoy at the kingsmoot rubs theons hair calls them little neice and nephew and chumping the shit out of them and connecting on all the haymakers i heard you have no cock explains why you think a woman can be king the galivanting to daenerys giving her his cock and not being born to be king but paying iron price asha and theon got wrekt

gameofthrones,not_removed,madness has had its day
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought hed never shut up i didnt want to interupt himit was a good speech
gameofthrones,not_removed,that wasnt really a speech well i guess technically it was idk it was a coronation probably what they say to every ruler when chosen
gameofthrones,not_removed,the book version is so much better
gameofthrones,not_removed,the king in the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,you are probably right though i really liked aerons deep voice in that scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,dakingindanorf
gameofthrones,not_removed,a bit of background my fiancé and i attended the february performance of the game of thrones live concert experience as lannister vips and were seated directly in front of the stage we were dressed in the costumes pictured on our stds and the lead cellist stopped to speak with us about our costumes following the first act i excitedly explained the costumes were a precursor to our epic game of thrones themed wedding in november and handed him a save the date which i had brought multiple extras for people who asked why we looked like we were going to a ren faire at the casino and any cast or crew we had the chance to meet a few minutes later ramins personal assistanthandler came out to ask us for another so he could sign it and wish us well for our upcoming nuptials he returned with the above and it was the icing on top of an awesome night out and a great addition to what has been an incredible year for the two of us as a couple if you are interested in seeing more photos of the costumes heres the link i shared on rweddingplanning of my favorites from the photoshoot hosted on imgur edited to fix gallery link
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats freakin awesome i went to the chicago show we probably even had the same seats i was seated next to the stage right near the orchestra i was also in house lannister ramin seemed like such an awesome down to earth guy during the qa and photoop had such a great night this just solidifies how great of a guy he is great photo and an awesome message congrats on your engagement too
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love this so much i was lucky to attend the minneapolis concert nice engagement photos id love to see the wedding photos when available since its a got themed wedding may the old gods and the new bless your marriage
gameofthrones,not_removed,what a fantastic experience for you i cant open the album on my mobile for some reason bit that save the date would make a lovely framed center piece on the bridegroom table at your wedding i had a vaguely similar experience when my girlfriend and i saw the zelda symphony orchestra live the conductor signed my girlfriends hyrule shield it wad just something she bought online during intermission its always great when artists reward fan enthusiasm
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you our venue is beyond perfect and i know the photos from the wedding will be to die for we are getting really into the theme i am crafting so much of our decor and were encouraging our guests to attend in costumemedieval dress i cant wait to share them with people i know will appreciate all the details
gameofthrones,not_removed,i edited the link i believe posting this from mobile must have gotten a bit screwy for some it was a very surreal once in a lifetime thing and we will treasure it forever i certainly plan to include it on our sweetheart table during the wedding and display it with the rest of our memorabilia in our media room so awesome the two of you got to experience something similar i agree its great to be recognized by an artist for being enthusiastic about work theyve been a part of ramin was very genuine and appreciative during the qa and certainly thankful for all fan enthusiasm chuckling along with us at fan comments regarding the show and his work and giving great detailed responses to all questions
gameofthrones,not_removed,everyone that opposed her died in the sept cersei is basically doing what the mad king did and filling court with people that do not oppose herlet her do whatever the fuck she wants the small council is now composed of person and he is only where he is because of cersei so he isnt likely to oppose her
gameofthrones,not_removed,hey there cersei not so fast you cant do th gregor twists his head off history the throne was once usurped by the legal kings uncle he chopped the head off of the first person that objected the grand maester there wasnt a second objection
gameofthrones,not_removed,how is no one charging her for mass murder who and how do you prove she blew it up she was in her room in the red keep nowhere near it
gameofthrones,not_removed,might equals right thats why
gameofthrones,not_removed,the only people you see are those that just got spared from being burned to death i wouldnt object too loudly if i was in kl what they did not show yet is the smallfolk reaction there could be massive outrage over it and probably would my guess would be that the first kl scene we see at the start of is massive unrest outside the gates and heavy soldier presence in kl
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree with what others have said about no one being left to appose her and while i think that is largely true we dont have the full picture of what is going on at the end of the episode i think her coronation is basically no more then a day or two or maybe no more then a week after the death of tommen we know this because when jaime rides up to kings landing its still smoking and he goes straight to her coronation so not much time has elapsed between those two events although many of the nobles and rich important people in kings landing will have been killed in the explosion there must be some left not everyone will have attended the trial and we know there are some vips left because its not peasants who are at her coronation i think we might see some fight back or underground organised opposition to cersei within kings landing in the next season because there will be survivors there who have lost loved ones and who have a bone to pick with cersei not to mention the surviving sparrows because there must be some we know its a large organisation because we see their supporters far away interacting with other characters in other places so even if every sparrow in the city was killed there would be people outside who were interested in what happened not to mention their supporters amongst the common people within kings landing and we know how popular they were because of their work with the poor its getting this opposition coordinated thats difficult it might take time for leaders of this opposition to emerge but i suspect they will do there may well be people stood in that coronation scene who intend to appose cersei in the coming weeks and months
gameofthrones,not_removed,its not like she left a trophy card there to say it was her everyone who could suspect her is dead its just a terrible random event as far as everybody is concerned
gameofthrones,not_removed,how is no one charging her for mass murder there is no one left to charge her and prosecute her king tommen is dead pycelle is dead everyone on the small counsel is dead the high sparrow and several other septonsseptas are dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol because shes got more wildfire where that came from and shes obviously not afraid to use it i wouldnt say shit to her either though i guarantee that if there are still people of power in the city they will be plotting against her behind the scenes
gameofthrones,not_removed,seeing as now there no longer any baratheons on board even though it was common knowledge that the kids were all lannisters to begin with it was still simply a legal right they had and everyone dealt with it then i see this as being the major catalyst that brings more support to dany when she arrives after all shes done i wonder if she realizes that probably the biggest saving grace in her overtaking the throne is the fact that cersei fucked up so bad that shes practically giving the support of westeros to her
gameofthrones,not_removed,fear
gameofthrones,not_removed,even in todays world with forensics and technology it would be difficult to charge her the only people who know for sure that she did it are robert strong qyburn and the little birds and none of them are going to snitch she is only able to take the crown because of the temporary chaos all of the powerful houses that could seize the throne are severely damaged extinct or on the verge of extinction for the moment tyrell baratheon frey martell tully lannister or preoccupied arryn stark greyjoy but as soon as the chaos calms and everyone regroups they will be coming for the throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah anyone who could has been blown up
gameofthrones,not_removed,ahh for the good old days
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is correct couple this with the fact that no one except team cersei knows who blew up the sept i think the next season will kick off with all the rumors she spreads about the sparrows being a death cult always anxious to meet god objections head twist nope it wouldve been anticlimactic to go over those points in the few minutes of the last episode most interesting will be tyrions reaction when he hears kings landing blew up hell know exactly who did it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree it may seem obvious to them but i dont know what is a definitive give away so you can assume she did it and then be very afraid of her power or you can assume she took it on because everyone else who should be leading is dead now and she makes the most sense they all know but how do you act against someone capable of killing off a good chunk of the most important people in the south with a single motion and her zombified superguard i think the best action for the people of kl is to leave which may seem ridiculous to abandon homes but they just watched part of the city explode lol i would have been out of there before they had the crown on her head until i saw some notable change
gameofthrones,not_removed,the kingqueens power comes from what this was one of tywins lessons cersei will have a difficult time convincing major houses and lords to support her holding kl and holding the kingdoms are different i see jon marching from the north with the vale i see dany swarming from the south both converge on kl with the mad queen trying to find someone to light the last cache of wildfire
gameofthrones,not_removed,well see if she actually is able to command her armies now that they all know what shes done to well everyone yes she can rule by fear but i dont see everyone bending to the knee to her so easily shell probably go on a spree of murdering anyone who opposes her for a while not that itll save her shell keep some of her army but not all of it is my guess
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is a great point that i hadnt considered theres wildfire all over the city shes holding them hostage
gameofthrones,not_removed,fortunately for cersei they live in a dumb society that believes that the gods weigh in on accusations via fights so she can just have gregor kill a sparrow and bam looks like the crazy sparrows were stockpiling wildfire and it went off
gameofthrones,not_removed,mead has got nothing to to with beer really its basically a wine made from honey they still make it today and its delicious go try some
gameofthrones,not_removed,home brewer here ale can refer to many different kinds of beer and can be as hoppy as an ipa or as mellow as a blonde ipas historically came much later than the time period represented in got in fact most modern ales bear little resemblance to what they likely wouldve drank in that time period mostly because the modern brewing process is very different in the first episode tyrion asks for a brown ale to drink with breakfast so i suppose it would taste something close to a newcastle though that brews fairly new for thousands of years beer was consumed as a necessity due to a lower chance of disease being found in it as opposed to straight water from the well the brewing process creates a sterile beverage that kills most bacteria even children drank it at the time though the alcohol level was likely lower than we have in beers today mead on the other hand is closer to wine than beer in terms of brewing process not hoppy at all and actually quite sweet due to honey and other nectarsfruits being used as with anything that can be brewed it all depends on the ingredients which vary heavily usually depending on region theres a reason beer is more popular in northern europe while wine is the drink of choice in southern europe obviously due to the prominence of barleywheat in the north and grapes in the south got represents this pretty well with northerners consuming ale and southerners with wine
gameofthrones,not_removed,mead is an alcoholic beverage created by fermenting honey with water sometimes with various fruits spices grains or hops the alcoholic content ranges from about abv to more than ale is a type of beer brewed using a warm fermentation method resulting in a sweet fullbodied and fruity taste historically the term referred to a drink brewed without hops
gameofthrones,not_removed,jesus man google
gameofthrones,not_removed,did not realize this was still a thing is this something you can get anywhere
gameofthrones,not_removed,best explanation i couldve helped to ever have gotten
gameofthrones,not_removed,so i guess mead is a verrrrrry loose ipa alcoholic beverage but not considered beer where as ale would be your historical pale ale style
gameofthrones,not_removed,stop being salty bro
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the uk im able to find it in specialist winebeer merchants
gameofthrones,not_removed,mead has nothing to do with an india pale ale an ipa is beer mead is not beer
gameofthrones,not_removed,mead has no connection to ipa ipa is a style of ale ale is a classification of beer but ales can be many different styles all beer is either ale or lager but there are further breakdowns from there think of it like a family tree
gameofthrones,not_removed,ales are just lighter beers that are usually lower in alcohol content i am by no means a beer expert but beers like blue moon and shocktop are ales i know shocktop is i dont think all blue moons are mead sounds like wine whiskey and beer had a threeway and gave birth to an abominationdelicious abomination edit in the past i was always under the impression mead was a type of whiskey not wine and i think thats how the show interprets it as they already have wine
gameofthrones,not_removed,but no idea about in the states
gameofthrones,not_removed,this was my thought too ale in gotwheat beer ie blue moon shocktops or your standard pale ales whereas meadexactly what you said my friend just told me he has drank mead before at a beer fest and it was and said he had a wicked hangover the next day not sure why he failed to mention to this in our initial discussion he might be stoned
gameofthrones,not_removed,any decent wine shop or if you live near total wine or bevmo will more than likely carry mead its fucking delicious too
gameofthrones,not_removed,just go to your local pretentious organic market if you live in a state where supermarkets are allowed to sell alcohol then theyll definitely have it its a very popular hipster drink and also a very important drink for people with celiac because its one of the few canned alcohols thats naturally gluten free the other main one being cider
gameofthrones,not_removed,yup ive had httpcharmcitymeadworkscom which i can buy in my local grocery store its made in baltimore and i live nearby so idk if its just sold locally httpmeadistcomcategorydrinkingmeadmeadreviews a list of commercially available mead you might have to call around to find some but theres bound to be a liqeor store in your area that sells at least or brands of mead if youre in denver you can visit httpqueenbeebrewscomindexhtml which is a mead brewery
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha it happens to the best of us
gameofthrones,not_removed,period accurate beer would be nothing like blue moon or shocktop they didnt have refrigeration thus no temperature control for lagering from seeing the recipes historians have created to approximate medieval ales it would likely taste closer to an amber ale fat tire etc with less hop presence than a modern american amber ale some may have also had characteristics similar to trappist ales westmalle chimay etc one common practice in ancient brewing was to brew a big beer and a small beer basically brew a beer then reuse the grain to make a lower abv beer for the children and poor mead on the other hand is honey wine but since honey contains more fermentable sugar than juice it tends to make a stronger hotter beverage than grape wine
gameofthrones,not_removed,nearest store that sells it from me is away
gameofthrones,not_removed,they aged him up so people didnt have to watch natalie dormer seduce a yr old
gameofthrones,not_removed,correct deancharles chapman also played martyn lannister one of the two lannister boys who were murdered while being held hostage by robb i think he took over the role as tommen because they needed tommen to be a bit older than he should be since he was going to be getting married and having much more dialogue i believe in the books that tommen was still quite young when he took the throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes youre right about everything early season tommen was played by a different actor who was never recast again to play him the current tommens actor also played one of the lannister children that were killed same with myrcella old actress being replace ironically rickons actor was kept the same maybe its to shut down any fan speculation that the rickon we see was not really rickon and that hes hiding somewhere
gameofthrones,not_removed,correct in addition to playing one of the earlier lannisters he was also mountain and beric dondarrion if im correct talented kid wishing him all the best as marta in the next season of ad
gameofthrones,not_removed,book tommen is about or i think by adod at joffreys death tommen myrcella joffrey show tommen is about by season at joffreys death tommen myrcella joffrey give or take this is entirely my opinion the ages of the characters is one thing ive never tried to keep track of since they had to be altered not just over the changes from the books but also over the course of the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,you are correct they liked him so much that they brought him back to play the more robust tommen character
gameofthrones,not_removed,dean charles chapman got to lie in a bed with natalie dormer hes a legend
gameofthrones,not_removed,all of this info is very easy to find on googleimdb
gameofthrones,not_removed,just look it up on google you could have found out about it in secs
gameofthrones,not_removed,ratings gold
gameofthrones,not_removed,i almost think i would have liked to see this it would have been so disturbing to watch yet i know shed have done it
gameofthrones,not_removed,correct tommen is a much more minor character in the books and very much a child he only cares about his kitten ser pounce stamping any document the small council puts in front of him and outlawing beets
gameofthrones,not_removed,never noticed
gameofthrones,not_removed,perhaps because he never had much of a speaking role
gameofthrones,not_removed,we spent a lot more time with rickon than young tommen so the recast would be far more jarring if they replaced him he also barely had anything to do except look scared and get shot so its not like acting quality was vital tommen on the other hand was barely in the show compared to rickon and his role postrecast was larger than anything rickon ever had to do so it was more important to get a more suitable actor
gameofthrones,not_removed,daario as well very versatile
gameofthrones,not_removed,not to mention trying to piece together how little sam is still an infant while many characters mention years going by
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was already kinda creepy to begin with
gameofthrones,not_removed,the tv series does not have enough ser pounce imo
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,so how does one make sugar if you dont have access to sugar cane no candy for the kiddies
gameofthrones,not_removed,it would also be weird to have nat dormer seducing the first tommen
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh man i dont even know what to think about that one little sam is what born during season and in season he still looks like a baby but with a full head of hair not quite a toddler either you can probably explain it simply as sams story after departing from castle black runs at a different speed than most of the major storylines as well as little sam having his father be not just his grandfather but potentially also his great great grandfather genetically the kid probably has a few things wrong here and there
gameofthrones,not_removed,you and every other person with toxoplasma gondii parasites
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would assume theyd just use honey in its place
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is very true
gameofthrones,not_removed,what you call weird i call nah not gonna go there
gameofthrones,not_removed,it doesnt help that weve never seen him walk or talk or do much of anything really we have no idea where he is on the development track
gameofthrones,not_removed,yep everyone who likes cats is infected with toxoplasmosis gondii

gameofthrones,not_removed,splinter is the name youre looking for
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow fantastic work definitely buying edit and now looking at all the work i want to buy like different posters especially the kick ass back to the future one
gameofthrones,not_removed,mobile network sucks so i cant check it out just yet but im guessing theyre in the us do they ship to eu and if so for how much i have to buy these for christmas edit alright nevermind i managed to check well i hope the promo code is still available
gameofthrones,not_removed,probably the two men killed by tormund and wun wun
gameofthrones,not_removed,i believe the show meant to imply that they were hung in batches
gameofthrones,not_removed,well castle black was already undermanned its possible jon pardoned all but the head conspirators i think thats unlikely though
gameofthrones,not_removed,either pardoned or executed before the camera rolled probably the latter
gameofthrones,not_removed,this submission was removed for the reasons listed below events that make changes to people places and things established at the start of the main story those are spoilers origin theory formulas like abc that rgameofthroneswtheories cant be in titles either please review the subreddits rgameofthroneswpostingpolicy and rgameofthroneswspoilerguide to better understand the content scope if you have a question or concern about this action please
gameofthrones,not_removed,still held by loyalists to stannis as far as we know likely to come back up when daenerys crosses the narrow sea it sits at the mouth of blackwater bay so anyone wishing to take the city must sail past it
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the show after stannis leaves for the wall its just kinda in the background in the books theres a siege and yada yada it ends up back in lannister handsim guessing the people at the castle are still loyal to stannis in the show since the siege never happens
gameofthrones,not_removed,presumably stannis maintained a garrison at dragonstone when he his main military force and entourage sailed to braavos then the wall its reasonable to think that news of stanniss defeat and death at winterfell would have reached dragonstone by now as this appears to be common knowledge as far south as meereen in that event stanniss remaining men have no real reason to remain at dragonstone but there wouldnt be much incentive for them to leave either presumably many if not most have homes and families there with stannis gone these soldiers might be looking for work i could see davos rallying the troops and delivering many of them to jons army or perhaps theyll largely become mercenaries
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the show uncertain its possible that stannis left a nominal garrison commanded by the castellan of dragonstone perhaps he abandoned it to fight the real war in the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon will need the dragon glass that is there to fight the ww army so he will probably take control of dragonstone prety soon
gameofthrones,not_removed,probably held by a skeleton crew who are reeady to open the door to whoever comes lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,we know so little about dragonstone at this point multiple seasons of no info that for all we know gendry turned right back around and is now ruler of the island
gameofthrones,not_removed,i assumed the siege happened but was so insignificant cause loras wasnt sent that there was no point wasting screen time on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i could see davos rallying the troops and delivering many of them to jons army man davos maybe along with tyrion might just be the one to bring jon and dany together to meet
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think so
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah first bag of gold thrown over the drawbridge opens the door
gameofthrones,not_removed,lmao wouldnt hey be something after seeing the promo i assume daenerys already has it captured by the time the new season starts
gameofthrones,not_removed,idk in the books its part of cerseis plot against the tyrells and since both tyrells hang out at kings landing until the sept explosion there was really no reason to even give the siege life im curious to see what banners dragonstone is flying under when dany sails in
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah hes not a conqueror he just wanted his sister to have her home back and to not die by white walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,well i assume the tyrrells will eventually be crippled under cerseis plotting in the books so including loras in the sept was just efficient for the show theres two options for dragonstone in the show either its still held by a skeleton stannis crew which will be easily destroyed or its under lannister control which will still be easily crushed but will likely send word to kings landing of danys invasion i think the latter makes more sense from a narrative pov just to make the coming battle more interesting
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive missed you big brother ive missed you too
gameofthrones,not_removed,burn them all the mad king paralleled by burn them all cersei lannisterbaratheon
gameofthrones,not_removed,a very small man can cast a very large shadow varys to tyrion
gameofthrones,not_removed,you will never walk again bran but you will fly
gameofthrones,not_removed,finest man i ever knew your grace im a nerd and i got chills even typing that lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,id like for jaime to shake jons hand and thank him for organizing the fight against the white walkers this time in a serious tone and this with his left hand presumably
gameofthrones,not_removed,arya ive missed you big brother jon ive missed you too arya i dont want to die jon youre not going to die oh crap please no
gameofthrones,not_removed,bran will be one of the three who ride the dragons with daenerys
gameofthrones,not_removed,hopefully arya wouldnt be too scared considering shes spent the last few years practicing the rmeirl of religions
gameofthrones,not_removed,ride no warg yes
gameofthrones,not_removed,more like little finger is her biggest helper considering he started the stark vs lannister feud he created all the chaos to try to put himself in power but really he helped dany
gameofthrones,not_removed,the very first conflict introduced in the show is that between the white walkers and humanity thats how the show opens the second conflict is between lannister and stark the first episode ends with jaime pushing bran out the window at the end of season i think the lannisters will finally be ended and i hope it is by a stark arya and not by daenerys or tyrion that will close that epic arc from the first episode then season will mostly deal with the other arc the white walkers vs humanity
gameofthrones,not_removed,the lannisters still have men in their army according to the wiki
gameofthrones,not_removed,chaos is laddah
gameofthrones,not_removed,said like that the only people making actual decision are lf and varys everyone else is a piece being moved by those obeying each of them certain rules
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think daenerys will defeat lannisters as for who will kill cersei its probably jaime or arya or maybe even hound
gameofthrones,not_removed,and daenerys with varys and tyrion jorah selmy daario missandei grey worm helping push her is the better climbah come to think of it the major advantage that daenerys may have over baelish is not her family name though that is something or the three dragons which have played only minor parts but that she builds a team and baelish sent ros to be joffreys target
gameofthrones,not_removed,this has been asked already i think but i think her magic that keeps her young is a mixture of the necklace and a potion i think she puts into the bath i kind of remember there being a shot in the season premiere when she takes the necklace off and theres a close up of the potion bottle being empty
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive heard its her beliefs not the necklace and at that point she was confident in her belief in the lord of light at the wall shes lost all hope taking her necklace off was just symbolically losing all hope

gameofthrones,not_removed,you do realise that the horses cant see a cgi dragon right
gameofthrones,not_removed,my mom is and had pretty extensive surgery where she was limited as to what she could do it happened right around the time hbo was playing the series in order so i started recording it she got tired watching ncis for the umpteenth time and finally watched it she sent me a text along the lines of why wasnt i watching this she isnt bothered by the nudity at least shes also never read the books so things like the red wedding were fun to see through her eyes
gameofthrones,not_removed,both my parents have loved it so far and my mom even went and picked up copies of agot and acok for herself to start reading the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,my dad is a hardcore fan of the show i wouldnt be surprised if he browsed this sub hes the one who recommended the show to me my mom on the other hand only knows the names of like characters
gameofthrones,not_removed,my mother basically recommended it to herself she noticed my obssesion with the showbooks and decided she wanted to see for herself
gameofthrones,not_removed,my mom who hates violent movies and couldnt sit through lotr is hooked
gameofthrones,not_removed,my dad is actually the one that got me to watch it and ive been crazy about it ever since ive recommended the show to my little brother and my cousin and theyve both gone insane about it and are watching like half a season a day the most facepalm was getting my uncle to watch it he lives in canada and just uses hbo and doesnt use go so the next time i saw him a couple months later he tells me and my dad eh i dont get it man theres just random dragons flying around and all this weird fantasy stuff i dont like it so we give each other weird wtf looks and ask him how far hes watched and he says ive seen all seasons well i started recording a marathon partway through and missed all of season one the level of triggered my dad and i were feeling was unparalleled
gameofthrones,not_removed,grandparents parents aunts uncles etc theyre all adults its not like they dont know what all that shit is if they dont mind the gore idk what the issue is
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have no experience nobody ever listens to me when i tell them to watch it
gameofthrones,not_removed,my mom recently had surgery and was stuck in bed home for a few weeks i put her on the series finished seasons in or around weeks specific got landmarks red wedding hardhome hold the door cercis shame walk she would come to me rambling on about what she thought about the episode sometimes even at am now does not stop talking about season lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,i showed my mom and my sister the show my mom hated it and my sister got hooked still trying to get my mom to come around
gameofthrones,not_removed,breaking bad is better brother
gameofthrones,not_removed,looks good but could use a couple of martell and greyjoy sails
gameofthrones,not_removed,brooooooooooooooooooo
gameofthrones,not_removed,you should write fire and blood on the sky horizontally i think the red letters just dont fit with the rest but the drawing is very nice
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks ill try that
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the whole explanation of the cotfww magic has been underwhelming the way benjen so nonchalantly recounts his experience makes it seem so mundane this is one of the few aspects of got where i think less is more the magical properties of the cotfww should be shrouded in a little bit more mystery and awe to the other characters at least than they currently are
gameofthrones,not_removed,damn good point if the children have developeddiscovered the ability to control white walker coldhand things why not make another army to defeat the bad ones
gameofthrones,not_removed,seemed to me that it was a justintime thing they came across him and prevented his zombification before it was too late and even if im misreading it and he was already changed when they got to him can you imagine them trying to do that in the middle of a rush of wws never happen i was pretty tired when i watched the ep so i may have not caught all benjen was mumbling
gameofthrones,not_removed,does that actually mean hes part ww now i thought he was just a wight that retained his humanity through magic similar to what made the ww im still confused on a lot of the details surrounding everything happening with bran anyway even so i dont think the cotf lost control of the ww in the sense that the ww were just inherently uncontrollably evil and hell bent on killing everything in their path i think the night king just retained his human emotions which drove him toward vengeance we still dont know why he was chained up after all maybe humans betrayed him to the cotf then they both teamed up against him to lock him out of the south dunno about you but thatd piss me off pretty bad i think something along those lines would be more gotlike than just having them be evil for the sake of evil and if thats the case then it wouldnt matter whether the cotf had control of benji or not because hes a man who wants to take care of his family and defend the wall orrrr hes pulling a fast one and hes actually working with the nk who knows
gameofthrones,not_removed,my theory on dragonglass is that it probably is a substance that has more than magical ability im sure there is more to it than just makingkilling white walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes it appeared the children got to him before he transformed but there is also this concept that the starks have a connection to the nights king
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon snow is the ice dragon
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is an ice dragon encased in the wall it will wake when the wall falls edit oh oh oh bran will warg into it and fly
gameofthrones,not_removed,grrm wrote a childrens book about an ice dragon that has nothing to do with asoiaf and now everybodys trying to crow bar it into the story despite grrm already stating their is no ice dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,ice dragons are supposed to be in the shivering sea and theyre also massive much larger than the dragons dany has
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a fan theory that has no evidence in the story
gameofthrones,not_removed,people seem to discuss about frostice dragons in the others army who would counter danys dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,yo
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,legends about ice dragons are talked about in asoiaf and twoiaf martin only said that the ice dragon doesnt take place in this world not that there are no ice dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,pretty sure ice dragons have been mentioned in the books and other got media the telltale game heavily hints at an ice dragon being beyond the wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,old nan told the kids a story about ice dragons so theyre real wether or not there is a living one well see but they existed in the past
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont see how they need ice dragons when they can clearly build a mountain of walkers up to whatever height the dragons are at to swarm them
gameofthrones,not_removed,yo
gameofthrones,not_removed,theirs also stories about ice spiders as big as hounds edit in response to your edit people often say danys dragons are deus ex machina incorrectly however if an ice dragon suddenly pops up that is
gameofthrones,not_removed,would that be considered canon
gameofthrones,not_removed,that would honestly be a dope way cinematically to take out a dragon
gameofthrones,not_removed,what do they eat chicken
gameofthrones,not_removed,im gonna be pissed if we dont see ice spiders due to cgi budget costs
gameofthrones,not_removed,that would also be an incorrect use of deus ex machina
gameofthrones,not_removed,show canon
gameofthrones,not_removed,the sarcasm just flew right over your head didnt it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i forgot who says thisin what context and its been bothering me the chicken thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,hope not ill take the hound over an ice spider any day if its over fookin chicken
gameofthrones,not_removed,pretty sure it wouldnt be considering theirs no hints or foreshadowing to an ice dragon in the show at least if it suddenly pops up to fight drogo and change the odds in the night kings favour thats pretty much the definition of deus ex machina no although i admit i could be wrong on that
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,i believe you are correct here the definition i found was deus ex machina ˌdāəs eks ˈmäkənəˌdāəs eks ˈmakənə noun an unexpected power or event saving a seemingly hopeless situation especially as a contrived plot device in a play or novel since no one in the show has talked about ice dragons at all one of them simply popping up to save the night king and battle drogon would fit
gameofthrones,not_removed,deus ex machina is when a sudden and fortuitous power comes out of nowhere to help the heroes out of a low point ice dragons wouldnt be deus ex machina unless they help the heroes out an unlikely prospect considering that their masters would be the walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,everybodys the hero of their own story even the night king after all he was kidnapped held against his will by the children of the forest and forced to become what he is now all he wants his justice im going to say im right its deus ex machina gg
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre not right because you were moving the goalposts anyway theres a difference between introducing ice dragons and concocting a very specific event that involves an ice dragon introducing ice dragons would not be a deus ex machina
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats not how that works in any way the show has a loosely defined group of protagonists but it still does have protagonists the night king and the walkers are literally the only characters in westeros that dont fit into that group ice dragons showing up wouldnt help any of the protagonists it would give them another obstacle to fight ergo not a deus ex machina
gameofthrones,not_removed,deus ex machina does not only apply to heroes it applies to anything being saved miraculously just wanted to clarify that carry on boys
gameofthrones,not_removed,book wankers will know why you want that character in there with cersei ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gameofthrones,not_removed,considering how much the whole walk of atonement cost to produce imagine how much a myrish swamp would drain the budget
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have said this before but i dont see them introducing any more major characters in the next two season except for possibly howland reed
gameofthrones,not_removed,might be a bit late for that now i reckon especially now that margery is dead too
gameofthrones,not_removed,drain the swamp washington insiders have been getting away with too much
gameofthrones,not_removed,id agree with your opinion except cersei is batshit crazy anything is possible with her
gameofthrones,not_removed,hahaha nice
gameofthrones,not_removed,he needed a shadowcat pet
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes the spoilers coming out of filming suggest that danys invasion doesnt go as smoothly as planned so i think that she needs to make an alliance jon is the best marriage prospect for her from jons perspective he averts a war in the north secures some sort of northern independence autonomy and gets access to the dragons to defeat the ice zombies the only issue is that it seems way outside the gritty asoiaf universe for the dashing heroic king to marry the beautiful queen with the dragons and save the world from a politics perspective it makes sense but from a george rr martin storytelling perspective it makes no sense
gameofthrones,not_removed,white walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,you mean like tyrion with a shotgun errr crossbow
gameofthrones,not_removed,well technically until bran or howland reed gets to him he does not know his parentage and neither does daenerys theres no reason not to get together then
gameofthrones,not_removed,the thing is jon snows a bit of a badass if the circumstances presented favor jon marrying daenerys but he doesnt want to he wont
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont forget he has a dragon blood which he will demonstrate to dany during his visit to her the sex between them will be very tender not like rape scene with drogo
gameofthrones,not_removed,unless littlefingee somehow gets in the way
gameofthrones,not_removed,or it might make perfect sense if they do it because they have too but they cant stand each other
gameofthrones,not_removed,ice zombies is more of a reason than theyre family jon has no emotional connection to them or very little only one was aemon
gameofthrones,not_removed,that could be one way to subvert the fantasy cliches although dany is jons type jon is not danys type she prefers bad boys to chivalrous knights
gameofthrones,not_removed,exactly

gameofthrones,not_removed,perhaps to differentiate him from the nights watch as theyre called crows apparently though theories with strong evidence support that the was from the nights watch and therefore was a crow the third eye representing omniscient abilities yet still fighting for what the nights watch stands for and therefore a crow thats just a maybe that i wrote up on the spot from what i can tell from our worlds cultures ravens are generally more respected or admired than crows as well as considered more exotic than crows not to mention poes the raven
gameofthrones,not_removed,they did it to distinguish between book character and show character book tec is brynden rivers around years old a targ great bastard banished hand of the king valerian steel sword carrying badass ter is sort of a mashup of him allegedly years old if we take him literally and likely without any of the aforementioned backstory that would be too cumbersome to tell on television and would distract from brans plot line moving along also the crowraven confusion was mentioned by dd at some point i would consider it a similar move to them calling show coldhands benjen coldhands to differentiate from book coldhands which according to grrms manuscript is not benjen edit my phone autocorrected brynden to brunson lmao
gameofthrones,not_removed,plus ravens carry messages so it is more poetic if the seer is one as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,any idea if this was a grrm move or was it a showproduction move
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you
gameofthrones,not_removed,might have been both the name of the character that is supposedly the three eyed crow in the books holds a nicknametitle bloodraven perhaps they knew they would not have time to introduce his character in full so switching from a crow to a raven was a nod to who im assuming grrm plans to reveal the crow to be in the books for example why bring bloodraven into the show when there are larger potentially more important characters to bring on like young griff that wont even make it
gameofthrones,not_removed,cant quickly find anything on who changed it or why but think its probably because of what you said yea makes sense not to confuse the viewers and mix it with crows as in the nights watch
gameofthrones,not_removed,the night king from the show is not in the books youre thinking of the nights king this is a different character with a different history
gameofthrones,not_removed,the night king and the nights king are two completely different characters
gameofthrones,not_removed,i always believed the lord commander was actually the first and the first were his companions who died beyond the wall with him
gameofthrones,not_removed,looks really nice
gameofthrones,not_removed,very detailed what kind of wood did you use it looks really great
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats fantastic well done
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would name you the kings hand just doesnt sound the same
gameofthrones,not_removed,i used some basswood and stained it with coffee
gameofthrones,not_removed,here
gameofthrones,not_removed,just trying to keep the title short
gameofthrones,not_removed,id like too see the dance of the dragons as the prequel series theres enough known about it for them to work on
gameofthrones,not_removed,dunk and egg of course but id love to see the tourney at harrenhal and roberts rebellion the tragedy at summerhal the doom of valerya and the start of the faceless men really id be happy with anything though

gameofthrones,not_removed,very much agree plus targaryens at height of their power while the characters definitely drive the story its the tension between the fantasy and the realpolitik thats draws the mix of fans it has not to mention dragons a westeros without any possibility of dragons i think would come off dull to the crossover audience though everything set in this world interests me
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel like its the closet they could get too game of thrones with the mythicalmagicaldragons and the politicsthe feuds between the families and so on so youre right when it comes to that i also have the same views that the world george has created is extremely interesting
gameofthrones,not_removed,not the nsfw i had hoped for
gameofthrones,not_removed,still havent accepted that shes dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,holy shit awesome work
gameofthrones,not_removed,das fucked up cool art tho
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is too sad
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah man she definitely did not deserve that
gameofthrones,not_removed,she asked to be killed off
gameofthrones,not_removed,no i think well get it pieced together from brans visions and from stuff sam reads in the library throughout the two seasons rather then show it in one episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,this seems like a very lost thing to do and i dont see it really fitting well into got btw not bashing lost love that show
gameofthrones,not_removed,from the ww point of view perhaps their existence is exquisite and pure paradise in their minds they are doing everyone else a favor by bringing them to their side and dont understand why people resist
gameofthrones,not_removed,id really rather not know to many details they are more mysterious and scary as they are with limited appearances that are devastating i hope they never speak or if they do its like onetwo words and very scarily voiced
gameofthrones,not_removed,it
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the show no way im still not sure that dd get that the white walkers arent the real enemy and are no more evil than us but in the books there is a chance of an others pov in ados
gameofthrones,not_removed,hard to say i think we we will see more of the backstory of the night king before he became who he was but an episode focused around nothing but them would essentially mean we would probably only see bran at the beginning and the end of the episode they are ridiculousy smart honestly probably smarter than most if not all of the characters remember they are not dead they live for thousands of years iirc most likely and they have gained more knowledge about the world than all the other characters combined imho but it would be ridiculously cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really hope that happens
gameofthrones,not_removed,ermm no it would be a waste of an episode since we only have about left
gameofthrones,not_removed,problem is right now with all of the major parties slowly dwindling away a lot of the politics and drama that has been brooding and has been a center point of the serious is almost unable to happen unless they have serious in fighting euron sneaks onto danys ships or arya meets up with the bwob and the hound and proceeds to lead them with it all wrapping up as it is now with out in fighting there has to be an episode focused on the white walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope not i think the way the human characters in the mix react to the long night and the walkers is much more interesting i also dont really think the showrunners captured how theyre supposed to look very well
gameofthrones,not_removed,no there is no motives or backstory for death and thats what theyre supposed to represent in this world as indicated by dd so no well never see them as a culture and hear any of them speak and i hope we wouldnt because it will only deminish their threat the lesser we know about them the more menacing and threatning they seem to be
gameofthrones,not_removed,i doubt it itll be nice when the series ends for someone to do a super cut of only white walker scenes however but i doubt thisll work in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,we kind of already know the children used their magic to create walkers as death machines to destroy mankind they may have other secret motives or maybe theyre just monsters who went out of control and turned on their former masters
gameofthrones,not_removed,there will be onlu white wedding where everybody dies
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think final season is going to war against others
gameofthrones,not_removed,there will not be any talk about motives d d said they are basically just death and they are just nature doing its thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,i kinda hope not they only have episodes this season so they need to make the most out of them
gameofthrones,not_removed,didnt we basically get that i mean we know they were created as a weapon no real other motivation right but seeing hat they are doing with the baby etc yeah we need that
gameofthrones,not_removed,no especially not if there is only episodes in the story left they may do a minute or so clip in a few episode to give some background but even that is too farfetched
gameofthrones,not_removed,hasnt it basically been confirmed that the white walkers are just super weapons created by the children that have gone rogue so theyre not really beings theyre just artificial things created to kill people
gameofthrones,not_removed,there has never been an episode where only one storyline is presented it has always been bits and pieces of each story strategically placed its the same with the books i think itd be really boring to only have one storyline in a whole episode because were so used to the way it is already
gameofthrones,not_removed,no
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was a huge lost fan back in the day maybe thats where this idea came from im aware its far fetched just an interesting thought
gameofthrones,not_removed,i literally thought this exactly and then i read your post thanks for streamingp my idea
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah first thing i thought of was the jacob and man in black episode after the turn that lore went i am ok with the white walkers not having their own episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,an interesting angle but they seem pretty malevolent the first time their introduced in book they laugh as they slaughter some rangers though i guess all we see of them is through the eyes of humans
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is what happened with the reapers in the mass effect series during the first game there is one communication with one of them it was dark and cryptic its only response to the question of why are you doing this was a simple our reasoning is beyond your comprehension that was all i needed they were machines hellbent on wiping out organic life i was totally okay with that being the end of it but in the third game they tried to gently force the player to accept some garbage reasoning behind the reapers and it really irked me im okay with a few unsolved mysteries let the storm on the horizon come and simply show me the devastation let the white walkers just be some threat something beyond comprehension i really dont need some reasoning behind their war
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is the thing where once you know someones backstory and reason for doing something they become human or someone that isnt a being of pure evil a good example is jamie at first we see him as a terrible person but as we learn who he is we find out that he is a much more complex and conflicted person it is like the saying everyone is the hero of their own story side note if you think about it though there is a reason for the walkers to be angry and want to destroy everything they were created as slaves and as being to serve the children not only that but they also fought the first men this would lead them to have a very legitimate reason to want to seek revenge and want to get back at the groups that wronged them
gameofthrones,not_removed,if we dont know then its very cheap and cliche theyd be just a big bad for the sake of being a big bad and got is interesting enough without the fantasy element why would there even be a fantasy element to the show at that point
gameofthrones,not_removed,its like hes allergic to his pet hes made of snow and its made of fire essentially
gameofthrones,not_removed,whyd they go rouge they seem more intelligent than just weapons theyve got their own armor i dunno seems like there more to it than just what info we were given in the door
gameofthrones,not_removed,blackwater the watchers on the wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,well i mean theyll come back from the dead so killing them is probably just playful right
gameofthrones,not_removed,this also happening in the halo series with the forerunners somewhat not quite as mysterious as they used to be
gameofthrones,not_removed,well as opposed to a single newly awakened reaper in they had a huge amount of reapers and reaper forces in and makes sense that theyd interact and learn more about the reapers
gameofthrones,not_removed,i always preferred to accept the indoctrination theory as canon in that regard where due to prolonged exposure shepard was more inclined to communicate with them
gameofthrones,not_removed,makes it more charming in my opinion
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think so forerunners in the halo games are like scraps that used to be a giant unstoppable titan the more you know about them the more you realize that they were much more than what they are now i suggest that you read the halo books that are focused on them halo cryptum primordium and silentium all of them are excellent books and are worth the read
gameofthrones,not_removed,its not that its the fact that at the end of they tried to explain the reapers what more did we really need an exact detail why they are bent on stopping humanity some save you from yourself bullshit weve heard a thousand times leaving the mystery allows people to fill in the holes with what they want their machines they are programmed to kill us for one reason or another they were created and ultimately went rogue what else do we need to know giving away the mystery takes away the fun its like a magic trick where the magician tells you how right after you lose all the sense of wonder not only does explaining the motivation of a force of nature like the reapers or the ww silly but it devalues everything in them but explaining their motivation because it is most likely some played out tired old cliche we already know that we expect it then are disappointed when its revealed because suddenly its much less terrifying if we never are told we still assume its for some cliche save you from yourselves nonsense but at least we dont know that it allows us to think of them as beings beyond comprehension taking away that illusion just makes them regular ass enemies and their mythical nature becomes mundane and tired
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have read them and i agree they are well worth the read particularly silentium just my personal opinion they feel a little bit diminished although that may be because halo story left a mostly bad taste in my mouth
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah but if they didnt do that the complaints would be about how they didnt explore the reapers enough
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh dont even talk about halo the last thing i wanted to see is the series turning into battlestar infinity
gameofthrones,not_removed,replace babies with those with the people in the sept cersei was and still not liked by the people she made even more enemies by blowing up those in the sept while we dont know who they were id imagine there were nobles from other houses rich merchants etc she doesnt have the support of the tyrells thus the people will starve and winter is coming relationship with jaime might end up strained and hell be the one choking her out as per the prophecy and fan theory its still not smooth sailing for danaerys though she might encounter eurons fleet and maybe even a storm that might sink many of her ships but in the end i cant see her dying
gameofthrones,not_removed,not dany ellaria sand if shes even considered a queen cersei may also go down in the last episode but lena headey and a few other of the got leading actors signed a fat contract per episode so its likely cersei will be around for the start of season though possibly no longer queen
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres a sort of dewey defeats truman appeal to cersei improbably outlasting dany but i dont see it happening
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei will fall first it dany falls it wont be until the final battle
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont see aither of them dying this season but if they even actually ever go to war dany will win that war
gameofthrones,not_removed,neither
gameofthrones,not_removed,¿porque no las dos
gameofthrones,not_removed,totally concur this season has me ecstatic it neeeds to hurry
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed if dany incurs significant losses at the hands of euron that could be the catalyst for her opening up a line of communication with the newlycrowned king in the north jon snow
gameofthrones,not_removed,seems to likely for dany to stay alive though
gameofthrones,not_removed,i never understood why more often tyrion doesnt use a type of reversepsychology on her because of the fact she is obsessively sensitive defensive and offendible like from the video above aftee cecsie makes the comment about killing thier mother he should say something like are tou seriously that stupid no no i dont remember killin our mother jk yeah iobvioisly worked hard at it day and night of course i remember stupid i hated that bich you wanr to rule the seven kingdoms amd youre dumb enough to think i dont rememver killing her in the womb you remember everything in the womb and on dont ya stupid jeez i have found like anbillion times hecould say soemthing like this to get big important points accrossnto her but he never does
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont see them both dying
gameofthrones,not_removed,what are you on
gameofthrones,not_removed,too much nightshade
gameofthrones,not_removed,jorah the explorah
gameofthrones,not_removed,bronn and jaime go a wenching
gameofthrones,not_removed,dance of the dragons pls
gameofthrones,not_removed,blackfyre rebellion doom of valyria roberts rebellion dunk and egg etc there is so many options ill be happy with whatever
gameofthrones,not_removed,blackfyre rebellion
gameofthrones,not_removed,i want to see valariya right before the doom a series which ends with the doom
gameofthrones,not_removed,dance of dragonsalbeit expensivewould be amazing
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel like they really cant go wrong with any sort of prequel there are so many things they could do
gameofthrones,not_removed,it would be cool if each season of the prequal was a main character of the series retelling past events as they know it for example season one could start out with a little jon and robb running into neds room and begging him to tell them the story of roberts rebellion fade into episode one season two could be tywin sitting down to tell jamie some cool story that involves the lannisters fade into episode one of season two so on and so on
gameofthrones,not_removed,adventures of dunk and egg would be the safest route to go the stories exist and were written by grrm himself
gameofthrones,not_removed,i want to see the doom of valyria
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe they can go the legend of korra route and fast forward a couple decades or centuries
gameofthrones,not_removed,sold thread over lets mail hbo and tell them what weve got
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think stuff like the doom is best shrouded in mystery
gameofthrones,not_removed,roberts rebellion
gameofthrones,not_removed,got has an interesting past to explore before we dwelve into a yet uknown future
gameofthrones,not_removed,in a perfect world i would have done a robert rebellions miniseries in between season and season to fill in the missing pieces for the entire viewing audience i know book purists would hate for all the spoilers to be shown before the books series is completed but the general public would still watch doing roberts rebellion a couple of years after the end of got would be kinda weird since we would more or less if rlj is true and explained in got have already have seen the coda to the rebellion so i dont know how satisfying that would be i could see something like the valyrian conquest that could potentially be explored its been brought up before but for most of the public this would be something similar but altogether new
gameofthrones,not_removed,warden is not the same as lord paramount warden is a military title like general which is usually not always given to the lord paramount of a given region the north westerlands vale or the reach so technically tyrion could rule as lord of winterfell while roose could remain the warden of the north tyrion would enforce laws and make political decisions while roose would command the norths armies in times of war
gameofthrones,not_removed,a warden doesnt rule over anything wardens are just in charge of organizing a military defense in the event of invasion from outside the seven kingdoms
gameofthrones,not_removed,he can just change his mind and appoint a new warden absolute monarchy is well absolute
gameofthrones,not_removed,its quite explicit should sansa bear tyrion a son come spring then he will rule the north undoubtedly tywin would have named tyrion warden of the north instead having a son by stark blood helps legitimize their rule in the eyes of the northmen
gameofthrones,not_removed,he was betting that the ironborne and boltons would hack each other to pieces
gameofthrones,not_removed,not sure if you were aware but there is also rasoiaf for more bookdriven discussion
gameofthrones,not_removed,i always took it to mean the boltons were always a disposable ally to tywin as soon as a starklannister child was born hed oust them from winterfell and tyrion would be warden of the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh that makes perfect sense actually i now remember that in the first book ned and king robert argued about whether robert arryn should be warden of the east following jons death it never quite clicked with me that the lord of a realm wasnt always necessarily the warden until now so in a similar vein in clash of kings bran is acting lord of winterfell but ser rodrick is castellan of winterfell should i take that as meaning that bran was filling the shoes of lord paramount but rodrick was handling the responsibilities of warden
gameofthrones,not_removed,it does seem like the lord paramount tends to also hold the warden title in most cases tywin ned mace tyrell and jon arryn all held both titles thus my confusion the show never differentiated the titles like the books have and even then it never clicked with me that two different men could hold each title until i posted this thread
gameofthrones,not_removed,im avoiding that sub until i finish the rest of the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,there was no warden of the north then because the north had declared itself to be its own independent kingdom
gameofthrones,not_removed,their was no warden at that point theirs robb who was kitn
gameofthrones,not_removed,warden is a title used by kings landing to identify military commanders mainly for foreign wars so with ned dead and the north in rebellion there was no warden during that period until tywin named roose
gameofthrones,not_removed,there are other wardens as we well however we currently know of at least three others the wardens of the princes pass the stone way and the white knife
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats information i havent encountered yet is it in one of the later books or that world of ice and fire book that martin released a couple years ago
gameofthrones,not_removed,affc and adwd
gameofthrones,not_removed,okay now look alive people take hold up a second kit kit kit thats the part where youre supposed get up off the table damn it sigh take
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,im so glad hes still on the show seems like a good dude
gameofthrones,not_removed,how the fuck do you fall asleep during the scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,but kit thats the dream
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love kit harington but hes a little bit of a weirdo
gameofthrones,not_removed,httpvideowmagazinecomwatchkitharingtongameofthronesjonsnow
gameofthrones,not_removed,lucky he didnt get morning wood
gameofthrones,not_removed,love got and all but waking up in westeros would be something close to a nightmare at this current point in the story
gameofthrones,not_removed,the new keanu reeves
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope you rat fucks die thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,this post made this thread better
gameofthrones,not_removed,how do you gey house stark next to ur name
gameofthrones,not_removed,seems like it but seems to make bad decisions with the ladies hes given up both ygritte and dany in real life id do a lot of things to be with those two edit apparently hes back with rose thats good news i like both of them
gameofthrones,not_removed,in batman begins when christian bales bruce wayne wakes up from being gassed by scarecrow he actually did fall asleep in the scene i was meant to be waking up so i laid down and just fell asleep and i didnt hear action so michael and morgan freeman were talking and i was supposed to join in i woke up with michael caine poking me in the ribs and going look at that hes bloody fallen asleep hasnt he hes bloody fallen asleep
gameofthrones,not_removed,probably the one where he is dead and there l talking around his body
gameofthrones,not_removed,because of the nature of the scene where he could have fallen asleepthat being him dead it was quite natural that he did seeing as it takes a couple of hours to film a scene like because of the actors forgetting their lines i think if they got his expression when he woke up it would be hillarious if they released itif its not in the series
gameofthrones,not_removed,people on film set routinely wake up at the asscrack of dawn dude probably was legit tired
gameofthrones,not_removed,alternatehistorycom has a dozen fics on this notion someone from our world waking up in the body of a got character
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,edit your flair button red bit top right when your on this subreddit
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes back with rose iirc
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt he dating rose leslie
gameofthrones,not_removed,you should totally link that scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh i know what scene hes talking about i just find it hilarious that he was actually able to fall asleep on set during the filming of a scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,more to do with angles and safety takes to be honest theyll film the same scene from a minimum of three angles usually and no director would only go for one right take unless they are under ridiculously severe time pressure
gameofthrones,not_removed,testing my flair please ignore
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cant actually find that specific scene with bruce waking up
gameofthrones,not_removed,to be fair given the same situation and the knowledge that these scenes probably require multiple takes id have probably fallen asleep as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah you would think he would be cold naked on the table
gameofthrones,not_removed,true i forgot about that

gameofthrones,not_removed,i do not recall anything about the whereabouts of the hound i am not saying it is not possible but i assume the new life statement is a theory
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes yes my friend cleganebowl hints at every direction i see them too hype them all
gameofthrones,not_removed,no tyrell reeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
gameofthrones,not_removed,i still wish you could create your own collection i would totally by the pack if they had the i wanted together stark targaryen lannister and nights watch
gameofthrones,not_removed,well this post cost me dollars thanks for that jk cant wait to get my shirts thanks for sharing
gameofthrones,not_removed,dorne is backwards also are those house clegane mottos real they are cringy af
gameofthrones,not_removed,the hound never lies i dont like these
gameofthrones,not_removed,gotta catch em all i bought these last year for my summer wardrobe the cotton is very comfy the sigils are wearingfading a little but totally worth it
gameofthrones,not_removed,poor house baelish always left out
gameofthrones,not_removed,does it bother anybody else that some of these shirts have the real house words up top and some have the real house words down below
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks just got myself a house stark and house baratheon
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive got a bolton one sitting around somewhere its actually pretty good quality considering it was
gameofthrones,not_removed,house martell is backwards
gameofthrones,not_removed,id only want a white walker one my goodness i hope they win
gameofthrones,not_removed,the onceuponatee site does ondemand shirts at weheartgeekscom and that one has httpswwwweheartgeekscompagesdigitalphoenix
gameofthrones,not_removed,flair checks out
gameofthrones,not_removed,how are the sizings i want to get a few but its hard to know how theyll fit
gameofthrones,not_removed,clegane has no official motto from the books those are quotes from the hound
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah that is gonna drive me nuts and no i dont believe the cleganes words have been revealed if they even have them
gameofthrones,not_removed,house clegane should say get hype and i prefer chicken
gameofthrones,not_removed,which baratheon shirt im thinking of getting both
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wear a mens large and the sizing was perfect on the two i got a while back they were standard gildan heavy cotton shirts
gameofthrones,not_removed,fuck the city fuck the kingsguard fuck the king
gameofthrones,not_removed,httpswwwweheartgeekscomcollectionscleganebowl
gameofthrones,not_removed,i got the storms end baratheon one not the dragonstone one with stanniss sigil i never really got on board the mannis train now i kinda want to targ one too though
gameofthrones,not_removed,so theyre not sublimated graphics on soft cotton
gameofthrones,not_removed,i ended up getting two in medium im sometimes a medium and sometimes a large if their size chart is close to right medium should be right large looked like it would be huge id have gotten more but didnt want to run the chance of them not fitting
gameofthrones,not_removed,im gonna have to eat every fucking chicken in this room
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have a couple sweet cleganebowl foam fingers
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont know about the printing method used i assumed the shirts were screen printed like most shirtsold shirts whatever method was used the prints havent cracked or worn after many washings over years and yeah the tag says just gildan heavy cotton the gildan shirts havent shrunk either unlike the american apparel brand shirts i got off redbubble edit ok found the sites faq that says screen printing
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre a talker
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it makes more sense that it signifies the white walkers coming into her domain
gameofthrones,not_removed,just no
gameofthrones,not_removed,so let me get this straight cersei just blew up a bunch of tyrells who were her best chance at keeping the realm a large part because she wanted to avoid marriage to some gay person partly because she feared the manipulationschemes of their family on hers i only mention gay cause its kinda like a bonus in a marriage of convenience if you think about it hes not gonna be wanting it like robert so she could enter another marriage of convenience dont get me wrong recent trauma make such a thing possible but itd be the biggest bummer ever to kill all those people and end up having to do what you were trying to avoid in the first place also cersei has like tolerance or respect for other powers in true mad king fashion it seems what she fears she destroys every dealing with powerful institutions has ended with her failure iron bank tyrells the small council especially with regards to kevan lannister even if she had the capacity or the desire to pursue such a marriage its still a longshot for blue boy as hes presumably winning and we have no idea of the night kings ability to arrange such a match although it has happened before
gameofthrones,not_removed,no tldr for a text like this is an worship for masochism

gameofthrones,not_removed,fuckin confirmed
gameofthrones,not_removed,this guy gets it
gameofthrones,not_removed,progress
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have a feeling that tormund will be married off to get his own land for the free folk maybe to alys karstark in lieu of sigorn im so entertained by the looks he and brienne exchange with each other though
gameofthrones,not_removed,yara
gameofthrones,not_removed,emilia says her most awkward scene she had to ever shoot was the lesbian scene in doubt shed do it with yaras actress unless it was reeeallly needed
gameofthrones,not_removed,its really needed
gameofthrones,not_removed,i concur
gameofthrones,not_removed,wasnt that one of the reasons he was able to become the new king im pretty sure he was wellaware
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is known
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank the gods for rhaelle targaryen and her titsi
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats why he could usurp the throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,food isnt likely to be an issue at all because the tyrells are on danys side bringing with them the reach the largest food producer in the seven kingdoms there is something unifying danys armies a shared hatred of the lannisters about the only ones that dont are the dothraki and the unsullied and they are unwaveringly loyal to dany winter has come but it will still be quite awhile before we are likely to see snow in the south giving at least some time to prepare winter clothing for the dothraki and the unsullied
gameofthrones,not_removed,with the impending winter supposed to be the coldest food will be an issue especially because kings landing is separated from the reach and supplies would have to go through lannisters territory first the dothraki and unsullied are the main body of her army you do realize you just said danys army are unified by hatred of the lannisters except the main part of her army plus the grey joys just want their kingdom back from euron not to mention even the martells and tyrells come from very different cultures
gameofthrones,not_removed,dany has more than enough soldiers to secure supply lines between the reach and kings landing i doubt that the unsullied and dothraki are the majority of her army anymore the tyrells have the largest army in westeros and dorne has complete set out the conflicts so far both have massive numbers of troops to send her way the greyjoys are not an issue because they wont be fighting beside the rest of the army theyll be at sea because they are sailors not soldiers and as i said even if they unsullied and dothraki dont have the unity brought on by lannister hatred they are still loyal to dany completely and will do whatever she says
gameofthrones,not_removed,the dothraki number between the tyrells are about and i doubt they commited their entire force to dany even if they did the the dothraki still make up the bulk of her force dorne only has about why do you think doran was so hesitant to go to war dorne are famous for exaggerating numbers dorne may have even less as they left a large amount of men in roberts rebellion granted it was a while ago but they have had no reason to rearm in addition they did literally just go through a coup there is no reason for them to send the full force for all we know dorne may not even be stable in its current state and will have to leave behind a fair amount of men to garrison its territory they still arent fighting for the same reason not to mention the tyrells martells unsullied and dothraki all have seperate commanders and different bodys of her army are loyal to different leaders dany doesnt command the tyrells or martells they are more of a coalition which makes it even less united
gameofthrones,not_removed,where do you get the number on the dothraki i dont know if it was ever confirmed but i dont think there were than many at vaes dothrak and even if they are they arent all soldiers that includes women slaves old peopleetc
gameofthrones,not_removed,im pretty sure she says in the show in one of the later episodes i could be wrong but still the tyrells dont make up the bulk of her force they may have the most men but they dont have the ships to transport their full force up the channel as dany is landing by sea hence most of tyrells forces are probably still in the reach they could attack from the reach into the westerlands and do a two pronged attacked on cersei that is another possibility
gameofthrones,not_removed,we dont know that dany wont be landing in the south first there is nothing that garuntees she will head straight to kings landing in fact i think she wont the dothraki will likely need some time to recover from the sea voyage before they are ready to fight i think she will land in the south and march to kings landing after all tyrion will have warned her about what he did to stanniss ships in blackwater bay and he would probably think that cersei would attempt the same trick again
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats true it would be kinda weird to just head straight for the capital good point with tyrion we know that cersei wasted all the wildfire they dont know that though the ending shot of shows the tyrell martells and danys force meeting up at the head of the channel between essos and westeros perhaps they will land somewhere south of kings landing maybe in the storm lands
gameofthrones,not_removed,im pretty sure that shot is just after theyve lest slavers bay the sun is rising directly behind them meaning they must be headed pretty much due west the tyrells and dorne probably provided more ships to help ferry danys army explaining why there are tyrell and dorne ships in the fleet
gameofthrones,not_removed,im pretty sure dany confirmed she had enough ships in the latter episodes from the greyjoys alone the tyrells and martell were just allies plus it explains the varys seeming teleport rather he simply went to negotiate with the reach and dorne and then met up with dany at the head of the channel it makes more sense than the tyrells and martells going all the way over to slavers bay just to pick up dany that would be several months between the beginning of episode and the end i know got has inconsistent timelines but that seems way off
gameofthrones,not_removed,the journey from westeros to mereen takes weeks not months tyrion said that they had enough ships but just barely thats not really a good position to be in because it means you have to load your ships to absolutely max capacity there is also the issue of the sun the sun behind them makes more sense if they are sailing west rather than north additionally the tyrell dorne and targaryen ships are all mixed together in the fleet meaning they must have been one giant fleet that started out together if they were fleets that had just met each other they would still be segregated
gameofthrones,not_removed,still weeks between the beginning and end of an episode doesnt make too much sense they arent attacking directly from land and their only seaborne competition is all the way at pyke still being built so i dont see the issue with max capacity not to mention she made a last minute call not to bring the second sons perhaps that frees up some space though i know they were never numerous perhaps they met somewhere close to the channel still sailing west but also at the head of the channel and your last point just seems to be a plot error though a really small one
gameofthrones,not_removed,there are other dangers at sea beyond just enemy ships there are storms waves disease etc
gameofthrones,not_removed,of course but i dont see how a max capacity ship will be affected by that
gameofthrones,not_removed,a ship that is overcrowded is more susceptible to disease spreading amongst crew and passengers an overloaded ship is more likely to go over in a storm or wave due to it carrying more weight than it can safely handle additionally if one of those ships does go down she loses a larger chunk of her army
gameofthrones,not_removed,aye got it
gameofthrones,not_removed,passed away so it is unlikely that they will recast
gameofthrones,not_removed,no because the actress who played old nan passed away the creators of the show retired the old nan character so it is assumed she passed away peacefully between season and in the books old nan was last seen at the dreadfort so not such a peaceful ending for her there also old nan has told her stories to bran and that is what she needed to do so there would be no place for her in the story now
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt it implied that she died when the kingsguard came for sansa
gameofthrones,not_removed,they have recast a ton of characters beric the mountain tommen to name a few
gameofthrones,not_removed,you might be mistaking her for septa mordane but yes septa mordanes head is mounted along with neds
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes but those characters played vital roles in the story and were recast due to wanting a different actor not because the original actor died old nan hasnt appeared in the books since winterfell was sacked so its unlikely that she survived anyway
gameofthrones,not_removed,then yes thats who i was thinking of
gameofthrones,not_removed,also one can assume its due to contract negotiations or conflicting schedules that they recast when one of the actors got cancer they retired his character i think seems like precedent to me
gameofthrones,not_removed,lbs thats crazy how long did it take to make
gameofthrones,not_removed,lbs dayum what flavor was the cake would be cool if the inside was red to look like blood
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion could sit on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow any pictures of it cut open
gameofthrones,not_removed,you werent supposed to use actual swords
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow can you make a cake for my next birthday😇
gameofthrones,not_removed,very nice
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,it has plastic dowels and a board obviously to hold each layer of cake so it didnt sink into each other it had rice crispy treats to hold up the sides and mold the hitter laters it has fondant which covers the cake and then layered with more fondant for the swords and then gun paste for the swords that were sticking out and the handles so yes the cake was it was a golden cake with red icing
gameofthrones,not_removed,years
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is not
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a golden cake with red buttercream 🙂
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,have you counted of course you have the lysa arryn of cakes shame that you had to settle for your second choice
gameofthrones,not_removed,really guys dont get me wrong the cake is awesome i love cake cake is terrific i just wanted to point out that it is not anyone should be able to see this given the lightweight nature of cakes and its perceived size regardless i will not delete my comment i love my comment my comment is terrific i hate all of you
gameofthrones,not_removed,just seems strange the dude would lie about a cake

gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah im really excited for his future he has the potential to be a huge threat to dany valyrian steel armor a master of sea combat plus the warlocks hatred for her never had a conclusion and he can hopefully harness their power in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,i bet he does have it why even put him in this show so late if he wasnt going to make some huge impact
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres no proof of any of that being in the show unfortunately and i dont think they have much time to introduce all of that but who knows i sure as hell hope they do of course
gameofthrones,not_removed,why put dorne inthey butchered that plot linei mean why kill doran off for doing nothing then do nothing lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,im so with you on that but i think they had to stay relatively close to the books still at that point as they had not surpassed it imo the show is better than the book the books got messy and there were too many open and incomplete plotlines and grrm got bored and added new characters and made some things irrelevant to the point now he doesnt know how to finish the show can now deviate and anything that wasnt actually important in the books was really cleaned up last season it was like oh the reason we had to do all this with dorne was so that danys fleet could land here when she came to westeros lets get these characters out of here arianne doran areo myrcella trystane darkstarr grrm wasted our time dd is not doing that everyone in the show now is important i love that
gameofthrones,not_removed,are arianne and darkstar the two people you mentioned who arent in the show dead in the books or something how do you know their plotlines are done if not
gameofthrones,not_removed,because if they were relevant the show would have put them inas to effect the endgame prince doran has children in the books the oldest a daughter then a middle son quentyn and a youngest son trystayne doran had some supposedly elaborate mega plot to get his children and the targs back in power he had a deal to make arianne marry viserys and get him back on the iron throne when viserys died he had the great idea to make quentyn marry dany well ol quentyn thought he could ride a dragon and the dragon thought otherwise and killed him so grrm wasted our time there although some believe that he is referenced in danys prophecy when the sun rises in the west and sets in the eastsunson house martells sigil is a sun he comes from westeros and dies in the east then doran decides arianne needs to marry a new targ because out of the woodowork rhaegars son aegon shows up it is mostly likely some blackfyre pretender but hes not in the show either so why do we care about all these dornish empty plot lineswe dont so the show at the beginning of season kills of doran and tyrstayne and basically are like yeah at the end the main thing dorne ends up providing is a place for dany to enter the seven kingdoms lets have ellaria do that for us and boom here we are on the show saved us a ton of time and effort i do think ellaria is sort of combined with arianne because ellaria and arianne are both kinda defiant of doran
gameofthrones,not_removed,first just because a character exists in the book and not in the show that doesnt make them unimportant or irrelevant second grrm killing off characters and in turn ending or diverting plotlines to another direction isnt wasting our time at all
gameofthrones,not_removed,george isnt doing that he isnt doing anything at all actually the show delivers the show is getting us to the end by cutting the fat it is a better story because of it i dont see faegon or the dorne plot as anythign more than geroge being bored with his characters and making new stuff up just only to be so lost that he cant complete his books
gameofthrones,not_removed,because you know what goes on in his head right sure the show cuts the fat but whilst cutting the fat huge chunks of meat also get cut out dont act like the show is the perfect rendition of the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,did you read the books from your first comment it seemed like you did not it is not the perfect rendition of the books it is a concise story that delivers and that is what i like
gameofthrones,not_removed,no i havent but i knoe a lot about the books from reading the wikis and forums and whatnot but thats besides the point there are tons of characters and sub plots that are exclusively in the books that would have been awesome in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol ok man let me explain why i feel that this way it is brutal to be a book reader grrm is great at world building and i loved having insights to all these characters and little tiny things we didnt get to see in the show but grrm isnt great on wrapping things up on getting to the endgame i am super thankful however that he shared the end with the showrunners and that the show is delivering us the conclusion to the story that grrm started for us last word from me on this read the books i read every one of them including de and awoif youll learn a great amount that the even the forums dont tell you youre right some characters are awesome but some are not i would have died to see ashara dayne in the show but i am so thankful the show saved us from the faegon plot i get that we are missing book pieces that are cool but the part of the books we are most certainly missing is the end the show will get us there i do not have faith grrm will
gameofthrones,not_removed,whats so funny just because i havent read the books doesnt mean i dont know what happens in them in great detail or that i dont have a valid opinion on this topic how can you say george isnt good at wrapping things up how can you say hes not good at getting us to the end game there are two books left for all you know the story will end with no loose ends i dont feel as if ending a story with vital questions left unanswered is georges style hes done nothing for us to assume otherwise also youre literally the only person ive seen say that the show is better than the books as far as charactersplot lines are concerned the show has left out a lot of fluff from the books sure i agree with you there but theyve also left out a lot of awesome charactersevents that are crucial to the telling of the story all in all yes we are missing the end of the storybecause it hasnt even been written yet i dont see how that is something to chastise someone over also thanks for keeping this argument civil besides the whole laughing at me part haha
gameofthrones,not_removed,sorry if i hurt your feelings that was not my intent i just cant see you getting the information you need to make that assertion from reading forums not knowing about ariannes current status in your first comment let me know you did not know the depth of the books in great detail as you might think ive been reading these books for quite some time i came from twot by robert jordan a similar epic series i had a ton of frustrations with that series i suppose because those books were left incomplete until a ghost writer recently finished them based on some notes that were found so as far as grrm delivering i have concerns as do a ton of other book readers let me start by saying the first books were fire they were great and they came out basically every two years then affc came out years laterthen adwd came out six years after that it will be another six before the next book comes out maybe if you ask most book readers i would say a great many would agree that the last two books werent as good as the first he split the two books up based on geography of characters and its been slow to make things come full circle the next two books wow and ados based on the world building and characters he has done will have to really start to wrap things up grrm has said the end is the same but how we might get there might be slightly different if in the books jon is the final king then jon will be the final king in the show but maybe mel doesnt bring him back to life he has room to do his own thing but largely the main points will be the same as he has shared the important stuff with the show writers so in regards to this grrm style of not finishing upheres the thinghes not delivering hes sorry about it but he cant deliver wow to save his life at best hes distracted or bored at worse he doesnt know how to close his plot lines and bring it together if he brings me two bangin books in and then again in or so that feature some cool backstories with ashara dayne and doran martell and some dodgy maesters in the citadel that are never even seen on the show and a septa that tyrion goes down a river with that maybe had a baby but oh my god its actually lyanna stark then yeah i will totally recant all my statements about grrm literally breaking my heart by not giving me closure on his epic series and trolling me with characters that never matter but i just dont see him finishing these books in any reasonable amount of time based on his pace and i dont see him getting the plot lines totally reconciled based on how relative to the first books lackluster the last two books were lastly again i think you should read the books to be so adamant in your argument that the books are better than the show when you havent read the books i can send them to you if like but if youre into at all you gotta read these books
gameofthrones,not_removed,what do you mean hes not delivering hes writing a book its not like hes supposed to be releasing a chapter a week and failing to do so hell deliver hes not gonna just stop writing the books my friend he also not gonna end a series with a ton of loose ends thats not his style im not sure how you can use his past books as proof hell do that when all of those books are part of the whole story so of course hes gonna leave crucial questions unanswered in those books it builds suspense also the quality of a previous book isnt proof hes not going to get the plot lines wrapped up youre equating two irrelevant things id love to read the books however im broke as hell and dont have a computer so i cant get em online i tried to listen to them on youtube using my phone but im not a fan of audiobooks i just cant focus on em plus its just not the same i readextremely fast and i would way rather read at my own pace

gameofthrones,not_removed,there isnt anything in that video that we havent seen before it may as well be called a recap
gameofthrones,not_removed,at least put fan made in the title
gameofthrones,not_removed,brilliant love the edit to wildfire
gameofthrones,not_removed,this reminds me of the fire lords throne room from avatar where most fire lords have the redorange wall of fire but azula gets blue fire the blue fire made her look even more sickly and insane and the green wildfire kind of does the same for cersei here
gameofthrones,not_removed,so whats different here
gameofthrones,not_removed,this would have been so epic
gameofthrones,not_removed,im picturing cersei about to drop a lion king musical on these unsuspecting guests
gameofthrones,not_removed,so fallout
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is better
gameofthrones,not_removed,weird how much better that looks
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats what jaime was thinking too
gameofthrones,not_removed,this gets me thinking what if cersei bites it not from dany but from the smallfolk if it ever came out in such a way that cerseis guilt in the matter of the sept of baelor was known beyond the shadow of a doubt im aware many must suspect her already shed get ripped apart faster than immortan joe at the end of mad max fury road
gameofthrones,not_removed,great now it looks more romulan
gameofthrones,not_removed,ah the matrix filter very nice
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats a bit wild dont you think
gameofthrones,not_removed,exactly what i was imagining
gameofthrones,not_removed,the fire lighting up the room has been changed to wildfire to remark cerseis madness
gameofthrones,not_removed,wildfire in all the braziers
gameofthrones,not_removed,or let it go
gameofthrones,not_removed,in a way it would have been very on the nose which is why im not mad they didnt go with it plenty of time to have her start doing it next season as we build up to kings landingkebab
gameofthrones,not_removed,except she has to be killed by her little brother
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks colorblindness is a pain
gameofthrones,not_removed,why let it go
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh no that scene with the barrels mustve looked weird ive always wondered what you saw instead of the green is it just gray or something sorry for prying just curious
gameofthrones,not_removed,link to the video
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not colorblind but one common form is redgreen colorblindness in which red and green look like the same color
gameofthrones,not_removed,but which colour do they both look like is it one or the other or something different thanks for the response though
gameofthrones,not_removed,for most its just slight colorblindness which means that the variations between shades can be hard to distinguish and colorbased information is processed more slowly or not at all if attention is absent eg i frequently mistake blue for purple or dark red for black or darker yellow with green the wildfire itself tho just looks green but at a quick glance i couldnt tell the difference between it and fire until its pointed out and the shading too
gameofthrones,not_removed,hahaha i decided to watch the show because i saw richard madden was in it not a bad first season although i have to admit as much as i like dustin hoffman his his accent was a bit much its nice to see actors getting to work on different projects together very amusing to see david bradley and madden reunited under more favorable wedding circumstances
gameofthrones,not_removed,no tongue
gameofthrones,not_removed,ha ha ha atlast together
gameofthrones,not_removed,he got rob stark to marry his daughter
gameofthrones,not_removed,that clip is from the show medici masters of florence where richard maddens robb character marries david bradleys walder frey daughter he was making a joke
gameofthrones,not_removed,settle in reality the freys could only have dreamed of marrying one of their liege lords the tullys they should have been happy with it
gameofthrones,not_removed,that harrenhal recruiter
gameofthrones,not_removed,at one point serving in the knights watch was an honor and a sign of selfless devotion to duty with knights and noblemen taking the black voluntarily the starks also have a long tradition of serving plus ned was the lord of winterfell and had heirs or bran went back in time and told him to do it
gameofthrones,not_removed,by all accounts it was a random decision he made shortly after roberts rebellion however there is a theory doing the rounds that it had something to do with bran as it seems everything that occurred in the shows past now does
gameofthrones,not_removed,once robb was born he was out of the line of succession for winterfell its pretty much the same reason jon joins he has nothing else to do its pretty common for secondthird sons to take the blackjoin the citadelgo sailing around the worldjoin a sellsword company
gameofthrones,not_removed,yoren
gameofthrones,not_removed,an unknown recruiter he met before the rebellion then when ned comes home after the war with baby robb benjen goes off to the watch
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think its really something as simple as this winter is here the end
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei vapes confirmed
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have a tin foil hat theory cersei will align with the night king become his night queen and theyll rampage the world together we know the night king can be bargained with if it suits his needs akaletting craster live to provide male children
gameofthrones,not_removed,shes just a cold hearted bitch so cold that shes basically a white walker already
gameofthrones,not_removed,like i said earlier
gameofthrones,not_removed,she makes a deal with the white wlakers she might not be this stupid but if she thinks this is the way for her to stay in power she might do it they seem like an unstoppable force to me what does cersei have to offer to the ww
gameofthrones,not_removed,what if cersei is a white walker and always has been
gameofthrones,not_removed,vapenation
gameofthrones,not_removed,for me it confirms two things winter has came there is another powerful force at play which most do not see the ww they are coming for you if you dont believe in them or not
gameofthrones,not_removed,she might go full wight by the end but i also like to think its a subtle hint she is part dragon mad kings daughter
gameofthrones,not_removed,its been almost a year you have to bear with us
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree with you i think it is a sign that winter is finally upon them and it is literally just getting cold in kings landing
gameofthrones,not_removed,it also foreshadows an ice dragon
gameofthrones,not_removed,that means she went six seasons without mentioning it is that really possible
gameofthrones,not_removed,and from this day forth the seven kingdoms shall be known as the vape naysh yall
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah that would be really cooland scary
gameofthrones,not_removed,hello three months later this thought hit me yesterday and i cant see any reason why it wont happen cersei is evil as fuck and will do whatever she can to survive if she sees the whitewalkers sweeping across westeros i could see her making a deal in the latest episode she stated that she needs an ally the night king poses the perfect one for her needs
gameofthrones,not_removed,i doubt the night king is in the business of making allies and cersei doesnt want to rampage the world and kill people just because she has nothing to lose she will do cruel things if they serve her best interests but that does not
gameofthrones,not_removed,then continue the show but repeat the process cersis husband dies she steals the throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,what if she is john snow in disguise
gameofthrones,not_removed,okay okay what it means is that shes really the mad kings daughter she and the white walkers hook up and turn dannys dragons into ice dragons and they freeze everyone then the nights king offs her and he lives happy ever after
gameofthrones,not_removed,you are making me guess myself now 🤔
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah cersei really has nothing to loseand she hates everyone anyway it would also tie into that prophecy about her pale white throat being strangled again just a tin foil theorybut id love to see cersei as a white walker queen
gameofthrones,not_removed,yep cersei is full blown evil now she will do anything now its a theory id love to see happen edit i can picture her rounding up her subjects in the city to protect them but in reality shes putting them all in one place for the night king to murder and add to his army there was some possible foreshadowing going on when euron was approaching kings landing she said something like hes looking for a queen you know cersei will never marry him but she would totally marry the night king
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like where you took this although i would add that gentry will probably surf his rowboat down a crashing ice tsunami that will destroy kings landing and he will land at his rightful place on the iron throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,which would in turn motivate both of her brothers to kill her aka the maggis prophecy
gameofthrones,not_removed,well her poonaynay froze over so it would only take the night king to pleasure her now anyway
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes this is great but i cant have the nights king kill her off until she claims gendry as she and roberts son thus making him targ and baratheon
gameofthrones,not_removed,yep i meantheres many reasons why her siblings would want to kill her but i enjoy my theory about her being a white walker my boyfriend was joking that this confirms jamie will get a valyrian steel hand as well to finish off cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,cold poozy
gameofthrones,not_removed,knows that varys tried to have her assassinated i think thats water under the bridge at this time finding out that myrcella was killed by the sand snakes is very interesting im sure he will not take this lightly dany finding out they killed a child due to political drama might be a bit interesting as well when her dragons killed a child they got locked up not to mention her niece and nephew were killed because of politics as well so im sure this wont sit well with her not sure tyrion really cares about joffreys death at this point i also dont believe that olenna intentionally tried to pin this on tyrion its kinda just how it played out due to joffrey being a miserable fuck and forcing tyrion to serve him wine beef between the dornish and the tyrells is something that can be easily put to the side i think ironborn have finally started to realize that their way of life isnt a productive one that became clear at the kings moot the option of being made independent is going to be appealing to them and would in turn be enough of an incentive to stop their bullshit i wouldnt expect this to be a happily ever after situation so im sure there will be drama but at the end of the day theyll be able to accomplish their mission and come to terms with what the future will become
gameofthrones,not_removed,can these characters really stay united against cersei the enemy of my enemy is my friend also i believe youre giving the showrunners far too much credit at this point tyrion doesnt know about myrcella and olenna can blame petyrsansa for jofferys murder the hostility between the tyrells and martells isnt touched on in the show the only issue i see there being is between dany and varys but tyrion trusts varys and that seemed to have been enough for her already
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was said that varys likely saved danys life he used jorah because he needed a spy and jorah was a good fit for the job in season we see that varys is speaking to ilyrio about restoring the crown to the targs so that was his plan from the start the only thing that doesnt make sense is the wine seller assassination attempt perhaps varys had doubts about danys potential at that point or someone else ordered the attempt
gameofthrones,not_removed,she has some betrayals left in that prophecy right one for life and one for death and one for love kinda vague go figure
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes the team will fall apart but then dany will fly in on a dragon give a big speech and then everything will be ok
gameofthrones,not_removed,david and dan recently talked about how danys army was so powerful so what could go wrong this means it absolutely will go wrong grrm has also compared dany unfavorably to george bush and his invasion of iraq the alliance angle could be one component cant see the sand snakes being long term allies i suspect the dothraki will be the main reason things fall apart they dont have experience fighting armor taking castles and are too dependent on their horses who will not have areas to graze with winter coming the dothraki themselves do not appear to have warm weather clothing which doesnt bode well then on top of this they are known for raping and pillaging which will easily cause enemies i suspect the dothraki are going to have a rough time and a charasmitic leader will splinter off forces to oppose dany while blaming her for dragging them across the sea but ultimately i do think dany takes kings landing quickly because the show is investing in the dragonpit just think things will go downhill after that
gameofthrones,not_removed,indefinitely certainly not but long enough to take down the kingdom i think so the houses she has on her side are certainly petty but theyve all had greater losses at the hands of cersei and the lannisters than each other so im fairly confident that itll work out just long enough to see some fruit of their labors it will probably not last very long though
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really hope so if only because things seem too easy for her as is the lannisters were devastated by the war of the five kings losing tens of thousands in the field while their coffers were bankrupted and the tyrells have over a hundred thousand men i think the dothraki have similar numbers and the dornish supply far less than the postulated but still a significant number of troops then she has the unsullied and a significant number of ironborn most importantly she has large dragons that she can now control i simply do not see how she can face any meaningful opposition unless she has to deal with infightingan inability to control one or more of her fighting forces or cersei detonates kings landing with a large part of danys forces inside which i see as very unlikely
gameofthrones,not_removed,just wait until the dothraki go up against the wrights and get their asses kicked thats when the shit is really going to hit the fan
gameofthrones,not_removed,nope that shits fire
gameofthrones,not_removed,if there is one thing that can unite them all it is hatred for cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion and elaria will probably get along when she realizes how much he hates cersei and that oberyn fought for him and was able to avenge elia
gameofthrones,not_removed,the sand snakes hated tywin lannister tyrion having killed tywin will likely be fine olenna didnt pin joffreys murder on tyrion cersei did olenna just kinda went along with it all the rest is probably just bygones being bygones in order to crush cersei and euron
gameofthrones,not_removed,they will turn against each other if dnd think thats what will please us most if they dont think so they will stick together because in the books characters act like people and their own person whereas on the show people behave as required to reach an end dnd decide on necessary evil
gameofthrones,not_removed,we are left to wonder because the motivations are not that clear for all the players in dany´s army insullied varys and tyrion will follow dany no matter what in spite of her family history with the lannisters she was able to see tyrion for what he is all tyrionever wanted was to be a player by his own merits and to have people like him for what he is varys has waited long enough and invested too much energy on dany to just turn on her now the insullied under grey worm are as loyal as one could be lady olenna cersei could try to outplay her by naming one of the rival reach families warden of the south right how loyal are those houses to the tyrell name they simplified this plot in the show but olenna simply has no other option to fight cersei now how weak is cersei really technically jaime is now lord of casterly rock i am not sure he will turn against cersei from the get go maybe he will simply move out of her sphere of influence i guess he will feel lost for a couple of episodes but cersei has just the crownlands for sure westerlands perhaps riverlands in name only cause walder frey is dead he has sons to inherit but i doubt his army and his heir will be very useful at this point cersei is isolated but not weak euron and littlefinger could be useful she has fucking quburn and wildfire she has no scrupples which is a huge advantagemy guess is that her strategy is really to stay at kl and defend it or destroy it at any costs she will want to buy time as she has no money left to buy an army so she will not be attacking dany or jon snow for that matter the only thing she can do military is to have euron attack dany´s fleet when on the move and try to pull a wildfire stunt again dorne is also fighting for survival and revenge as with lady olenna they simply have no other option than to fight alongside dany because jon snow is up in the north not giving a fuck about iron throne and cersei is basically kl mayor at this point tyrion might get pissed about myrcella but i think ellaria will also remind him and dany that lannister men brutally killed a child and a baby and that tywin lannister did not serve them justice when that was all they wanted so killing myrcella was bad but what is done is done move on lady olenna said if she falls so it will littlefinger everybody forgets she can also like elaria simply admit it to tyrion and remind him that was his own father that judged him guilty and would be ready to execute him and that she was not alone littlefinger got the poison after all lady olenna can also tell to the world now and own it i helped get that depraved little shit killed because i was defending my family because i could not let margeary marry that awfull prick the ironborn are also very divided now so i am not sure if dany´s rules will affect their cause now she is to give them independence and is not like they can offer her much more than their ships she has dragons to make them realize the deal is as sweet as it gets she just mentioned the seven kingdons she did not mention they could not go to the stepstones or essos who knows she can also offer them part of the greenland that was them long time ago uncle euron might stir things up and this spells trouble more for yara than for dany yara betraying dany i cannot see that but it is possible but how betraying dany to go against her on suicide mission yara has no other option toowhat cersei could dooffer to her euron most likely will play cersei but even if he does not cersei is simply the mayor of kl yara and the ironborn also suffers from a simply no other option disease and are thus loyal to dany for now dothraki they followed dany because of the miracle of her surviving we can say they have simply no business going and staying in westeros they are not used to fighting an organized war but again they have that prophesies about mounting the world the way i see it is that they go there they suffer a lot under those constraints weather warfare then they go back to essos and do what they always dreamed conquer qarth and break those walls almost like they are the wildlings that is the only thing they can get out of this situation but for dany having the dotharki long term might be problematic i agree but not if she just uses them to win most of the country which is wlaht she needs an army for after all if she wants to solidify her position she has to ally herself to the powerful of westeros and this she can only do through marriage like robert did war on the targaryens with a huge combined army then the lannister marriage allaince to stay on the iron throne in short the division within her team are obvious but for most part do not present a great danger to her conquest if she is wise enough to balance the tensions and keep the goal in mind her real problem is the only one she thinks she has it covered she thinks the smallfolk will be at her side and that she can easily find new allies through allaincemarriage tyrion is skeptical of her breaking the wheel but this might be what she has to do in order to conquer
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think team dany will fracture because of rivalrieswith her advisors it will fracture because dany has two enemies working together the dorne and the reach with mace tyrell dead and oleanna being borne a redwynei can see randyl tarly betraying them in exchange for cersei making the tarlys the heirs to highgarden
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope so otherwise it will be quite boring when they steamroll westeros without much of a fight
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was robert who tried to get dany assassinated varys was just following orders tyrion loved myrcella he may want revenge but he wont show his hand for sure tyrion doesnt know that olenna poisoned joff and if he did it could be played off as if it was pinned on him accidentally the dornish and tyrells cannot stand up against danys army and they want to be on the right side winning side when all is over ironborn wont stop raiding will def cause trouble the tldr is that dany is going to be the new queen and people will want to be on her side instead of the lannister side
gameofthrones,not_removed,to add to the iron born bit itll be just as difficult telling the dothraki they cant rape and pillage some people are saying that they now see dany as some sort of a god and will do whatever she says but im not buying after some time of seeing all the rich vulnerable lands they dothraki are gonna get fed up
gameofthrones,not_removed,its dd man i lost all hope in a complex multilayered plot at this point i think its pretty straight forward theyll all be united against cercei and might lose a bit of their army to euron for some reason although he clearly wants to marry dany but i can see dd just skipping that detail for spectacle i think youre giving dd too much credit at this point now realistically i think that group can never stay united i wouldnt be surprised at all if betrayals happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,theyll probably stay together at least up until cersei is dethroned and someone new takes the iron throne dany knows varys has tried but since hes stopped she has probably forgiven it or at least doesnt care anymore for the sand snakes its probably well known throughout the kingdoms that tyrion killed tywin and is accused of killing joffrey and so he had to flee from his name so they probably wont see him as an actual lannister anymore no one knows who actually killed joffrey and i highly doubt olenna is going to be like btw i caused your exile by pinning joffreys death on you when she clearly knows hes a good ally to have being the hand of the future queen in the show the bad blood between the dornish and tyrells was touched on when they first met but with a common cause in beating cersei they could learn to at least be on friendly terms im actually curious about both the ironborn and the dothraki i mean sure dany walked out of a burning fire and has dragons to intimidate but can we really expect the ironborn and dothraki to just stop being pillaging raiding and raping cultures just because she wills it i feel like this is either gonna be ignored or its gonna be a bigger issue in the coming seasons for the moment however cersei is definitely hated enough by most of them to warrant a solid alliance the only people who dont hate her are the ironborn but they need dany to take back the iron islands from euron
gameofthrones,not_removed,against cersei definitely i guess there will be some twist between dornethe tyrells and the ironbornashatheon but dany will end it pretty fast there is no major aggression between any of danys allies expect if the sandsnakes decide to be cunts again
gameofthrones,not_removed,oberyn gave his life fighting for tyrion in a trial by combat the sandsnakes shouldnt hate tyrion that badly especially when they learn that he killed tywin the dornish are targ loyalists varys is a targ loyalist theon and yara have no where else to go and so are dany loyalists the only thing that is going to stop dany is an outside forceeuron or the whitewalkers or euron teamed up with the white walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,daenerys knows that varys likely kept her alive the tyrells and dornish were allies under the targaryens before their armies fought side by side at the battle of the trident the ironborn might be a problem later on but they already had their reaving put to a stop by king robert they might complain about it in a generation or so but it looks like ashayara will keep to her word unlike balon tyrion might not have heard about myrcella yet and i can see that being a problem but hed probably accept it and move on given that he hates cersei more likewise almost nobody knows who framed him for joffrey and unless olenna tells him he doesnt know
gameofthrones,not_removed,as i posted previously in another thread i am absolutely certain that team dany will fall apart im just convinced it will do so after the second sack of kings landing short version cersei demands trial by combat mountain kills greyworm and than either dany has killed cersei anyway which could drive tyrion and possibly yaratheon away to team snow or she decides to follow the rules and set cersei free which leads to the revenge driven dornishtyrells and possibly the unsulliedmissandei away from her maybe to euron
gameofthrones,not_removed,not much of her dothraki will make it imo she doesnt have that much ironborn the dornish will become an afterthought now and olenna will probably die soon
gameofthrones,not_removed,all characters ive read the books and watched the seasons many times like many of you last season was a complete anomaly whether or not that is because of grrms dragging feet on winds of winter is another topic completely my point is the show will return to darkness the fans were given a reprieve from all the hope dashing during season butwhat made this series so popular was the fact that no one is safe no hero is out of reach from the many face god s there is no way aryas part in becoming a faceless man for the better part of seasons was a waste she must have a major role go back to the origins of grrms first book and why to was rewritten it was a story of different characters jon arya tryon dany and bran the rest are cannon white walker fodder team dany i bring all this up to say no danys team will not be broken before she gets to kings landing the team will suffer loses thoughim sure at the hands of euron euron his character in the show is far inferior to his legend in the books b if he actually did find dragon binder the show may take a sharp left turn causing her to marry euron i hope not because you knowwe havent seen enough abusive mad men in power yetif she is able to resist or he doesnt have dragon binder she will lose a chunk of her fleet to his superior sailing abilities which have been curiously neglected on the show tarly i also agree that the tarlys werent introduced simply to display randall s is an asshole to sam with all the talk of his ability as a military commander and the might of the reach i think the tarlys will play a major role next season sand snakes ugh justgoaway olenna becomes the tywin of team dany she has the cash and resources needed to back the team dothraki ironborn i agreetheir raping and pillaging will be a major issue this could be the tipping point where dany becomes the villain in order to gain the iron throne s dd have made her into an antihero if you look at what shes done to the places shes been in she overthrew multiple established governments threw flowing economies into chaos and killed many tribal leadersjust an outside the bottle perspective cersei headed for a very bad death there is no way the mountain can save her he has been built up as invulnerable for way too long in this series and as stated above no one is beyond the reach of the many faced god s i think arya will have a hand in cerseis downfall heck she may even kill them both herself edited for spoilers and spelling
gameofthrones,not_removed,the enemy of my enemy is my friend seems to be this groups mo if i do recall there was no love lost between all the factions that united against the mad king but unite they did everyone in that group hates cersei for one reason or another and are united against her they may fall apart at the end which may be the bittersweet ending grrm promised us
gameofthrones,not_removed,you forgot to mention the dothraki horde is a dothraki horde other than that yeah spoton im going in expecting that pretty much everything that can go wrong with danys alliance will go wrong
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think olenna set up at least sansa possibly tyrion as well as a patsy the poison was obviously poison on the show and otherwise why smuggle it in on sansas hairnet
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think olennas plan was make oberyn culprit but joffrey was dick and tyrion was just unlucky
gameofthrones,not_removed,also varys is the one who went to dorne and got the dornishtyrells as allies the two most strongest houses right now in westerosi that surely buys alot of good will
gameofthrones,not_removed,b in the books varys and illyrio are backing a better claimant one which they have raised themselves dd may have not decided to scrap him yet here
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive wondered this myself why would you send someone to kill her if you want her on the throne maybe he actually wanted viserys at first and didnt mind losing dany or maybe he just gambled
gameofthrones,not_removed,varys couldnt fuck it up or robert would at best have him removed from the council and at worst banished from the capital or murdered robert hated the targaryens enough to kill a couple of teenagers across the sea who at the time didnt really pose a credible threat so if varys showed any leniency hes not only giving away his sympathies but also disobeying his king
gameofthrones,not_removed,at this point i want at least one sand snake to die painfully and the rest gone somehow
gameofthrones,not_removed,whoa that guy that arya with varys saw while chasing the cat was ilyrio and i always thought that the wine seller was part of when robert ordered her dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,one for blood one for gold one for love for blood it was the maegi
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would say that both team dany and team jon have cracks in them
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dunno they seem good at cqc
gameofthrones,not_removed,the sand snakes hated tywin lannister tyrion having killed tywin will likely be fine maybe from the sand snakes end but tyrions not going to let myrcellas murder lie once he finds out about it olenna didnt pin joffreys murder on tyrion cersei did olenna just kinda went along with it true and i suspect of all the potential fracture points in danys alliance this one tyrion likely would forgive framing tyrion was an unexpected consequence not a design on olennas part and olenna certainly wasnt going to pipe up to save him all the rest is probably just bygones being bygones in order to crush cersei and euron ehnnn im still pretty sure myrcellas death will not just be bygones being bygones ifwhen tyrion finds out about it
gameofthrones,not_removed,and what will randyll tarly do try to fight the dragons queen cersei is as good as dead the only impact she can have is if she still has wildfyre and chooses to burn the city
gameofthrones,not_removed,remember that danearys made all of the dothraki horde blood riders that doesnt necessarily mean that they will not rape and pillage but it will mean that they will face certain death if they are found to be disgracing their khaleesis orders if those orders are enforced that is
gameofthrones,not_removed,we are talking about the show here and the blackfyres dont exist within the show outside of the history and lore videos
gameofthrones,not_removed,cant dany just deny trial by combat as it was banned by tommen before cerseis ascension dany hates fighting anyway and as ruler she would have the right to do that
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont see dany giving cersei any more of a trial than aerys targaryen got
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon and dany are kind of beyond the reach of the many faced god
gameofthrones,not_removed,that wasnt how the rebellion against the mad king worked actually the main rebel faction baratheon arryn stark the one that actually defeated the targaryens were firm friends and allies tywin stayed out of it until the targaryens were clearly defeated then joined in to kill off the kids and the old man even then there was no feud or buried conflict between the lannisters and the others at that point there was more enmity among the loyal faction ironically highgarden and dorne hate each other
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just dont see how they could have possibly pinned it on tyrion sansa for sure due to her leaving etc but i think tyrion was just caught in the crossfire
gameofthrones,not_removed,makes sense with the poison
gameofthrones,not_removed,hell even the books they may have had a prickly relationship but they were still the only targaryen loyalists at the end of roberts rebellion
gameofthrones,not_removed,the dornish actually had a legitimate reason to murder him after daeron conquered dorne he sent that tyrell to rule dorne and the guy basically visits every castle to bang dornish women all he has to do is pull a rope and someone will come to satisfy him and then one time he pulled the rope and scorpions fell on him
gameofthrones,not_removed,house arryn is the strongest right now no
gameofthrones,not_removed,im pretty sure dd just merged dany and young griff i wouldnt be surprised if she lands at storms end next season
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah im pretty sure this was overlooked by the show runners i bet if they could go back they would have changed this
gameofthrones,not_removed,well as i understand it he needs to be seen as making a genuine effort in his office or he will be removed possibly killed so when his king tells him to send an assassin he sends an assassin because he has to however im a proponent of the belief that a certain boy with dyed hair was varys plan all along and thus dany was somewhat expendable to him i agree with hombatwistory on why the poisoning was included in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,b the plan in the books was for viserys to take drogos army to the seven kingdoms and wreak havoc aegon ivyoung griff whom varys had supposedly rescued from death as a baby and then raised to be the perfect king would then swoop in as a savior rescue everyone and put down the mad conqueror and his savage army dany was only useful as a payment to get drogos army that was the beginning and the end of her value to illyrio and varys however dany becoming pregnant complicates things rhaego would have been a potential rival for the throne for aegon so what does varys do he has one of his little birds poison dany its my belief that this poison wasnt meant to kill dany but the unborn child she carried she would simply think she miscarried and jorah would be on a boat back to westeros perhaps then varys could claim his assassination attempt simply failed but still give robert the good news that danys child had perished done deal clean break jorah of course threw a wrench in this plan by saving the babydany and staying then viserys dies and now varys and illyrios carefully laid plans years in the making are falling apart then dany suddenly has no army but she has dragons then the plan changed so that aegon would marry dany and they would unite their forces dany would effectively prove aegons legitimacy if dany accepted him as a targaryen so would everyone else hed then have dragons and a bolstered army a true aegon the conqueror reborn then dany disappeared on drogons back and aegon made the executive decision much to the dismay of varys illyrio and connington and much to the joy of all his other commanders to abandon dany and move forward to press his claim partially due to tyrions urging and advice while westeros was broken and because he was no longer sure that dany would even support him rather just feed him to her dragons because he would be a threat to her legitimacy as queen s its definitely worth noting that dany is sort of stepping into the shoes that varys and illyrio had intended for viserys to fill showing up on the doorstep of the seven kingdoms with a savage army hellbent on conquering possibly some foreshadowing there this is assuming that she does get her army of dothraki in the books tldr its my belief that he was trying to poison her into miscarriage not kill her theres a lot to support this belief and a lot to support the belief that he was outright trying to kill her we might never know
gameofthrones,not_removed,wasnt it roberts order to kill her off so its not said that varys was responsible its just what the viewer might think because of his spying but thats two totally different things
gameofthrones,not_removed,and i always thought that the wine seller was part of when robert ordered her dead it was but varys was the middle man
gameofthrones,not_removed,i didnt catch it until my or rewatch they might have made it intentionally difficult to identify him to make the scene more mysterious ominous
gameofthrones,not_removed,one for gold was brown ben plumm i think the one for love will be daario or jon snow
gameofthrones,not_removed,whos the maegi
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats such a good point i totally overlooked myrcellas death thats gonna be particularly interesting given that tyrion is the one that sent her there to begin with
gameofthrones,not_removed,didnt randyll tarly fight for the targayans during roberts rebellion so he might cooperate with dany if that is the case
gameofthrones,not_removed,he might not believe in the dragons being real until its too late and i agree cersei has the odds stacked against her thats why i believe shell raise vassals to lords to give herself a fighting chance
gameofthrones,not_removed,he was loyal to the tyrells and fought for his liege lord like a good vassal should however his lord is dead and so is his heir oleanna is technically a redwyne i think randyl is a very prideful character he spoke about how he hated the wildlings well the reach also hates dorne and if cersei offers him his own wardenship and the opportunity to be the lord of highgarden id say its a very tempting offer could he serve dany as well yes its possiblebut only cersei gives him the opportunity to advance his house
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe like will break off or something under the rule of some badass dothraki
gameofthrones,not_removed,of course she could do that but in that case chekhovs zombiemountain would be completely useless dragonfood
gameofthrones,not_removed,nah trial by combat is back in preparation for cleganebowl
gameofthrones,not_removed,i see her do that dont forget she also did it or tried to do so in mereen didnt work out that well though also she knows from barry that killing aerys was pretty much necessary
gameofthrones,not_removed,tywin was previously hand of the king under targaryen jamies last order from the mad king was to bring him his father tywins head lannisters kind of had to lay low during the rebellion but once it was clear the rebellion would win tywin ordered the execution of the remaining line of targaryens and forged the alliance of lannisters and baratheons through the marriage of robert and cersei cersei i dont think ever wanted to be queen and she knew from the start that robert didnt love her
gameofthrones,not_removed,the dwarf jousting show is how littlefinger chose them as bait to drive a very public wedge between tyrion and joffrey and pin a motive on tyrion for the poisoning all of the slappings and insults put a giant target on tyrions back and the mistreatment of sansa made her an easy scapegoat the plan all along was to make it look like tyrion did it and sansa encouraged him
gameofthrones,not_removed,its kinda hard to tell the dornes are literally untouched in supplieswealtharmy and while tyrells lost alot in the sept with macelorasmargarey burning they still have the biggest army in westeros although house arryn should surely be up there
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the reach could still match them man for man with randyl tarly at the helm of that army i think they could give them a run for their money
gameofthrones,not_removed,no according to grrm vale and dorne has equal strength the reach is strongest
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is a chance they overlooked it they made a conscious decision to ignoremerge that plot for the sake of time and avoiding confusion
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont forget that young griff wasnt introduced until adwd which was only released after season was finished airing
gameofthrones,not_removed,awesome thank you for the book explanation just recently started listening to the audio books got a long way to go
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont remember a ben plumm in the show is he a book only character or am i totally forgetting something
gameofthrones,not_removed,or tyrion for jaimes sake
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought the same the first time through correct me if im wrong because im honestly not sure but didnt ben plumm betray dany because he thought she couldnt control her dragons anymore and thus her cause was apparently doomed that wouldnt be for gold even if he is a sellsword also a lot of people think for love is about jorah but he didnt betray her for love he betrayed her to get his life back he saved her for the love he bore her ive seen many theories but i think theres more to these treasons than weve been led to believe
gameofthrones,not_removed,maegi mirri maz dur
gameofthrones,not_removed,arent the dragons pretty much common knowledge at this time in the storyat least among lords she wont have a fighting chance either way her vassals are tired of war and while they might be frightened of her and her latest actions they will not fight when they see what the dragons are capable of
gameofthrones,not_removed,and on top of all thisin the books randyll tarly sits on the small council admittedly this is before any potential septexplosions and the like but theres a precedent for tarly working with the lannisters
gameofthrones,not_removed,that seems pretty likely to me perhaps it could happen just as the white walkers take winterfell or some other important location which would set up dany facing some pretty huge setbacks
gameofthrones,not_removed,with all of this extremely wellplaced framing i dont understand how people believe that tyrions trial in the show was a sham clearly shae lied and she very well may have been coerced to do so but from the outside its honestly ridiculous to imagine that tyrion hadnt done it
gameofthrones,not_removed,very good point i hadnt thought of it that way
gameofthrones,not_removed,dorne has the smallest army according to grrm whereas the vale could field up to as much the north and they are far better equipped and trained
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes only in the books and hes a sell sword that switches sides to the masters in the books betraying dany
gameofthrones,not_removed,yep book only he command the second sons and joins her cause then switches over to the yunkai daario is still around but hes in charge of the storm crows instead
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh her yea fuck that lady
gameofthrones,not_removed,field of fire
gameofthrones,not_removed,well seehate can overcome a lot is tarlys ambition and hate enough for him to overcome war wearinesswell find out next season edit im getting downvoted for saying well seehow silly are people on this board
gameofthrones,not_removed,indeed to deal with danys army cersei will need to make alliesand one of the best ways to do that if all the lords hate her is to promote their vassals tarly seemed like an obvious choice to me
gameofthrones,not_removed,from the common folk sure but from anyone with a real brain it is obvious he didnt
gameofthrones,not_removed,i didnt know that baelish setup the dwarf jousters i thought it was something joffrey planned just to be a jerk nonbook reader
gameofthrones,not_removed,when did he said george r r martin has previously stated that the vale is roughly equal in military strength to the north and dorne grrm id say these three kingdoms were roughly equal in the force they could assemble but the north is much bigger so it takes longer for an army to gather and life is harsher there as well so lords and smallfolk both need to think carefully before beating those plowshares into swords
gameofthrones,not_removed,ah how did he die ive only seen the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,tbh she only wanted revenge on khal drogo who led a group of people who murdered raped and enslaved her people for hundreds of years plus she had been raped previous times before dany saved her so imagine if you were raped and beaten numerous times and some princess bitch comes and claims you as her property and declares that you owe her because she saved you
gameofthrones,not_removed,there no indication on the show that lf had anything to do with it the jousters so you are correct in your assessment
gameofthrones,not_removed,still alive still besieging meereen
gameofthrones,not_removed,i didnt think it was too much of a stretch that he hired them in the show as well since a the rest of the purple wedding was almost identical to how its portrayed in the books b book lf directly tells sansa he hired the jousters c show lf is shown to be even more colluisive with and manipulative of joffrey than book lf see ros but i guess youre correct that its only a theory that show lf hired them even though i have a hard time believing that an idiot like joffrey came up with the idea
gameofthrones,not_removed,oooh so dany is still dealing with that in the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,show joffrey is older and has shown occasional glimmers of intellect thinking that there should be just one royal army that they should take dany seriously most importantly though there isnt even a hint that lf hired them in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats where it left off tyrion isnt even with dany hes with ben plumm and hes trying to convince him to turn his cloak again
gameofthrones,not_removed,oof i should read the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,your submission has been removed because of the following reasons rgameofthroneswikispoilerguidewikihowtomakeposts spoilers are events that make changes to people places or things that were established at the start of the main story origin formulas like abc are also spoilers and cant be in titles rgameofthroneswpostingpolicy rgameofthroneswspoilerguide rgameofthroneswbans
gameofthrones,not_removed,way too happy needs more cowbell
gameofthrones,not_removed,plausible in the sense that two lines from season statement to dany that she was destined to be a conqueror not a ruler and tormund davoss exchange where it is said that jon snows not a kinglead me to suspect that other candidates for the throne may yet emerge i have a hard time seeing jaime ever forgive tyrion though if he does kill cersei i would think it more likely to be a murdersuicide
gameofthrones,not_removed,tied up too neatly imo but im sure a ton of what you said will go down similarly first off tho the iron throne is likely mostly iron and steel it was made from the swords of the westerosi who fought against aegon the conqueror during the conquering of westeros seems silly to think all the westerosi had that much valyrian steel without anyone noticing especially considering it has a very distinct rippling pattern to it everything else is plausible although i personally think it wont be so perfect tons more main characters will fall in order to beat the white walkers if they are beaten
gameofthrones,not_removed,ned martell warns that summer is coming and the days watch must fend off the fire walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,do your research on the iron throne it is not comprised of valyrian steel in the times it was melted by dragon fire valyrian steel was still so rare i liked reading your piece though
gameofthrones,not_removed,gendry the blacksmith has arrived back in town and he melts it down to make swords to fight the ww this makes sense but where did gendry learn how to smith valyrian steel i too think arya will marry gendry i also think most of westeros will starve to death the war left them ill prepared for the winter
gameofthrones,not_removed,the iron throne gets melted down to create valyrian steel swords to combat the white walkers the seven kingdoms get divided again and dany jon and tyrion will rule as three separate but cooperative leaders since they are all targaryen and everyone lives happily ever after
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope we dont get this cliche ending
gameofthrones,not_removed,the thrones not made out of valyrian steel
gameofthrones,not_removed,no clegane bowl
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion and varys looking from a balcony and seeing all the land they now rule
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think that after the final battle with the white walkers in which they are defeated westeros will abandon a monarchical system and assume a more democratic way of electing their leaders
gameofthrones,not_removed,with all the surprises this crazy bastard of an author comes up with i wouldnt be surprised if the wws win and kill everything
gameofthrones,not_removed,then gendry and jon start a rebellion
gameofthrones,not_removed,jaime wont kill cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,what do you think will happen with sansa she looks like shes ready for some power for herself
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think cercei and euron will reign i dont know who cercei has left to fuck now that jaimes going to be the commander of the nights watch she killed off her whole family i guess euron doesnt look so far off they will begin by ordering the mountain to remove the tongues of the rest of the kingsguard and then they the entire court and then everyone
gameofthrones,not_removed,im telling you right now if jon marries his fucking aunt or fucks heri am done
gameofthrones,not_removed,no not at all lannister incest wasnt something a cared for hell even tyrion has his faults but he aint fuckin his sister i was never ok with that
gameofthrones,not_removed,clangaclangaclanga
gameofthrones,not_removed,jaime came into the world holding onto cerseis heel i believe he will leave the world holding onto her throat as they go over the side of a tower in kings landing a justice of sorts for bran
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i agree with about everything but cant see jamie having a happy ending unfortunately tragic hero through and through
gameofthrones,not_removed,i see tyrion as hand and jaime ruling casterly rock
gameofthrones,not_removed,while he may never forgive tyrion i always thought it would be possible that jaime kills cersei then takes the black oathkeeper back in his hands after he sees sansa and arya safe whether by briennes hand or not fighting the white walkers with honor as goldenhand not the kingslayer
gameofthrones,not_removed,but everything already changed the day the fire walkers attacked
gameofthrones,not_removed,fire walkers jesus that would be savage targaryens would need nerf tho volvo plz
gameofthrones,not_removed,eh valyrian steel is forged with dragon fire right and the throne was forged with dragon fire maybe it will get forged into true valyrian steel by a dragon toasting someone littlefinger sitting on the throne or maybe something goofy like valyrian steel requires blood and dragonfire so killing someone on the throne is how it gets forged into weapons its always seemed like a chekhovs gun to me besides it would make decent dramatic irony if everyone is fighting for the throne to dominate the kingdom when they should be using the throne to fight for the people of the kingdom
gameofthrones,not_removed,the iron throne was forged with the swords of aegon the conquerors enemies be they iron steel or valyrian steel its not all valyrian steel but theres more than likely some in there especially since aegons enemies are more likely to comprise the high lords of westeros and not the common foot soldier
gameofthrones,not_removed,it would also be really weird to melt down a recliner sized chair into enough steel to support an entire army
gameofthrones,not_removed,gendry was apprentice to the only westerosi blacksmith capable of reworking valerian steel although to be fair gendry barely did any work with swords up to the point where he leaves kings landing greatly decreasing the likelihood that he knows much about the process possible though
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree the throne will be destroyed and westeros will be in ruins the only way to maintain peace would be for it to be separated into seven kingdoms
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree the throne will be destroyed and westeros will be in ruins the only way to maintain peace would be for it to be separated into seven kingdoms
gameofthrones,not_removed,as plausible as this may be i dont believe tyrion to be a targaryen tywin and his wife were happily married it was unlikely that she wouldve had an affair besides who would dare defy the tywin by bedding his wife
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope we do
gameofthrones,not_removed,probably not in season but it will happen however it wont happen just because sandor has a different purpose in mind right now and the mountain looks like doesnt have a conscience on his own so something major will happen that will force sandor to get back to kings landing and confront his brother maybe cersei will take one of the stark girls prisoner maybe a trial by combat to save her maybe a daring rescue plan involving other people
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think littlefinger will come to power then sansa will marry him because she has to save jon or the north after which she will betray and kill littlefinger
gameofthrones,not_removed,real analysis
gameofthrones,not_removed,wait so all this time you were ok with jaime doggying his twin sister but when its jons aunt you want to quit
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah as much as i like the idea of some meaningful reconciliation between tyrion and jaime i cant quite wrap my head around it tyrions decision to kill tywin after jaime freed him was a major betrayal in and of itself but it must sting even more now that it has had such a devastating ripple effect had tywin lived its unlikely that the high sparrowfaith militant would have been able to gain nearly as much power as they did on cerseis watch which indirectly but unquestionably led to tommens death and the de facto collapse of the lannister regime
gameofthrones,not_removed,as he utters the wordsthe things i do for love
gameofthrones,not_removed,jaime attacks cersei he strangles her she stabs him and he dies laying on top of her his golden hand wrapped around her throat she cant get out from under him and dies
gameofthrones,not_removed,several kings have bleed all over the iron throne before and since its been established that kings blood has some unique properties for magic its possible
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh that means gendry was some kind of prodigy and there is going to be a scene like ive never forged valyrian steel beforebut ive seen my master do it loads of times then tyrion or someone will say if you failall our hopes are lost and dany or someone will say something like then we will not fail and then surprise gendry saves all the swords and everyone has valyrian steel now wooo
gameofthrones,not_removed,the mad king
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah definitely expect something to happen with him taking down the mountain theyve put a lot of time into both characters for there to not be a showdown at some point
gameofthrones,not_removed,no clue but i think shes going to commit some act of betrayal against jon i especially dont think shes going to be too happy with jon workingsleeping with dany
gameofthrones,not_removed,people have wanted a clegane bowl since they clashed at the hands tourney
gameofthrones,not_removed,jons not danys type anyway
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would actually be happy if they made that happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,that works too
gameofthrones,not_removed,possibly but i doubt tywin would leave her alone or not see that coming the man was too smart
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cant see her betraying jon she feels like shit for the way she treated him when they were younger and at this point he is the only family she still believes is alive even if she reconnects with bran andor arya i feel like her bond with jon is too strong after he helped her get revenge and win back their home
gameofthrones,not_removed,her type seems to be boastful but can back it up with actions with dario and drogo being the extent of our samples i agree with you jon doesnt have the panache that she appears to crave
gameofthrones,not_removed,more like jon is only into readheads
gameofthrones,not_removed,if you read a world of ice and fire there is a section where they kind of leave it open that tywins wife was living in kings landing for around a year before she gave birth
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre probably right theres just something about that look she and littlefinger exchanged after jon was crowned king of the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,no more like i meant exactly what i said dany wouldnt be sexually attracted to him
gameofthrones,not_removed,i saw more worry in that look sansa knows littlefinger and his intentions she will fear that littlefinger will be a danger to jon and she will have to keep him under control yes at times it will look like sansa will betray him but she will just be playing littlefinger control game and eventually this will be littlefingers demise
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just saw what do you think about it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i took it more as a you seeing this shit look but i hope youre right
gameofthrones,not_removed,damnthat made some good points about all the shady shit she did thx for sharing now im doubting her true loyalty to jon

gameofthrones,not_removed,been waiting since that last jaime pov in dance
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope so jaimes been hanging out with cersei too long he needs some better influences in his life
gameofthrones,not_removed,the chrome on jaime alone is brighter than westeross future
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like how stanis is not with his wife lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,if it seems too obvious that dany will win you know its gonna get messed up somewhere down the line lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,night king counters with ice dragon your move dtarg
gameofthrones,not_removed,we have to remember that we also dont really know much about the night king and the ww we learned how the night king was born but everything after that is still pretty much a mystery to us who knows what else theyre capable of we know nk can raise the dead and maybe all of the ww too not sure if thats specific to the books or not but what about their weapons somehow they forge weapons that can cut through normal steel also what lies to the very north what else are they capable of how many undead corpses have they reanimated what else have they reanimated how many ww are there craster had been sacrificing his sons for quite some time they could have taken wildling babies as well so many questions and i cannot wait any longer
gameofthrones,not_removed,if fking dorne can kill fully grown dragons im sure the white walkers could come up with a plan for three baby dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,i havent done any rewatchingreading of the series since last year but i dont recall any mention of the dragonbinder horn last season on the show so if thats not in the mix then im going to say daario naharis is going to betray and hinder her in a major way daenerys gets told shell be betrayed three times right once for blood and once for gold and once for love the first time is by mirri maz duur the lady who saves khal drogo with blood magic the second time is from xaro xhoan daxos the merchant guy who welcomes daenerys into qarth and tries to steal her dragons for money now the third thing hasnt happened yet but we know its based on love who loves dany daario naharis does and she breaks his heart by leaving him behind in meereen so yeah not looking too good on that front and thats why it makes the most sense the ironborn and second sons might not be enough to stop dany with her dragons unless they have dragonbinder but they should provide enough conflict for her to not snatch the throne from cersei instantly
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea shes doomed to die so its ok
gameofthrones,not_removed,ice dragon mate
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre right i think its just the anticipation thats killing me truly only time can tell at this point
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have a feeling that shes going to win but will be killed off just before she gets the throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion betrays her for john
gameofthrones,not_removed,fire melts ice
gameofthrones,not_removed,fucking confirmed
gameofthrones,not_removed,but then it is a question of who is fighting who the dragons that dany has are hers because we knew very early on that she possessed the eggs and that she stepped into the fire to birth them if there were to be an ice dragon who would it fight for in my opinion the overlying enemy throughout the seasons are the wws because of the continued alluding to winter is coming and the fact that when someone even mentions a ww its hard to believe so if dany has her dragons and the overlying enemy of the show seems to be the wws because everyone in the seven kingdoms seems to dread their return it would then shift the immense power to the white walkers but at the same time we really dont know what the ww intentions are at all which just raises yet another question edit i just cant see the series ending with the night king on the throne seems too farfetched and has a lack of that hero aspect we so want to see out of jon snow
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think tyrion will more likely become a mediator who creates a truce between daenerys and jon tyrion helps jon empathize with his fellow nights watch members when he first arrives at the wall and is also still technically married to sansa so it makes sense for him to be the guy who brokers a deal between the two it sets up for an epic team up and who doesnt want to see jon and dany fighting together side by side i suppose since theon is with daenerys and knows sansa and jon as well he could also chime in to that alliance he might not be enough though considering how he and jon arent on good terms but maybe thats changed due to him rescuing sansa from ramsay
gameofthrones,not_removed,any dragon the nights king has had more than a millennia to grow and dragons dont stop growing sure most of the time fire trumps ice but in this case you could be throwing a match into tub of dry ice
gameofthrones,not_removed,white walkers extinguish flames around them
gameofthrones,not_removed,if you think this show has a happy ending you havent been paying attention p
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think one of danys dragons dies somehow in combat and then the night king brings it back to life forcing it to fight in his army of the dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,true plus dd or grrm forget which one said the ending would be bitter sweet
gameofthrones,not_removed,grrm says it is bittersweet so to assume that everything is just going to go down in flames probably isnt a good assumption
gameofthrones,not_removed,wouldnt surprise me they seemed weak asf during the stadium scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,that was only one of the dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,and it was like only a dozen of mortal humans behind masks not a literal army of undead some with magical weapons or you know magic in general
gameofthrones,not_removed,it can kill white walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,many people including me seem to think that he will study the properties of the sword and perhaps even find a way to replicate the process of making valyrian steel its said that the steel is the product of magic so perhaps samwell will finally become a wizard like he always dreamed
gameofthrones,not_removed,his father will come after sam and the sword at the citadel sam will need to find help to protect himself and his family and the sword this is where i think his story line overlaps with jorahs jorah needs a cure and sam needs the aid of a warrior sam will realize that hes not the best warrior and give the sword to jorah to eventually be used against the ww in season
gameofthrones,not_removed,sam will just ride north and kill every white walker by his damn self gilly and little sam will watch
gameofthrones,not_removed,to take back to the wall for when the wws come
gameofthrones,not_removed,samwell is sick of his fathers disgust and hatred of him the sword is sams by right and i think sam will either melt the sword down to make a maesters chain which is the ultimate slap in the face to randyll tarly or use it to find a way to research making more valyrian steel to aid in the war to come against the wws
gameofthrones,not_removed,the significance is that not only is samwell a badass warrior totes killed a ww but also a master thief its role will be samwell now has a sword that is much much cooler than the other badass warrior sidekick bronn in all honesty the theory involving reptile from mortal kombat jorah and samwell teaming up
gameofthrones,not_removed,sams father leaving his home to chase the sword deprives the queen of one of her best generals allowing dany to take over with less bloodshed then she and jon are able to combat the threat of the walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,the issue i have with that theory is that the citadel would have a supply of valyrian steel so the sword shouldnt be necessary for that
gameofthrones,not_removed,currently my favorite theory is that euron raids the citadel for antidragon measures and sam gives it to jorah to wield im eager to see sam and jorah meet because sam served jorahs father and knows he was avenged
gameofthrones,not_removed,make a maesters chain that would be a massive waste
gameofthrones,not_removed,the latter source am ww
gameofthrones,not_removed,it has been speculated that maybe valyrian steel is nothing more than regular steel but forged with dragon fire that would explain why this particular material was produced in valyria and why there hasnt been any more valyrian steel produced since the doom if that is true which probably isnt but who knows maybe somehow sam is able to work it out by studying old books and analyzing his sword and new valyrian steel weapons can be produced using danys dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,the other interesting thing if you like symbolism is that jorahs father jeor mormont gave his sword to jon which would have been jorahs if he wasnt disgraced if sam were to give jorah heartsbane the family sword it passes a valyrian sword back to someone who was supposed to inherit it from their father so sam gets to see a valyrian sword indirectly pass from father acting as jeors surrogate to son something he knows will never happen for him
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed but sam wants to be a maester so you never know what an angry boy will do
gameofthrones,not_removed,it would not explain that because all dragons did not die with valyria if all you needed was dragonfire the early targaryen kings wouldve had a hell of a lot more valyrian steel swords than just blackfyre and dark sister
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really like that theory do you think that since jorah got his greyscale from valyria that valyrian steel would cure it
gameofthrones,not_removed,eh i dont think youre giving him enough credit hes just as worried about the wws as jon is and valerian steel weapons are in short supply sam isnt enough of a vindictive ass to melt it down just to spite his dad
gameofthrones,not_removed,there are simple ways to explain it for example the few individuals with the actual knowledge and craftmanship required to produce valyrian steel died in the doom so the targaryen kings had the dragons but lacked the knowledge to use them to produce valyrian steel again im not advocating for this particular theory as being true but its pretty consistent
gameofthrones,not_removed,no if you want to go super speculation mode i think greyscale was an attempt by the children to fight the white walkers after fighting the white walkers in the north of westeros thousands of years ago those infected with greyscale decided to exile themselves and got on ships never to be heard from again eventually some of those survivors settled in valyria and their true origin was lost to history i dont think they will find a cure for greyscale but the will use it as a weapon to fight the ww
gameofthrones,not_removed,are we sure this is a prophecy i always saw it as just a saying like when hell freezes over and pigs fly but a more poetic fantasy setting sort of way
gameofthrones,not_removed,when the sun rises in the west and sets in the east said mirri maz duur when the seas go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves when your womb quickens again and you bear a living child then he will return and not before the faith had risen in power in the west especially as shown by the kingsguard adopting the seven sided star on their breastplates this may be a stretch but daenerys left daario and the second sons in essos to rule so perhaps that could be the sun setting in the east or just her leaving essos could be also the massive navy she has acquired has left the sea dry all we need is for the mountain to blow in the wind
gameofthrones,not_removed,when seas go dry frozen over during winter mountains blow in the wind like leaves gregor clegane killed by the stormborn
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel like this is more of a book thing theres a character i cant recall his name currently who is a relation to doran martell that is sent to attempt a pact with daenerys he dies in essos trying to prove himself to her attempting to tame one of the dragons the sun is their sigil he was born in dorne westeros and died in meereen essos i also recall correct me if im wrong an excerpt from the book where daenerys had an inner monologue about getting her period which i thought was an unusual thing to just throw in there i took it to mean the quickening of her womb part if when the mountain dies that would fill that part of the prophecy im not sure what the seas being left dry could mean
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think gregor either being hanged or burned to ash via dragon though i think the seas going dry part has already been fulfilled
gameofthrones,not_removed,when seas go dry refers to the dothraki sea which isnt a sea its wasteland desert being empty which it is because dany has amassed like all the dothraki
gameofthrones,not_removed,quentyn
gameofthrones,not_removed,the state of tyrions hair though
gameofthrones,not_removed,in point of fact this is not the pilot earlier a pilot which btw was never broadcast was filmed and even had a few different actors for various reasons hbo and others were disappointed because of this got almost didnt get made dave and dan reworked it did a little recasting and what you see is officially the first episode and the rest is history
gameofthrones,not_removed,ill usually rewatch the series every year with each new season starting with episode one and casually watching episodes throughout the following months until im all caught up and ready for the newest season while you probably dont need to rewatch the show that many times i definitely recommend rewatching the entire show at least once or twice ill still hear a character in season one or two say something or make some kind of subtle reference that has a huge connection to something going on in season or whatever the newest season might be at the time its really cool to catch those things when they happen for example episode season one is the last time jon and ned are together the last thing ned says to jon is the next time i see you well talk about your mother fast forward to the last episode of season and we all learn what ned would have presumably told jon if theyd ever met again
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love the first episode my first rewatch was after season i got emotional seeing the starks all together it is very cool to rewatch and see all the pieces fall into place and see how much you missed i highly recommend rewatching the entire season even the boring episodes every episode has a little gem in it definitely worth it for any true got fan
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cant watch the first episode because all the starks look so happy it is depressing to know what happen to them
gameofthrones,not_removed,the first time i watched the show and hadnt read the books i completely missed the importance of jon arryn in fact i didnt even remember who he was or recall the scene with cercei and jamie talking over his dead body upon my first rewatch the story became much clearer
gameofthrones,not_removed,you saw the pilot how was tamzin merchant s
gameofthrones,not_removed,only once mate i always do a series rewatch between seasons its a must
gameofthrones,not_removed,do you actually mean the pilot because then theres thousands of us whod really like to know where you managed to get hold of it
gameofthrones,not_removed,whenever i rewatch the first episode and see how willing theon was to kill the dire wolf pups i lose all sympathy for his character sign that hes a traitor
gameofthrones,not_removed,watched the whole show while high rewatching sober and i missed so much information its also an amazing feeling when you see all the foreshadowing happening
gameofthrones,not_removed,i didnt start watching the series until after season xfinity on demand had free viewings for the first three episodes on a day off from work i figured id check out one episode then i could say i gave it a shot pilot hooked me in i watched the three then immediately signed up for hbo go and got caught up a week before season started
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like watching the first few episodes and counting up how many characters introduced then are dead now i think i was up around characters by the third episode
gameofthrones,not_removed,meh personally i dont like the direction on the first few episodes and i find a lot of the scenes kind of jarring and uncomfortable
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually preferred it more faithful to the books
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really want to see the actual pilot i have rewatched the show so many times i just want to see the original
gameofthrones,not_removed,i started watching season like two days before season aired basically binged watched it in less than a week and then was straight on to season every since season ive rewatched the entire series before every new season came out when came out i rewatched and so on and so forth even now youd be surprised the things you missed or didnt ever notice meanwhile doing a reread of the books is basically like this experience but tenfold
gameofthrones,not_removed,littlefinger started the whole show
gameofthrones,not_removed,pedantry
gameofthrones,not_removed,jory theon hes a good lad jaime i doubt that
gameofthrones,not_removed,to be fair ned initially said to kill them too theons character in the show is a shadow of his book self in the books theon smiles at everything laughs at everything and treats everything especially death like a game to the viewer on tv he comes off as a prick but when you get to his pov in the books you learn that in reality the reason theon is such a cock most of the time is fear in the book when ned executes the nights watch deserter theon casually kicks the head like a soccer ball and laughs only later do you realize he did it because in truth hes deathly afraid that one day hell be beheaded in the exact same way by ice if his father should ever rebel again its actually quite sad
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe its a stretch but i kinda thought his appearance changes coincided with his moving away from his family
gameofthrones,not_removed,it included flashbacks to roberts rebellion and the events that immediately preceded it those would be interesting to see but i have a feeling they confused audiences with too much information upfront
gameofthrones,not_removed,hopefully they release it once the series is done id like to watch it simply out of curiosity
gameofthrones,not_removed,there are some scenes from it that made it into the actual pilot which have continuity issues ones that come to mind are two scenes with tyrion with different hair one in the brothel and one where hes outside talking to the hound theres another scene with sansa in the great hall where they refilmed the parts of the other speakers but not the parts with sansa its noticeable because she was so young at the time and theres a years difference between when the two pilots were filmed
gameofthrones,not_removed,not as good as seeing it but you can at least tell a lot of the differences from the episode we got the first scene after the prologue is the execution scene of the deserter as it was in the books the show as we see it now shows the stark family happily living in winterfell in the first scene actually the whole pilot seems to be very similar to the first few chapters of the book a near direct translation by my memory
gameofthrones,not_removed,misusing the word pilot when you mean the first episode is careless use of language i would not normally have been particularly bothered though inadvertently claiming to have seen the actual pilot of got which essentially nobody outside the production team or the financial backers has when you actually havent is worthy of a snarky comment
gameofthrones,not_removed,instead of helping to fight jaimes father like he promised robb he beheaded jorys father
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think youre right same thing happened with jaime his hair is now like a sandy blonde and hes also a lot more good and i think hes excepting that he doesnt have to be cruel to everyone
gameofthrones,not_removed,it also included a cameo from grrm himself at danys wedding
gameofthrones,not_removed,you must be fun at parties
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh wow i never made that direct connection thats pretty cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,bobby b might ensure dany gets murdered since ned wont be there in kl to forbid it unless of course varys has something up his sleeve brotherhood without banners will not exist bobby b might still be murdered by cersei but at a different time and a different method varys could repeat what he did with aerys whispering paranoia into bobbys ear suspecting ned and plan to murder him bobby would become mad king ii eyed raven might still seek out bran but bran might not have the motivation to reach out to him tyrion would not have been kidnapped lannisters would not have a solid reason to declare war against the north arya would not meet syrio would not have the motivationreason to become an assassin gendry might just turn out to be a master blacksmith barristan selmy would still lead the kingsguard renly would not have the initiative to declare himself king there are still plenty of possibilities but id stop at for now
gameofthrones,not_removed,ultimately it wouldnt matter because winter is coming
gameofthrones,not_removed,doesnt the book mention if ned declined to be hand of the king the king would then begin to think hes conspiring against him or something of the sort
gameofthrones,not_removed,brans story would remain the same he would have his visions and travel northward only in a much more convenient manner neds story might turn out differently although robert would still die and the civil war would have started anyway remember renly revolted without any knowledge of joffreys legitimacy problems but the cerseijoffrey duo would have alienated everyone eventually
gameofthrones,not_removed,the iron bank of braavos will still create the havocs in westeros to collect its debts after all their motto is the iron bank will have its dues
gameofthrones,not_removed,show if ned had declined roberts offer of the position of the hand he would have had to do something to appease his king and friend one reason robert wanted ned in kings landing is he felt surrounded by the lannisters and didnt trust his own small council he also didnt trust his own brothers though only renly had given him real cause to suspect any ambition on their part bran still gets pushed out the tower window because robert still comes north to persuade his friend and fosterbrother to come back to kl with him so cersei and jaimie accompany him jon still joins the nights watch and his story arc continues on pretty much the same path he accompanies benjen whos story arc continues on path sansa is still betrothed to geoffrey and goes south as a ladyinwaiting to the queen ned sends robb with a banner men raised for a years service mounted menatarms spearmen and archers as an escort for sansa and to give robert a loyal force in kl tyrion still accompanies the kings retinue heads to the wall with jon but with ned in winterfell is arrested by the tullys and sent there for the attempt on brans life bron could still save his ass in a trial by combat robert could still be murdered by a conspiracy to put geoffrey on the throne this is where things get more complicated like robert could turn to stannis or tywin to be hand or robert discovers what jon arryn discovered and the conspiracy has to murder him before he can disown his children he could send letters to stannis renly and ned calling for troops to secure kl and support him in his actions robb would already be there with his in and around the red keep
gameofthrones,not_removed,one step further what if jon arryn never died would the story still happen but have a different journey if so is it all down to him
gameofthrones,not_removed,robert took his family to winterfell and whilst he was there offered the job to ned chances are jaime and cersei would still have met in the tower bran would still have climbed and would still have been pushed if ned hadnt accepted the job then chances are his family would have been ostracised and he might even have been imprisoned with the same outcome but if the whole family hadnt gone to kings landing sansas storyline might have been very different
gameofthrones,not_removed,i always felt bad for sansa and how it all worked out for her but if she hadnt gone to kl then she would still hate winterfell and want to leave lol its almost laughable to see how leaving turned out for her
gameofthrones,not_removed,you just got jammed
gameofthrones,not_removed,robert went against neds wishes anyway and hired assassins for daenerys ned being there didnt change much in this matter
gameofthrones,not_removed,i didnt think cersei killed robert though wasnt it while he was hunting and i think arya would have still been a killer or whatever just maybe more of a warrior and not assassin
gameofthrones,not_removed,truest comment iv read so far
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah in the books and show i believe but its really just a what if type thing that popped in my head lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,well if jon never died then he would have figured out about jeoffery and the others and then see how that would play out with robert would be very interesting
gameofthrones,not_removed,i didnt think cersei killed robert though wasnt it while he was hunting yeah but cersei laid out the plans and i think arya would have still been a killer or whatever just maybe more of a warrior and not assassin but her nimble build is more suited of an assassin she wont fare well with fighting styles like that of hound or brienne which relies on raw physical strength
gameofthrones,not_removed,she admitted to the shame nun that she killed robert straight from the horses mouth
gameofthrones,not_removed,shes the one that gave lancel the really strong wine to get robert extremely drunk and if a boar didnt kill him robert wouldve fell off his horse or any other kind of accident its not even the first time cersei has tried to kill robert during the hands tourney cersei was tricking robert into entering the melee part of the tourney and she was gonna pay an assassin to enter and kill him
gameofthrones,not_removed,the king took his entire family and spent month going from kings landing to winterfell to offer ned the hotk position in person declining this offer is like slapping robert to the face not to mention that it definitely will cause suspicions not only to robert but to the whole westeros unless ned can find an extremely acceptable reason to decline but the decline has to be sent before robert reach winterfell not after he arrived at winterfell
gameofthrones,not_removed,aryas good at riding though and being a lancer is mostly about horsemanship
gameofthrones,not_removed,couldve just been saying whatever to avoid beatings i know i would if i had to admit something to stop the beating may as well get it over with if they wont accept that i didnt do it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i watched the all of the shows and im halfway threw the first book and literally just read this past yesterday or the day before very interesting she even plotted it so ned couldnt say anything to robert about it i do hate cersei and some of the other lannisters but god damn they are good
gameofthrones,not_removed,would she have the strength to carry and accurately thrust the heavy lance though
gameofthrones,not_removed,i didnt mean when cersei was held captive she admitted it in the final episode when it was the shame nun who was on the table and about to get physically abused by zombie mountain i can find the clip probably if it helps
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe not when shes ten but later definitely i think shed have been much like elia sand and im guessing shes not called lady lance for nothing
gameofthrones,not_removed,nope elia httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpeliasand elia sand is the oldest bastard daughter of prince oberyn martell by his paramour ellaria sand she is one of the famous sand snakes shes fond of horses and jousting her weapon of choice is the lance elia was most likely named after her late aunt elia martell

gameofthrones,not_removed,oathkeeper needs the black and red ripple pattern on the blade in a year or so itll also need to be changed to the blade being on fire
gameofthrones,not_removed,her likeness is captured so well great job
gameofthrones,not_removed,jaime i kept my oath i lost arya and killed the hound
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats really fucking good bravo
gameofthrones,not_removed,i do too and theres no shame in that
gameofthrones,not_removed,well between the armor and her looks i think its safe to assume the artist used the show version as their main reference inspiration
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel like its a bit of both her features are very strong in this picture but she does have the likeness of got bit the actress playing brieanne looks a tad better
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei jaime littlefinger qyburn the mountain
gameofthrones,not_removed,davos hes basically ned stark hes too righteous and wholesome to live cersei it probably wont take a whole season for danny to show up at kings landing although that would be classis danny storyline shit if it did and jaimie is pissed also shes on aryas shit list shes a fucking goner sansa she is littlefingers biggest threat and he is one of the most dangerous people in the westerosi game right now she should have just married him and lived happily ever after im biased brienne another righteous character if sansa lives i think it will be through brienne sacrificing herself the mountain he will be rekilled by the hound during the cleganebowl which is stll confirmed
gameofthrones,not_removed,edd and some other men of nights watch calling it
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei the mountain tormund davos sansa
gameofthrones,not_removed,no chance all three lannisters die in season those three are given top billing alongside kit harrington and emilia clarke definitely bet on cersei jaime is and id say tyrion is a definite for season the whole anyone can die mantra is done and dusted i could be eating my words but i will be very surprised if tyrion does next season

gameofthrones,not_removed,said it in another thread before im quite certain that arya will die soon as she is now she is just too powerful for the story if she makes contact with jon or sansa she will be the perfect weapon to kill any enemy they have shes basically the equivalent to an orbital canon from a story writing perspective this is horrible you cant make exciting storylines or plot twists like this every possible threat an enemy king could be is immediatly weakened by the idea that arya could literally just walk in on him and kill him i expect her to bring a few important deaths and then die on one of her missions or being betrayed
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei mountain sansa littlefinger
gameofthrones,not_removed,sansa cersei littlefinger mountains have eyes davos
gameofthrones,not_removed,why do so many people think sansa will die the series has been foreshadowing that she will survive and shes proven herself to be a survivor given all of the bad situations in which she has found herself i dont think the show runners would have tyrion utter a line like lady stark you may survive us yet if they werent foreshadowing that she would outlive most if not all the major characters seems to me that grrm is setting her up to be the elizabeth of york type character in this story which means she survives and also ends up as queen consort whether of the seven kingdoms or the north my five cersei jaime euron littlefinger and a tie between yarathe mountain time to cull the herd further and set up the last season for dealing with the true main characters of the story jon arya bran sansa tyrion danaerys and the battle against the white walkers

gameofthrones,not_removed,shit forgot frankenmountain and dr frankenmountain
gameofthrones,not_removed,this firstly people are vastly underestimating how insanely superior danys force is and secondly i dont want to see season be a mindless slugfest against zombies but judging by how predictable season was though it was cinematically spectacular thats what were going to get which means the remaining human antagonists need to be wiped off the board this season
gameofthrones,not_removed,just curios why lf
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually really like qyburn i hope he makes it through the season somehow

gameofthrones,not_removed,get the fucking hypes
gameofthrones,not_removed,all four of the men left on the wall i can see it
gameofthrones,not_removed,davos do not fucking joke with that
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think i can deal with davos and tormund both dying one would be bad enough jon needs at least one loyal friend beside him in the final season
gameofthrones,not_removed,no tormund cries
gameofthrones,not_removed,tormund davos
gameofthrones,not_removed,jaime and cersei are almost certainly going to die before the series is over i guess tyrion is more of a coin toss but i dont think hes bulletproof anymore
gameofthrones,not_removed,because you like the characters or because you dont respect it
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei and frankenmountain
gameofthrones,not_removed,agree with yara euron and melisandre i would add theon as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,makes me think of danys dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think youre missing a major theme in the show its about the return of magic at the beginning got hardly qualified as fantasy but now the dragons have grown and the walkers are about to knock down the wall meanwhile euron at least in the books has a bunch of magical shit as well cersei has a zombified super knight several characters have come back from the dead bran can warg and time travel and jon snow is probably being protected by a divine force so yeah i wouldnt exactly call arya too powerful its not like she can just wipe out entire armies all we know is that she was skilled enough to kill walder frey personally i believe alt shift xs theory that she will die toward the end of the series and warg into nymeria
gameofthrones,not_removed,i call it sirius black syndrome when a character is willing to go so hard in the paint and is such a badass that they are essentially an instawin for their team the only way to resolve it is to kill them off
gameofthrones,not_removed,because presumedly someone good in the north is gonna die and none of us want to believe it could be jon or davos
gameofthrones,not_removed,lf might plot something to get more power
gameofthrones,not_removed,meera id cry hard
gameofthrones,not_removed,lady olenna you shut your mouth
gameofthrones,not_removed,bronn cant die
gameofthrones,not_removed,or maybe one or both of the other two
gameofthrones,not_removed,if robyn arryn survives and ghost dies we revolt
gameofthrones,not_removed,what would aryas reason for killing mel be
gameofthrones,not_removed,if everyone is smart and works together they should be able to deal with the whitewalkers and the death army quite easily danys dragons and the huge cache of wildfire can burn away all the zombies then they can use valeryan steel and dragon glass on the walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,as you get closer to the end a series inevitably becomes more predictable and yeah i agree about danys force the reach alone is probably a stronger force than all of casterly rocklannisters plus theyre fighting with purpose rather than defending a tyrant then you add that she has all of dorne which dwarfs the rest of cerseis army on top of all that she also has dragons to more than cancel out home field advantage unsullied dothraki and probably a thousand or so ironborne
gameofthrones,not_removed,i assume that he is going to be plotting something regarding jon andor sansa in the next season however i believe that it would need to be resolved by the end of the season so that season can focus primarily on the white walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont really see littlefinger as an endgame character not to mention his plotting and scheming makes him seem more like an obstacle
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes actually my favorite character i just love him
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes evil
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel pretty confident that the series could end with a meteor hitting during the final battle between all sides and after minutes showing the carnage and dead bodies davos would be the only guy to crawl from under some rubble alive he will make it to the end
gameofthrones,not_removed,not joking its an odd numbered season lets examine the things that happen in odd numbered seasons season lady dies nymeria is banished ned dies season robb dies catelyn dies talisa dies grey wind dies season shireen dies stannis dies jon dies so odd numbered seasons are historically bad for starks and their allies even quasi allies davos and tormund are screwed jon would be but his plot armor and plot healthcare are too powerful
gameofthrones,not_removed,the fact you put the hound jaime and sansa on it angers me
gameofthrones,not_removed,me too that girl deserves a happy ending after everything shes done for the starks but im already preparing myself for her death just in case
gameofthrones,not_removed,as soon as cersci dies she goes too shell have nothing left to live for
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really want him and jamie to make it and davos jamie and bronn are just too cool with each other on screen
gameofthrones,not_removed,she got on her list from taking gendry away from the brotherhood without banners because of his kings blood when gendry was happy there
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree to me i think the whole point of sansas arc is to take littlefinger down their plotline will hit its zenith this season
gameofthrones,not_removed,there comes a point in a story like game of thrones when the main characters need to start winning i think weve reached that point with jons resurrection last season the major deaths for the good guys those i consider to be good this season were hodor the three eyed raven margaery loras rickon wun wun doran and tommen of those id say hodor was the only one that hit hard and even then he got a relatively heroic death which is more than most characters can ask for on the flip side of the villains walder frey the waif ramsay roose bolton ser aliser maybe not a villain if you consider the circumstances but the antagonist to jon and olly bit the dust hodor hurts and the tyrells had so much potential destroyed but we didnt get a nedrobb level death really the worse off this season were the villains walder frey and ramsay are two of the most if not the most hated bad guys in the show and they both met gruesome deaths add onto that we got the return of two beloved characters with the hound and the boy jon snow id say this season was a net positive for the good guys and i think that trend will continue into the final conflict then again i may be totally wrong daenerys could finally come home to westeros take her first step onto the land of her birth trip on a rock and break her neck its still game of thrones after all honorable mention i dont think he occupies a slot of major deaths but rip mace the ace you will ride eternal on the plains of valhalla sweet lord
gameofthrones,not_removed,id be really surprised if jaime made it to season i believe that he will murdersuicide cersei the hound and sansa might be reaches but i was trying to stick to main characters
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think theon will die characters like that get redemption and then pass on
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion and bronn with pod the rod was the superior bromance
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive been thinking so much about this do you think her sewing could be like spider and web i mean the books shes learned more you see more influence but what is the point she kills him or she sides with him spins a web reaps what she sews
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like how you were willing to consider alliser as possibly a good guy but not olly
gameofthrones,not_removed,if jaime goes down the route of book jaime meaning he will not love cersei anymore because of what shes done then i can definitely see him killing her however i dont see jaime killing himself after murdering cersei imo jaime will ditch her for brienne theres definitely gonna be something between them in the future
gameofthrones,not_removed,no no no you see the dragon has three heads so sansa marries sandor and petyr when she becomes queen of planetos so none of them can die my logic is sound
gameofthrones,not_removed,they could all be together
gameofthrones,not_removed,im sort of liking a sansa pushed lf through the moon door lf grabs hold of her and pulls her through with him
gameofthrones,not_removed,theons death would make me really sad for some reason maybe because i just feel bad for the guy and i think hes really on track for redemption also hes the rightful heir to the iron islands if you ignore yara id like to see theon meet up with jon before he died if he does end up dying though i wonder if jon would still be pissed about the betrayal of robb
gameofthrones,not_removed,im liking that as well if they both have to go they should go together because at this point their future as one without the other is almost irrelevant anyway
gameofthrones,not_removed,calling it now theon dies jon its okay theon brother please theon i would have follow you my captain my brother my king
gameofthrones,not_removed,ha nice udiegroblers totally realized with ur comment unadirehstark unless they make a stand and set her up with another plot quick if he dies it takes her purpose could have been season to give her something else which man since in the end it looks like no growth even backsliding if in the end she really did bc more vindictive with that last lookthen to me it can maybe be similir arc to grrm outline she chooses something else but her family to her own demise i mean she doesnt seem to have been one of the chosen she didnt get lured by the faceman or threeeyed men in trees or have a destiny of legend neither did rickon her life seems to beg question if it has endgame purpose unless they do put her next to tyrion as queen leading the new world in the end but her training is more treachery than leadership
gameofthrones,not_removed,giving him the role of hand of king over cersei was a death sentence didnt play out like he wanted to but tywin kept putting tyrion in dangerous situations so he would get himself killed without him having to do it himself
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think tyrion drinks and whores or drank and whored because of the neglect and disdain his father had toward him he put him in charge as the hand because he knew that tyrion was intelligent and would not coddle joffrey and knew how to play the game though he may not have looked at humans his son he respected his intelligence and trusted that he would do the job efficiently plus he had the lannister name
gameofthrones,not_removed,tywin made tyrion the hand because he knew he was smart and that he could stop joffrey from making stupid and irrational decisions i think he always planned to kill tyrion when he was ready to become hand and he decided to try it at the battle of blackwate he still wouldve done that to him if he didnt drink and whore because he thought he was a stain on the family name even if hes a good person everyone still remembers him as the impdwarf son of tywin lannister and even if hes a good person its better for tywins legacy to take him out of the picture
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think tywin really hates tyrion because he knows tyrion is probably a targaryan
gameofthrones,not_removed,the only way he wouldnt hate tyrion is if his mother didnt die during his birth
gameofthrones,not_removed,i reckon so there was a line somewhere in a tyrion chapter in adwd where tyrion says lanisters usually take a trip over to essos and explore the free cities as young adults tywin thought tyrions antics would bring shame on their name so he forbid him go to essos and subsequently put him in charge of the rocks plumbing probably hoping hed fall into a pipe or something
gameofthrones,not_removed,he hated tyrion for killing his wifeit all comes back to thatcersei hates him for itplus she hates him from the propechy or fears him because of itbut tywin shared the same vices as tyrion he just was better at being discreet i think and was never a fool to love them but he keeps putting tyrion into situations that he thinks will kill him but as tyrion is about to kill him he admits he always wanted him dead but respected him because he fights for whats his the thing with tyrion is he is based of an english king who was also a dwarf who was seen as evilbecause they believed that dwarfism was the gods way of showing they evil and not to be trustedsame way in the books he is distrusted and hated for simply being a dwarf
gameofthrones,not_removed,when tywin was a child he had to make up for his father being a complete idiot everyone laughing at how much of a pushover his father was so he worked his entire life to make sure his family was never considered the way his father made them and i think that tyrion being a dwarf made people laugh at his family again which brought tywin back to when his family was ruined by his father so i think that tyrion represents that resentment of his father and all of the embarrassment of his early years also the fact that tywin views tyrion as his wifes murderer
gameofthrones,not_removed,giving him the leftflank which he knew would fall is another example of this tyrion even adresses it to tywins face and he admits it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i disagree entirely tywin for the first time gave tyrion a chance and then in the very next sentence he said dont bring your whore what did tyrion do turned around ignored it and brought his whore he was given a chance by his father finally and then he fucked it up literally the very first chance he got all the other good he did in the role didnt matter because he did the one thing tywin despised the most the one thing he told him not to do immediately and he went and did it anyway i love tyrion and i know hes near the top of every fans favorites list but hes flawed and he fucked up
gameofthrones,not_removed,i remember a line from cercie when she was asked if she was hand after tywins death she said something along the lines of clearly a woman wouldnt be a good fit for hand of the king so clearly tywin believes it as well doubt he wouldve made her hand even if tyrion was never born he wouldve made kevan hand
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion dying in the blackwater wouldve also been beneficial because it could be spun that the lannisters made great sacrifices protecting the people of kings landing from the rebel stannis baratheon it would have also cleared tyrions image and the stain on the family name that tywin perceived
gameofthrones,not_removed,at the battle of blackwater its implied that it was joffrey who sent the kings guard after tyrion i thought
gameofthrones,not_removed,well obviously putting a dwarf and a bunch of lightly armored barbarians in the vanguard wasnt an honor lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,tywins a fucking genius although there would be some people who knew how tyrion actually died and it would be a big rumor like the cersei and jaime rumors
gameofthrones,not_removed,always assumed it was tywin maybe he had his hand in convincing him to do it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think joffrey needed convincing his uncle wasnt scared of him and would talk down to him and slap himplus he hated him for being a dwarfhe was just a vicious petty idiot kind of sad for tyrion thoughhalf of his own house wanted to kill him when he had never done anything but server there greater interests
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh he regarded tyrion as cannon fodder as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,tacos im in
gameofthrones,not_removed,my issue with this is why would the hound tell anyone about littlefinger he doesnt really care about anyone especially anyone of power it sounds like something he would do but what would drive the hound to do this

gameofthrones,not_removed,thefacelessmanformerlyknownasjaquenhgar is lorathi not braavosi
gameofthrones,not_removed,we really dont hear enough native braavosi speak on the show in order to have a meaningful discussion on the matter jaqen hghar is originally from lothar which is why he speaks in the manner in which he does whilst the mummers likely travelled from city to city gaining and dropping performers as they went its unlikely though certainly not impossible that any of them would have a braavosi accent either
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont you only pick up the accent if you grow up in a place for awhile if you had already been speaking for awhile i could see you picking up some local lingo but not really the accent
gameofthrones,not_removed,if the faceless men have no identities does this mean their accents change with their faces as well would wearing a lorathi face give you a lorathi accent
gameofthrones,not_removed,does braavos have a local accent though
gameofthrones,not_removed,i doubt it works quite like that being able to artificially change your accent is not a rare ability by any definition so whilst the faceless men doubtless do later their accents dependant on where their latest face comes from i suspect it has to be done knowingly
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think since it was founded by slaves that it would depend on if the majority of the founders were of a certain region or descent i think it would have just turned into a melting pot and there would be little to no surefire ways of deciding on just a single accent to represent the whole area
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh okay that makes sense thank you
gameofthrones,not_removed,due to the incestuous nature of the targaryen dynasty their genes were recessive thats why rhaegars platinum hair and other typical targaryen features like purple eyes though theyre not depicted in the show were phased out by lyanas dominant genes because they were not weakened by generations of incest this is why jon took on typical stark features instead of targaryen ones
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes not the first one with targaryen without the silver hair it happened quite often in the last three centuries
gameofthrones,not_removed,its not its brown a very dark brown but brown nonetheless
gameofthrones,not_removed,they needed to make him look more visibly different to the other stark kids notably bran rickon robb and sansa who were supposed to have the lighter tully auburn hair
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a dominant hair colour
gameofthrones,not_removed,a high concentration of eumelanin
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon has dark brown hair and grey eyes in the books the show casts people based on their acting ability not on their physical features matching their book characters physical features
gameofthrones,not_removed,dark baratheon hair trumps light hair is all we learned
gameofthrones,not_removed,the seed is strong

gameofthrones,not_removed,at the moment dany its not confirmed whether or not jon is a legitimate targaryen or if hes still a bastard we dont know if rhaegar married lyanna or anything like that just that lyanna is his mother if he were legitimate hes the son of the rightful heir which in traditional westeros houses would make jon the rightful heir but there are some customs that see women on equal footing to men in terms of inheritance some dornish houses for example jon targaryen if he is a true targaryen and daenerys targaryen both have strong claims it ultimately comes down to possession being of the law whoever can press their claim gets the throne dany has an uphill battle being a woman but this is greatly aided by the fact that she has the military might to back it up
gameofthrones,not_removed,targaeryns were disinherited there claim would have to be by conquest
gameofthrones,not_removed,dany is a cousin of robert baratheon
gameofthrones,not_removed,even if jon is legitimate he isnt the heir because aerys disinherited rhaegar and his children
gameofthrones,not_removed,which would make jon the son of the firstborn male third cousin
gameofthrones,not_removed,did he specifically disinherit rhaegar and aegon or did he just name viserys as the heir once rhaegar died because he was still trying to follow the ptwp thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,not sure if aerys word is worth much in westeros these days
gameofthrones,not_removed,aerys disinherited rhaegar and his children
gameofthrones,not_removed,we now have a queen i dont think gender matters much anymore
gameofthrones,not_removed,its never explicitly stated but he does name viserys his heir and forces elia and her children to stay in kl as hostages
gameofthrones,not_removed,just got home from it fucking sick i think i had the chills the entire time
gameofthrones,not_removed,spoilers my husband i and were there as well we were on the floor omg this was amazing we felt the heat omg httpimgurcomircbgpj
gameofthrones,not_removed,man im bummed the show in columbus didnt have all the screens set up that looks so much cooler
gameofthrones,not_removed,was really cool seeing ramin djawadi on the pianoorgan during light of the seven didnt realize he was so hands on with the music performance piece such a great show they didnt use the stage effects as much as i thought they would but it was still a really epic journey through the show again with beautiful music to match
gameofthrones,not_removed,i also enjoyed the hell out of the show here are some photos from where we were sitting and also some of the costumes that were on display httpimgurcomachncs
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have a seat just as far how is the audio
gameofthrones,not_removed,im so jealous of you guys really hope it comes to the uk so glad you all enjoyed it though
gameofthrones,not_removed,reminds me a lot of the staging for muse drones tour

gameofthrones,not_removed,if someone hasnt watched or finished game of thrones does this event spoil it for them
gameofthrones,not_removed,the light of the seven was sooooo fucking awesome
gameofthrones,not_removed,geez i was rows up and felt the heat lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was there too absolutely amazing i loved seeing him on piano at the end also he was right across from us finally since we didnt get too much action at that end of the stage check out his music from westworld too he is pretty awesome id definitely go to this again if there was another show close by
gameofthrones,not_removed,where the hell were the costumes it was such a disaster waiting in line to get in we didnt have time to look around thanks for sharing your pics
gameofthrones,not_removed,hell yeah it was people were leaving while ramin was speaking and im sitting in my seat like they still need to play light of the seven and then it came on and the chills man
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah it was crazy
gameofthrones,not_removed,they were near the broad street north entrance which happened to be where we came in and right near our seatsotherwise we wouldnt have seen it either we also enjoyed standing in line outside for so long that we got to our seats just as the show was starting
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think pcp and game of thrones dont mix
gameofthrones,not_removed,what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever heard at no point in your rambling incoherent post were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought everyone in this subreddit is now dumber for having read it i award you no karma and may god have mercy on your soul
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is crazy and i say that as a fan of preston jacobs
gameofthrones,not_removed,please explain more
gameofthrones,not_removed,honestly any things possible but for the sake of narrative that is one fucking task to explain in an organic way without breaking down into a youtube conspiracy slideshow thats like rey being a kenobi granddaughter
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would say this is the most batshit crazy theory ive ever read but ive read the time traveling tyrion fetus theory
gameofthrones,not_removed,for the offseason is dark and full of craziness
gameofthrones,not_removed,no just no
gameofthrones,not_removed,well this really isnt coherent i mean if theyre all faceless men then this makes a lot of sense i guess i see how jon could have not really been dead and he could have had makeup like how sherlock faked his death still youre wasting your time on theories that will never happen maybe try doing something else with your time and please ignore the rudeness that you have received its a nice read and once i think about it possible but its not gonna happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,um wut
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes please more this is great dont stop there
gameofthrones,not_removed,shapeshifting into different bodies but they all diedand didnt change appearance so are you saying that the nights watch were magicians or that magicians took over the nights watch and two jon snows what why how and what motivation would magic actor nights watchmen have for plotting the rise of a young bastard to be the king how long do you suspect they planned this for and lastly as others have said is there any evidence at all to support this like whatsoever not trying to be rude but this just seems so far out of left fieldplease explain what brought you to any of these conclusions
gameofthrones,not_removed,basically the nights watch was sick of being looked down on and treated as a joke by many people they learned magic and became able to go into different bodies there was an whole elaborate plan for them to use this ability to make jon into sort of a god i am at work right now but i may be able to type out a longer theory tonight if there is enough interest
gameofthrones,not_removed,please elaborate on the fetus
gameofthrones,not_removed,the off season is dark and full of terrors
gameofthrones,not_removed,ill humor you is there any evidence of this at all
gameofthrones,not_removed,tyrion is actually rhaego sent back in time and the baby dany gave birth to was joanna and aerys son
gameofthrones,not_removed,if its about power symbolism jons army power is not smaller than cerseis also in the vid how can you tell danys room is bigger than cerseis
gameofthrones,not_removed,is there a tldr for that theory
gameofthrones,not_removed,while youre right about various houses being motivated just by hearing the north remembers there is a huge gap between recognizing that everyone wants another king stark and actually carrying out the plot which reinstates the starks those details are the parts which would have to be kept secret if the whole north is repeating the north remembers and each house is waiting its turn to step in theyre all basically just waiting for a stark to be reinstated by chance it takes much more than that to topple a great powerful house like the boltons and ensure that a stark rises from the ensuing power vacuum
gameofthrones,not_removed,its not just people blindly believing in it because they want to though we know for a fact there is a northern conspiracy led by wyman the pie man its only a question of who else is involved
gameofthrones,not_removed,nah han shot first
gameofthrones,not_removed,welp it is book only to start basically davos meets with lord manderly who plans on betraying the freys and the boltons other northern lords might be in on it such as the umbers and glovers that is the most basic version of it alt shift x touches on some potential relatedunrelated things such as robb naming jon his heir and the people carrying the message havent been seen since book three but they are likely alive
gameofthrones,not_removed,id watch the video though he has very good presentation
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the video he mentions several houses working individually to reinstate the starks so my idea is that even though rhymes arent working together they are working together under the credo the north remembers once one group acts the other groups will follow
gameofthrones,not_removed,plus the video itself is pretty much a tldr of the actual post
gameofthrones,not_removed,theyll rise separately and come together is what i thinkhope
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love how it matches up so perfectly thanks for getting that song stuck in my head
gameofthrones,not_removed,is that sebastion bach
gameofthrones,not_removed,now some fool come tell me how thats in the iron islands its clearly dragonstone
gameofthrones,not_removed,could the rocks be dragonglass also it looks even more uncomfortable than the iron throne or the great bench of meereen
gameofthrones,not_removed,love how its carved into the stone where did you find this
gameofthrones,not_removed,it seems that the game of thrones isnt really about the throne in kings landing but more i would say that even a wooden chair in winterfell might be a throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,jorah looks worse for wear here
gameofthrones,not_removed,so she is going to dragon stone right
gameofthrones,not_removed,the highest edge of the stone behind the throne is clearly a dragons head right i cant be the only one seeing that
gameofthrones,not_removed,honestly cersei can have kings landing her house is imploding and no longer has any allies on the continent if dany doesnt oust her the smallfolk will that is if she doesnt blow up the whole city of course which i think is pretty likely to happen
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really really hope that the show doesnt try to say this throne is made out of dragonglass its clearly sedimentary rock clear laminations and layers with a dip slope of degrees so theres no way it could be obsidian aka dragonglass
gameofthrones,not_removed,its gotta be dragonstone
gameofthrones,not_removed,odds of it being dragonstone are high but i hold out hope that it will turn out to be storms end that makes strategic sense given that her allies are the reach and dorne plus the symbolism of seizing the baratheons old seat of power the stones look kind of wind blown
gameofthrones,not_removed,whats up with people in the got world and their fascination with uncomfortable looking seats why not pillow throne or ergonomicallysoundspinesupporting seat
gameofthrones,not_removed,who can create the most uncomfortable throne to sit on that is the true game of thrones
gameofthrones,not_removed,they say she carved it herself from a bigger rock
gameofthrones,not_removed,those windows are definatly dragon stone not a doubt in my mind now
gameofthrones,not_removed,why would she want a throne in dragonstone
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres enough evidence that its dragonstone but looking at the way the previous season ended i thought she would be sail towards dorne looking at the map it makes sense for her to first head towards her alliances and then figure out a strategy otherwise youd have another battle of blackwater tyrion obviously wouldnt suggest attacking from dragonstone unless she has enough ppl on her side just having the dragons wont help
gameofthrones,not_removed,is anybody gonna discuss the hidden meanings behind that enigmatic piece of string on the bottom right corner all aboard the hype train
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt that the salt throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,i must say they make a sport of building uncomfortable thrones in westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,i am a show fan havent read the books yet and im trying to figure out what about dragon stone will help her and her dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,a dragon has three heads
gameofthrones,not_removed,what is it with westerosi monarchs and uncomfortable chairs
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats in dragonstone where danny was born and where i think she want to start conquering from
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love the geometry of this room whoever designed it did an excellent job
gameofthrones,not_removed,that chair doesnt look very comfortable i think dany is going to need a cushion or two to sit on that
gameofthrones,not_removed,wouldnt a lazy boy be more comfortable iron throne does not look comfy either
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wonder what the chain on the right is for i would like to think stannis and lady mel had sexy time there at some point
gameofthrones,not_removed,dany has her own throne wtf can jon get a real fucking throne instead of a wooden chair please
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love it though it looks very modern
gameofthrones,not_removed,what and why are those chains on the right there for
gameofthrones,not_removed,doesnt make sense for it to be dragonstone how could she take it over from stannis
gameofthrones,not_removed,honestly thats a shitty throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,looks terrible
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre right plus weve already seen the seastone chair in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,it seems like dragonstone but if thats the case it would be a bit weird because dragonstone is super close to kings landing if she has dragonstone theres not much stopping her from just flying drogon over to kings landing and burning down the red keep around cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,yep clearly dragonstone its fitting that daeneryss return to westeros be at the point of her departure aegon ruled spent half his time at dragonstone ruling from it and the aegon fort i believe its the only other true throne in westeros as far as the targaryens are concerned
gameofthrones,not_removed,it looks pretty cool im really sad we didnt get to see king stannis on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,why would she even go to the iron islands she formed an alliance with theon and yara who would be killed if they went back there
gameofthrones,not_removed,well aegon the conqueror did believe that a ruler should never be comfortable on the throne hence the iron throne and this rock throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,it doesnt look at all like obsidian there is supposed to be a lot of dragonglass on dragonstone though
gameofthrones,not_removed,looks more like your usual transgression regression mudsiltstone and sandstone interbedded goodness
gameofthrones,not_removed,not sure about the throne but the outside has a ton of dragon glass probably the biggest hoard of it in westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow my brain didnt even register that i think the pattern and contrast made me think the seat was in front of the stone your way is better
gameofthrones,not_removed,power resides where men believe it resides anything can be a throne if people believe it is one
gameofthrones,not_removed,a throne doesnt have to be grand or glorious or even real for that matter it is the symbology behind a throne that gives it power
gameofthrones,not_removed,people used to call chess castles it means game of strategy for kings and queens to take over the castle
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont see what youre talking about at all pls help
gameofthrones,not_removed,well now i see it
gameofthrones,not_removed,people fought for the mad king aerys for some houses it is black and white you fight for the kingqueen unconditionally which is why robert baratheon spared the houses that fought for the mad king they did their duty
gameofthrones,not_removed,im pretty sure the dragon glass on dragonstone was described as far beneath the surface in the minesquarries under the castle
gameofthrones,not_removed,try not to lose your panties if this show tries to say that
gameofthrones,not_removed,it being dragonstone would make more strategic sense that way she can souround her enemies with her vastly greater army and she would get a warning about euron coming at her doorstep with his ships since they will have to sail past here allies the big quantity of dragonglass on dragonstone would also prove to be a big help if she decides to give a hand at saving the world with the king in the norf
gameofthrones,not_removed,the stones look like interbedded shale and dirty sandstone shale is a metamorphic rock which forms under extreme heatpressure the extreme heat could come from a dragon so id say its more likely that a dragon blasted the rocks with flames resulting in a different rock type given their culture of fables i think they saw the changed rock and decided to call it dragonstone geologist here btw
gameofthrones,not_removed,aegon is logic a king should never sit comfortably in his throne it is not a time when a man should be at ease
gameofthrones,not_removed,iʻm voting for the great wooden chair of winterhell
gameofthrones,not_removed,targs had a thing for making uncomfortable chairs apparently something about kings not sitting easy
gameofthrones,not_removed,its symbolic dragonstone was the seat of power of her ancestor aegon targaryen before he invaded and conquered westeros even right down to its name it is a piece of targaryenvalyrian history on a more personal note dragonstone is where she was born it is from here that she and viserys fled after the rebellion
gameofthrones,not_removed,of her ancestor aegon targaryen before he invaded and conquered westeros even right down to its name it is a piece of targaryenvalyrian history on a more personal note dragonstone is where she was born it is from here that she and viserys fled after the rebellion plus its smart from a tactical perspective theres likely to be plenty of lore on dragons and its a springboard into westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,itll only be temporary shell probably take it quickly in one of the first episodes and use it to stage the rest of the war once she takes kings landing assuming its not burned to the ground shell use that for her seat of power
gameofthrones,not_removed,its symbolic dragonstone is where she was born where the targaryens first arrived in westeros from valyria and where aegon the conqueror began his conquest of the seven kingdoms
gameofthrones,not_removed,nothing but theyve got to drag out the season
gameofthrones,not_removed,because stannis was given dragonstone after robert became king its the traditional seat of the targaryens
gameofthrones,not_removed,but that really isnt the northern way
gameofthrones,not_removed,the northerners tend to rule beside their people the north is wild and untamed displays of a luxurious lifestyle would be frowned upon in their culture
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres chains on the left too i think theyre probably just camera or lighting rigging to be honest
gameofthrones,not_removed,a tennis sent his entire army north he even took his family
gameofthrones,not_removed,wat
gameofthrones,not_removed,pretty much exactly how the throne room on dragonstone is described in the books unlike the iron throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,we have i only remember a kraken fireplace and some old wooden chairs
gameofthrones,not_removed,no we havent
gameofthrones,not_removed,really musta been pretty lame since im basically a greyjoy groupie bc i dont even remember it
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats why she has advisors doing so would kill more innocent people
gameofthrones,not_removed,it makes perfect sense if her purpose is conquest which it is take a look at credit to for the image not only the strategic location she can attack kings landing from sea from land and the sky but no one is currently at dragonstone now that stannis is gone and not mention who could possibly stop her on an island absolutely no one and of course this is her birthplace this is her home very symbolic in her return imo it makes absolute perfect sense why she would want to go to dragonstone
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats literally how targaryans took westeros the first time its not weird at all
gameofthrones,not_removed,im gonna go ahead and disagree with you dragonstone is not a weird choice it being close to kings landing means its a strategic point stannis launched from there she has dragons she can do whatever she wants its her home its where she was born its where her family lived for centuries even prior to aegon i i dont think anyone is holding it or at least not a strong army so it would be easy to take ps my bf and i called this like months ago looks like a lot of us did so im pretty excited thats where it seems like shes going pps whats with the chain on the right side what was there before she got there so many questions
gameofthrones,not_removed,do you guys think the dragons will be ready for war this season im curious because hbo is really playing up how awesome the dragons will be but they didnt seem to be trained nearly well enough when we last saw them
gameofthrones,not_removed,well shes not just going to take her fleet and army directly from essos to kings landing without stopping somewhere to regroup resupply feed the horsesarmy gather intelligence etc etc as others have pointed out dragonstone is the perfect place for her to set up her base of operations before setting out for kings landing
gameofthrones,not_removed,because there is no reason to be queen of the ashes when she can keep the red keep for herself intact and still eventually take the iron throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,white walkers if kings landing gets invaded by them a good refuge would be dragonstone
gameofthrones,not_removed,people in the trailer thread were saying its the seastone chair like shes gonna sail literally around the entire continent when we have only a few episodes left
gameofthrones,not_removed,what about the great ikea wooden chair and table set of winterfell
gameofthrones,not_removed,it looked very different after post in the trailer
gameofthrones,not_removed,a throne could even be made out of porcelain
gameofthrones,not_removed,symbolism i believe the word youre looking for is ssssssymbolism
gameofthrones,not_removed,power is power
gameofthrones,not_removed,correct me if im wrong but isnt that from disneyland california adventure on the river rafting ride
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a huge stretch and dude is reaching imo its just a rock
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats why i suspect it will be dragonstone needs of the narrative and all that she lands on dragonstone there is some overworked sparring between her and cereei in which she demonstrates laudable concern for civilian life hence not just turning kings landing into the new harrenhal and then somehow contact with winterfell bran wargs a dragon maybe will convince her of the immediate head northward but ive been wrong before
gameofthrones,not_removed,that sounds good plus when my wife saw the trailer she said dragonstone without prompting so thats production design speaking to the audience last season taught me ockhams razor
gameofthrones,not_removed,fair enough
gameofthrones,not_removed,its for those who are destined to be dragon food
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont worry stannis will come back to dragonstone right right
gameofthrones,not_removed,the driftwood chair
gameofthrones,not_removed,sadly i think that was supposed to represent it its all we ever see balon sitting onwith the way they did the iron islands storyline in the show it wouldnt surprise me in the least bit
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont need to the iron islands story is already ruined
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha if youre a greyjoy groupie then u know everything about them in the show is lame book greyjoys are fucking amazing
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks for crediting me i am kinda happy to have called it that daenerys will reside in dragonstone to start her conquest from there its not confirmed i guess but i am confident it will be that way to be honest it only makes sense in my mind and i see no other way that would be more logical and fitting for the story
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean aegon the conquerer quite literally started his campaign the exact same way except kings landing was just a plot of land on the coast not a castle town
gameofthrones,not_removed,and its called dragonstone
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know it makes good strategic and thematic sense thats exactly why i think its a bit weird this promo is setting up cersei on the iron throne as a big image if dany has dragonstone means that cersei must immediately flee kings landing or at least the red keep or else risk being vulnerable to surprise dragon attack
gameofthrones,not_removed,but they built kings landing there was nothing there before now if they want to repeat the conquest exactly the first step is to attack the capital where cersei is it just feels kind of rushed is what im saying
gameofthrones,not_removed,i totally agree i think the idea that it could have been on the iron islands came from the alliance forged between the two but that being said its not the best location for conquering the kingdoms it seems fitting for her to be in dragonstone where itll all go down im so excited to see what she does even if she has gone a little power hungry and tbh i didnt notice the chains until you mentioned it and it could be just for the aesthetic of dragonstone
gameofthrones,not_removed,there are two more chains on the left side
gameofthrones,not_removed,would the chains have been for dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,they dont need training did you see them last season they were more on point than beyoncés backup dancers i think they can handle another fighthoweveri genuinely am worried about them underestimating the nights king
gameofthrones,not_removed,did you miss the end of last season or something they brutalized an entire army and drogon is massive
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wonder how the island can support such an influx of people from an agricultural standpoint im assuming they took a bunch of food that would make it to dragonstone without going bad the dothraki are going to have a rough go of it though the island probably has enough wild horse meat for each dothraki to have a tacos worth of meat for one night a taco bell taco that is not chipotle and that would be it
gameofthrones,not_removed,the north remembers cushions
gameofthrones,not_removed,nice reference lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,very helpful
gameofthrones,not_removed,see thats what i was thinking he meant but i didnt know for sure
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh for sure it could just be my imagination and thinking about dragons could make me see it more like those people who see jesus on toast im just curious if thats just me or if its maybe intentional
gameofthrones,not_removed,if anyone believes thats a dragon then i have an im offering up for sale i need about tree fiddy
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dunno if you look at it like there are three heads three dragons and the bottom right of the rock is close to the perspective of the viewer and the top of the rock is further away it makes it seem like three dragons are flying compare to op bottom right is one dragon middle near the outline of the chair is another then the one at the top stretching their heads out in flight from the seat itself
gameofthrones,not_removed,whats the real one like poppa
gameofthrones,not_removed,if anyone in westeros would use human shields to deter attackers its cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,we dont know the order of events dany could spend episodes at sea while cersei fucks up the realm
gameofthrones,not_removed,the problem with flying a dragon over a city and castle though is that some bugger with a ballista might kill the thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,when daenerys reaches the kings landing throne room it will be winter and the roof will be blown off im guessing her dragons make first strike but by the time the army gets there the wws are knocking on the door
gameofthrones,not_removed,two warring capitals being in close proximity does not mean the war will be rushed just look at the us civil war the usa and csa capitals were only miles apart yet the war lasted years
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea im guessing dany put them there if stannis ever used that chair he wouldnt have needed them
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wonder which dragons are gonna die before the end of the series one of them is certainly gonna die to make it a point that the white walkers arent to be underestimated
gameofthrones,not_removed,worried about the nights watch its the song of ice and fire song of jon snow and dany im a monkeys uncle if the two half targ kids dont end up ruling westerns and fighting off the white walkers as lovers in the end
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre right i saw it but somehow managed to forget that part i definitely need to rewatch after the season ended i read the books for the first time so i guess i had that timeline in my head
gameofthrones,not_removed,an island nation could also fish for food again a culture shock for the dothraki but food is food
gameofthrones,not_removed,the north remembers good posture and firm buttocks
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,so why is there red lines coming out of a rock kidding of course im just saying it looks nothing like a dragon
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,big black oily old
gameofthrones,not_removed,if only one side had dragons or airplanes
gameofthrones,not_removed,but in got theres an additional factor that makes the closeness of the castles a bigger deal dragons kings landing is within dragon range of dragonstone unless qyburn sciences up a way to counter dragons very quickly theres not much that can stop dany from just flying to the red keep on drogon and immediately winning the war cersei would have to flee kings landing if dany took dragonstone which is why i thought it was weird that the promo focuses on dany at what looks like dragonstone and cersei on the iron throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,my bet is on viserion drogon is too important to die in my opinion he is azor ahai
gameofthrones,not_removed,to me it would almost seem too cheesy to have them evolve into lovers
gameofthrones,not_removed,if they hook up it would just beweird for me not that matters but
gameofthrones,not_removed,your use of capital letters confuses me
gameofthrones,not_removed,sounds like a certain penis i have
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the infrared guided missiles would easily be able to lock in on fire made of flesh
gameofthrones,not_removed,i still am not following the promo is just a promo i wouldnt read much into it other than telling us danny will be at dragonstone whos to say she and her dragons wont tear up shit at kings landing relatively quickly her dragons will be the besides there are more factors than just cersei other than the obvious winter is coming and all that there could be a number of variables that prolong cerseis control for a while or postpone danny from overtaking kings landing euron greyjoy and his upcoming role perhaps dragonbinder more specifically lots of stuff can happen but whatever the case i dont think it will be too long before danny and her dragons attack kings landing we have episodes left in the series
gameofthrones,not_removed,a lot of people are to important to die in game of thrones most are dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,its their final form
gameofthrones,not_removed,jons the only male lead with a manhood still intact and of status of value left to dany who else
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was long boarding across campus and on mobile there was not a hidden message in my lack of grammar
gameofthrones,not_removed,firmbuttocks
gameofthrones,not_removed,the penis that was promised
gameofthrones,not_removed,seeing as shes infertile i dont really think it matters that she has kids i mean hey its cool that you want that to happen i just do not think that her being able to get married and bang or have kids is necessarily the ending im hoping for edit either way im sure ill be stoked with how the team creates the ending but i feel like there are more important things to ponder on like what kind of government will be standing after all is said and done would their current system dissolve do the children come back also jon may be infertile as well with the wholenecromancy thing maybe not though
gameofthrones,not_removed,in the melody of in zair
gameofthrones,not_removed,you might want to get that checked out if youve got a flaming sword there
gameofthrones,not_removed,youll get a flaming sword too if you make the
gameofthrones,not_removed,you ever fuck a river lands girl back in our day you werent a man until you fucked a girl from each of the seven kingdoms and the river lands we used to call it making the king robert poonhound baratheon
gameofthrones,not_removed,actually there is a theory that cercei and jaime are targaryens it would be ironic how tywin mistreated tyrion while tryion was his true son but i doubt this theory to be true
gameofthrones,not_removed,i want the citizens of westeros from the lowly peons of kings landing to cersei herself and the palace staff to find this out just before dany arrives i could see a rebellion with the people of the realm now having a justification to seek justice for cerseis misdeeds memories of the mad king will flood back and the surprised cersei will be executed bringing an end to the targaryen claim in westeros but whats this another dragons heir is seeking to claim the iron throne and is coming by sea i expect extremely fierce resistance leaving dany totally and utterly shocked by the time shes in the red keep shes a beaten woman who had not expected to be so loathed and what happens from there happens from there
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe them being together is a foreshadowing of their being targs were constantly reminded that targaryens very often kept it in the family
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh really that is pretty funny d makes me even more want it to be the case
gameofthrones,not_removed,aye and also with cersei seemingly going mad in the show like it be great twist if she getting targaryen madness
gameofthrones,not_removed,wait what those two from bwb arent dead neither is yara or bran is this more for what their purpose is in the overall story
gameofthrones,not_removed,back not dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes sorry should have clarified

gameofthrones,not_removed,i know some people dislike danys speeches but i enjoy them i must say my favorite one is from season before stepping into the pyre it perfectly illustrates that daenerys is a person who shows immense compassion but will also be utterly ruthless to those who would harm her people you will be my khalasar i see the faces of slaves i free you take off your collars go if you wish no one will stop you — but if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters as husbands and wives i am daenerys stormborn of house targaryen of the blood of old valyria i am the dragons daughter and i swear to you that those who would harm you will die screaming

gameofthrones,not_removed,cool story bro
gameofthrones,not_removed,johnny cash how original s
gameofthrones,not_removed,also the land bridge that existed between the continents was submerged under water by children of the forest magic which like the cave and the wall can be undone
gameofthrones,not_removed,daenerys is way east of the narrow sea look at a map of where slavers bay is the narrow sea is pretty far south oceans typically dont freeze over vast distances if its cold enough for the ocean to freeze it would probably be cold enough to kill the khalasar
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think the desert dwelling dothraki will enjoy the winter covered kingdoms very much
gameofthrones,not_removed,where was the bridge
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree freezing slavers bay is probably un reasonable but if she goes to mereen the retraces her ancestors path they would go to pentos by land and across to kings landing which is minor body of water and i think could freeze with everything going on
gameofthrones,not_removed,in dorne it was called the arm of dorne and connected westeros to essos the children of the forest destroyed it to try and stop men from coming in to their lands but it was too late
gameofthrones,not_removed,id say that even considering the scope of magic in the realm that freezing the narrow straight is highly improbable who would perform the feat the white walkers would have busted that out at hard home if they had it at best i could see a frozen land bridge around the stepstones but thats all the way down in dorne i think the effects of winter diminish the further south you go
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes i suppose this isnt a spoiler because you mention his execution in the title tywin has it melted down into two swordsoathkeeper which is given to brienne by jaime and widows wail which is given to joffrey for his wedding
gameofthrones,not_removed,god dammit the white walkers win their division no spoilers my ass
gameofthrones,not_removed,are half of you saying hodor
gameofthrones,not_removed,house stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive actually seen a jersey similar to this online they have some a good amount of the other houses as well not all are in stock though
gameofthrones,not_removed,hbo just stopped by
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe people are just calling you inbred
gameofthrones,not_removed,you look like if cersei actually had joffrey with robert and not just a secret bastard a legitimate baratheonlannister
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre also a doppleganger for but i have a strange feeling a homeland cosplay wouldnt be very widely recognised
gameofthrones,not_removed,i see a combination of jack gleeson joaquin phoenix and robert pattinson
gameofthrones,not_removed,you lol more like the vampire from twilight imho
gameofthrones,not_removed,you look like an older joffrey
gameofthrones,not_removed,did they have the costumes then looks cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,when you say official iron throne you mean the actual one they use on set
gameofthrones,not_removed,dudeyou look more like finn jones then jack gleeson
gameofthrones,not_removed,you definitely have the look of a lannister
gameofthrones,not_removed,gerion lannister before he went missing
gameofthrones,not_removed,you look like youre related to michael deluise
gameofthrones,not_removed,you look like robert pattinson and jack gleeson had a kid its a good thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre right you do look inbred
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre a baratheon the first born son of robert not a lannister
gameofthrones,not_removed,you look like youre the real joffrey and jack gleeson was playing you in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,except lannisters are specifically known for being blonde and green eyed
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah youre forehead looks like the port in lannisport
gameofthrones,not_removed,you are wearing the baratheon stag crown
gameofthrones,not_removed,they had a popup promotion i guess some sort of college tour promoting a few shows with roku tv
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats probably it
gameofthrones,not_removed,beat me to the joke
gameofthrones,not_removed,this was my first thought as well with the small image on my phone and my habit of ignoring titles its actually what i thought it was meant to be like a really well done image of what a grown up joffery would look like
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean the actor is alive
gameofthrones,not_removed,wew lad
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was thinking a lannistergreyjoy
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes also in the latest hitman movie much more recognizable if youre willing to shave your head
gameofthrones,not_removed,but how do you know what he lols like
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh man youre right
gameofthrones,not_removed,green eyed actually
gameofthrones,not_removed,as did joffrey
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean the actor is alive you mean that was literally your first comment on this page you didnt say anything that required you to restate with what you mean
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was thinking more like a lannisterbolton
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a hitman movie no one watches those
gameofthrones,not_removed,how do you not
gameofthrones,not_removed,cherish this picture forever
gameofthrones,not_removed,first the iron thronethen the imortal iron fist things are going smoothly for you
gameofthrones,not_removed,gracias will change
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is a no spoilers thread my man id be careful
gameofthrones,not_removed,writing gestapo on the prowl
gameofthrones,not_removed,is it really that hard for you to understand nonliteral figures of speech
gameofthrones,not_removed,you dont need an electric razor or even scissors to give someone a haircut theyve had sharpened weapons and dragonglass since they got there for the record i also think he looks better now than with that ridiculous moptop
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe its just me but i think the show never does enough to portray the horrors of war and the death and destruction as the direct results of the wars especially on noncombatant civilians thus the audience think lightly about the wars or just secondary to all the intrigues and conspiracies between nobles which are portrayed more heavily on the show still i disagree about joffrey and tommen to me they look like rulers that are likely to make mistakes that can lead to war or doom their reign one way or another unless if tywin is still around
gameofthrones,not_removed,as ned stark said your son has no claim to the throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,i see your point but i feel like the central theme in your argument is to maintain the status quo we can say this knowing this is a fictional show but if you actually lived under the rule of cersei a tyrannical sadistic powerhungry monarch if your children did i think you would feel differently i think you may be trying too hard to find a theme that may not be there at best stretching it compare cersei to any dictator in history they rule through fear and blood is it wrong to start a war to remove them from their seat of power if the common people unite under the pretext that blood will be shed from both sides but they are doing it to free future generations from a madmanwoman how is that not good how is it any better in the long run to allow a sadist to remain in a position that allows them to spread misery and death
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei isnt capable of keeping the realm in peace even if dany and jon or aegon didnt interfere just look at the debacle she caused in her pursuit of margaerys destruction if cersei were to be left to her devices everyone will end headless or incapable of feeding themselves
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre putting too much blame on ned he did not go to war to depose joffrey the war of the five kings was initiated by joffrey beheading ned leading to the north rebelling against the crown tywincersei had plans to placate the north by letting ned take the black and join the nights watch from a pure pacifist standpoint minimizing the body count you could lay even more blame on cersei and joffrey for going to war to hold on to an illegitimate throne a petty motive using your own words
gameofthrones,not_removed,im sorry but your logic makes zero sense if thats your reasoning for wanting cersei on the throne then why did you support robert in the first place he started a war apparently unjustified in your eyes at least with your logic and he then took the throne why would you support him in the first place with your logic when a king or queen murders innocent people war is unjustified in your eyes cersei murdering the people in the sept was ok and war in response isnt how does that work according to you it was justified to start a war over brandon starks and his fathers murder and the apparent kidnapping and rape of lyanna stark but when cersei and the lannisters do the same exact thing to the tyrells and targaryens it isnt justified your logic contradicts itself all danaerys is doing is taking back her rightful spot on the throne and you dont support her because murder of household leaders isnt a justifiable cause of war according to you unless its the starksbaratheonslannisters cersei did what the mad king was going to do and roberts rebellion was somehow justified yet the other way around it isnt justified why dany deserves to sit on the iron throne because she is the last known targaryen alive one last thing do you think the american revolution was justified if not im afraid i cant help you and youre clearly a tyrant or believe in tyranny and you would kneel for a king in todays day and age
gameofthrones,not_removed,i can definitely see where youre coming from that being said i think the best argument for a lannisterhouse baratheon of kings landing regime died at the fire bombing of the sept which claimed the lives of kevan lannister mace tyrell and margaery tyrell as well as irreparably severed ties between kings landing and olenna tyrell all four of whom were gifted pragmatic diplomats who for the most part seemed to work well together on matters of state with those four out of the picture cersei is rendered little more than yet another chaos candidate at this point i think jon snow represents the best chance left for longterm unity and stability given his proven ability to band some of the most unlikely of allies together
gameofthrones,not_removed,also lena headey is pretty great and the longer cersei reigns the longer we see her acting chops
gameofthrones,not_removed,without cersei there is no cleganebowl seeing as cleganebowl is confirmed get hype then clearly she is staying on the throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,a from you uleoofredkeep on rgameofthrones has been removed because of the following reasons all content must be respectful and mature please review the subreddits rgameofthroneswpostingpolicy and rgameofthroneswspoilerguide to better understand the content scope if you have a question or concern about this action please
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont like cersei but i do like your reading it would certainly be bittersweet to have the protagonists toil away at a war in the north while cersei ends the series still ruling westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,your support seems filmsy but ill take it now into the line
gameofthrones,not_removed,the show did on battle of the bastards thats it otherwise youre right
gameofthrones,not_removed,yep if itd been up to ned him and littlefinger would have gone into the throne room with a handful of men and placed stannis on the throne with very little or no bloodshed when that failed the ball was in joffreys court everyone told him that killing ned would lead to war and he did it anyway joffrey chose war to satisfy his own ego and sadism
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think blackwater did aswell specifically the wildfire section
gameofthrones,not_removed,what works in a book doesnt always work on tv you can only fit so much brutality into a single episode and since youve got to tell the main stories which are filled with brutality you also have to make time to tell the smaller stories which are coincidentally filled with brutality in fact after book its pretty much terrible shit happening everywhere in increasingly sick and sadistic ways a pov has a rising action climax and falling action but since an episode is a series of povs to fit a tv format they also have to make sure those stories are still creating an episode that has its own rising action climax and falling action you have to give a viewerreader room to breathe in a pov you can do that but when youre hopping from one pov to the next where multiple people are just getting chopped to bits it gets a little hard to watch eventually it comes down to cutting important content about the main story or making an episode where there is no release no feel good just a lot of brutality even botb and the red wedding had some lighter moments some times you look at some awful shit and youre like what could perk our viewers back up and suddenly youve got a terrible moment followed by a brothel scene the small folk are seen and mentioned plenty in my opinion the message is definitely heard well enough
gameofthrones,not_removed,and maybe the show will never really bring that aspect and end in a glorified victory of the wellmeaning over hidden piles of bodies rotting offscreen this got me thinking maybe thats where the white walkers come in they are an army of the dead and in the wake of the deaths caused by the fairly pointless wars fought for the throne there is no shortage of dead to be drawn into their fold kind of fitting that all the people who have been clamoring for war may have been simply feeding the monsters that will in the end be their doom i could imagine an insane scene in this scenario the night king and jon about to duke it out in the final battle and the night king breaks silence to ask jon if the fighting for power was worth it as now the bodies of all who died in that fight stand poised to crush the last of the powerful nobles who led westeros into ruin ironic no almost like the sins of the great would come back to doom them and the rest of the world especially poignant to us the viewers who have spent so much time obsessing over the affairs of nobles while the common man suffered and died by the thousand with every move how relevant in times such as our own perhaps there is a far more applicable lesson to this tale than weve ever realized
gameofthrones,not_removed,i am starting to get a troll vibe mostly when you said cersei wasnt sadistic powerhungry or to be feared either that or you havent actually watched the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,she is neither tyrannical i choose violence sadistic i enjoyed killing all your sparrows all your septons and septas or even powerhungry i should wear the armor and you the gown
gameofthrones,not_removed,if a woman in the city i live in decided to blow up a church killing thousands of people and inserting herself as the monarch of my country i feel like fears would be projected on her
gameofthrones,not_removed,only if theyre not short enough to merit decapitation or know too much of one of her crazy schemes
gameofthrones,not_removed,well then blame the lannisters for the first act of aggression by beseiging riverrun it was never neds intention to go to war he wanted cersei to peacefully leave kings landing with her children and go back to casterly rock cersei along with little finger conspired to kill robert and slaughter the stark men in the capital
gameofthrones,not_removed,she is there and leaving her there hurts no one she killed thousands of people to get there i dont doubt that she would kill thousands more to stayas long as she is ruler the people arent safe because she doesnt care about them one iota she would use them for her own purposes
gameofthrones,not_removed,dude by killing most of the tyrells she severed the supply of food to the capital how is that doing a decent job
gameofthrones,not_removed,never said i was
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is a terrifying post cersei is a manipulative psychopath and the entirety of her internal monologue makes this abundantly clear
gameofthrones,not_removed,you mean her verbal torture of sansa wasnt for fun cersei is needlessly cruel because she enjoys it not because shes threatened
gameofthrones,not_removed,most of the claimants to the throne are pretty awful people or at the very least pretty awful leaders but i dont think that cersei is in any way better besides incompetent leadership she is also hated and shares a good portion the blame shared with jamie robert baratheon tywin lannister and littlefinger for the most of the events that have gone down in the show i just think its a little naive to say that cersei isnt any of those things you mentioned when by her own admission she is
gameofthrones,not_removed,hahahaha it seems quite clear you are the one not understanding she fucking committed an act of terrorism on her own people you would like to be ruled by someone like that she has shown little to no ability to rule and inherited a crown massively in debt you dont want a bloodbath but what do you think the first thing she is going to do as queen probably attack high garden for its riches to pay back the iron bank she will be starting a bloodbath that you are so against anyways you think she will be cool with kitn jon snow not bending a knee to her no she will war over that as well look at her objectively and you will see in her all that you dont want in a ruler
gameofthrones,not_removed,well if the king is illegitimately on the throne who do you blame the guy calling him out or the illegitimate king as hand of the king i believe ned did have that right by what right do the lannisters falsely hold on to the throne the lannister initiated the first act of aggression by httpawoiafwesterosorgindexphpbattleinthehillsbelowthegoldentooth robb went to war to save his father which i dont see as a horrible thing and cersei threatening neds children to get him to falsely confess is reason enough to dislike her i get that you like the lannisters but i really dont see how you can award them some sort of moral superiority over ned i agree that he was somewhat short sighted and that ended up costing lives but in the end the lannisters are the ones going to war to hold on to power regardless of the suffering that falls on to the people
gameofthrones,not_removed,she had the option to return to casterly rock where she would be more or less untouchable instead she kills a bunch of people to seize power with the result of severing the food supply to the place she is governing then i believe she starts a war with dorne for revenge might be wrong here id have to go back and check i understand her justification but im saying she does things for selfish reasons without a ton of regard to how it will affect the ruled if she only wanted to live she could always have returned to her home but she always chose to go for power as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,talking with power doesnt need specifications
gameofthrones,not_removed,disagree do you remember her manipulation of tyrions trial to go the way she wanted thats a show thing do you remember her rearming the faith for the explicit purpose of attacking the tyrells thats a show thing do you remember how she had hundreds maybe thousands of innocent people killed so she wouldnt face punishment for her crimes and smiled as she watched thats a show thing do you remember her it felt good monologue where she said everything she does is because she feels like it thats a show thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei is not manipulative she got lancel to kill king robert she manipulated her entire trial to her advantage to kill her enemies at once and her manipulation is what caused the sparrows rise to power in the first place all among others of course you can say all you want about how well intentioned you think her manipulations are but i dont know what show youve been watching if you think cersei lannister has never done something manipulative
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei lannister did nothing wrong uegedal
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats part of being a psychopath justifying her actions she creates justifications but shes wrong
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei was a mother to sansa troll confirmed nothing to see here folks
gameofthrones,not_removed,that is the most ridiculous statement i have ever heard
gameofthrones,not_removed,that lizard bitch lmao i havent heard that one before
gameofthrones,not_removed,you pro terrorist troll shoo cercie is a crazy bitch you need to get your head screwed on right she killed innocent people you are a psychopath get outta here
gameofthrones,not_removed,they did start a civil war they murdered the king and usurped the throne whats the difference between cersei killing robert and installing an illegitimate joffrey on the throne vs ned arresting cersei and installing a legitimate stannis on the throne just because cersei did it first shes justified remember that cersei shed the first blood by killing the stark men after arresting ned even if you want to overlook assassinating robert the lannisters initiated the first battle by invading the riverlands i dont see how you can argue that ned started things maybe you could argue that catelyn started things off by kidnapping tyrion without sufficient evidence but even before that you can point to jaime for tossing bran out a window
gameofthrones,not_removed,with the exception of a fact i was unsure of the rest are facts throughout the story people tell her to return to casterly rock when she is in trouble with the mountain and her frenemies the tyrells she could have escaped you keep bringing things back down to insults whenever your position is challenged
gameofthrones,not_removed,she believed in tyrions guilt and she also believed in margaerys malevolence which was not completely invented as we saw perhaps it makes her paranoid not a psychopath shes paranoid and a psychopath they are not mutually exclusive just because she beloved those things to be true and was definitely wrong about one it doesnt make them so and her trying to have both of them killed because of it is the act of a violent psychopath as to the sept i accept no limits to selfdefense the high sparrow was responsible for getting these people killed not the person who was saving her own life how can you honestly say no limits to self defence so you think its ok for her to have hundreds maybe thousands of innocent people killed for her self defence i could not disagree more lets say that a criminal is running from the police is he justified in taking a hostage because of there being no limit to self defence its the same principle as the crimes cersei was on trial she was actually guilty of she wasnt falsely accused all charges against her we saw were correct its also not the high sparrows fault those innocents died he put her on trial for crimes she was guilty of thats what he was responsible for he didnt have the sept destroyed cersei did if he got what he wanted shed have answered for her crimes and no one else would have gotten hurt their deaths are on cersei and cersei alone and whoever helped her plot it the feel good monologue would be an issue if it were sincere but we have no reasons to think it is well thats a case of opinion she may be saying it to hurt septa unella but i think she just did it for herself she had no real reason to lie as no one else was there to hear her
gameofthrones,not_removed,let me try a scenario here prior to margaerys conversation she and loras break out of jail the kill cersei because they know without her pushing the high sparrow can be talked down and tommen can be free to pardon them are loras and margaery justified in killing cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh she was definitely targeting the tyrells she set the faith on loras as an attack against them then when the faith stiopped working for her she had the tyrells blown up you said she wasnt manipulative at all not that her manipulations were justified
gameofthrones,not_removed,you said she wasnt manipulative which she is i dont care if her actions were justified thats irrelevant to whether or not her actions were manipulative
gameofthrones,not_removed,from my point of view the redditors are evil
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre twisting yourself in knots to defend your favorite character but what if its unella she escapes but to be fully free and safe she has to blow up the red keep to kill the mountain cersei is in the red keep too and unella kills cersei to save herself from the mountain justified
gameofthrones,not_removed,be careful what you say next are you threatening someone to try and win an argument
gameofthrones,not_removed,better yet septa unella breaks out of the black cells and on her way to escape takes cersei hostage and then kills her is that justified
gameofthrones,not_removed,you really think cersei couldnt have stolen away in the dead of night if cersei hadnt wanted to murder her enemies she wouldnt have she had many choices before her she could have confessed and converted like margaery she could have run she could have begged for mercy from the hs her life was in no immediate danger cersei blew up shit because she enjoyed the pain of what she perceived as her enemies
gameofthrones,not_removed,cerseistyle
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is no way to justify how anything should be worth more to someone than their own life what about the lives of countless other innocent people who will pay the ultimate price for your crimes that seems like good justification to me to not do what she did the high sparrow is therefore responsible for lowering all possible restraints cersei might have had okay then lets propose a new situation a killer is sentenced to death but while on death row he escapes prison he goes on the run and kills someone to take thieir money and car to keep running that is a life threatening situation hes on death row and he has acted in self defence hes trying to stop himself being caught and punished for the crimes he committed is the judge or the original arresting officer responsible for the innocent person the killer killed or is the killer himself responsible this is pretty much the exact situation cersei is in except she killed a hell of a lot more innocent people died as a result of cerseis actions than as a result of the actions of the man in the situation i proposed
gameofthrones,not_removed,they didnt know that at the time they didnt know they had an option to convert so they are in the same position as cersei who didnt know if she would be given the chance to convert same situation
gameofthrones,not_removed,when unella kills cersei in her escape its justified
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think he is like
gameofthrones,not_removed,he becomes king when hes in the books if that is exact then hes about when he becomes king on the show and in season i suspect hes around or edit strange though on the httpgameofthroneswikiacomwikitommenbaratheonbehindthescenes it says hes which actually now that i think of it makes sense because tommen didnt have a regent in the show maybe
gameofthrones,not_removed,i believe loras mentions that tommen is eight in season one but that was before they changed actors
gameofthrones,not_removed,if we take it than he is the same age as bran then he would be sixteen in season sixroughly six years have passed since the beginning of the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes definitely aged up a lot book tommen is
gameofthrones,not_removed,they aged them up pretty sporadically arya and sansa were only aged up two years and joffrey was aged up four i guess they did it to better suit the actors they had playing them
gameofthrones,not_removed,cersei was queen regent in the show until she got stripped of her power by the faith
gameofthrones,not_removed,the wiki is not official and has their own one seasonone year system so they cant ge taken as a source i guess tommen is
gameofthrones,not_removed,years im pretty sure its more around years
gameofthrones,not_removed,its not as apparent with the stark sisters but in the first season jon and robb are supposedly and
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes i realize that its not accurate which is why i still suspect hes
gameofthrones,not_removed,well jon was in season one because catelyn says to ned you rode off years ago and came back a year later with a babethat would make dany in season one cause she is nine months younger than jonand in season tyrion says she is twenty meaning five years have passed plus one more in season sixi think the show goes by the one season one year approach even though they are usually very vague about time
gameofthrones,not_removed,probably i think im only slightly ahead of you in book honestly thats why i had that factoid ready
gameofthrones,not_removed,you mean in the first book because theyre definitely in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah not sure how old the actors were but they all looked a lot older than
gameofthrones,not_removed,well most of them are older in real life than the character theyre playing they wont get a year old possibly inexperienced actor to play such strong roles as robb and jon are same way they probably wouldnt have gotten an inexperienced year old the age joffrey is in season jack gleeson was to play a bold character like joffrey they do that with a tonne of actors theyll sacrifice something as meaningless as age in order to get someone who can play the part better
gameofthrones,not_removed,playing teenagers is very common in tv of course
gameofthrones,not_removed,hbos httpviewersguidehbocom is quite good and spoilerfree since you can choose the episode you want
gameofthrones,not_removed,also watch hbos lore videos on youtube they are narrated by the actors and really well made but if you are completely new to the show man prepare for an awesome ride you should probably stay off the internet completely if you know what will happen its only half the fun
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you good sir i will check out this link you provided and watch it with great focus
gameofthrones,not_removed,i shall search this as well on youtube indeed i have avoided pretty much all spoilers i am getting to know the characters so that when i do watch complete episodes i will know the goingsons without issue i will be watching the episodes on a inch projector with surround sound source material will be from an untouched iso thank you kind sir
gameofthrones,not_removed,good luck enjoy and dont give up until the end of the season got is the kind of show that builds up through the season and have a climax in the last two episodes so sometimes we have a really slow episode but amazing episodes and
gameofthrones,not_removed,im jealous i wish i hadnt seen the series to binge watch all of it like it was the first time have fun

gameofthrones,not_removed,relax dude its a joke chill
gameofthrones,not_removed,magic was being used to keep volcanoes from erupting eventually the magic wasnt strong enough anymore and the volcanoes erupted it sounds like the place iswas a very active volcanically
gameofthrones,not_removed,volcano httpiceandfirewikiacomwikidoomofvalyria
gameofthrones,not_removed,brace yourselves tinfoil is coming
gameofthrones,not_removed,volcano or the faceless men or a volcano that erupted because of the faceless men
gameofthrones,not_removed,volcanoes all blowing at the same time
gameofthrones,not_removed,nobody really knows what caused the doom we know that the actual doom was a series of volcanic eruptions earthquakes and tsunamis caused by the latter as to what caused them there are a lot of theories some say that the valyrians were experimenting with strong magic and caused the doom some say the faceless men were behind it and some say that it was just a natural disaster although this is unlikely in my mind there are so fucking many theories about the doom and a lot of them are very interesting i suggest watching the last harpys video on the doom for a little taste of what the community has conjured up
gameofthrones,not_removed,the faceless men in giving the slaves of valyria the gift of death they wiped out the civilization
gameofthrones,not_removed,some characters say that it was the price they paid for all of their blood magic and incest
gameofthrones,not_removed,the most powerful and raw force of all plot
gameofthrones,not_removed,the volcano where they found the dragons
gameofthrones,not_removed,volcanoes all erupted at once also planteros is magical and shit so these volcanoes are all like the super volcanoes from before and after
gameofthrones,not_removed,a bunch of wizards
gameofthrones,not_removed,the doom occurred when fourteen volcanoes situated around valyria all erupted in a single day completely destroying it there are many speculations and theories why and here are a few the magic used to control the volcanoes was maintained by fire mages under to control of the dragonlords but many of these mages were killed by rival dragonlords so the spells to hold the volcanoes back were weakened and thus the doom occurred that the curse of garin the great that valyria would be destroyed had come into effect that the valryians had put spells but due to their hunger for wealth and slaves that the spells around the fourteen fires were weakened and the cataclysm became unavoidable that it was a natural disaster that the priests of rhllor called down the power of their god in queer rituals the least likely theory is that their belief in a hundred gods caused them to delve too deep and unleashed the seven hells on them
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe grrm was being literal when he said no one knows what caused the doom﻿ you can thank me later
gameofthrones,not_removed,reality tv
gameofthrones,not_removed,my moms oven
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean i understand maybe building a small colony near where they found the eggs but putting your whole kingdom next to an active volcano magi or not is a terrible idea
gameofthrones,not_removed,they were like landlocked inside this huge ring of volcanoes sheltered away from the wars of the ghis empire then they found dragons had like wars with ghis and came out to rule essos then westeros they had their like main city with mad dragons in valyria and they got merked
gameofthrones,not_removed,think about it more as a fault line and the cities multiple were all built around it because that is where the production centers were images down for a side by side
gameofthrones,not_removed,it just goes to show how much your pride or ego can blind you
gameofthrones,not_removed,speaking of pride i meant paid im sure what happened there but yeah thats why the targaryan family left one member i think foresaw what was going to happen and them and one if they house fled valaria and made westerose what we know it to be in the current timeline
gameofthrones,not_removed,nope they left and moved to dragonstone
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think at that point in roberts life all the shit he did seemed like some kind of fairy tale or game or i dont know to him point is he wasnt taking his past seriously anymore jaime telling robert the mad kings last words brought him back to thinking about how fucked up and serious everything in his past actually was thats my take on it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think robert finally realized jamie is not and has never been on roberts side
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats possible though i dont know how robert wouldnt be well aware of what happened youd think someone would have asked but it may just be him remembering what he already knew side note isnt a bit odd how selmy looks at robert with something very close to contempt with his story but with jaime he seemed more interested and glad to listen maybe selmy didnt dislike jaime despite the whole kingslaying incident
gameofthrones,not_removed,roberts face is one of being disconcerted more than shocked he realizes that hes tapped into something very serious to jaime in the middle of his silly chiding effyouoctopus and the replies to him explain the rest
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha whoosh
gameofthrones,not_removed,my name is jamie lannister after years in aerys kings guard i have realized my one goal to save this city but to save my city i have to become someone else something else i am the kingslayer
gameofthrones,not_removed,jaime saved alot of people killing the king to him felt like justice in my opinion he is a servant of justice and would of made a great king himself but people are not so simple he is now a broken man this sums it up quite well
gameofthrones,not_removed,im pretty sure jaime never told anyone why he killed him people just assumed he had sided with the rebellion and broken his oath to aerys but nobody gave a shit robert didnt punish it for him but the name stuck kingslayer jaime never told anyone he saved the city and everyone in it until he told robert and later brienne its basically the most important thing he did in his life an heroic deed yet from that day until now hes been chastised for it
gameofthrones,not_removed,robert never understood how legitimately good jaimes reason was for killing him until that moment
gameofthrones,not_removed,i believe its a display of shock as it epitomizes how insane king aerys was right until the end
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think robert was grandstanding and it backfired he seemed slightly embarrassed not shocked to me
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think a lot of comments here are giving robert and barristan too much credit jaime says that the mad king was saying burn them all but doesnt elaborate on what that means so robert and barristan probably dont know the full extent of the good jaime did they can only sort of speculate
gameofthrones,not_removed,i saw this scene again shortly before seeing this post i always assumed robert was too busy being a drunken ass and mocking jamie that he forgot the seriousness of that situation i guess as many have suggested its possible he had never bothered to ask jamies motives and assumed something less heroic but i think robert was just being an ass and put his foot in his mouth is also likely
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think its less him putting two and two together its a bit of a leap lets be honest he was like shit man thats deep we all have one of those friends that gets a little too real a little too quickly and jaime is doing that here
gameofthrones,not_removed,well robert was lightly shitting on jamie for what he perceived as him feeling better than the conversation kind of like the guy who says that he doesnt kiss and tell he did what dudes do and brought up the fattest ugliest chick he had sex with metaphorically to get him to talk about it jamie gave him a very straightforward answer and it wasnt a pretty picture
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive always interpreted it as robert realizing that he at least partially misjudged jaime
gameofthrones,not_removed,when robert is guessing what aerys last words were he asks if he called a traitor or begged for a reprieve robert thought of aerys as being a cruel weak coward with at least some semblance of reason left jaimes comments suggest something more feral the same thing hed been saying for hours burn them all i think that moment was when robert grasped that aerys wasnt just cruel he was truly insane
gameofthrones,not_removed,he was trying to mock jaime and jaime threw it back in his face and made him look bad thats it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont remember this in the books at least im pretty sure its not in the first one if this is in the book that would explain why robert didnt distrust jaime as much as ned did
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think that it was because robert wanted something loud and exciting or expected like huebleblurble or please no instead he effectively got the equivalent of someone demanding an alltooreal mass murder
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think its because robert said it a joking way and jaimie gave him a real answer
gameofthrones,not_removed,he realised that the mad king was truly mad and that jaime pretty much saved the city he probably didnt know just how insane the mad king had become until hearing his last words because we dont have strong enough context of roberts rebellion we dont know if roberts friends were burned at the stake under the mad kings command it could just be that burn them all brings bad memories the shock is most likely just robert realising how insane the mad king actually was
gameofthrones,not_removed,hi guys i just found a tinfoil hat lying around so i thought i pick it up i can see it like after the news of rhaegar falls jaime threaten the mad king about how the lannisters will take over kings landing and how love of a brother that wanted to see his sister to be married to a prince rhaegar but the mad king never wanted cersei and rhaegar choose lyanna instead thus bring us to mad king want to burn all plus the lannisters who are at the gates which brings us the kingslayer moment for jaime he sits on the iron throne afterwards which makes ned stark look at him entirely different this is why ned keep trying to keep reminding robert that it is not their man who is at kings landing when the war at trident is over its the lannisters but robert keep saying that theres nothing to worry about cause the lannisters give him the iron throne which the plan of cersei bemarried to robert rolls on ok here take this tinfoil
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is how i read the situation as well basically robert had turned his past into a fairy tale the mad old king was some bad guy out of a childrens tale and robert was the hero who fought for his princess but wasnt able to save her he had romanticized the tale but jaimes story brought back the truth of it all of thousands died and in the end jaime who had born the brunt of scorn for years in the show in the book was the true hero who sullied his name and his vows to save of thousands from a fiery end
gameofthrones,not_removed,to build upon this he wasnt even on his fathers side he was on the peoples side and thats something any king would be right to fear
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think thats a fair reading robert is smarter than that he never thought jaime was on his side thats why hes so contemptuous of him earlier in the scene he thinks of jaime as a traitor at most this scene made him realize jaime had a good reason to do what he did but most likely he was just upset by being reminded of what the mad king did to so many people and made him remember that his youth wasnt all that great after all
gameofthrones,not_removed,you really think so i doubt hed mock jaime to his face is that was the case
gameofthrones,not_removed,i missed that
gameofthrones,not_removed,selmy knew that jaime had the balls to do what he couldnt sacrifice honor for the realm
gameofthrones,not_removed,well selmy knew jaime and like us is probably able to see the logic and bravery behind the kingslaying on the other hand he has guarded for twenty years a king who is irresponsible and insults everyone around him
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is weird that in years robert never found out what aerys last words were seems like something hed want to know the next day
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think its this the way jaime says it feels weird to me no your grace or anything of the sorts a dead stare into the eyes and the last words spoken probaly as menacing as aerys spoke them
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree he doesnt really know what to make of such a serious reply to trying to joke and poke fun at jaime he is also very drunk in this scene so i think even if he tried to he wouldnt have been able to think too mich about what jaime meant by that statement
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah this is how i took roberts reaction
gameofthrones,not_removed,this parallel works really well what with cersei and felicity both blowing up cities without remorse and emotionally abusing jaimeollie
gameofthrones,not_removed,you know the kind of kingsguard that does nothing but maintain his honor and wonders why the realm sucks well that was me everytime something good happened something horrible was waiting around the corner the seven that is when i realized something had to change so i sacrificed my honor and killed my king im just trying to be a better person my name is james
gameofthrones,not_removed,and if he was king cersei could still be queen just say hey aerys and his ancestors married their sisters just keeping up tradition and tywin probably be cool with it because hey king and queen lannisters and legitimate lannister heirs
gameofthrones,not_removed,gives much more weight to the scene where he is looking at the kingsguard achievement book and looks at his blank pages
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea he never gets into specifics until the hot springs with brienne right i stopped watching this show for a year or two until one day at my cousins i happened to catch the hot springs scene after hearing jamie finally describe what occurred i realized this show was so much more elaborate and deep than just some silly fantasyincestdragon show
gameofthrones,not_removed,what
gameofthrones,not_removed,some mistakes in your lore knowledge and a bit confusing structureenglish but otherwise id say good conclusion definitely not tinfoil
gameofthrones,not_removed,except when any of those people catch him and cersei together
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think robert thought that jamie killed the mad king for him that jamie believed in his cause now robert is realizing that jamie did it to keep the people alive and he isnt safe from jamie like he thought he was
gameofthrones,not_removed,imo robert isnt smart at all hes kind of an idiot often regarded as being able to win the throne but not knowing what to actually do with it also to keep a kingslayer on the kingsguard means you probably trust him a lot and thought he actually killed the king for you robert asked if the mad king called jaime traitor before he killed him this very obviously infers from robert that he thought jaime was killing him to clear the way for robert not for his own reasons
gameofthrones,not_removed,ive never thought of it that way but that makes sense actually didnt book barristan once lament rescuing king aerys from a lord holding him hostage at one point saying if he would have just let him get killed maybe it would have prevented a lot of tragedy
gameofthrones,not_removed,well the mad king ordered jaime to bring his fathers head to him and was about to basically fuck up house lannister which made it a lot easier to jaime to act like he did
gameofthrones,not_removed,insults are a world away from blowing up ones subjects
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think jaime told anyone but tywin but maybe im wrong
gameofthrones,not_removed,except i slightly like parts of cerseis character but felicity makes me wanna kill myself
gameofthrones,not_removed,i still dont understand why he kept it a secret im still early in the books and i suppose something hints at why he would keep it a secret seems like its not something that could be turned against him he did a heroic action and has been labeled a kinglsayer since then with zero gain im guessing its an internal conflict he had to chose between his duty to aerys and his duty to the family and ended up having to chose duty to the people something his dad would prob consider weaksauce
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea or maybe thought jamie realized robert was going to win the rebellion and switched sides and killed the king to save his life but after this conversation it became very clear thats not what happened at all
gameofthrones,not_removed,robert constantly treat jaime with contempt so i am pretty sure he believes that jaime was never on his side and was just an honorless turnclock who killed the king to save his own skin in this scene he realized he was maybe wrong after all and that he his the one acting like an ass
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh i see now thank you
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think robert trusts jaime at all he doesnt act like he trusts him the only person he trusts is ned he even says that himself im pretty sure robert thinks jaime killed aerys because aerys was going to lose and jaime wanted to be on the winning side thats what tywin and the rest of the lannisters did and its what pretty much everyone else thinks
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes he wished he didnt rescue him at duskendale and that he died there so that rhaegar would be crowned the new king of westeros barristan had much trust and hope in rhaegar after being rescued aerys paranoia and madness got even worse
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was a comparison between jaime and robert not aerys and robert
gameofthrones,not_removed,he definetly told tyrion at some point but yea he didnt tell a lot of people
gameofthrones,not_removed,i liked felicity in the beginning but holy hell did she get annoying i had to stop watching that show because it got so ridiculously bad every single person who died would just come back the next episode it came to the point where i didnt give a shit who died because i was sure theyd be back
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think we enjoys talking about it and why it was so emotional for him to tell brienne also probably not a good idea to go around telling everyone there is wildfire all over kings landing in the sewers
gameofthrones,not_removed,to add to this i think robert always saw jamie as a turncloak and this exchange showed that jaime wasnt as traitorous as robert thought
gameofthrones,not_removed,kill felicity already shes a show only character then they have the balls to kill black canary arrow after season is 👎🏻
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah hadnt thought about the wildfire issue i guess telling anyone there is a giant bomb under the city would be a bad idea esp with cersei around p
gameofthrones,not_removed,hate to be that guy but season was a pile of poo as well penicillin tea and the will to live felicity hacking a plane felicity wearing the atom suit the constantly mismatched flashback storyline no oliburr and of coursemy personal favouritefelicity standing up to ras in nanda parbat who then basically told her to go have sex with oliver which she did in a scene that took up minutes of an episode that promised hella magic and proper use of the lazarus pit
gameofthrones,not_removed,everyone knows season was shit season was worse later season start of season was alright at best
gameofthrones,not_removed,im still amazed at that whole scene and the music and the shock the light of the seven got me even more that the winds of winter
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,could margery have climbed inside a fridge and survived
gameofthrones,not_removed,rewatching the shoe show right now and the way she manipulates joffrey is masterful she didnt deserve this
gameofthrones,not_removed,absolutely heartbreaking work this is extremely good
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like it especially the melting rose pin
gameofthrones,not_removed,am i the only one that was disappointed we didnt see margaery and loras killed on screen i know that the wildfire explosion was incredibly fast but i wouldve liked to view it not because i dislike the tyrell characters but just because they were such major characters
gameofthrones,not_removed,at least it was quick i hope she wasnt one of the people you could see getting flung into the air gonna miss that foxy lady
gameofthrones,not_removed,too soon
gameofthrones,not_removed,the saddest thing is even if she had escaped from the keep she still wouldve died
gameofthrones,not_removed,still recovering from the fact that shes completely gone from the show it just happened so fast
gameofthrones,not_removed,love you always queen margaery but disappointed cause you dont have to do the walk of atonement
gameofthrones,not_removed,amazing
gameofthrones,not_removed,still not over her dying she was my favorite female character shrewd a legit rival of cersei and also hot
gameofthrones,not_removed,aww thats too depressing
gameofthrones,not_removed,rip my little queen c
gameofthrones,not_removed,pretty gruesome this artist has some other fantastic work as well
gameofthrones,not_removed,that is brilliant bravo
gameofthrones,not_removed,y u do dis
gameofthrones,not_removed,really took me by surprise i was expecting her to somehow be involved in the downfall of the religious fanatics it seemed thats where things were going and then boom literally it all changed i guess thats one of the aspects that makes game of thrones so good its not predictable
gameofthrones,not_removed,growing strong
gameofthrones,not_removed,im saddened by the fact i probably wont see natalie dormer on this show anymore shes a fucking goddess
gameofthrones,not_removed,still sexy
gameofthrones,not_removed,too soon
gameofthrones,not_removed,c
gameofthrones,not_removed,you spend all the time making an awesome digital painting and then sign your watermark right across the middle is it just me or it ruins the piece as art someone could still trivially photoshop it out if so inclined and the people that wouldnt dont get to enjoy it as much
gameofthrones,not_removed,triggered
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is kind of hilarious
gameofthrones,not_removed,sad but had to be done my queen did what was necessary see it as the bombing of hiroshima necessary evil for a greater cause
gameofthrones,not_removed,motherf that music i have to listen again thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah dd have brought some amazing scenes to life on the screen more than enough to make up for dorne
gameofthrones,not_removed,shhh margaery is azor ahai
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was upset i didnt get to see margaerys walk of atonement
gameofthrones,not_removed,she was inside the bell
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,no but she mightve ducked under a dumpster
gameofthrones,not_removed,she had one of these positive pressure bubbles they use in harry potter for breathing underwater she is safe
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean we technically didnt see her die on camera yes the wildfire engulfed everyone but she could of survived like stannis we just assumed he died because we saw brianne swing her sword but never making contact with stannis we see the sparrow go up in flames though that was satisfying
gameofthrones,not_removed,what did you find inside the shoe im curious
gameofthrones,not_removed,just the adjective i was thinking
gameofthrones,not_removed,wildfyre must be as hot as dothraki soup
gameofthrones,not_removed,shhhhhdont point that out or we will spend weeks reading theories about how they survived
gameofthrones,not_removed,tdog magically crosses universes and drags them out sacrificing himself because he is the ronetruedog
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont worry guys i think i saw a dumpster in the middle of the sept
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think to see their deaths you cant have it be because of a wildfire explosion anymore which probably affects the plot with the whole jaime cersei aerys wildfire theory i cant think of a way to show a person dying in an explosion its pretty much split second
gameofthrones,not_removed,one of my favorites characters and melisandre
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it was more impactful to have it centered on the high sparrow
gameofthrones,not_removed,i enjoyed seeing the high sparrow go up in flames more
gameofthrones,not_removed,the great sept of baelor was the building that exploded the red keep is the palace
gameofthrones,not_removed,and that was the moment tommen was hated by the fan base even though it would be horrible we all wanted it
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was lit fam
gameofthrones,not_removed,burning bright
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a piece shared on deviantart they are notorious for stealing work if all you release is watermarked prints they are less likely to feature your work in ads without telling you never post anything on the internet without a watermark prints can be purchased without watermarks thats how you get paid in digital media as for the shopping it out its the same thing as locks keeping an honest man honest
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes protecting his work
gameofthrones,not_removed,eh but her phoniness was often in the best interest of the kingdom and keeping peace and stability well never know long term the influence she wouldve had on joffery but she did make him more likable to the people and in that way made the kingdom more stable joffery seemed somewhat smitten by her entirely more so than he ever was with sansa just not puppy in love like tommen and she could have been the only other person hed listen to besides tywin and pretty sure only because he was scared of his grandfather her death was bittersweet because despite all her efforts and knowing cersei was going to fuck things up she was trapped and died this image kinda breaks my heart a little
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont hate her but i do think that she was playing with firelol as she tried to grab as much influence as she could she wasnt a victim she was an informed player in the game of thrones and as we all know in that game there are only two outcomes
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre almost certainly alone people myself included loved her character am i kinda glad she was taken out to make way for the new order of royalty with daenerys or the northerners maybe but im really gonna miss her character
gameofthrones,not_removed,she wasnt an all bad influence she felt disgusted by the people she was helping but she still did it she was calculated and manipulative but werent all of the influences she was trying to bring about positive make the people happy fed and safe they will insure the roses keep growing strong
gameofthrones,not_removed,you literally just committed suicide there
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it was perfectly in character for her as a master of manipulation it also put her in a position where in her final moment she could argue with the high sparrow she would not have been able to do so if she still was a prisoner like loras and it gave the scene more of that sense of impending doom also i think the plot line worked like a red herring that she had a lot more planned for her making it even more chocking having it blown out in an instant
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh and rob starks entire campaign was destroyed such bad writing also i wanted to see eddard on the wall to see whats up bad writing
gameofthrones,not_removed,go away
gameofthrones,not_removed,just an fyi you can say motherfucker all you want
gameofthrones,not_removed,next youll tell me shes a secret targaryen
gameofthrones,not_removed,tits everywhere
gameofthrones,not_removed,it still blows my mind that they used that take
gameofthrones,not_removed,they blew up the cameraman
gameofthrones,not_removed,could have
gameofthrones,not_removed,we see him get engulfed in flames but then the scene cuts to the explosion there is still a chance that he manage to put a out the fire and went to see a maester to get healed or something no character is really dead until we see him with the googly eyes rocks on his face
gameofthrones,not_removed,except inch of lead isnt enough to stop the gamma rays and he was tossed out of the town and bounced along the ground should have been enough to at least break a few bones
gameofthrones,not_removed,okay but an old man would get fucked up hard if he went flying in that fridge
gameofthrones,not_removed,literally ground zero in a tiny fridge thrown hundreds of feet
gameofthrones,not_removed,gendry
gameofthrones,not_removed,that soup scene was so weirs when i rewatched it d gold melted instantly
gameofthrones,not_removed,syrio secretly pulled them away just before the explosion
gameofthrones,not_removed,they were able to get under a dumpster at the last second
gameofthrones,not_removed,the lord of light saved margery because there is still one more king for her to sleep with and that king knows nothing of whats to come well he knows that one thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,they didnt survive and that was the saddest fucking part there was a split second where i thought maybe they had survived maybe dd hadnt just killed off one of the most bad ass chicks of the show unceremoniously off screen to further cerseis storyline but then the camera panned out to show the area surrounding the sept also being annihilated and i just lost it
gameofthrones,not_removed,they did survive now margaery is going to come back saying that she is the reincarnation of the maiden with no church to question her beloved by the people and with the armies of dorne coming to help her she will dethrone cersei because she has a legitimate claim to the throne but shell need a man to legitimize her claim to the throne a beautiful man from a powerful family who is destined to betray cersei in the end jamie lannister marries margaery to prove to himself that cersei cares about more than just the iron throne and thus leaves her without power and without children
gameofthrones,not_removed,wtf is that subreddit
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont watch the walking dead but that guy followed me on twitter when i had one
gameofthrones,not_removed,a refrigerator you mean
gameofthrones,not_removed,i almost forgot the other reason i refuse to continue that show the finale made me forget wow
gameofthrones,not_removed,right if anything there was just the tiniest moment available to show one character blowing up in the explosion and they rightfully showed us the high sparrow going up in flames which was much more satisfying to see and less sad than watching the poor tyrells burn to death
gameofthrones,not_removed,lannisters have killed some of the most beloved characters at tye sept of baylor i just realized ned and margarey were both killed there
gameofthrones,not_removed,you know it would have just been another body double like lena had
gameofthrones,not_removed,the only lannister hated less than tommen is probably myrcella
gameofthrones,not_removed,its not the concept or general use of a watermark thats bad its specifically the placement across the center of the image this image would have been awesome for a phone background or something but the giant obnoxious watermark running across the center of the picture is really dumb
gameofthrones,not_removed,protecting it by ruining it
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes not alone i never cared for margery i think the whole tyrell plot was boring frankly apart from olenna
gameofthrones,not_removed,people only loved her character because shes hot and her outfits show tits
gameofthrones,not_removed,exactly she was great at playing the game and her only real mistake was not realising cersei was fookin crazy
gameofthrones,not_removed,language
gameofthrones,not_removed,shame shame shame
gameofthrones,not_removed,watch your profanity
gameofthrones,not_removed,watch yo profanity
gameofthrones,not_removed,shes a secret targaryen
gameofthrones,not_removed,shes a secret targaryen
gameofthrones,not_removed,shes a secret targaryen
gameofthrones,not_removed,i liked it shia usually comes off as boisterously fake to me but this take sounded somewhat natural
gameofthrones,not_removed,what
gameofthrones,not_removed,how does this not have more upvotes
gameofthrones,not_removed,because its khal drogo when he wants molten gold it happens immediately because he is just that intimidating
gameofthrones,not_removed,the wildfyre was a faceless man
gameofthrones,not_removed,margery loras somehow surviving the wild fire would still feel more plausible than that bullshit
gameofthrones,not_removed,in a fridge
gameofthrones,not_removed,he knows how to please a woman and thats all he needs to know
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think it just speaks to the fact that lots of smart people who are capable and are in the midst of a cool plan get killed being smart and clever and noble dont grant you magical immunity only being tyrion arya or magical dany give you actual magical immunity
gameofthrones,not_removed,i had that thought for a second too during the initial blast that maybe she barely survived
gameofthrones,not_removed,memorial for the worlds greatest hero
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a walking dead thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,why they had to butcher the finale i would be okay with what they did but they spent an hour leading up to it and all we got was negans introduction without said scene from the comics
gameofthrones,not_removed,if they felt it necessary they could have easily put them in the same shot as the high sparrow but i think they were making a dramatic point like anya in buffy that main characters are still just people and people sometimes just die with no big hoorah
gameofthrones,not_removed,i doubt it natalie dormer has done all her nude scenes in other historical tv shows see tudors lena headey had a body double because she was uncomfortable with being naked on screen or just plain didnt want to
gameofthrones,not_removed,but she dropped robe for renly in season just sayin
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe not lena is after all edit really with the downvotes do you really think its an insult to think that an international star known for her beauty wouldnt want people to see her slightly aged body this is a business and her image is her brand
gameofthrones,not_removed,jaime tyrion tygett
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats the point you can get those assets by going to the persons site and downloading them they get the traffic revenue on their sites and some of them even have a patreon account with patron exclusives like wallpapers without the watermark again how you make money in digital media
gameofthrones,not_removed,well in a way yes without this watermark anyone can simply save the image and do whatever they want with it its not like this is the only copy of the artwork the artist has
gameofthrones,not_removed,well i can agree there i didnt like the tyrell plot itself but her character was really cool and if youre not alone youre in the minority especially on this sub lmao
gameofthrones,not_removed,or rather she was the only one who realized that but hadnt gathered the power to do anything about it yet
gameofthrones,not_removed,i need to watch that again
gameofthrones,not_removed,fuck that
gameofthrones,not_removed,predicted that well maybe she is a red priestess
gameofthrones,not_removed,but she could have survived could of makes no sense
gameofthrones,not_removed,if you watched the rest of the movie its pretty clear he didnt
gameofthrones,not_removed,well it was made at
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow at least put
gameofthrones,not_removed,context
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wouldnt even mind if they somehow survived and margery was disfigured like twoface
gameofthrones,not_removed,king pod the rod confirmed
gameofthrones,not_removed,what about snow and his reanimation trick can someone please revive this margaery puddle
gameofthrones,not_removed,no i know that i didnt know t dog has such a huge fan base
gameofthrones,not_removed,also because she was visibly pregnant at the time
gameofthrones,not_removed,pretty sure it was her boobs in i dont think she has a discomfort with being naked or maybe just topless on screen but shooting a scene like that one naked outside and with a very large amount of people in very close proximity she discussed it on some talk show saying it didnt really have to do with her being pregnant
gameofthrones,not_removed,she was phenomenal in turdors absolutely loved her in that show
gameofthrones,not_removed,and still hugely hot
gameofthrones,not_removed,cmon jaime just because hes gotten better since getting his hand chopped off doesnt make him a saint tyrion is easily one of my top favorite characters but i have no delusions that everyone feels that way tygett appears only in name so i dont think he even counts
gameofthrones,not_removed,you can get those assets by going to the persons site and downloading them they get the traffic revenue on their sites thats not the case here httpertacaltinozcgsocietyorg and they both have the same watermark even the one posted on the site named in the watermark of course hes allowed to use big obnoxious watermarks to make sure he gets credit when his images are shared and im allowed to say that putting big obnoxious watermarks in the middle of an otherwise awesome piece is dumb and detracts from the artwork
gameofthrones,not_removed,im ok with that
gameofthrones,not_removed,is anyone going to address the fact that he just said language
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow i got destroyed i guess everyone is tired of the gendry jokes
gameofthrones,not_removed,s a major character appeared to be eaten like completely surrounded by a horde no possible way out you can see guts being torn apart devoured by zombies only for it later to turn out that hed managed to crawl under a nearby dumpster to escape while the undead ate his friend without so much as a scratch on him not that i wanted him to die but it was a total cop out they frickin showed his wife grieving after hed been gone for days and days before being like gotcha he was alive all along they obviously wanted to try and give the emotional impact of a loss without actually throwing away one of their fan favourites ended up feeling cheap so people are quite scathing about that choice by the showrunners
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was a really lamecheap plot point in the latest season of the walking dead for anybody who cares major twd spoilers ahead glenn a main character since early in the first season ended up in a situation where he another guy were cornered by zombies in an alley they climbed on top of a dumpster in desperation and then happened fucking episodes later we got
gameofthrones,not_removed,walking dead
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you i just spit water all over my laptop pod the rod best name ever and you it doesnt take minutes out of every episode to say
gameofthrones,not_removed,well in the books they mentioned something about not being able to bring robb back because he didnt have a head im thinking this would be another level kinda stuff
gameofthrones,not_removed,huh til
gameofthrones,not_removed,she wasnt she would have been a few weeks pregnant at the most she just hasnt done a nude scene since she had her first child with that being said i dont think it matters why she didnt want to do it
gameofthrones,not_removed,was a long time ago shes probably more self conscious about her body now
gameofthrones,not_removed,that show is a load of shit
gameofthrones,not_removed,absolutely but you havent seen her body none of us have
gameofthrones,not_removed,everyone ive watched the show with plus almost everyone online loves jaime and tyrion so im pretty sure i have a point there tygett was just snark idk who the fuck that even is
gameofthrones,not_removed,nah its just the how does this not have all the upvotes part that no one really wants to upvote
gameofthrones,not_removed,its called a joke
gameofthrones,not_removed,well he was joking but also are you new here this should be like the one safe place for spoilers
gameofthrones,not_removed,hook line and sinker
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont worry hes gonna bite it for real very soon
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was obvious he was alive though you saw the other guy fall on him and the zombies couldnt have been eating him unless he has intestines in his chest
gameofthrones,not_removed,i didnt say favorite characters i said least hated lannisters like i said i love tyrion and i like jaime too im just not under any false pretenses that people dont hate them
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,or will he
gameofthrones,not_removed,i expect so
gameofthrones,not_removed,s the way they shot it was suspicious gave the game away though i didnt think it looked like his intestines were coming from his chest just that it was a noticeably weird camera angle i must say i thought he had actually died until i saw the overhead shot where hed magically flipped around so that his head was by the dumpster that gave it away for me
gameofthrones,not_removed,i will eat an issue of the walking dead comic if he isnt the one negand probably along with abraham too
gameofthrones,not_removed,i still have faith they didnt that stupid cliffhanger just to kill the most obvious one i think itll be michonne
gameofthrones,not_removed,i will be messaging you on utc to local time to remind you of on october if this guy ate a walking dead comic to send a pm to also be reminded and to reduce spam parent commenter can httpnpredditcommessagecomposetoremindmebotsubjectdelete commentmessagedelete dont forget to add the time options after the of
gameofthrones,not_removed,ill even let you choose the issue
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think its just a common saying in the universe like words are wind or seven hells
gameofthrones,not_removed,but op where do whores go
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised if that batman movie traumatized him it was traumatizing to me
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think times in hundreds of thousands of words is overdoing it the only reason it stands out to people is because its not a common english saying i think
gameofthrones,not_removed,its true though nipples on breastplates are a bit silly
gameofthrones,not_removed,nipples on breast plates arent useless they protect your nipples
gameofthrones,not_removed,hes still scarred by clooneys batnips as am i
gameofthrones,not_removed,asearchoiaf finds six uses of the phrase claiming its really common isnt quite as much of a circle jerk as grease running down chins in all of the series but thats not saying much
gameofthrones,not_removed,or others take themyou
gameofthrones,not_removed,not to theon hahaha am i right my lords and ladies
gameofthrones,not_removed,the nipples traumatized me less than the gratuitous second held shot of batass from the beginning of that movie
gameofthrones,not_removed,actually they were very common in during the time of the roman empire look it up
gameofthrones,not_removed,hah i think the worst actual scene was the batcredit cardstill get shivers from that cinematic abomination
gameofthrones,not_removed,depends if you mean ceremonial or actual combat armor
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh my god id blocked that one out i guess literally cringing right now i went to see that movie with my younger cousins when it came out i was old enough to realize it sucked but even my year old cousin came out of it and said that was less believable than the cartoon no wonder that the franchise got put on ice for almost a decade afterwards
gameofthrones,not_removed,no there were both ornate and simple versions of the armor ornate versions were often worn by generals but simple physique armor including nipple details has been widely used in combat historically specially in greece but also rome
gameofthrones,not_removed,which one is this i gotta see it
gameofthrones,not_removed,that was my point its as silly as nipples on a breastplate theyre useless its the point of the saying
gameofthrones,not_removed,ptwp is azor ahai basically so theres a legend where azor ahai a great warrior wields a blade lightbringer and that hell be reborn from ice and fire under a bleeding star and save the world from the long night blah blah blah he had a wife nissa nissa and drove his molten sword through her heart to solidify it and that sword is lightbringer so this reborn guy thatll save the world from the long night is probably jon or daenerys but thats the azor ahai prophecy and nowhere is it written that azor ahai is ptwp so i am not sure this may be bs
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a prophecy possibly linked to the azor ahai reborn prophecy theres no definitive answer on it we only get bits and pieces so whenever melisandre goes on about azor ahai the lords chosen one who will lead us out of the darkness etc etc the prince that was promised is probably the same thing aerys the mad king knew about it he got his fortune told by some witch who said ptwp would be born of the targaryen line by him and his sister rhaella so he set that marriage up and fathered rhaegar viserys and dany all the other things as with most prophecy is open to interpretation all the way through until you see all the pieces line up in more detail so rhaegar thought he might be ptwp then he thought it might be his son aegon maester aemon thought it was rhaegar too for a while though later he thought it could be dany since it could be prince or princess in the valyrian scrolls theyre getting their info from
gameofthrones,not_removed,ok here we go the prince that was promised will be born of the targaryen bloodline he will be born under a bleeding star he is the one that will defeat the night king and save all of humankindin westeros at least from the long night jon snow is the prince that was promised they just confirmed it in the show if you look closely ned carries ser arthur daynes sword with him up to where lyanna is laying why is this important a bleeding star is also known as a falling star and is really a meteorite ser arthur daynes sword is forged from a meteorite it has blood on it and if you look even more closely ned places the sword down and its all the camera is focused on the sword for a full seconds this wasnt an accident also lyanna must say the word promise at least times so jon snow was born a prince he was born under a bleeding star and there was a promise on him jon snow will defeat the night king
gameofthrones,not_removed,essentially jesus for the red women theres a whole prophecy and criteria and such but you can look that up on your own

gameofthrones,not_removed,if we dont point it out maybe no one will notice the spoiler
gameofthrones,not_removed,i assume dothraki on horses working as a unit is way different than on combat on foot
gameofthrones,not_removed,the dothraki are grrms amalgamation of the huns mongols and various other nomadic peoples avars magyars to an extent etc throughout roman warfare to late medieval warfare weve seen disciplined western armies struggle to fight these nomadic horsemen despite the nomads being lightly armed and armored during the magyar invasion of europe a large relatively httpsenwikipediaorgwikibattleofpressburg due to the magyars reliance on lightly armored cavalry whose job was to harass the more heavily armored frankish troops this is one battle of the invasion however there are many more just like it same goes for the mongols when they invaded europe and steamrolled many western and eastern armies
gameofthrones,not_removed,the majority of westeros forces are just peasants given spearsthe dothraki are all warriorsthey come at you and fire arrows and when they retreat they fire arrowswesteros forces would be eaten alive in an open battlewith many of them more then likely breaking and getting routed because of it that being said they have obvious weaknessthere overproud and will ride down a smaller force when they could surround themthere not suited for winterthey would get destroyed invading the north during the winterthere horses would be useless and they would get slaughtered because of itthey dont know how to fight people in armour because no one in the east wears itand lastly they have no seige craft some of there weakness will be overcome with a competent commander though
gameofthrones,not_removed,the dothraki are master riders when it comes to their horses they are fast as well with their blades head level with anyone on foot there is simply no comparison for example had the calvary of the vale been dothraki instead they would have just steamrolled through boltons bannermen like butter now one on one on foot is a different situation in which it would come down to skill since most westerosi are not in expensive armor like jaime and his lannister men the dothraki as individuals are more skilled fighters their lives are centered around them being warriors and combat a mistake might mean death for westerosi it is much different their chain mail or various armors might protect against the dothraki weapon of choice but it wont protect them from the more skilled fighter if you took a random westerosi fighter vs a random dothraki fighter chances are the dothraki fighter is much more skilled
gameofthrones,not_removed,well who said the dothraki are gona fight fairly as put simply by king robert baratheon the dothraki warfare is most likely going to be the dothraki horde going around the lands around the castle pillaging massacring raping and taking slaves of whoever is left regardless whether the dothraki succeed in their invasion the crown is going to be severely weakened as a result imagine what the people will think of a king who just sits behind the castle walls and does nothing to help his people
gameofthrones,not_removed,grrm is a fantasy writer not a military historian the success of the various horse nomads was predicated on their ability as horse archers to rain arrows down on less mobile troops until their morale and formation broke up and then led by their tribe and clan leader families in armor and with lance they would break up any rear guard and chase the fugitives this was true of the scythians parthians pechengs magyars mongols sassanid persians manchus etc bows were not always necessary as the moors used javelins a combined arms force with armored spear armed infantry supported by archers slingers and javelineers could hold the nomads at bay and use their cavalry usually heavier armed and armored in short charges when the nomads bunched up for a charge that would then rally behind the infantry an example of this is richard i the lionhearteds victory over the saracens at arsuf the eastern romans with their disciplined armored spearmen and foot archers and their own horse archers and cataphracts and clibinarii routinely beat the arabs pechengs and sassanid persians if their generals were even basically competent the romans beat the sarmatians and the romans and macedonians beat the scythians the key was proper planning and logistics along with making the nomad camps your primary objective the dothraki have shown no evidence of using missile weapons without them they are forced to either ride around their enemy looking for a chance to charge or repeatedly charge their enemy to no effect i can see the unsullied holding off a dothraki tribal army maintaining their tight formation in a hollow square protected by their shield and helmets their spears leveled outward the dothraki without missile weapons are unable to inflict any casualties on them no horse will willing run onto a spear or pike point period you cant make them except when they are barded with armor and trained to ignore their natural fear if jons or ramseys army faced dothraki they would form a hollow square shield wall with pikes and spears presented outward supported by archers in the rear ranks the dothraki cannot close to contact and the foot archers inflict a growing number of casualties that force the dothraki to break off their attacks you give me henry vs army from agincourt and ill chew the dothraki to pieces on any ground and at odds as bad as to i would love to see what welsh and english longbows would do to a bunch of light cavalry like the dothraki but again grrm writes fantasy not military science fiction like drake or flint who still get it wrong sometimes btw in a feudal society all freemen had a military obligation unless serfs slaves or women and children the peasants would train in the village commons at least once a month with spear and shield the armored knights of the normans and the idea that dothraki were better than norman knights is laughable had problems at hastings against the shield and spear armed anglosaxon peasants of the fyrd as long as they stayed in the shield walls the welsh and english archers at crecy poitiers and agincourt were yeomen land owning peasants who practiced their archery on weekends the swiss pikemen that humbled charles of burgundy were moutaineers peasants living from herding logging and small farms the idea that in a feudal society like westeros that landowning peasants would have no familiarity with weapons and tactics ignores the historical record of such societies
gameofthrones,not_removed,im not saying there not dangerous but i mean they would likely struggle to defeat all kingdoms the north and west at there height would have a combined force of about also the huns and other nomadic tribes where only a real threat to rome when the empire was weak and divided the same with westoros if they picked a side like danny is doing now with the thryals then yer there all fucked then and the north would probably destroy there armies sense its harsh and they dont look like they have winter clothing
gameofthrones,not_removed,same the other way like if ned stark was leading everyone and also if you look the great houses look like they have professional armys like the lanasters the vale and the starks ones like the boltons and freys look like there made up of peasants when they say it would be foolish to meat them in open battle i think they mean it just better to stay in forts and staff but then they would just destroy all the land like robert said
gameofthrones,not_removed,if they dont fight them in battle they could use the scorth earth trick where they destroy all useful food and resources and store the rest in the keeps
gameofthrones,not_removed,running around the enemy can only last so long if they did like the tortes roman formation or the shield war the dothraki would ave to fight sooner or later there used to essos armies a lot of witch is made up of slaves where the unsalile are there only real threat there not use to the why westoros fights where they know how the dothraki fight and there never invaded a full content so they would have a geographic advantage and the armies are not all pussys
gameofthrones,not_removed,yer its just that invading westoros would be i think to complicated for the dothraki all the knights and foot soldiers would need would be a moral boost and a smart leader like ned stark and they could push back the invaders
gameofthrones,not_removed,to all of you book readers yes the dothraki are typical horse nomads with bows but the show has yet to show them use a bow much less a javelin and this where the jorahdothraki combat was viewed and the question originated so the question remains is that without bows how do the dothraki unarmored light cavalry win against a force like the knights of the vale and this has nothing to do with the dothraki being born fighters or spend their lives fighting as i have said before grrm is a fantasy writer this view of the dothraki ignores the very basic requirements of a horse nomads life which is tending to the flocks when young guiding and guarding the horse herds when a young warrior and engaging in various activities needed to be done to just survive in a hostile environment that cant be left to the women who do in fact quite a bit the mongols did not originally have the training and organization they displayed in conquering china and their known world that case is made very plain by chinese writers the genius of a generation or two of charismatic leaders like jhengis khan produced the juggernaut known as the mongol hordes and the wealth of empire sustained them before internal conflict and absorption by more advanced societies destroyed them by the time of kublai khan the mongols were as much chinese as anything else before that they were no different then any other group of horse nomads there are as many horse nomad societies in history that have accomplished little or nothing as have conquered empires most of which were ephemeral some such as the mongols are remembered the huns disappeared with attila the transoxania turks with tamerlaine the arabs were reduced to a garrison force of declining morale and effectiveness after the jihad and in many cases these horse empires were the result of hitting settled civilizations at a point of weakness when they tried a settled society or near their prime they were no more successful than the sarmatians against the romans or the slavs or magyars against the carolingians there success hinged on maneuver and movement across accessible and favorable terrain the mongols did not fair as well against the japanese on the beaches or the vietnamese and cambodians in the jungle a mongol army penetrating further into europe would have found it a harder nut to crack then an army of germans and their vassals on the edge of the eurasian plains
gameofthrones,not_removed,if the seven kingdoms worked together they could like look at lanisters there full of armour
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is a description of the magyars from the time period you mentioned like most nomadic steppedwellers the early magyars were light cavalry armed with a composite bow of wood horn and sinew and rather flatter than those of their neighbours according to osprey they also used the curved sabre light spears and less often the mace the sabre was distinguished by turneddown quillons and a curved hilt the aristocracy wore finely crafted metal armour probably lamellar which was favourably commented upon by those of other nations less exalted magyars probably wore leather lamellar or thick felt for protection the magyar helmet seems to have been of similar design to those of their turkic neighbours – spangenhelms of conical shape possibly with a spike at the crown shields were apparently rare the magyar saddle was light and comfortable and was widely copied and stirrups helped with stability and control endrey states that they were great archers and they had a superb military organization a claim that is borne out by their success against some of the most professional armies of their time he states that henry the fowler after being defeated by the magyars in copied their light cavalry and was thus able to defeat them in his turn in some key things they used spear cavalry shock cavalry and mace cavalry anti armour wore armour with the rich men being similar to knights or menatarms and though rare shields they were extremely disciplined the battles you mentioned also show that they were well versed with a huge variety of tactics and had incredible commanders so what you just described is a force that would beat the dothraki in every possible way fighting a century eastern european army that wouldnt stand a chance against a century western european army like in westeros that example doesnt show how the dothraki could win the others you mention huns mongols etc they were all well known to employ heavy cavalry with lances and metal armour light and heavy horse archers light cavalry infantry and siege engines they were all very disciplined and professional armies led by very potent commanders all those examples have more in common with the knights of the vale then they have with the dothraki and they all faced fractured militaries far less efficient then those of westeros martin based the dothraki on the image of those people propaganda made by their enemies the armies of europe considered the mongols barbarians but historians show they were just as advanced as their peers
gameofthrones,not_removed,quality post
gameofthrones,not_removed,remember that the huns were ferocious but ineffective attila was defeated by the romans at chalons and he was able to sack italy years later because the romans were more worried about infighting than fielding a legion
gameofthrones,not_removed,for example had the calvary of the vale been dothraki instead they would have just steamrolled through boltons bannermen like butter isnt that exactly what they did though
gameofthrones,not_removed,the same could be said for barbarians and romans but a well disaplind army is better then a bunch of unarmed horses men i mean in open battle but they do say the dothraki cant siege castles
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh and in the real world even a thousand ships wouldnt carry dothraki to westeros if the dothraki are anything like other horse nomads each warrior has multiple horses both as a mobility enhancer and as moving wealth each dothraki would take a minimum of two horses with them to westeros unless they assume they can gather more horses when they get there so you have a thousand cog or carracks carrying twenty sailors and troops or horses the or so unsullied and danerys stormborns staff take up ships that leaves the dothraki ships for their use that comes out to around dothraki and their horses now this could just be the first wave estimate that such ships make knots for hours nautical miles and they can reach the sea of dorne off westeros from slavers bay in about twenty days take five days to unload and do any repairs needed and the second wave of dothraki about would reach the sea of dorne thirty days after the first wave at that rate it would take over six months at a minimum in optimum conditions to get dothraki to westeros from essos
gameofthrones,not_removed,this is more what i was thinking and plus im pretty sure the lanaster army is a professional army as well as the knights of the vale and before the red wedding the northern forces looked pretty professional
gameofthrones,not_removed,khal drogo had a force of men when he died his was the largest khalasar but not the only khalasar after he died the various splinter factions were not noted to be of any notable size indicating that khal drogos khalasar while large was not a majority of the dothraki population in fact the wikis both show and book note that the khalasar that left were of average size about meaning that with the two dozen khalasar roaming the great grass sea there would be about dothraki warriors given that grrm outlines that drogos khalasar is warriors this leaves slaves women and children to be used as footsoldiers bringing their total up to from what i can gather this is the following breakdown of westerosi armies northerners iron born westerners vale men riverlanders stormlanders dornish reachmen that is a total of assuming are knights or equivalent that is knights we can assume another are menatarms such as locke or the hound who while not knights are trusted warriors with horses this means about mounted warriors and unmounted peasantry when you consider that drogo planned to inflate his ranks by raiding villages and buying slaves from the free cities and would take any survivors in westeros as slaves his numbers woukd only grow while dothraki arakhs would be poor use against plate armour their bows would not their archers would be able to pick off the armoured soldiers and the screamers would cut through the peasantry the dothraki are terrifying meeting them on an open field is foolish remember that their only major defeat in the field was at the hands at the unsullied and that was only because they used spears and trained in formation tactics not widely used in westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,i admit i dont know much about nomadic horseman thats why i asked the question haha i agree when you said they attack when empires are weakened when you look at the fall of rome they real romans had already gone and the empire was to big at that point attila was a good leader but i think he would have had more trouble if he faced a legion from ad
gameofthrones,not_removed,of course but the point is that the seven kingdoms are not united and dany was supposed to invade when there is a war going on
gameofthrones,not_removed,full leather armor most of them are newly recruited peasants farmers and butcher boys who went through a hasty training for a few months knights are individualistic warriors their only unified move is whats called a shock tactic line up take lances and charge at the target great against other heavy armored cavalry and peasant based infantry against light cavalry that is constantly on the move and are actually horseback archers less so they are slow and have very limited movement and compared to dothraki they have no range as they only use lances no bows then we have dothraki born and raised warriors they have all seen war at least once in their life believe warfare is the greatest thing there is running away is a disgrace fighting to death is the most glorious thing ever so the peasant based infantry of westeros that is already fcked against regular cavalry is fcked even worse dothraki are also better riders than knights as they spend their lives on horse back and more importantly they are horseback archers they will not bother trying to cut armored knights with arakhs they will run circles around them and the infantry raining arrows only closing in for a quick slashing sessions when they start to falter and then pull back once more to keep firing arrows
gameofthrones,not_removed,this so much this
gameofthrones,not_removed,also worth nothing that the bolton infantry werent even in proper formation to defend against a cavaly charge they were attacked in the rear
gameofthrones,not_removed,through warm butter then
gameofthrones,not_removed,definitely dothraki vs a castle or archers probably means game over for the dothraki but i mean more so in an open field where phalanx strategies of the smaller force wont make a difference towards manned horses im also assuming that the dothraki greatly outnumber whichever other army theyre up against but then again some might argue barbarians were responsible for the sacking of rome
gameofthrones,not_removed,the largest medieval round ships could carry horses and men each and even with those a thousand ships would only carry enough horses for dothraki assuming horses per dothraki even then the long journey would have so weakened the horses that they would need a minimum of three months to recover their condition if used hard within a few days of landing youd blow upwards of a third of the horses and hard use within three weeks would still see a very high attrition rate realistically dany wouldnt be able to launch any major military attack within three months of landing which would result of an enormous financial burden on her allies and give cersei ample time to get ready
gameofthrones,not_removed,the dothraki wont use those women children and slaves as foot soldiers it is dishonourable to let women and slaves fight for you in dothraki culture and any children capable of wielding a sword are already in the if anything they are a major disadvantage in essos the dothraki have the open empty dothraki sea to attack from it means they decide when and where they attack and when and where they do not in densely packed westeros this is not an option the westerosi will decide were the battles are which takes away one of the biggest advantages the dothraki normally have this gets worse when we look at terrain the dothraki come from essos which is filled with steppes and plains ideal for a horsebased horde culture if they were to travel to westeros things would get hard the vale westerlands stormlands and northern dorne are very hilly and mountainous any dothraki going there will be slaughtered the iron islands are a no go for obvious reasons southern dorne and the north cant sustain large amounts of horses and the horde will die of lack of food the heat or the cold this severely limits their options as the only places the dothraki can effectively fight are the reach the riverlands and the crownlands nearly everyone i see here seems to dismiss the westerosi levies as untrained unarmoured inexperienced peasants the opposite is true in any late feudal system like the one in asoiaf levies were drafted from the upper lower class these men were able to afford at least chainmail and probably a lot more see that amount of armour would make them immune to the dothraki swords and very hard to beat with dothraki bows these levy men would train with weapons and tactics at least once a month and were well experienced with weapons and basic tactics and formations these common soldiers were well trained and deployed spear walls pikes and longbow archers swords are used by knights and menatarms wearing plate not common soldiers common soldiers hold formation to pin troops down while knights and menatarms outmaneuvre the enemy and cut them down they wont break easily this isnt different in westeros than it is irl we see the lannisters draft thousands of heavily armoured and welltrained soldiers even after they lost men in the war the north lost most of its soldiers including nearly all veterans and experienced soldiers they still manage to create armies with over trained and equiped soldiers even with most of the north sitting it out westerosi peasants are not unarmoured untrained idiots that would drop their swords at the sight of dothraki longbows used by the westerosi and recurve bows as used by the dothraki have similar range longbows have one big advantage penetration a longbow will penetrate at much longer range than a recurve bow this is compounded by the fact that the dothraki dont wear armour at all the dothraki will have to come in close range to shoot the westerosi at which point they have already received multiple volleys themselves horses are a much bigger target than footmen and taking out a horse at full speed will kill the rider as well dothraki archers wont do anything against standard levies the dothraki are an excellent cavalry force to enhance an army but on their own they lack what it takes to defeat anyone no infantry no armour no shock troops no siege equipment poor weapons no tactics no army in history is as inversatile as the dothraki they dominate with fear and reputation and by large numbers
gameofthrones,not_removed,didnt robb only gather soldiers when he called the bannerlords
gameofthrones,not_removed,heard the story of qohors unsullied
gameofthrones,not_removed,yer thats what i mean haha
gameofthrones,not_removed,but then the butter would melt and wreck itself
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe but i think in open battle if there where fully armoured lanisters as the main infantry witch at the height was in a tight formation would be hard i mean the dothraki would win battles but sooner or later they would be pushed back by the time rome was sacked the empire had more or less collapsed the west was poorer and most the real armies where in the east
gameofthrones,not_removed,according to the history and lore most westerosi army is peasants although it doesnt look like it is in fact dothraki destroyed an army of infantry thousands of heavy cav thousands of chariots while being outnumbered they had only screamers
gameofthrones,not_removed,except this isnt the old school dothraki they are following a woman on a dragon do you really think they would keep those ablebodied women in the back instead of having them fight based on merit
gameofthrones,not_removed,robb took men south this does not include the bolton men the men that rodrik raised to retake torrhens square and later winterfell the mountain clans or the crannogmen
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes but unsulliedknight at least in my opinion also i dont know if the lords of westeros would buy from slavers
gameofthrones,not_removed,that which does not melt breaks no thats not how it goes
gameofthrones,not_removed,but lannisters didnt have men in full armour most of the westerosi armies are made of poorly equiped peasants lannister army was no different
gameofthrones,not_removed,the valerian armys beat the and not just because of there dragons and so did the unsalile
gameofthrones,not_removed,looking at essos level of technology the location of sarnor compared to the other states in essos martins tendency to base his realms on existing things and the descriptions given of the sarnori armies they are probably based on hellenistic armies like the ones from pontus or egypt those heavy cavalry are not comparable to westerosi knights or menatarms less armoured and no lances those spearmen are most likely much less armoured then the westerosi commoners nobody seems to use steel in essos apart from valyria so they probably used bronze if anything at all scythed chariots are a historically poor weapon there are only two battles known in which they performed well and they are an anti infantry weapon primarily not much of an issue for light cavalry many of those infantry were slingers who are obviously not even remotely as efficient as longbowmen the leaders of the sarnori are notoriously poor one of them tried to use the dothraki to destroy the other sarnori states the various sarnori were fighting wars between each other even while the dothraki laid siege to their cities they wouldnt work together until there was no other option left when the battle began they fell for the very first trap that appeared now where did you read most of westerosi armies consist of untrained peasants the books clearly mention every army having very large amounts of longbow archers longbows require years of training to use so those men are definitely very well trained pretty much every soldier described in the books is said to have both leather and mail in their armour or wear some form of plate this is also shown in the show they are described and shown as using basic tactics and formations this all matches up to how an historical army would look yes they are peasants but rather well trained and well equiped ones not young boys given a shield and spear and sent into battle armies from westeros use century western european tactics and equipment the dothraki managing to get some victory against a poorly led century bc style hellenistic army doesnt mean anything for their efficiency against a proper army
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes its not part of dothraki culture for woman to fight that wont change overnight the women themselves will most likely be hesitant and reluctant to fight and we know that dany wont force them to
gameofthrones,not_removed,unsullied knight this is explicitly addressed though im not if it is in the show or only the books unsullied knights because of discipline the unsullied wont break and run and will operate as a unit in the face of casualties that would route any other army knights are generally very skilled fighters nut are not raised as part of a unit since adolescence this makes them vulnerable to acting in ways that breaks their formation or triggers a retreat
gameofthrones,not_removed,its not all about calvary romans where not the best at fighting with calvary they only used them for flanking but they made up for it with strong infantry if you look at the kingdoms lanister infantry northern calvary and donish spearmen would be the best force the dothraki had ever faced not the city states of essos
gameofthrones,not_removed,even so a shield wall with wooden spears would render cavalry charges useless
gameofthrones,not_removed,the valerians beat them because of the dragonsthey were to afraid to fight as would be anybody when they saw dragons going against themdothraki would never dare to chalange dragons from valyria usullied are the best infantry in the worldtrained since little kids also they were expensive so you dont see tens of thousands of themmost other armys are recruited from villagesalso the army that qohor had before unsullied came to help were decimated by dothraki im not saying that the dothraki are the best in the world but they arent a pushover either
gameofthrones,not_removed,you still have no proof that the tall men didnt have armor like westeros or that they didnt use steelyou are basing this on speculation not facts we know that the tall men united for the final battle in which they had heavy cav and chariots and were destroyed if you look at history and lore of ninepenny kings you see that soldiers were recruited along the way to war and that their armys fought with sharp sticks also after the battle of oxross talisa said that most people there were young boys given a spear a few months agothey may have some armor but they lack the experience and you are forgreting heavy cav that qohor had which had steel qohor is known for their smithsgot massacred by dothraki
gameofthrones,not_removed,but not horse archers
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hate to be the one to break it to you but its king in the north
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing i figured the omitted it because either they didnt plan on including it in the plot or they didnt want to spoil it but since they included the deaths of her children in the prophecy i dont think theyd be unwilling to include it for spoiler reasons still it would be a good way for her to go
gameofthrones,not_removed,i assume jaime will be the one doing the strangling and i think that wont really change in the books or the show the context that it happened because of some prophecy that drove cersei mad with paranoia is kind of lost on the show since we dont see a lot of cerseis actions in regards to the prophecy maybe they will include it at the end just to give like an ohhhh shit moment as it happens but other than used for shock value it doesnt really need to be a part of the story jaime has clear motivations to kill cersei at this point
gameofthrones,not_removed,it doesnt need to be stated but it has been heavily implied especially during the coronation scene at the end of the look on jaime when sees what cersei has done and what she has become tells me that he realizes that she is far more dangerous than he realized
gameofthrones,not_removed,im glad they omitted it because regardless of whether its tyrion or jaime its such heavyhanded and obvious foreshadowing that ruins cerseis fate
gameofthrones,not_removed,itll be tyrion with poison the strangler show foreshadowed this with the false conviction of joeffrys death and how it was done tyrion already was sentenced for a crime he didnt commit would be fitting to see him take out cersei that way
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was just going to make a post about this i think its already fulfilled cersei died with tommen just not literally
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the difference between including the deaths of her children and her own death in the prophesy is that in the case of her children the prophesy wont say how they will die the valonqarpart gives it away more or less also in the show they would either have to explain what valonqar meant in a way that would probably come of as a little bit forced explanation or they would just have to say little brother or sibling because it is supposed to be gender neutral and then it would be too obvious
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah even without the prophecy his own sister used wildfire to blow up the queen sparrow and other important people in attendance now that she has firm control of power she can easily use the remaining wildfire and place them in strategic location in the tunnel and kill of people or the entirety of kl that way much like what the mad king was originally gonna do he knows very well that the lannisters dont have many allies anymore except for the riverlands cersei lived for her children theyre all dead now
gameofthrones,not_removed,we see all kinds of actions in regards to the prophecy she expressed nothing but loathing for tyrion since day one to the point where she tried to kill him and later supported her father killing him i suspect the showrunners thought it would give too much away also the little brother could mean arya arya with jamies face a surprise loras etc lots of possibilities
gameofthrones,not_removed,anothet good point either way if they do have the valonqar kill cersei or a different way itll make sense why they did what they did
gameofthrones,not_removed,young cersei valonqar maggie little brother that wasnt too hard
gameofthrones,not_removed,even the allegiance of the riverlands may be in question now im not really sure about the makeup of house frey at this point with frey and his sons both gone
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dunno arya seems like a weak choice an unlikely contender although maybe grrm will subvert the prophecy to give her the kill i doubt it though i also dont think tyrion strangling cersei to death makes a lot of sense he already killed one family member it doesnt really fit his narrative to kill another so brutally plus the sheer logistics of a dwarf strangling a grown woman to death shae was one thing cersei is another plus it seems pretty clear that with all the talk about jaimes hand and hands and how his hand was his whole world and all that hed be the one to slip his hands around her throat
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think the two have to be of some equal size in order to use the face properly little maisie is never going to appear as big as nikolaj
gameofthrones,not_removed,i forget about them lol but youre right in the books jaimes aunttywinns sister genny was married to walders freys son not sure if thatll play a role though but i do think that therell be a power struggle of which frey will be the rightful heir
gameofthrones,not_removed,im hoping that edmure will get out of his situation and take back the riverlands

gameofthrones,not_removed,littlefinger will betray cersei
gameofthrones,not_removed,a war in the reach with highgarden as the focal point the war will be danys forces vs cerseis forces leading to a military victory for dany but at a enormous cost at the reach basically being burnt down and its fields ruined setting the stage for a even more bleak winter without the agricultural might of the reach
gameofthrones,not_removed,stark reunion

gameofthrones,not_removed,either her heads going on a pike or shes getting poked with a needle
gameofthrones,not_removed,opening scene is going to be one of danys ships crashing into his boat
gameofthrones,not_removed,fucking confirmed
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh shiiiit and then theyll be set for the white walkers
gameofthrones,not_removed,it involves dragon glass ive always thought perhaps dragon fire may be required for forging but thats pretty tin foil
gameofthrones,not_removed,hype confirmed
gameofthrones,not_removed,first huge massacre what was hardhomme
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would love littlefinger to assume the role of tywin if history repeats itself promise loyalty upon entrance to kings landing then sack the city and seize the throne long live his grace king petyr
gameofthrones,not_removed,id think by that point most of the crops wouldve been harvested
gameofthrones,not_removed,they will decimate each others forces along with the capital itself and baelish will swoop in to become king of the ashes
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats what the man does
gameofthrones,not_removed,then daenerys just says oops and ignores him drowning
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cant fucking hear you
gameofthrones,not_removed,it is confirmed that it is conformed
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think he means south of the wall or at least at the wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,and then sit on the iron throne until danerys arrives when she does hell sit up and tell her she can have it since the seat is so uncomfortable ala jaime
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would assume that word will spread to the queen that lf and the vale helped sansa and jon take winterfell i dont think she is going to be dumb enough to trust him shed burn everything to the ground first
gameofthrones,not_removed,then gendry just says oops and ignores her drowning
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i suppose i should have worded that a bit more clearly the first huge massacre on westeros land
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha worming his way into the next queens circle i would actually love it if littlefinger occupies the throne and dany doesnt have the force to take it so varys sneaks into the city and crossbows him thats a death i think truly does littlefingers character justice
gameofthrones,not_removed,good point im curious as to how littlefinger would make a play for the throne assuming he wins the allegiance of sansa the knights of the vale are now enemies of the throne and are perhaps hungry for war having not been involved in the previous one could littlefinger persuade robin to march on the capital once lannister and targaryen forces are depleted
gameofthrones,not_removed,wait did you use the words queen and not dumb enough in the same sentence actuallyi guess you didntbut still
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes because gendrys boat is definitely bigger then one of hers
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cant imagine the targaryen forces will be depleted any time soon the armies of the reach and dorne an armada of ships a dothraki army army of unsullied and dragons will be behind dany the lannister army has to be depleted since the war of the five kings and if the north is going to choose anyones side i very much doubt they side with the lannisters with many of the freys dead riverrun will probably be taken by the tullys or the vale if lf gets in charge of the twins and riverrun he will be standing in between the north and presumably the targaryen army lf will still want the throne and can probably try to wed dany to give her the rest of westeros that is assuming he doesnt piss of jon and sansa possibly coming off as a peace broker to help the north jon will need help fighting the wws lf would tell jon that he can use the entirety of the targ army plus the vale to fight the wws in return for taking a knee for dany lf will tell dany that he can hand her the north and the vale if she weds him as long as the wws dont destroy everyone this is kind of the best case scenario for everyone except cersi she is going to die
gameofthrones,not_removed,good answer i like your thinking but dany arriving as the outright favourite for next ruler of westeros and taking the throne just as wed expect seems too obvious i think they may use eurons fleet and perhaps a dragon binder to deplete danys forces and even out the odds a little
gameofthrones,not_removed,why would jaime try to save tyrion jaime hates tyrion for killing their father and jamie said he would kill him if they met again

gameofthrones,not_removed,it may not be because of tyrion but his face at the end of season at cersei being queen may lead him to killing her like he did the mad king
gameofthrones,not_removed,ok everything is finally spoilered up for all the snowflakes christ that was harder than writing it
gameofthrones,not_removed,someone literally wrote this exact thing on here yesterday at least give the person some credit
gameofthrones,not_removed,perhaps arya is the maiden and the hound is the stranger just musings though
gameofthrones,not_removed,surely mel would be the crone
gameofthrones,not_removed,how is cersei going to save westeros i like the links between the seven and some of the main characters but i dont think we should be dependent on those links they dont see as developed as say tptwp or aar
gameofthrones,not_removed,honestly its hard to judge what the mods will call a repost this is a years old theory circulated hundreds of times but i suppose in the down season this passes i personally just wish people would google their theories before assuming they are new
gameofthrones,not_removed,naw jon was resurrected and not by the faith of the seven
gameofthrones,not_removed,you mean like five posts down
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a pretty common idea actually i see it at the very least once a week it doesnt really conclude anything but its always posted here for some reason lmao
gameofthrones,not_removed,the boltons have a reputation for being sadistic fucks look at their sigil and roose appears to respect power more than birthright edit the boltons are basically what couldve happened to the starks in a worst case scenario
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think he is ok with it at all if anything i think the way ramsey acts sickens him and this is a man who is quite willing to flay men alive just for coughing in the general direction of his castle the fact of the matter is however that ramsey is his only son and as such he is the only chance of the bolton name continuing on beyond rooses death roose does try to utilise ramseys behaviour for the betterment of the family but it ultimately fails once roose is poisoned by his enemies
gameofthrones,not_removed,roose knows his days are numbered if not from winter some sickness or old age it would be from the countless enemies he has made in the north that want to kill him since he knows he isnt long for the world he thinks of his house and its future and in his wordsa boy lord is the bane of any house a baby bolton ruling the north wouldnt last more than a week an adult needs to be in charge to face the coming winter and political unrest
gameofthrones,not_removed,the boltons are known for being psychos but the book and show imply that roose wanted ramsay to do the things he did to make for a more unstable albeit fearless leader the boltons have had a hatred for the starks for thousands of years going so far back to the age of petty kings where the boltons were kings known for warring against winterfell and wearing the skin of killed starks for me roose achieved his life goal purpose of killing the starks and claiming winterfell for the bolton name he was almost content to have ramsey kill him if you look back at the numerous times in the books and show when he prodded ramsay you see hes looking to get a reaction out of him he toyed with ramsay the way ramsay toyed with reek in a more extreme way i believe roose wanted ramsay to kill him and claim the bolton name roose knew what ramsay was and wouldnt have given him legitimization until his dying breath the fact he legitimized him and let him get so close shows roose knew the danger of ramsay
gameofthrones,not_removed,why seem so accepting of this fate of my bastard is just going to kill my sons and rob me of my heir eh and not even attempt at having if not a less batshit crazy more stable family at least a better chance at not going extinct roose is pragmatic he served the starks all his life until he didnt he waited for a moment when they were vulnerable and he would gain enormously from it roose knows he rules the north with fear not respect like ned the moment his house is vulnerable it will fall if ramsay dies house bolton is years away from having a replacement ready to run the house roose doesnt think he has years left
gameofthrones,not_removed,i will not live long enough to see new sons to manhood and boy lords are the bane of any house i think this is the important line if he were to have more sons the only way to protect them would be to kill ramsay however he knows he wont live long enough to father the sons and raise them for lordship and he knows that if they became lords as children the house would fall the rest of the north fears the boltons and respects their strength but they dont like them and they wouldnt keep a bolton child as warden of the north ramsay is the only hope of maintaining this position because whatever other flaws he has he would want to maintain the strength and the north does fear him i think roose dislikes ramsay but its not the sadism he dislikes its how childish he is roose is annoyed when ramsay makes japes about fat walda and with how he treats sansa – not that he actually cares about sansa but because of how immature ramsay acts he also dislikes how impulsive ramsay is while roose is smart and calculating as soon as sansa escapes ramsay wants to storm castle black and kill her and jon snow without thinking of the consequences but roose knows that even if theyre strong enough currently to withstand the north hating them for it their house would struggle in the future if they killed jon as a whole i think roose dislikes ramsay because hes impulsive immature and doesnt quite care for the longevity of the house i dont think he really cares about how sadistic ramsay is what he doesnt like is how poorly ramsay handles it roose is just as sadistic raping a woman under the hanging corpse of her husband but he uses it as a tool to better his house and rise up by betraying the starks whereas ramsay is foolish and loses both theon and sansa just so he can have some fun however roose is resigned to ramsay as his only option for the house and he tries to make do
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree with this i think he wants someone who can stomach being sadistic if one of rooses other sons had killed ramsey in a similar fashion he would respect him just as much
gameofthrones,not_removed,poisoned
gameofthrones,not_removed,i guess he couldnt just kill his own son ramsay bastard or no even if it means he could save five trueborn sons it would make him a kinslayer still roose is a clever man he should be able to outwit his own arguably more looney bastard not necessarily complaining about a plot hole just thinking better of roose
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean if hes okay with being a kingslayer hes probably okay with being a kinslayer
gameofthrones,not_removed,he could have just sent him to the wall or off to fight or offered him as a ward of another lord
gameofthrones,not_removed,kinslaying is a much bigger deal in westerosi traditions its one of the few unforgivable things a person can do in the eyes of either the old gods or the new
gameofthrones,not_removed,hizdahr zo loraq isnt jons uncle at least not in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,bejen stark uncle i hope jon is sitting down when he finds this one out
gameofthrones,not_removed,but why its a beautiful tattoo but to me it falls into the same category as band names or meme tattoos
gameofthrones,not_removed,that is a bloody good tattoo mate
gameofthrones,not_removed,a good got tattoo wow im impressed
gameofthrones,not_removed,unreal tattoo man why do all the good realism artists have to be thousands of miles away from me
gameofthrones,not_removed,or a kit tattoo
gameofthrones,not_removed,not gonna say its a bad tattoo cause it aint artist did a great job but i think you would of been better off with one of the sigils
gameofthrones,not_removed,hahaha you want that dumb grimace on your body for the rest of your life congratsi guess lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,the blood didnt translate well and looks more like a leper it is one of the best realistic tattoos i have seen though and i am sure was worth the money paid not one i would personally get but i dont even know if i would get a tattoo i just dont like the idea of something always there that i would have to cover up for events and such where i need to be professional
gameofthrones,not_removed,i am sure there will be no ragrets later in life
gameofthrones,not_removed,i could see a dope start sigil with winter is coming under it or something but the actors face i dunno i wouldnt do it
gameofthrones,not_removed,see i like that pic of john snow but the tattoo looks like he became on of davy jones pirate team and has barnacles growing on his face
gameofthrones,not_removed,very well done technically but if it were me getting it id have chosen a frame where he wasnt doing that with his mouth makes his face look sort of ratty
gameofthrones,not_removed,lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,awesome work weird thing to have on your body forever
gameofthrones,not_removed,how many people got i love lucy happy days or mash tattoos years ago honestly i get that its a great amazing show but in years hell always have that tattoo on his arm reminding him of a tv show that no one remembers im not bashing the guy im all about people doing whatever makes them happy i do like learning about decisions people make id like to ask op or the guy who got the tattoo why they did it i mean i get the feeling that to do something like this it has to be more than a cool scene from a show did the show help you through a really hard time in your life id like to understand the motivation for making what to others is a simple form of entertainment into such a permanent part of your remaining life thanks and nice tattoo
gameofthrones,not_removed,ugh why a tattoo of an actor playing a fictional character from a bookso odd
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a damn shame using that photo of a beautiful man with shit all over his face as a tattoo
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats badass man looks great i would not of payed for that dudes shoulder in the background though probably save a few dineros
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would rather get a tattoo of that photo of him standing on the beach wearing sunglasses
gameofthrones,not_removed,i couldnt believe my eyes when this was the top comment but then i realized it was on rgameofthrones not rtattoos if your asking this question im guessing your not into tattoos or involved in the tattoo community lots of us look at the tattoos as pieces of art with aesthetic reasons behind them while others look for deep meanings in their tattoos some people combine both of these from a technical standpoint this tattoo is amazing they really pulled the realism off and there is no doubt who this is and what scene its from from a subject matter standpoint botb was one of my favorite episodes of all time tv keeping me on the edge of my seat the entire time this tv and book series is my all time favorite and jon snow and my favorite charactor if op feels similar to me at all i hope youd understand why he got the tattoo
gameofthrones,not_removed,some people would think this a good desktop background others just dont think to each their own tho
gameofthrones,not_removed,there is no why asking why to a personal choice is really a waste of time its not your business were here to admire the artistic talent this tattoo is ridiculously impressive
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know right it was an amazing scene to an even more amazing show but a bloodied up john snow is not an ideal tattoo specially when the showbooks come to an end
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon sneeeewwww
gameofthrones,not_removed,common misconception you can look professional while having tattoos show its all in the art obviously a tattoo that says fuck bitches get money on your arm is going to look trash no matter what but a well designed and beautiful piece that shows when the dress sleeves are rolled mmmmm source i have visible tattoos wear a suit everyday in corporate america and have never been anything but complimented when my pieces show while suited
gameofthrones,not_removed,no regerts
gameofthrones,not_removed,you are insane if you think nobody will remember this show
gameofthrones,not_removed,its his tattoo doesnt matter if other people dont remember the show does it especially if he got the tattoo to symbolise a moment in his life the tattoo doesnt have to translate to onlookers also i see this idea of permanence in this thread and while yeah tattoos stay on your body forever they can also symbolise memories events and feelings that arent everlasting but were significant in your life maybe the show helped him through a hard time and maybe hell have another favourite show later on but when he looks at the tattoo hell remember that bad time and that he got through it tattoos dont have to symbolise things that will last you a lifetime they can be like memories on your skin a chronology of events in your life
gameofthrones,not_removed,do you have tattoos edit ill take the downvote as a no people without tattoos have the biggest opinions on what you can and cant get
gameofthrones,not_removed,the shoulder is likely left in the tattoo based on how the face was done notice how the face isnt actually shaded its just skin color so using the background dark shoulder to draw the lines makes the face pop more
gameofthrones,not_removed,this guy gets it
gameofthrones,not_removed,ah im glad you wrote this comment im a little surprised by the vitriol thrown ops way you dont have to understand the meaning behind a tattoo to appreciate it hell the tattoo doesnt even have to have meaning as long as it looks great and this tattoo does people need to try to understand others better before they start making fun of them
gameofthrones,not_removed,butwhat if in the future you dont feel like that about game of thrones that tattoo will be there forever probably but that passion for game of thrones probably wont also surely a tattoo that complex will warp really badly
gameofthrones,not_removed,doesnt mean you have to
gameofthrones,not_removed,he wasnt trying to compliment it though you have it switched around hes saying its stupid as fuck but its still a nicely done tattoo so it isnt all bad executed nicely terrible idea
gameofthrones,not_removed,no rugrats
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre insane if you dont think pop culture has a shelf life
gameofthrones,not_removed,i didnt downvote you yes i have tattoos
gameofthrones,not_removed,your questions are fair so im not certain why youre being downvoted since they read like honest sincere inquiries so ill see if i help with my own experience i have large art pieces on me its fair to ask but what if you dont like x i get this a lot because in my sleeve i have the logo for the band that wrote the song the sleeve is designed from thrice is the band but its a personal thing to me and the logo is actual a symbolized reminder of something greater so to the owner of this art maybe they strongly relate to that character or maybe the emotion they felt watching it is similar to another emotion caused by a personal life experience and its a way to artisticly remind yourself of it to some its just a tv showbook but to others it could mean the world ie my sleeve in regards to the potential quality degradation tattooing now is very different than say years ago technique and equipment wise super detail like this is rare so who knows how it will truly hold since everyones skin is different touch ups over the years will help retain the color pop but stretchsag is going to depend on the individual location on body and how they care for it themselves hope this helps
gameofthrones,not_removed,says skylukewalker
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love lucy happy days or mash
gameofthrones,not_removed,fair enough what do you have if you dont mind me asking
gameofthrones,not_removed,ahah i suppose that makes sense i do hope ops tattoo holds up and that he likes it forever not for me though
gameofthrones,not_removed,its not a tattoo now if i had a giant tattoo of fonzie or hawkeye from mash you might have a point but i dont
gameofthrones,not_removed,that i regretfirst one i got when i was told them i was its poseidons trident down my forearm i know work in finance and wish i didnt have it since everyone wears short sleeves in the summer except for me the other is a greek helmet on my shoulder my argument is that this person has another persons face that is playing a character from a book on their body i dont know that just seems odd to me
gameofthrones,not_removed,so basically projection because you are on your tattoos
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like the theme of your regrets tho i have an icarus sleeve
gameofthrones,not_removed,those seem really fucking sweet dude awesome calls back to
gameofthrones,not_removed,no because i cant imagine years later looking down and you have fucking kit harrington on your body what if he has a bunch of bad movies or turns out to be a pedo then youre stuck with that at least mine look good and arent a random person
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks man
gameofthrones,not_removed,some people dont view tattoos as symbols of things that will last a lifetime some people get tattoos to symbolise moments and feelings in their life even if those moments and feelings arent forever theyre like memories on your skin youre projecting your perception onto op and from your perspective getting the tattoo is illogical but you dont know ops perspective maybe his thinking isnt about liking kit harrington forever and ever
gameofthrones,not_removed,this scene was just pure raw emotion spewing from his mouth i absolutely loved every second about it besides being kicked from the clan
gameofthrones,not_removed,in my opinion one of the most powerful moments we know how close davos and shireen were also liam and kerry are very close friends just pure raw emotions and truly fine work by liam liam is one of my absolute favourites and very underrated actor and honestly the way he plays davos is just perfect he was never nominated for awards much like iain glen but for me he is a scene stealer and one of the best actors on this show also love his sheer enthusiam for the show and how he loves his job hes not going to read this but my hats off to you liam cunningham for your work on game of thrones and hopefully a decent ending to your character if there is someone who deserves something good its ser davos seaworththe onion knight
gameofthrones,not_removed,liam cunningham charles dance sophie turner and peter dinklage are probaly the best actors there are in got in terms of displaying their characters
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought he was going to cry like really cry but he was only on the verge of doing so during the entire scene somehow that was so much better
gameofthrones,not_removed,probably my favorite scene in the entire series i watched it so many times davos is my favorite character
gameofthrones,not_removed,and for what they all died anyway that line was rough so well done
gameofthrones,not_removed,dude crushed this scene so hard

gameofthrones,not_removed,its the only time when davos lost his composure iirc davos is so controlled before and even after this it really added gravity imo his choices literally made me anxious which is the sign of a great performance
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed liam cunningham as davos is like pedro pascal as oberyn and charles dance as tywin for me i would add sophie turner for sansa but the age difference between the character in the book and show is too large for that they are the faces i see when i read the books now which isnt true for most other characters that are in both renditions i think it is absolutely criminal that dany and tyrion are the only ones who get nominated for anything except for this last season when a few others got emmy nominations dinklage is great as tyrion but i feel like hes getting nominations by default at this point as he was nominated for best supporting actor this year despite never having any incredible scenes in season emilia clarke hasnt stolen a scene since dracarys imo
gameofthrones,not_removed,if there is someone who deserves something good its ser davos seaworththe onion knight well shit hes screwed
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed but what about alfie allen i dont know much about acting but i think he must have the hardest job on the show since no other character goes through such drastic transformations he basically plays a different character every season he was a great theon then he was a great reek now hes great as theon id also add lena headey jack gleeson and iwan rheon to the list and bella ramsey of course the new star of the show ok its hard to just pick one the casting directors did a phenomenal job
gameofthrones,not_removed,this show has quite possibly the best casting of any show i have watched considering how many characters there are its insane that there are only a few whose actors arent all that good like the shae actress was pretty bad the stable boy but otherwise so many great actors and actresses
gameofthrones,not_removed,sophie turner why does everyone think shes so good ughhh i know everyone here loves her so will probably shower me with downvotes but i honestly just dont think shes a very good actress i dont think her character is very well written either which doesnt help but outside of a few good scenes she brings no life to the role
gameofthrones,not_removed,so relieved not to see iwan rhion in that list i think hes pretty much the most overrated actor in the series people on here seem to absolutely love him
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes he is always the calm and measured voice of reason even when he argued with stannis about mel he was always composed the fact that we finally see him lose control in this scene gives his anger so much more weight was a really awesome scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,man her speech to the dothraki leaders was pretty badass i thought
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah but that dracarys stole like every scene in history also i definitely imagine maisie williams as arya when i read the books but for some reason cant remotely think of dinklage when i read tyrion no matter how hard i try
gameofthrones,not_removed,the age difference between book sansa and show sansa isnt that large shes still a teenager in the show the age difference between book tywin and show tywin is a lot bigger years difference in fact
gameofthrones,not_removed,nina gold is responsible for casting
gameofthrones,not_removed,wasnt saying everyone else was bad just these actors who were really superb
gameofthrones,not_removed,she literally was a porn actress before so she fits the role and didnt do too bad so i dont mind her
gameofthrones,not_removed,i like her character as a contrast to all the heroes clever people and great fighters she is a scared little girl who gets treated like shit the whole time and her character arc starts pretty late when she is in the vale with lf sophie turner did a nice job playing that and i think she did the crying sansa scenes pretty well but im just a drunk fanboy so fuck my opinion and the king
gameofthrones,not_removed,i liked him and he played his character very well but its not something id call an outstanding performance
gameofthrones,not_removed,that scene was one of my least favorite in the show because it was emblematic of a serious problem with daenerys targaryens writing the rules of the universe dont seem to apply to her she gets these miraculous super weapons that havent lived for centuries dropped in her lap and she uses them to fight the most trusting slavers in history in astapor and the most trusting sellswords at yunkai in the first case they sell nearly every soldier in the city for one tiny dragon then dany just orders the soldiers to kill them and take the dragon back in the second she gives a ton of wine to the sellswords outside yunkai then attacks them when theyre drunk though the latter case only happened in the book then despite calling herself the unburnt for her very public fire immunity the dothraki see fit to put her inside a very flammable thatch hut full of burning oil torches with all of their leaders then when she does the completely predictable thing the dothraki immediately worship daenerys for killing all of their leaders and burning part of their sacred city down despite the fact that dothraki culture is probably the most sexist on planetos also immediately after that despite failing to stabilize slavers bay for years she is able to do so by killing two slavers and burning one ship before leaving guys to control cities with populations in the hundreds of thousands im absolutely sure this will all work out for her because it almost always does
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have the same problem the descriptions of him in the book paint him as much more monstrous drinklage is too pretty
gameofthrones,not_removed,because dinklage is a magnificent bastard while book tyrion was ugly before he got his nose cut off and his character in the show is not nearly as dark show tyrion is like im so suave i can get slave prostitutes to fuck me for free whereas book tyrion is like i understand that fucking this halfconscious slave is essentially rape but i hate myself and everyone else too much to care
gameofthrones,not_removed,well its not quite as much of a difference in purely empirical terms but in terms of the characters behavior i would say the change from years old to years old is far more significant than a change from to years old i have a lot of difficulty viewing a year old younger than sophie turners age in the first season as sophie turner now but season sophie turner was pretty similar to how i view sansa
gameofthrones,not_removed,dinklage is a goodlooking bastard thats why
gameofthrones,not_removed,we are bran is all the characters and everything is happening in his mind
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres a youtube channel i heard of once that edits all the scenes for a specific character in chronological order so you could watch just their parts i cant find it now though mightve been taken down because that sounds super copyrighty
gameofthrones,not_removed,cant wait for gendrys pov of season
gameofthrones,not_removed,daemon blackfyre on youtube uploads videos for dead characters with most of here scenes so check that out
gameofthrones,not_removed,bran is charles xavier about to worg into the future and become an xman i dont know why people keep denying these facts
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres a couple that still do that kevin gt is the one i remmeber offhand
gameofthrones,not_removed,kevin gt does rewinds and daemon blackfyre does the fate of blabla daemon mostly handels characters that have been killed of so he can show them beginning to end kevin gt introduces a character with a recent scene and then goes back to the beginning with some explanations

gameofthrones,not_removed,omg just let me have my shitty karma
gameofthrones,not_removed,edmure tully is a very realistic character and a truly nice person the blackfish is a bad ass a legend robb was very much a tully as he was a stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,see my flair the coolest dude in westeros edmure and cat both mean well but cant seem to stay out of their own way lysa well but as a whole the tullys are probably my second favorite house behind the starks mostly because they always fight with the starks
gameofthrones,not_removed,house tully is one of my favourite houses mostly because of their words and how members make decisions acording to the motto like edmure did in order to protect his wife and son and cats long journey to discover who hired an assasin to kill bran they know their family comes first as blackfish which is one of my favourites characters from the series he is an honorable man and a badass he kept riverrun safe from those freyweasels during the siege and died fighting for his family seat respect about lysa i cant see her as a tully she could have loved her son in a weird way but she did bad irrational things not because of her family because of her obsession with littlefinger and how easy he can manipulate her i believe however that if it wasnt for littlefinger she could have been pretty much like cat and edmure i love their words and blackfish but i cant empathize with the characters perhaps with another tully generation yes haha
gameofthrones,not_removed,house tully is my all time favorite house edmure is a family man and a man of the people he would have and hopefully still will been a great lord of riverrun and lord paramount of the trident im hoping things work out with his frey bride because she is pretty cute and according to the books and show had no knowledge of the intentions of walder frey and of the red wedding hoster tully was a badass just like brynden aka the blackfish during his good years he fought on the side of robert and ned during roberts rebellion and pledged his house and family against the tyrant mad king aerys his pairing of his children to great houses made him an excellent strategistpolitician to those who dont know he tried to pair brynden with a lady of another house which would have strengthened tullys position more so but brynden said no which made hoster start calling him the blackfish brynden tully of the show seriously does his book counterpart justice love the actor they chose since he really killed the character then got killed offscreen which sucks but i guess they couldnt spare minutes for him to go down killing like lannisters or freys an excellent warrior and great to his brother hoster cat and lysa are strong women groomed from birth to be ladys of the great houses and both did an awesome job at it they both protected their family above all else which holds true to their origin words overall i am really hoping for a tully comeback in the show and books they are one of the few great houses with honor just rule and soundness of mindjudgement their location screwed them over they essentially are the normandy of the got world everything and everyone goes thru the riverlands making it a natural battleground
gameofthrones,not_removed,the blackfish singlehandedly redeems the entire fishy house they have a really cool history and remind me a great deal of the austrian hapsburgs in terms of their strategy of marrying their daughterssons off strategically theres a reason the riverlands are like the of westeros in terms of culturegerman including austrian in this case the current generation of tullys arent exactly great cat lacks good decisionmaking skills lysa is whentshit crazy edmure shares cats inability to make the right choice but the blackfish damn the blackfish i know he kind of died like a wuss due to his being an older man who still was able to slap the shit out of insubordinates mind you and not having had a proper fight but the sassss god i live for the sass in game of thrones olenna tyrell lyanna mormont brynden tully blackfish knew what was up he knew how to make an impression he knew how to get the read of a man he was stubborn and loyal to his ancestral home but he was protecting the honor and memory of his family with edmure heavily compromised
gameofthrones,not_removed,considering cat is essentially the sole reason for every bullshit thing that happened up until she died no no love for her at least blackfish is a badass though
gameofthrones,not_removed,frey and tully are my favourite houses
gameofthrones,not_removed,im one of those guys who dont really like the tullies i think cat made two catastrophical mistakes arresting tyrion and freeing jaime jaime confronted ned about tyrions arrest and ned said he was taking on his command protecting cats actions resulting in innocent deaths and almost costing ned his life also her hatred for jon although there is also a scene where she admits she regretted some of the hatred with edmure i cant get this scene out of my head where he missed all his arrows to burn his fathers body also the scene with robb where he explains he pushed back the mountain and conquered a mill not knowing he messed up robbs plans lysa kind of speaks for itself not participating in the war of kings trustingfalling in love with littlefinger failing in raising a child etc i also dont like they dont seem to have much control over the freys being their bannerman i do like the blackfish
gameofthrones,not_removed,house tullys sigil is the best
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hate catlyn i hate house tully i hate every member of that house i hate everybody that even looks like a tully except bran whom i tolerate they make me want to want the freys to win
gameofthrones,not_removed,no characters are perfect however edmure is a total wimp he gave up his castle and ordered the death of his uncle for what so he could be locked back up in a dungeon again should of took one for that team and accepted his death lets not forget he is basically the reason tywin was able to save kings landing and form an alliance with the tyrells thus turning the war into the lannisters favour lysa was batshit crazy cat was strong but stupid the blackfish is a badass though
gameofthrones,not_removed,he didnt need psychic powers just some listening skills robb let him come to you edmure lets engage them im not surprised though considering he couldnt even shoot an arrow from a to fucking b
gameofthrones,not_removed,edmure is the best catelyn and robb are dicks to him for keeping the smallfolk in the castle but thats what a good lord should do meanwhile robb left the north undefended and look how that turned out
gameofthrones,not_removed,really what did she do i only finished watching for the first time recently but i always remembered her being super nice maybe thats just me being a casual watcher though
gameofthrones,not_removed,why frey
gameofthrones,not_removed,edmure handed over riverrun so that his son didnt suffer any trebuchet related accidents edmure was a fool by allowing tywin to escape though why couldnt he use his psychic powers to read robbs mind and know the plan
gameofthrones,not_removed,this they are my people and they were afraid
gameofthrones,not_removed,when are they dicks to him i dont remember this
gameofthrones,not_removed,taking tyrion hostage started the war between the lannisters and starks
gameofthrones,not_removed,books
gameofthrones,not_removed,to be fair that war would have happened anyway when eddard was arrested for treason in fact isnt that exactly when robb decides to march south not sure cat can be blamed for that one although i agree that taking tyrion hostage was a stupid move at the very least it got ned a spear through his leg
gameofthrones,not_removed,when she arrested tyrion tywin started a war to get him back do you remember jaime crushed all the river lords and laid siege to riverrun
gameofthrones,not_removed,mmm true but that was specifically against the tulleyscatelyn robb still didnt get involved until ned was arrested but i see your point after tywin started pillaging and burning the riberlands im sure it would have led to war eventually

gameofthrones,not_removed,winters arrival as it snuffs out every last flame of hope for the living
gameofthrones,not_removed,it means they needed a cool shot for the trailer and used what was available
gameofthrones,not_removed,your fires burn low my king
gameofthrones,not_removed,two candles blown out two flames snuffed two dragons die
gameofthrones,not_removed,team snow here i like where you are going with this
gameofthrones,not_removed,it means dragonstone is one drafty castle
gameofthrones,not_removed,drogons fart
gameofthrones,not_removed,i saw it was a symbol for darkness falling in westeros as winter covers the continent though you could be on to something if anyone is going to fall out of jon dany and cersei i would say cersei but dany could also fall i see jon as the only one surviving to the end out of the three maybe theyll kill dany off early so jon takes control of the dragons and becomes king of westeros it sounds a bit far fetched but its possible if they really wanted to shock the audience then killing off dany before the final battle will do just that if jon is the end game then theyll need to eliminate some of his competition for him to get where he is now they have pretty much done been doing that throughout the series that from executing ned to eliminating rickon to wiping out the baratheons it is almost as if someone is manipulating the entire thing so jon becomes king theyll eliminate at least one of the queens to reduce the competition so which one will it be dany or cersei or both what do you think
gameofthrones,not_removed,nice catch not sure what i make of it
gameofthrones,not_removed,theyre shaped like three crowns
gameofthrones,not_removed,dragons confirmedo p
gameofthrones,not_removed,the brazier looks an awful lot like the crown on the cover art of a clash of kings maybe this signifies the restart of the war of the five kings but with new rulers vying for power
gameofthrones,not_removed,her reign has ended go in peace
gameofthrones,not_removed,i honestly think thisll mean one of them wont make it to the end of the season like a candle snuffed in the wind but which one will it be
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe its just cold and windy
gameofthrones,not_removed,it means walter white cares more for his drug empire than dany cares for her dragons walterwhitewalkerconfirmed
gameofthrones,not_removed,probably true i was thinking about something more related to daenerys though
gameofthrones,not_removed,low fuel sad
gameofthrones,not_removed,three contenders to the throne two will fall
gameofthrones,not_removed,im sure dragons fart must be like methane wouldnt it make a flame thrower
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really hope its cersei but knowing how the show and the books work it could be dany who falls hoping thats not the case but i agree with your assessment entirely
gameofthrones,not_removed,well we know for sure because of the prophecy that cersei will falldie its just a matter of when thats going to happen clegane bowl get hyped
gameofthrones,not_removed,fake ravens
gameofthrones,not_removed,i mean it could be but yeah i doubt it not with her dragons and the fact shes come so far
gameofthrones,not_removed,zombie daenerys
gameofthrones,not_removed,man her eyes look creepy
gameofthrones,not_removed,horse hearts weigh like pounds thats a lot of meat
gameofthrones,not_removed,i love how they make her eyes glowing like a robotandroid
gameofthrones,not_removed,im getting a real bioshock vibe from this one i cant put my finger on it why though
gameofthrones,not_removed,thats a giant gummy
gameofthrones,not_removed,george is just really bad with numbers
gameofthrones,not_removed,or a white walker
gameofthrones,not_removed,the show was awesome went to the one in philly at the wellsfargo center great set up really cool stage huge screens even some pyrotechnics most of all just really fantastic music they saved light of the seven for the end and it was outstanding ramin played the piano himself during that song and another cool instrument that i cant recall for aryas song called needle they had the scenes playing alongside the music notably the stadium went wild for all of the dany and arya stuff lol and on the flip side the stadium went completely quiet when they played the rains of castamere alongside the red wedding scenes someone in the audience shouted the north remembers lol at the very end they played the bear and the maiden fair alongside an in memoriam for all the characters who have died on the show lol overall it was really great ramin djawadi seems like such a cool and humble guy and the place was packed i imagine if this tour goes well enough they will do another one of these in a few years to add in whatever great stuff ramin does for the last two seasons
gameofthrones,not_removed,some photos from philadelphia on httpimgurcomachncs
gameofthrones,not_removed,saw the show in chicago did any of you guys also have ramin and his crew come out to jam to bear and the maiden fair at the end i uploaded a video of it
gameofthrones,not_removed,tonights show at the forum in inglewood was awesome they had serj tankian from system of a down sing
gameofthrones,not_removed,i might be the lone dissenter here but i was actually very disappointed i went to the chicago show the music was awesome no complaints there and considering its a show for the music bravo it was awesome but while the stage was really cool and the screens on a grand scale i felt like the whole setup was under utilized the screens were basically just clip montages from the show and they kept inserting actual dialogue from the show which felt cheap and distracted from the music it felt like i was watching youtube videos only not for free the only cool thing they really did with the screens was a huge weirwood tree and that was at the very beginning also one of the round screens was brokenpixels out on one end of the stage it was very distracting the stage had some really cool features flames fog soloist stages that rotate and rise but the whole thing just felt under utilized and the stage felt empty most of the time i know the music is the central point of the whole thing and it was great however if you take the time to put all these features into your set design you should use them the visual for the whole thing was lacking i was more impressed by concept video than the actual event my suggestions for improvement nix the visual crap all together and just have the orchestra this orchestra and music at the chicago symphony would have been out of this world intense
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont post much on this sub and may sound like an year old after a bieber concert but let me say oh my frickin god i saw this at verizon last night in dc and it was one of the best if not the best show of any kind ive ever seen i got amazing free tickets would have gladly paid but free is even better sat in section row l which was super close to the big triscreen thing that moves i could feel the heat of the flames see the expression on the faces of the performers and see the leaves falling the energy in verizon center was that of a capitals playoff game people were in costumes there were no fights or yelling like you get at a capswiz game everyone was buzzing everyone was smiling and grinning the whole time it was fucking magical the girl i went with shout out to her roommate for the free tix said i looked like a kid in a candy shop i would recommend this to any got fan absolutely amazing a edit also wanted to mention the star of the show besides the main conductorproducermaestro guy whose name escapes me the main female singer the one who sang reigns of castamere she has an awesome powerful beautiful voice her voice brought people to tears friend of mine said the lady next to him cried at least three times
gameofthrones,not_removed,the la show was amazing they had serj fcking tankian singing the rains of castamere chills
gameofthrones,not_removed,dc show checking in at intermission so far its amazing but i keep watching the screens and forgetting ramin and company are playing live
gameofthrones,not_removed,just got back from the boston show really really cool we had great seats pretty much smack dab in the middle light of the seven was excuse the pun lit
gameofthrones,not_removed,i saw the dc event this wednesday at the verizon center it was incredible i loved needle and mhysa there were a lot of really unique instruments used to great effect i loved the chelloist guy rocking out on the water platform during the greyjoys song oh and of course the pyrotecnics were awesome but what just really blew me away about the whole thing was just like damn you all think how far geek culture has come there is a musical performance for a booktv series being performed across the country in some of the top music venues the verizon center is usually reserved for hockey games big performers like lady gaga or stuff like that but no wednesday night it was a bunch of nerds cheering to game of thrones i just couldnt get over it ive personally attended videogames live several times so i know that nerd performance shows are widespreadish but this just felt so much more legit and mainstream even than vgl it made me really excited to see what events come in the future
gameofthrones,not_removed,boston show was incredible i didnt realize ramin went to berklee school of music he seemed hyped to be back in boston his first home after moving to the us from germany naturally this made the boston fans go nuts nothing like hometown pride light of the seven was just beautiful i also loved the use of the didgeridoo and other wind instruments the ones used during dany and the dragons themes are so dang cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,did they play any of the greyjoy themes what is dead may never die pay the iron price in it they are by far my favorite from the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,denver show was amazing the whole experience was somethin my wife and i will remember forever
gameofthrones,not_removed,just got back from the la show so inspiring and amazing i always figured ramin was a nice guy and this proved it even more loved every song they played got a few chuckles of people shouting mhysa shame and during this really emotional part someone screamed the north remembers ramin had a lot of fun as well and we had a special guest lead singer of system of addown serj tankian the inner middle school in me lost it and he sang i believe a version of rains of castamere overall amazing shed some tears in the beginning
gameofthrones,not_removed,does anyone know approximately how long the concert is
gameofthrones,not_removed,dc show was phenomenal loved watching ramin and the orchestra his music is so intense and infused with emotion the percussionists and drummers made the show imho favorite part by far was the battle of the bastard getting to watch that scene on a huge screen with live music was unreal
gameofthrones,not_removed,went to the show in boston it was amazing ramin is ridiculously talented my favorite had to have been the rains of castamere she had such a powerful voice singing it
gameofthrones,not_removed,for those who went long long was the concert im trying to plan something afterwards thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,just saw the concert in toronto so good we were in section just behind the orchestra you could feel the heat from the pyro so good it was a wonderdul interactive experience my favourite scenes music were needlearya the greyjoy scene and obviously all the jon snowstark music
gameofthrones,not_removed,i had a great time watching the concert at the air canada centre in toronto for anyone looking to get tickets i wouldnt recommend floor seats as you wont have a great view of the screens which has clips of the show i would also recommend being caught up with the show as the concert gives away spoilers from season
gameofthrones,not_removed,the houston show was fucking incredible was sitting rows back in the center couldnt have picked a better seat i didnt even blink i was so into the show ramin djawadi deserves so much more recognition for what he does it was so worth driving hours to see it im still fucking ecstatic
gameofthrones,not_removed,loved the la show it was much better than i expected
gameofthrones,not_removed,i am about to buy tickets for the boston show and have read conflicting reports on where to sit some say you must sit in the middle so you can see screens and other said you need to be on the ends where did you guys sit and what do you suggest is the best area to get the most out of the experience and see everything thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,amazing i went to the boston show last night at the td garden and loved every minute of it heres the facts in outline form bought tickets on groupon and was under capacity for the garden most common comment was didnt want to be disappointed and didnt know what to expect our tickets were each in the balcony dead center right in front of the massive screen great spot if you didnt have floor seats show is hours long i told everyone it was the best show ive ever seen live musical concert vegas performance bar none for me it was a religious experience for a number of reasons seeing one of my favorite composers in person one of my favorite books and shows come to life on the stage and in music format was huge im the type that drives around bumping westworld soundtrack or any game of thrones soundtrack or two steps from hell so this was perfect for me there was a brief intermission after the hour then they performedplayed for hours more or so perfect amount of time and i was on the edge of my seat the balance of stage performance music and scenes from the show was perfect too heres why you want to watch ramin compose you want to watch cellist or various band members or orchestral performers play you want to catch glimpses of the show because they do cutsplice all seasons together that are epic for a given character or scene and so your eyes are darting everywhere to catch it all i was just blown away because there was a beautiful and gutwrenching scene with theon greyjoy and his song dont remember the name and it cut from all six seasons from his wardship with ned to his fall then eventual rise i literally cried at moments because i love agot that much and thought it was brilliant many people that attended were from hours away and made the trek via car or train on a crummy monday night in boston which is a pretty horrible city to navigate on a weekday in the dark id say the timing was poor and perhaps the portrayal of what it would be and wouldnt for the show to sell out go with people that are in love with the show and you wont be disappointed unfortunately the garden isnt very comfy up in the so i had a couple next to me doublefisting beers and getting up either to buy more or hit the head but other than that it was amazing best show of my life and you wont see anything like it if youre fan every again i hope it rolls around for another year or more so i can go with other people
gameofthrones,not_removed,just got back from msg and it absolutely blew me away i had great seats and isaac hempstead wrightbran was rows behind me im actually really happy i didnt buy floor seats i think it would have impaired my enjoyment by not seeing the screens i was in section and it was a perfect view just a beautiful breath taking event from start to finish i didnt want it to end
gameofthrones,not_removed,msg concert was awesome great moment when ramin took the piano to play light of the seven and another director took over the orchestra he was wearing a hand of the king pin nice detail must say that the violinist stole the show she is amazing
gameofthrones,not_removed,i too was at the nyc one last night great show i agree with previous comments about the sound not being powerful enough to capture the emotional intensity debate i was having with my gf was it just me or did the woman singing the rains of castamere get the lyrics wrong at one point
gameofthrones,not_removed,just got back from the charlotte show it was awesome great crowd great performance
gameofthrones,not_removed,ill give a more critical view of the show i went to the one at the wells fargo center in philly with my wife we arrived about an hour before the show this gave us more than enough time to get inside through security grab some concessions and find our seats we were pretty livid when we got to our seats and came to find that we were above the high monitors and directly behind the orchestra this made the majority of the stage invisible to us this was a problem especially given how the show was sold as a degree any seat is a good seat type of show i guess thats what you get for getting tickets but still the point remains some marketing is false and did not make for a good experience seatingwise we fixed our seating problem by going to new seats despite what some have said the stadium was not packed though i imagine it may have seemed that way from the first floor there were entire sections unfilled most of the seating around us turned into a free for all as i heard many people having problems getting up and finding new seats we had friends in a similar predicament across the stadium as well with seating they should not have sold seats anywhere where the seating starts to curve in the stadium i did not drive hours to watch the back of the orchestra after moving the show became instantly better when we could actually see more going on best seats will no doubt be on the floor or on the lower levels but for i could at least appreciate and enjoy this new view best parts were the performances of dracarys and the rains of castamere also hodor and the red wedding if only for being subject to watching the video montages along with the depressing music with a bunch of other people i also thoroughly enjoyed the intro as they cycled through house flags i really enjoyed the musician who played the duduk and other ethnic instruments i remember seeing him with yannis band in some videos and was surprised he was a part of this really solid musician some of the pyrotechnics were cool as well and i could feel the heat even where i was seated quite impressive while cool i was a bit let down by the light of the seven as they condensed the track and the eruption of green colored fire was short lived there were also some timing problems with the orchestra at points the actual sound of the performance felt off some of the instruments did not seem to align with what i was seeing for example i had a good view of the large drum in the back of the orchestra and there were many times where i found myself staring and noticing that the actual beat was not in sync with the hit not sure if this delay was to be expected or indicative of the use of some prerecorded sounds aside from this specific case much of the performance sounded like listening to a studio recording something didnt feel authentic except when the vocalistchoir was on stage the stage was underutilized early on there was a nice section with the tree and at a later part some fake snow fell on the stage both were not really enjoyed all that much given our seats some props were odd and unnecessary namely this door that is lowered onto the stage and a musician is playing and just walks through it and nothing else happens im all for artistic metaphors and such but i sat there and had a good chuckle asking my wife wtf was that in addition to the stage the imagery displayed on the multiple screens was hit or miss i enjoyed watching some parts of the show in conjunction with hearing the music played along it just makes sense for an event like this however at some points seeing images of the show detracts from seeing a screen with the actual performers on them from my viewpoint some screens were also off a smaller screen showed clips from the show but particularly in danys sections with subtitles the subtitles were in reverse really weird due to the tiering of screens above the stage it led to some odd effects weird duck faces on characters etc again this is probably my angle vs everyone on lower levels the worst offender was seeing solo artists such as the vocalist cellist drummer duduk player on screen engulfed in some laughable fire rain and snow effects end thoughts it was a good show that could have been better part of this is my having higher expectations for my seats probably because of marketing indicating that any seat is a good seat and actually believing the hype once i moved to a better spot even up in the rafters the whole experience became much better the stage show could have been more engaging and the imagery on display too i feel the creators were torn before having just an orchestral display and having an actual theatrical display and decided to try and split the difference some parts just work more than others the best moments really came from reexperiencing high emotional points in the show which too an extent feels cheap to write out as its not indicative of the quality of the live show but more so the quality of got as a tv show the best still was the occasional audience member chiming in during a quiet moment like with a bunch of people throughout the stadium yelling the north remembers after acertainevent is shown id say its worth going to if you check your expectations even more worth it if you have seats on the first floor of the stadium your in and facing the center of the stage still after all my cynical bs how many other opportunities do got fans get to come together in one huge public setting listen to some dope orchestral tunes watch segments of the show and be entertained im hoping for a next one after the show ends with some more elaborate set designs but for now this will be a cool memory for what it was
gameofthrones,not_removed,houston was amazing we were sitting third row in the club seats im still a little awestruck it was everything i hoped and more
gameofthrones,not_removed,heres my dump of pics and short vids from the houston show yesterday httpimgurcomaptrqe
gameofthrones,not_removed,la tonight anyone else going section we out here
gameofthrones,not_removed,laying in bed as i write this just got home from the la show at the forum i cant believe i got to see ramin djawadi himself so talented i was blown away
gameofthrones,not_removed,all hail based flute lord pedro
gameofthrones,not_removed,just got to see the la show last night not great seatsbut i definitely still got the experience im so happy that they decided to take this on tour and that i had the chance to see it it was an amazing concert the performers were all fantastic live ramin was a delight and his passion really showed and the set and stage performance part of it was incredible
gameofthrones,not_removed,was there much cosplay seeing it in montreal this friday any other mcgill students around here
gameofthrones,not_removed,holy shit this concert was so amazing it was immersive it felt like you where there and the stage was amazing i wanna see it again
gameofthrones,not_removed,great show in boston last night i had to tell myself at times to focus on the orchestra since thats the part i cant see whenever i want but it was all put together well i particularly liked how some scenes were interspersed with earlier ones as part of single sequences eg the door and hardhome watchers on the wall as a window into jon and ygrittes history the choral songs like mhysa and winds of winter really stood out the latter in part due to the edited clips other favorites were son of the harpy and needle if i couldve added a piece it would be house of the undying
gameofthrones,not_removed,hey everyone this is my first post and thank you for all the comments so far re the concert i have a questioni know a lot of you mentioned the floor seats having some screen viewing issues but has anyone sat in the house stark section i bought these for my mom and i for her birthday yes they were pricey but she is a huge fan it says the vip seats can enter as early as and that there is a round table talk with raminhas anyone does this how did it go was the food they serve just bar food apparently you get a few mementos also any feedback on how good they were ill be at the fll show tomorroweven though i may have to look up i am so excited to share this with my mom shes going to love itthanks so much
gameofthrones,not_removed,msg last night woke up this morning wishing i was still there it was pretty awesome the battle of the bastards absolutely blew me away although i have to say unpopular opinion alert i did have some complaints for whatever reason i didnt think it was loud enough also i thought they could have done so much more with light of the seven i dont expect them to have brought a pipe organ in but it just sounded so electric and at the end of the song i was expecting legit pyrotechnics not necessarily what we got but whatever it was an awesome experience id go again
gameofthrones,not_removed,just got home from the charlotte show that was awesome just go if you can its worth it
gameofthrones,not_removed,sitting in the atlanta show right now waiting for it to start mildly hype edit intermission she got rains of castermere right
gameofthrones,not_removed,just left the atlanta show it was a fantastic set but i couldnt stand the overlay of actual clips and dialogue over it i was there to hear the music not a montage of plot points and popular quotes did anyone else notice the sound system cutting in and out constantly during the first part or was that just me either way i was very impressed with the choice of songs and the presentation of the houses was very cool didnt even realize the tyrell theme had been there all along
gameofthrones,not_removed,went to the atlanta show last night and absolutely loved it i had chills the whole time i went with two friends who havent watched an entire episode of got between them but they love live music and pyrotechnics so they went with me both of them had a great time as well and theyre seriously considering watching the show now they were even able to follow along pretty well with minimal prior knowledge of the shows plot
gameofthrones,not_removed,just got back from the san jose show and that was magnificent
gameofthrones,not_removed,just watched the san jose show so good easily one of the best concerts ive ever been to fantastic music and cinematics rains of castamere is beyond stuck in my head now lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,saw the show in philly last night overall i thought it was very pretty good but it definitely needed some kind of story telling to go along with the show maybe someone dressed as a maester talking about the families and events that have occurred in the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,going to the show in ft lauderdale so excited how was everyone dressed work casual jeans and tshirts or suits and dresses
gameofthrones,not_removed,show was amazing here in chicago not as many people as i thought there would be but i thought it was due to the fact that it switched from a sunday to a wednesday only thing that surprised me is that they didnt play the tower was looking forward to it but it was amazing from start to finish
gameofthrones,not_removed,the dc concert was excellent the musicians the sound quality it was all really amazing for those asking about best seat location i was on the floor at the verizon center i was able to see the middle screens but it was a side angle view the view of the orchestra the small stage and everything in between was excellent i had bought front row vip but apparently days ago they added seats right in front on mine kind of annoying bannermen vip got a gift bag containing a stainlesssteel tankardtype mug a commemorative ticket and a thickquality glossy poster of sheet music signed by ramin you also get crowdfree shopping but i thought the merch table was very underwhelming lots of shirts a mug hat cds didnt buy anything the house vip sections in the middle had high top tables they did not have a view of the side screens but they were in the middle of everything if you sit on the floor you will get rained on by red paper leaves and snow there was also a lot of smoke and bursts of fire i still have my eyebrows but it was quite warm does anyone know what song they played at the end after the thank yous and bows where ramin played guitar and they all walked around happily singing and playing along
gameofthrones,not_removed,is anyone interested in buying my tickets at a discount i bought them for march at pm at the air canada center in toronto and i cant go pm me if interested
gameofthrones,not_removed,just saw it in boston god i love this showbooks i wish the merch wasnt so overpriced i bought a t shirt
gameofthrones,not_removed,currently at madison square garden for the new york show have a great time everyone
gameofthrones,not_removed,msg show last night was incredible does anyone have an accurate setlist of the songs performed theres one which is incomplete and ive managed to put together on spotify by its a bit incomplete and out of order if anyone could help out it would be much appreciated
gameofthrones,not_removed,went to charlotte show last night and it was awesome we were third row back on the floor so it was definitely difficult to see the main screens but being twenty feet away from the musicians was breathtaking i would highly highly recommend seeing this show perfect seats would be facing the main screen not too close
gameofthrones,not_removed,ramin and his team killed it tonight in fort lauderdale what a great show worth every penny was hesitant to sit close was lower bowl first row but it was fine although i agree with others that sitting halfway up the lower bowl is probably the best view however being less than feet from the performers provides an intimacy that you wont get anywhere else happy to share pics if folks are interested
gameofthrones,not_removed,went in ft lauderdale last night and have to say one of the coolest experiences ive ever had it was so fun i teared up times during the intro during the red wedding and during hodor the best part for me was when the ethnic wind instruments guy ran across the stage with a hose like instrument hornish type does anyone know what this is called id see it again
gameofthrones,not_removed,just got back to my hotel post show here in tampa it was absolutely fantastic every piece was beautiful on its own but coupled with the giant screens and pyrotechnics it was a complete marvel to see and hear if you have the opportunity do your ears a favor and go see this show you will not regret it
gameofthrones,not_removed,for everyone that went to the concert did it start on time thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,at the show now in houston worth every penny spent
gameofthrones,not_removed,saw it in houston last night the wife and i were blown away easily the best concert ive seen in years go go go if its coming near you
gameofthrones,not_removed,just got back last night from the denver show super amazing to be able to go with my wife and some close friends surprisingly not a lot of people even knew about this concert
gameofthrones,not_removed,heres the best video ive found of the rains of castamere by serj tankian starts late but otherwise amazing sound quality
gameofthrones,not_removed,just got back from the show in las vegas they did a great job with the format and accompanying the music with video clips really glad i had a chance to experience it
gameofthrones,not_removed,probably will get lost since this is a month old but does anyone know if there is any cddvds of the event available to buy i loved the live version and the lead vocalist was great and was different from the standard sountrack would love to have this if its available anyone on the fence go it was so much better than anything i could have imagined and now the best show ive been to in my life
gameofthrones,not_removed,who are the soloists traveling with ramin i loved the drummers and the violinist
gameofthrones,not_removed,im so upset they arent planning on doing anything in the uk
gameofthrones,not_removed,seeing it tomorrow in toronto my fiancée and i havent seen season yet does the concert pretty much go in order at least if it does we can stop watching the screens after the season stuff also is the list of dead characters at the end
gameofthrones,not_removed,i went to the msg show last night in ny and i have to say i regret buying my tickets the orchestra was great so was the composer and his band but the section i was sitting in should never have been offered as seating to anyone not only could we not see the stage at all but the huge monitors they were using in the show were aimed downward distorting all the visuals for anyone sitting level with them paid and wasnt willing to pay for a concert tee so we ended up leaving after a half hour into the show from what we could see while walking out it looks like a spectacular time and i still love the books and the show but i feel kind of cheated by whoever designated available seating for this performance
gameofthrones,not_removed,i went to the show in boston on monday it was amazing im still reeling from it reliving some of the saddest moments in the series felt worse with the music and the orchestra sounded beautiful i hope they do something like this again
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just got tickets to the event in san jose hype
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just wanted to say that my husband and i dont get to do very many things very often so we splurged and bought seats for our anniversary were driving hours to san antonio for the show thursday night and im super excited im glad everyone is enjoying it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i couldnt make it to the tampa show last night but this review was in our local paper and i totally regret it that i missed it hopefully they tour again once the series ends everyones youtube videos are awesome maybe i should drive up atlanta tomorrow
gameofthrones,not_removed,incredible
gameofthrones,not_removed,this might sound ridiculous but does it seem like there is any kind of dress code associated with the concert or is it casual considering its a symphonic concert im curious if ill have to dress up or not
gameofthrones,not_removed,first of all i loved it i saw it in houston i also realized that i could never watch the entire series like that it was overwhelming the emotion i loved ramin and his humility seriously the guy is brilliant side note i am looking for a largemens or xlwomens concert shirt the group i went with had to get back home and i had no time to wait in line hoping that someone that hasnt gone yet will show mercy and get one for me any takers
gameofthrones,not_removed,im still in traffic to park right now its so slow im on reddit spent half the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,at the phoenix show now im so excited
gameofthrones,not_removed,holy shit that is all there is to say about it holy shit as a loyal bannerman i about shit myself when i got the bolton banner section and also it was a little odd lord bolton had the third most screen time behind dany and the bastard no complaints about that though
gameofthrones,not_removed,i went to the la show at the inglewood forum i was seated directly below the banner for house tyrell and i had such an urging to take that banner hahah the show was amazing but the maester song was the weakest bit of the entire show to be honest
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was surprised they didnt do the tower of joy scene does anyone know where to download the stark theme on itunes
gameofthrones,not_removed,went to the live show in san jose just days ago here are some highlights i got it was a fun experience to sit with other got fans as we cheered at random scenes but i think the price was too much my ticket was process fee
gameofthrones,not_removed,im late to the party on this but i was at the one in nyc last night overall im pretty disappointed to put it kindly we had vip tickets that let us in an hour earler than general public it was to let us in and see some memorabilia and grab our seats they underhandedly had several levels of vip that werent spelled out until we were there the only memorabilia available to see was a handful of costumes and replica throne that were roped off completely not what we were there for as far as the concert it was okay stars if i was to rate it the music is obviously awesome the show is lucky to have ramin djawadi but the entire show was basically a highlight reel from the beginning now with the music they played during certain scenes it got played out quickly for me and several in our section a friend of mine left at intermission overall if you are interested get cheaper tickets the music is good but the show and the organization as a whole was woefully underwhelming
gameofthrones,not_removed,for people that have already gone to one of these is it worthwhile to pay up for bettercloser seats or is it enough just being in the building also any advice on which end of the stage to sit on for optimal viewinglistening the floor chart shows a big round stage on one end and a small round stage on the other what is going on for each and should we be at one end or the other i want to go but the tickets to the fort lauderdale show are pretty pricey
gameofthrones,not_removed,went yesterday to the toronto show was absolutely amazing we sat pretty high up in the and could still feel the fire from up there favourite bit was the house introsthemes i regret not getting the cd now though only picked up the poster
gameofthrones,not_removed,what kind of merchandise was for sale
gameofthrones,not_removed,is anyone selling two tickets to the charlotte show this thursday
gameofthrones,not_removed,going thursday to charlotte show taking our boys hoping this show and crowd is kid friendly any parts i need to be ready for
gameofthrones,not_removed,trying to pick my senses for tonights show at the garden but idk where to sit theres some floor seats further away from the house lannister and house stark section are those any good
gameofthrones,not_removed,just got back from madison sq garden it was awesome really blew me away succeeded my expectations tbh one small problem was that the screens made everyone look kinda weird but overall an amazing spectacle i truly recommend this for any got fan
gameofthrones,not_removed,msg show checking in it was fantastic i want to echo what a few others said which helped me get seats off the floor in the middle of the stadium seats on the floor are cool if you want to be near the performers but honestly of the show is the accompanying montages and you really cant see those well from the floor
gameofthrones,not_removed,just back from msg sat in the very top of the which made it somewhat difficult to see what was going on but glad the screens were there to show amazing job done by ramin djawadi and his orchestral team loved the flames pyrotechnics in reign the crazy wilding horn being swung degrees in the wilding piece and rain of castamere being sung live was just so different only regret is having to leave early to catch a train and missing the battle of the bastard and light of the seven piece overall glad i went to listen to such fantastic music ps does anyone know what that horn insturment being swung in a circle is called
gameofthrones,not_removed,was at the msg show sat at section not too high up great view great sound enjoyed it immensely the bear and the maiden fair at the end was a lovely surprise
gameofthrones,not_removed,i have tickets to game of thrones live concert in tampa my wife isnt feeling well and im thinking of taking my son years old for those of you who have gone would you consider the content of the concert appropriate for a year old my wife and i have read the books and watched the series i would not recommend the books or the hbo series for my kids at and years old i love the books and series but its ok to say that our kids will have to wait a few years to be able to enjoy got that being said the reason im asking i know during the concert video clips and some liveaction is shown during the performance my son would love the music but i wouldnt be keen on some of the explicit sexual material again your replies are much appreciated the concert is sunday
gameofthrones,not_removed,amazing show
gameofthrones,not_removed,what are the best seats are vip tables worth it
gameofthrones,not_removed,fully worth it would canada
gameofthrones,not_removed,this may be a silly question but im going to the show in fort lauderdale this weekend and was wondering about the dress like i assume the audience is dressed casuallyright
gameofthrones,not_removed,what are you seeing people wearingits a date nite for wife and i table seats house 🦁
gameofthrones,not_removed,we saw the show in tampa last night and i was frankly pretty disappointed perhaps that has to do with pricing it seems like we paid a lot more than others in the thread have our tickets were a piece and we were in nosebleed seats though at least close to the center of the screen httpsimgurcomgalleryghdrf was the closest to my experience the drummer and ethnic woodwind player were the only interesting parts of the music ive heard better renditions of rains of castamere on youtube and the light of the seven was pretty good but you can see a live video of that online their singer needs to learn how to breathe like dont pull the mic up to your mouth as youre taking a big breath the whole first half of the show was basically cut scenes of every depressing thing on the show mashed together with no catharsis which wasnt pleasant they saved most of the triumphant scenes for quick clips right in the last few minutes of the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,wait can someone clear something up for mewhen they say iron throne photoop for house table seat members does that mean you get to sit on the throne or just take pictures in front of the roped off area
gameofthrones,not_removed,just came back from san antonio show im still in awe great concert i cried i cheered i relived a truly awesome experience
gameofthrones,not_removed,who was at the san antonio show just got back home and loved it
gameofthrones,not_removed,this sounds incredible
gameofthrones,not_removed,i went to the show in atlanta it was great however i purchased floor seats thinking they would be raised up to view the orchestra they were not we were unable to see the orchestra during the show but we were able to see the middle and right stage very well if the set ups are relatively the same from show to show i wouldnt recommend floor seats regardless i enjoyed the show and would definitely go again sidenote i was incredibly displeased at the lack of love for jon snow if you were at the atlanta show i am disappointed in you
gameofthrones,not_removed,can anyone chime in on which seats would be the best to view the show upper level lower level floor if people could let me know where they were sitting and what their thoughts were thatd be incredibly helpful i wanna go to the san jose show at the sap arena
gameofthrones,not_removed,those who have been to the concert are school bags allowed there want to know because ill be going from my college
gameofthrones,not_removed,does anyone from the vegas show have laminated passes theyd sell want to buy one for my ticket board
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just splurged on a ticket for the vancouver show i knew i wanted to go when it was first announced and still i waited till a week before to buy ticketsthe photos from other shows have so many empty seats but here it is sold out
gameofthrones,not_removed,does anyone from the vegas show have video of matt berningers lead singer of the national who sang the song in the show performance of rains of castemere
gameofthrones,not_removed,went to the one in st paul incredibly cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,i went in boston a couple weeks ago it was fantastic
gameofthrones,not_removed,me and my girlfriend loved it i was tired from a long day the flamethrowers woke me right up the artists were amazing in the mpls show the singer the instruments the showmanship and effects were all just spectacular words cannot describe
gameofthrones,not_removed,does anyone know the orchestra that is traveling with the tour i cant find any individual musician credits and i was curious the names of the soloists
gameofthrones,not_removed,can anyone tell me what kind of merch they are selling just tshirts or do they have the actual album there for sale im going tomorrow was just curious
gameofthrones,not_removed,i get to attend at rogers arena in vancouver on saturday april im super excited with not much idea of what to expect gotta say game of thrones is my favorite show im hoping this can only improve my opinion of the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,was also at the philly show last night the crowd really made the event hearing people screaming fuck you olly zigzag was great the stage lights pyrotechnics were awesome they use a local chorus in each town so that was also nice to hear the vocalist did a tremendous job considering she is singing like four languages only one is real the cellist was pure punk the violinist was phenomenal during her solos needle may have been my favorite part of the show the light of the seven had such a cool phantom of the opera feel to it the show does a great job of weaving all the major storylines characters though they didnt highlight some of the biggest moments in the show like viper vs mt joffs death tyrion killing shae tywin anything that happens in dorne so they basically skip seasons unless it pertained to jon or danny they could have had more on stage action people only ever walk across the stage it would be nice to see them do more like dance or mimic fights cant complain though overall it was very well done was such an awesome way to take thrones in seeing the battle of the bastards on that big screen with the orchestra blaring was intense i wish they would take certain movies star wars indiana jones bond interstellar or the dark knight trilogy take them on the road like this the grand spectacle is fantastic well worth the price of admission will upload photosvideo later
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was there as well the highlight of my night was watching a drunk joffrey cosplayer getting escorted off the floor by the main stage
gameofthrones,not_removed,wow hearing rains of castamere while they show the red wedding in an arena where everyone is completely silent must have been an experience how did they end light of the seven was there a big explosion of fireworks or anything
gameofthrones,not_removed,another cool instrument that i cant recall for aryas song called needle hammered dulcimer
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was at the philly show too i thought it was fantastic from what i saw on previous concert photos online philly looked like it was the most filled which made me happy my friend and i on are side started the king of the north chant we were fangirling a bit but the music and show was really awesome so glad i went idk whats going to hold me over now though for season
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just got tickets for the phoenix show this is going to sound dumb but what is the dress code for this thing tie targarian tee shirt
gameofthrones,not_removed,did they play reign or dracarys what is the string instrument that gets a little ominous and dramatic solo is it a bass on dracarys and on reign
gameofthrones,not_removed,he played the hammer dulcimer on needle killer show
gameofthrones,not_removed,just got back home from the show in houston it was absolutely fantastic i loved the beginning when the iron throne came out and then into the intro song before the red wedding ramin said ok so we just did the rains of castamere so you know whats next the doors are locked everyone laughed then it got quiet really quickly he looked like he was having a great time sharing his work with everyone light of the seven was just perfect
gameofthrones,not_removed,omg that sounds so amazing wish i went long live king snow
gameofthrones,not_removed,hey so they did have costumes and stuff on display where were they just out in the open or in a special area that needs a special pass or something could you sit on the throne and take a picture
gameofthrones,not_removed,yup with an im memoriam for every character who has died
gameofthrones,not_removed,honestly this was the song that i was anticipating the most to say it did not disappoint would be a huge understatement
gameofthrones,not_removed,so epic gave me chills
gameofthrones,not_removed,i recorded the
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was there too it was amazing also did anyone else get a call about winning the raffle that you signed up for on those monitors we got a call about winning hotel nights and airfare all they asked for was for us to attend a min conference at some place in encino cant find anything else on the web about this but it just seems too good to be true edit never mind its a scam trying to sell bad time shares
gameofthrones,not_removed,nooooo way having the scenes relate to the music is what really hits the emotional aspect plus not many people listen to the soundtrack without seeing the show having the clips helps the average viewer understand the intensity
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree clips were important but i think some parts could be muted and not have the dialogue cover up the music as much
gameofthrones,not_removed,i somewhat agree as well i really had no expectations going into the show but i felt like it left a little on the table technically the fireworks and weirwood leaves and the snow were cool and very well placed but as things moved around the stage there was some mechanical noise which kind of interrupted the music and the speaking lines audio from the montages was hard to hear maybe just in issue from last night but either way my attention was struggling to try and follow the screens and the stages and i felt like the wandering instrumentalists were getting out of sync with the orchestra sometimes and the quality of the graphics was slightly less than i would expect but maybe it was just a bit of a rush job but dont get me wrong its still really really cool lots of spoilers so be warned and for the charlotte show last night the supporting orchestra and singers were local which i thought was a really cool idea maybe theyll host a oneoff run at some point like ive see with lotr and hp scenes and videos running as the orchestra plays the music
gameofthrones,not_removed,agree completely
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree the clips were so loud i had a difficult time hearing the music they also didnt seem to arrange anything much differently from the show so it felt like just watching the scene again only the drummer and ethnic woodwind performer were really interesting to see in person their singer also needs to learn not to breathe in the mic
gameofthrones,not_removed,my only disappointment was that i thought it would be more amped like transsiberian orchestra also our vocalist was very breathylike she couldnt hold the full value of the note but otherwise nah i lovedddd the visualsthere was something for everyone
gameofthrones,not_removed,i took a lot of vids from up close if people would like me to ill upload them theyre pretty large files so dont want to do it if nobody will bother watching them
gameofthrones,not_removed,ha i was a few rows ahead of you in row c exactly my feelings too
gameofthrones,not_removed,this was such a huge surprise for me around the end when he went full high pitch i swear i never had this kind of a massive goosebump
gameofthrones,not_removed,we just went there too and also kept forgetting about the live music the sound was so perfectly mixed and synchronized with the videos that it felt like it was all coming from the screen it was almost too perfect to be live and sometimes i almost doubted that it was
gameofthrones,not_removed,we were there too so great everyone booing ramsey ha ha
gameofthrones,not_removed,the guy who played all the wind instruments is actually my crazy uncle hes insanely talented he makes a lot of his instruments if you remember one instrument i dont know what its called that he swung around like crazy he made that out of an old vacuum part
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh yes
gameofthrones,not_removed,is this my dear friend max lol my buddy and his wife went to the show in denver as well and was glowing about it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i totally agree ramin was so great the crowd was fun and the experience blew my expectations away i loved it
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,can confirm i was there last night too it was awesome battle of the bastards and needle were highlights for me hodorbran and red wedding were so intense and painful to watch cant wait for season
gameofthrones,not_removed,favorite part by far was the battle of the bastard getting to watch that scene on a huge screen with live music was unreal that and the audience ive never watched the show with anyone else so essentially watching an episode even in part with a whole arena was a crazy experience
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was about hours i went to the philly one and it ended around or so
gameofthrones,not_removed,minneapolis show was hours also
gameofthrones,not_removed,same in new york started at around and left at around
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah that heat was crazy we were in at the far corner but still had a great vantage point for the screens and soloists i was a bit worried about our seats but it was fantastic the crowd certainly cheered for their favourites i couldnt believe the length of the sept scenemusic it was awesome
gameofthrones,not_removed,agree about the floor seats was at the toronto show having the multiple screens including the smaller side screens above the audience really allowed you to take in a bunch of interesting visualssoloists
gameofthrones,not_removed,were you on the lower level or the upper level or the floor im wondering which seats to get
gameofthrones,not_removed,httpsimgurcomacjkop these general areas offer the best view of screenstage
gameofthrones,not_removed,middle think yd line
gameofthrones,not_removed,am sitting on the endwould rather be in the middle great show either way
gameofthrones,not_removed,sit able to see the screen i just went
gameofthrones,not_removed,definitely middle
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was there last night too i also cried i have been incredibly lucky to see hundreds of live performances from classical to rap in my lifetime but i honestly have to say it was one of the best acoustic and visual experiences of my life i really wish my other got friends had gone it was just incredible
gameofthrones,not_removed,more scenes and quotes from tyrion would have been great
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was at msg last night and my favorite part was ramin playing during light of the seven
gameofthrones,not_removed,she did fuck up we were confused as why they did it that way
gameofthrones,not_removed,i havent been to the concert yet going to the show but ive watched some videos and she consistently sings it differently so i wonder if its intentional ive heard her sing my claws are sharp and sharp my lord instead of long and sharp i dont know whyd they change it though
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes rains of castamere singer got the lyrics wrong in boston as well i was a tad disappointed as it was the moment i was most looking forward to rip my beloved tywin i also wish the song took place later in the evening rather than so early on
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i noticed that too lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,im standing in front of one of the gates here just heard rains of castamere playing from inside the building maybe theyre rehearsing or something im so aboard the hype train
gameofthrones,not_removed,there were some people in cosplay right near the stage were the only ones i saw they had floor seating so they were the closest seats in the stadium
gameofthrones,not_removed,in dc there was a decent amount id say had some sort of got gear on mostly tshirts id say had full blown cosplay costumes
gameofthrones,not_removed,in my section in charlotte there was a tormundlooking guy and a jon snow lookalike sitting next to me i didnt even notice til he was coming back to his seat after the intermission and further down there was a young lady who looked just like sophie turner except with allgreen hair but i only saw a couple of people dressed in actual costumes both danys
gameofthrones,not_removed,did you find out the answer to your food question i am going to the san jose show tonight and we were trying to figure out whether to get food before the show or if we would be able to get something there
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was there as well had an excellent time where were you sitting i was in sec and agree that it could have definitely been louder im not sure if maybe i was too far away or if i just enjoy my music too loud but yeah besides that it was epic
gameofthrones,not_removed,rains was fantastic especially every reprise of it it reminded me of olenna joking about how often it is played in the books since it came back for the walk of atonement with all the vocalizations simply amazing
gameofthrones,not_removed,i really enjoyed the clipsdialogue on top but itd be nice if the dialogue audio wasnt so distorted perhaps it was just the acoustics of the arena but it was hard to make out some of the lines
gameofthrones,not_removed,any preshow events i thought about showing up early to see some of the cosplayers in san antonio but maybe a bit earlier as well if there are some eventsphoto ops prior
gameofthrones,not_removed,same here back from san jose sat in section i think a lot of people missed the beginning part because i got in late and there were a lot of people behind me heres my point of view
gameofthrones,not_removed,i went to the san jose show as well it was interesting to hear rains of castamere with a female vocalist but she knocked it out of the park i loved the bear and the maiden fair a the end and the whole thing aghhh so good
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was casual from what i could tell prob a good place to wear any merch you may have
gameofthrones,not_removed,it was mixed here in chicago i went in just jeans and tshirt but it looked liked a lot of people were at the concert right after work so they were dressed up in like business casual
gameofthrones,not_removed,haha damn i felt the heat of the fire from the floor area i cant imagine how toasty it got down on the floor
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,the bear and the maiden fair is the song
gameofthrones,not_removed,intermission that first half was fantastic
gameofthrones,not_removed,what did you think of the volume show was incredible but i kind of thought it wasnt loud enough maybe i just enjoy my music too loud lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,man that was a hell of a show my only complaint is i didnt sit on the sides to get the big tv view but hey at least i can finally say i sat rows away from the floor in msg
gameofthrones,not_removed,i wish they would publish this information can i buy the ost anywhere
gameofthrones,not_removed,i too would love to know all the different songs and edits and new pieces written specifically for the show if you take the setlistfm set as a starter and then browse youtube long enough you can at least double it but the correct sequence is another thing entirely
gameofthrones,not_removed,its a didgeridoo i think i choked back tears for the same three moments ned the red wedding and hodor plus maybe needle which featured aryas arc plus shireen how could i not tear up for her every time
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought ramin said it was armenian but im not sure what its called
gameofthrones,not_removed,atlanta started on time i mean between five and ten minutes after but no show starts on the dot otherwise youd have people flooding into their seats which they still were
gameofthrones,not_removed,did you take any video of rains of castamere super jealous matt berninger was there to sing it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i also want a cd or dvd of the show maybe they will announce it after the tour is over which is today i think or maybe it will be shown as a special feature in the season dvdbluray
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i also hope that they will publish a cd or dvd or bluray i have seen some videos on youtube and this looks really good i am sad that they doesnt make a europe tour
gameofthrones,not_removed,cameron rocked the house
gameofthrones,not_removed,everything isnt in perfect order no also youll hear enough of the scenes for things to be spoiled even if you arent watching do yourself a favor and watch season before you go
gameofthrones,not_removed,isnt the point to listen to the music idk maybe im crazy if i wanna go to a concert for the music
gameofthrones,not_removed,you really should i hope they tour again but i couldnt take that chance so glad i made the drive up to charlotte
gameofthrones,not_removed,its casual wear whatever you want
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just sat down at and then two songs later they took a break
gameofthrones,not_removed,did you take any video of rains of castamere super jealous matt berninger was there to sing it
gameofthrones,not_removed,hey just wanted to say thanks i was at the seattle show my best friend ended up not being able to make it we sat and watched your entire video earlier today and it was the next best thing to her getting to go
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would say dont get the floor seats the video screens would be very hard to see with any sort of comfort the larger end is the orchestra i would sit on that end but on the long side of the stage for the best view not the end zone so to speak
gameofthrones,not_removed,i would recommend to sit on one of the sides not the ends closer to the big stage if you can medium level probably has the best view we say all the way on the top and had great view on the overall show just couldnt see the musicians too well id say if in doubt go higher
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope you made it to the fll show last night it was amazing seats we bought ok seats but i guess they didnt sell enough so they gave us new tickets upon arrival and they moved us to the center best seats in the house
gameofthrones,not_removed,mostly dollar tee shirts
gameofthrones,not_removed,its absolutely kid friendly theres no nudity swearing and there arent any graphic deaths shown i think robb and jon getting stabbed might be the worst of it
gameofthrones,not_removed,checked the booth they dont have cd of the concert only cd from each of the seasons
gameofthrones,not_removed,its called a didgeridoo
gameofthrones,not_removed,there are no nudesex scenes included there is definitely footage of violence though
gameofthrones,not_removed,there are no sex scenes no real violence either maybe some sword battles it does show parts from the red wedding though but the overall experience far outweighs any concerns he will remember this for the rest of his life
gameofthrones,not_removed,see you there
gameofthrones,not_removed,id avoid vip seats and on the end you cant see the giant screen
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah the show that i went to most people were dressed casually a lot of people with got tshirts on saw a couple of jon snows which was great haha
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was there last night how did you like
gameofthrones,not_removed,anything from formal gowns to tshirt jeans to chainmail
gameofthrones,not_removed,a piece thats bullshit ticketmaster was selling those seats you got in the second level for around fees unless you bought from a reseller
gameofthrones,not_removed,idk what you paid for but my seats were something after processing and taxes we were the first row on the second level dead centerabsolutely perfect seats maybe it was luck we only bought them days before the show
gameofthrones,not_removed,on the iron throne
gameofthrones,not_removed,dont go with floor your view is limited sort by newest posts and see recent reviews
gameofthrones,not_removed,lower level avoid the corners i have a giant pole in front of my face
gameofthrones,not_removed,possibly i do know they checked bags probably should call the venue and ask
gameofthrones,not_removed,its whatever the usual rules for that venue are you might want to check their website
gameofthrones,not_removed,la had empty seats until about min into the show but once it got going it was almost totally full
gameofthrones,not_removed,they use an orchestra local to each city from what he said at the san jose performance for san jose it was the skywalker symphony
gameofthrones,not_removed,i went to the san jose california one two days ago the merch there was pretty disappointing tshirts of them with pretty lackluster designs imo and of them was ehh decent enough one of them is while the other three are each poster of httpwwwmicrobytecorpcombsfimagesgameofthronesjpg cup with the same thing printed on it there was a cd being offered but i think its just the originally recorded soundtrack the only decent thing i saw was the varsity jacket with game of thrones live experience sewn on it it was though nope just settled for popcorn
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was thinking that as well for shows and movies with big enough fan bases like star wars i can see this becoming a popular thing i think they should do this again when the series ends for good they would prob get just as many if not more people to go especially with more seasons worth of potential new music i feel i should point out that if you are not caught up on the show and care about seeing spoilers fair warning they show a lot someone with me hasnt finished season yet unfortunately for him lol they do assume youve seen everything at this concert lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,a star wars version of this would be amazing someone call disney
gameofthrones,not_removed,nso often does orchestral play along to big movies at wolf trap in va im sure they mist in other places too they have done lord of the rings i believe star wars and indiana jones too we went to see back to the future and it was awesome
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre kidding lol i didnt see that but i did see people dressed up i costumes down by the stage i assumed they were cosplayers there was an obnoxious person sitting behind us who just kept shouting and kinda ruining the vibe she completely ruined the somber and touching tone after they played the hodor scene
gameofthrones,not_removed,yea they shot up green fire right at the end no fireworks but there were some stage spots that did fire two or three times they did it for light of the seven and the scene with the dragons in the arena toasting the ships
gameofthrones,not_removed,green fire and smoke shot up from stage during lots djawadi the raised organ were surroundedengulfed as well which was really cool fire shot up from stage and spit down from sky as if from a dragon during dany scenesagain dope you could hear pins drop during rainsred wedding hodor jon got more vocal reaction some guy said rains was the best part on way out
gameofthrones,not_removed,i actually dont remember if they had any fire at that point i want to say yes but maybe someone else can confirm that because i dont remember lol the most notable parts with fire were when they showed dany and the dragons burning down all the ships the fire was coming out from the screens and the stage it was great
gameofthrones,not_removed,at the charlotte show last night they dropped down these reflecting mirrors and shot light beams between them it was really cool just like the what sam sees in the library the lights either ended up off stage or as a spotlight on some of the instrumentalists very cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,i always thought it was a harpsichordi truly got more of an appreciation hearing ramin play the hammered dulcimer
gameofthrones,not_removed,definitely no dress code just wear whatever you like
gameofthrones,not_removed,look your best but not super formal many people rocking got apparel we wore jeans tshirts many couples were dressed up very nicely the women wore very nice dresses
gameofthrones,not_removed,lookin for this exact question thanks a ton for throwing it out there
gameofthrones,not_removed,im at the la one and someone just showed up as varys with a green bottle
gameofthrones,not_removed,they definitely performed dracarys at the msg show i believe that instrument was the cello it kicked ass
gameofthrones,not_removed,at our show during the walk of shame the audience did shout shamewas fun
gameofthrones,not_removed,they were just behind a rope around the outside of the arena on the first floor out where the concessions stands and such are
gameofthrones,not_removed,and no syrio on there
gameofthrones,not_removed,yup i would not be able to connect the ost with the scenes just by listening to the music but when they played the scenes i was able to emotionally connect the music to what i felt when watching
gameofthrones,not_removed,you heard the breathiness also i heard some different arrangements
gameofthrones,not_removed,ill watch them im debating on going to the atlanta one
gameofthrones,not_removed,please do
gameofthrones,not_removed,i know i was surprised by the cercei cheers too
gameofthrones,not_removed,unfortunately no but im sure your buddy max loved it like us
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was in the lower level about twelve rows back thats going to be the best spot for the show now the floor seats were vip seats so i believe they got some extra stuff out of it and were close enough to the stage to hear the musicians speak but they couldnt really see the big screen and had to just watch on a monitor in front of them the upper level seats wouldnt be bad as long as you were in the center meaning like the yard line but the big screen is actually angled downward slightly so it might not be the best angle id shoot for the seats as close to the middle as possible its well worth the money with a view like that
gameofthrones,not_removed,excellent thank you i went with seats in section that and were the only areas available that were somewhat central everything else offered and i looked for a solid minutes was off to both sides i am excited and appreciate your insight i think i made a decent selection
gameofthrones,not_removed,im a college soccer coach so this is helpful
gameofthrones,not_removed,i cant wait to go on monday glad you enjoyed it
gameofthrones,not_removed,hope you had a blast im pretty sure i purchased tickets with a view of the screen thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,i went with just a smidge off the middle section thanks for the advice
gameofthrones,not_removed,she sang it that way in denver last night as well surely djwadi would have said something if she messed it up consistently youd think
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was in yeah it could very well be that i enjoy blasting my music haha and im just being super nitpicky but i still had an awesome time and i hope they make this an annual thing
gameofthrones,not_removed,definitely but on top of that the sound system in my section kept cutting in and out instruments kept dropping out midphrase even though you could see the musician still playing including the featured soloists
gameofthrones,not_removed,i didnt really look for photo ops beforehand but i walked about half the perimeter of the arena and only saw one area with a green screen photo op right at the main entrance of the building i did see some cosplayers at various points the most memorable being a missandei who i saw walking from her floor seats after i sat down before the show she looked incredible and i honestly thought she was a performer but i never saw her onstage
gameofthrones,not_removed,any recommendations on where to sit also my gf is not caught up on the series any big spoilers for her thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you
gameofthrones,not_removed,i saw the show in charlotte but i think it was the perfect volume just loud enough to keep the audience from being louder than the music though the crowd was very wellbehaved sort of like at a movie but not so loud and boomy or bassy as a rock show and very well mixed too i could make out what the orchestra was playing even from the far end of the arena
gameofthrones,not_removed,when they sang rains of castamere i legit almost cried what a great show
gameofthrones,not_removed,i read in an interview that ramin wrote some new pieces specifically for the show andor extended others so maybe or so is new and not on the available soundtracks i hope they release a recording audio andor video of this tour or perhaps the new pieces will be on later releases seasons or
gameofthrones,not_removed,we had so many people still coming in at so damn annoying when youre trying to enjoy something
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did not but i found this video of it on youtube enjoy
gameofthrones,not_removed,guess it all depends on your mindset i personally went to the msg show expecting to hear the music i love live that was my only expectation the music was great and everything else was just icing on the cake though i did have a great view but i would have been happy either way to just to hear it live
gameofthrones,not_removed,i agree but its not about just audio i have a nice home theatre system at home i could have just listened at home for free i went for the spectacle promised by the bill most of which were the visuals they designed specifically to accompany the music i paid for the whole experience the sum of all its moving parts and in my eyes i only got to experience half of what was promised
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks didnt know if showing up in a got tshirt n shorts would be out of place or not good to know
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i sat right before intermission still worth it
gameofthrones,not_removed,no i didnt yeah loved having him voice it
gameofthrones,not_removed,and that comment made it worth holding up my iphone during the show thank you
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks appreciate your reply
gameofthrones,not_removed,the bloodiest part is during the red wedding scenes with robb touching talisas bloody stomach
gameofthrones,not_removed,incresible i got tickets for my buddys birthday and i woke up yesterday morning thinking it would just be kinda lackluster i was stupidly surprised i would love to go to another one if they came back that lady doing the vocals was absolutely amazing
gameofthrones,not_removed,i bought them from ticketmaster but perhaps they linked me to a reseller
gameofthrones,not_removed,ah thanks im thinking of getting the section there arent any good priced mid section for sale httpiimgurcomyaahphwpng

gameofthrones,not_removed,i really loved seeing the concert at this point in time actually it felt like a good recap and a celebration of what has come so far like a big party right before the final plunge into the finale i mean it was a party full of darkness and death but ya know game of thrones what can you expect
gameofthrones,not_removed,they have done star wars in concert for close to a decade now the show i saw anthony daniels was the mc it was great i liked the stage set up better than the game of thrones stage because the monitors could be seen by everybody
gameofthrones,not_removed,wish i still lived in va that sounds really cool
gameofthrones,not_removed,l t k lgslgdftiiftiqqp qw qu tow wlyeruqptuppiqyppuquptpqgjggg
gameofthrones,not_removed,god that sounds amazing it was supposed to come to town but they canceled i was disappointed before but now after hearing how amazing it is im even more pissed
gameofthrones,not_removed,im going to the one in phoenix next sunday so i also appreciate this answer since its an orchestral concert will probably get a bit dressed up
gameofthrones,not_removed,same for charlotte last night a little display near the entrance they took it down by the end probably so the crowd didnt build up on exit you couldnt get past the ropes so no pictures sitting on the throne but they let us stand in front of the display and take pictures
gameofthrones,not_removed,i did not notice his absence jaqen hghar confirmed lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,tellinglol
gameofthrones,not_removed,living syrioconfirmed
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh damn
gameofthrones,not_removed,you really should i saw the charlotte show from a slightly compromised corner seat view and immediately looked up atlanta for available tickets when i got home but i couldnt find affordable seats in the middle where the show would be most enjoyable and i have to work tuesday anyway i hope you go you will have a great time its a pure nerdgasm for bookshowmusic fans
gameofthrones,not_removed,i went to the show in houston friday night and she sang the correct lyrics long and sharp not sharp and sharp i dont know whats going on there and i suppose it doesnt really matter the show was amazing overall
gameofthrones,not_removed,oh man i would totally go again what were some of the most memorable parts for you for me id say goodbye brother those strings were so cathartic and the weir wood tree just added to it
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah they spoil stuff in the season finale almost every major eventdeath is shown they even have a little in memoriam slideshow when they perform the bear and the maiden fair
gameofthrones,not_removed,i went to the minneapolis show i had seats in the middle of the middle screen think yd line and it was perfect i could see everything
gameofthrones,not_removed,i was in the same boat the whole thing is a spoiler to be honest
gameofthrones,not_removed,i sat on the level it was great for seeing all the action from above and the screens were right in front of us but there were some orbs that were used for one song that blocked the view of the screen so that kinda sucked dont try to get the sides get the middle though cause the stage is very long and spreadout so middle will give you the best view
gameofthrones,not_removed,jesus after watching serj tankian sing rains of castamere that performance seemed so dull
gameofthrones,not_removed,this i could have sat there with my eyes closed all night and i would have enjoyed it just as much in a slightly different way but ive also been to enough arena shows mostly rock to know that youre not going to get the best seat available if you go through ticketbasterd expect disappointment and appreciate what you get but as to the op leaving halfway through i would have just wandered around to try to find a place to stand unobtrusively to see the show better or asked for a refundexchange of tickets
gameofthrones,not_removed,hearing it in person is different than listening to a recording of it but was the image really distorted that bad i mean at least you could see the screen from a good angle the seats at the ends of the venues cant see the screens at all
gameofthrones,not_removed,i saw tons of people in got tshirts and jeans at the atlanta show last night youll blend right in
gameofthrones,not_removed,agreed that drummer looked badass
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah i suppose but they dont show her actually getting stabbed
gameofthrones,not_removed,yikes yeah sounds like you got screwed this is why i always turn resale off on ticketmaster i think the vip floor seats are that price
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes they do this often ticketbasterd is the scum of the ticketing world and i wish artists would stop using them sorry you had such a bad experience but honestly if id had the money id have gladly paid to be in your seat with that view i had a corner seat a bit lower down past the end stage but i still enjoyed the music and the overall got atmosphere
gameofthrones,not_removed,how did you manage to post this exact comment times lol
gameofthrones,not_removed,woah cant believe i didnt know about that does it still go on id be super disappointed that i missed that for good
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think theyve done sw on a big stage tour have they
gameofthrones,not_removed,the couple next to us dressed up nice i wore jeans but a got shirt and suit jacket and it blended well with the scene really just come as you feelplease and majority of folks jeans and tshirt but the folks who dressed nice you can tell it was appreciated by other folks who came in with their best edit san antonio venue
gameofthrones,not_removed,i loved mhysa the vocals gave me chills also needle was really really cool to watch with that weird instrument thing that ive definitely never seen before
gameofthrones,not_removed,awww man bummer thanks for the heads up maybe i can get her to watch season real quick 😀
gameofthrones,not_removed,thank you appreciate it
gameofthrones,not_removed,i told her shes got days to watch episodes 😆😆
gameofthrones,not_removed,excellent thanks for the tips
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah thats ultimately why i paid more for the seats everything else i saw available for a ticket was in a corner it was my husbands birthday present and he enjoyed it so i suppose it was worth it
gameofthrones,not_removed,ticketmaster didnt do anything wrong here you purchased on what is essentially a secondary market from a seller who is free to set his price wherever he wants just as you are free to accept or reject it lesson learned
gameofthrones,not_removed,they are doing shows during star celebration in april in orlando ive heard they are doing a tour soon httpsyoutubejuutscnfckw
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes the first tour started in the most recent one ended in they have a ton of costumes including vader chewbacca and they also had some of john williams original sheet music
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks for this im pretty sure the other couple im going with are going dressed up and my girls excited about being able to wear high heels
gameofthrones,not_removed,you are truly a queen of love and beauty
gameofthrones,not_removed,but azor ahai killed his beloved wife the last time around seems like a stretch for daenerys to take that role for sam instead of say gilly and what about the bit where azor ahai is supposed to be reborn amidst salt and smoke to wake dragons from stone
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think that completely ruled out the theory being reborn is definitely something that could be in sams story arc waking dragons from stone could be a number of things that havent happened yet correct me if im wrong but the prophecy doesnt say lightbringer is created by shoving a sword into a beloved wife
gameofthrones,not_removed,and what about the bit where azor ahai is supposed to be reborn amidst salt and smoke to wake dragons from stone so do you believe its dany personally i dont have a theory but shes the only one who fits that part of the prophecy
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think that completely ruled out the theory i dont think so either im just exploring your ideas being reborn is definitely something that could be in sams story arc waking dragons from stone could be a number of things that havent happened yet but it could also theoretically happen in any characters future so at this point those particular indicators dont point to sam any more than a lot of other candidates correct me if im wrong but the prophecy doesnt say lightbringer is created by shoving a sword into a beloved wife the known prophecies for the next incarnation of azor ahai dont say anything about how lightbringer will come around at all therefore if youre looking at a lightbringer analog to indicate who might be azor ahai this time youre only drawing comparison to the relationship between azor ahai and lightbringer last time so im just saying that to the extent youre making comparisons to the azor ahai of the past the additional circumstances of the past may also be worth looking at otherwise youre picking and choosing which parts of the past line up with your theory for the future
gameofthrones,not_removed,i thought it was jon based on how his moment of trauma was described in the books but the show didnt really portray some of those details so im not as sure now
gameofthrones,not_removed,at this point its safe to say she is so far she is only one can defeat ww with her dragons and army without her westeros is fucked
gameofthrones,not_removed,ah sorry i took your reply wrongly as a complete debunking of the theory fair point about it could be anyone sam does seem to fit more than others though given his character being more closely involved with jon the others the prophecy than any others i can think of it wouldnt have as much impact if jorah morment tyron or hot pie was azor ahai any better candidates ive missed so how about dany kills gilly with heartbane who had sacrificed herself to save sam and sam kills dany better allignment with past events im no grrm i appreciate
gameofthrones,not_removed,it will be drawn from a fire
gameofthrones,not_removed,well its a good thing shes so hot for westeros then
gameofthrones,not_removed,that makes more sense quite a turn of events if dany ends up facing them like that
gameofthrones,not_removed,freys are loyal to the lannisters tullys are not lannisters lost the castle just as much as the freys did
gameofthrones,not_removed,the lannisters the baretheons want to help the freys because house tully is part of the starknorthern rebellion the black fish is the only northern lord who is left fighting the crown so it stands to reason that the lannistersbaretheons would be used to help the freys secure that part of the kingdoms
gameofthrones,not_removed,i guess because the freys hold a valuable strategic position in the twins and since the boltons and lannisters had a falling out after sansa married ramsey they need to be on good terms with the freys this is just a guess but i think tommen or margery might have struck a deal with the high sparrow to get jaime out kings landing he was honestly their biggest threat and i cant imagine tommen wanting get rid of jaime on his own

gameofthrones,not_removed,the blackfish isnt a northern lord i believe hes from the riverlands
gameofthrones,not_removed,yes you are right i meant that he is the only player left standing from robs rebellion im not even certain he is a lord as edmure tully is still alive
gameofthrones,not_removed,ah i see and yes the lord of riverrun before he was imprisoned is edmure tully brynden blackfish tullys nephew
gameofthrones,not_removed,what youve just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things i have ever read at no point in your rambling incoherent post were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational theory everyone in this subreddit is now dumber for having read it i award you no upvotes and may god have mercy on your soul
gameofthrones,not_removed,rasoiafcirclejerk is that way ↓
gameofthrones,not_removed,its shit posting hour already
gameofthrones,not_removed,hahabilly madison
gameofthrones,not_removed,
gameofthrones,not_removed,tommen killed himself because he was ashamed at what a terrible king he is by allowing his mother to blow up half the noblemen in the city everyone he knew and respected and who was helping him rule the kingdom was in that sept he surmised that his mother was behind it because gregor was still in the red keep barring the door he just gave up his life became pointless even if he remained king hed be cerseis puppet it has nothing to do with sex
gameofthrones,not_removed,after tywin died cersei was the lord or lady of casterly rock i guess now itll be jaimes
gameofthrones,not_removed,more importantly if tommy dies does that make jaime the next in line for the throne since there are no baratheons
gameofthrones,not_removed,in books it was devan in the show it was kevan now its jamie
gameofthrones,not_removed,would it not be an estermont first
gameofthrones,not_removed,since hes never mentioned in the show from what i can remember i doubt hes going to be involved
gameofthrones,not_removed,brienne gwendoline christie meets a friend turned foe lady stoneheart i hope could be jaime though i suppose
gameofthrones,not_removed,if brienne meets with jaime in episode or then thatll be evidence toward lsh in the finale if not then its probably just jaime
gameofthrones,not_removed,a queen comes forth dany flies to westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,arya maisie williams is not alone this is making me curious
gameofthrones,not_removed,why was this deleted does anyone have the text somewhere
gameofthrones,not_removed,or takes ships she wouldnt leave her army
gameofthrones,not_removed,no lyanna mormont
gameofthrones,not_removed,with euron revealing himself being in there that could be it though that would make the iron islanders the fastest ship builders ever of all time
gameofthrones,not_removed,i imagine theon and yara will go to her so that they can work with her before euron can but i might be wrong
gameofthrones,not_removed,australia the land of nope
gameofthrones,not_removed,considering that westeros is meant to be an analogue of britain essos of eurasia and sothoryos of africa with its elephants and jungles what do you think ulthos is supposed to represent i think you have to be careful with this line of reasoning theyre not necessarily meant to be analogues of those places or represent those places grrm uses those landmasses as inspiration for the ones of his own creation and to some extent the cultures as well he mixes it up and combines with a lot of stuff from parts of our world that dont correspond to the landmasses he used at all but its more a matter of i could either randomly draw some lines on a piece of paper and decide that thats what it looks like and then fill in all the blanks with stuff i have to come up with or i could use some other stuff as inspiration and save myself the time and effort of creating a bunch of stuff a lot of which is never going to feature in the story in any major way anyway ulthos is a landmass of unknown size that exists somewhere south of essos and east of sothoryos other than that we know nothing about it ulthos is never mentioned in asoiaf and all we know of it is that its there because its included in some of the maps that were published later we know that its covered in dense jungle and may be huge or tiny grrm said that basically the entire point of ulthos is to highlight that people from westeros do not know much about the world east of qarth and south of the summer sea its deliberately unknown and its status is deliberately ambiguous to highlight the limited knowledge of even the maesters of the citadel about the wider world well likely never get to see it or learn whats going on there
gameofthrones,not_removed,no sandor varys and cersei know
gameofthrones,not_removed,she doesnt know but i believe she or jon will find out and it will play a part in somebodys demise its not unlikely that varys or clegane will tell the starks
gameofthrones,not_removed,no but she knows that he killed her aunt she just need to say it to the right person and poof no more littlecreeper
gameofthrones,not_removed,bran stark knows from his visions that littlefinger betrayed ned stark
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think there is one way this might work in the starks favor sandor at the end of going north to fight ww with jon and arya going home as well as potentially bran going to wf there will be a fair amount of people to piece together information of lf betraying the starks sandor motivated to help his stark girls he has some weird alliance with both we also know that lf still has the dagger the vs dagger used against bran and the one he held to neds throat that places evidence against him on two betrayals and it isnt like lf to give up something so valuable if the starks and sandor can put those things together they will likely have lf holding the smoking gun so to speak
gameofthrones,not_removed,sorry my memory is foggy but in what way did littlefinger betray ned
gameofthrones,not_removed,none of the starks know otherwise hed be dead by now
gameofthrones,not_removed,no she doesnt know only varys and probably cersei know the other person that knew was slynt but he is dead sandor does not know he was only present in the throne room and knows nothing of the conspiracy
gameofthrones,not_removed,i feel like if sandor knew he might have said something to arya he had no ties to anyone so i cant imagine he would hold that type of information back i think that if sandor knew he would have had to heard it from joffrey i am not certain that joffrey was included in the betrayal though
gameofthrones,not_removed,since you might know another question why doesnt tommen just dissolve the sparrows hes the one that reinstated them to begin with thanks again
gameofthrones,not_removed,thanks
gameofthrones,not_removed,why exactly wouldnt varys tell them any reason i can think of is the starks killing smallhands and making an enemy in the vale and robin arryn should the north rally with dany and from my understanding theyre only with lf because of sansa and th could possibly think that its just irrelevant that would explain why he never mentioned it to arya new user dont know if i should spoilermark my post
gameofthrones,not_removed,yeah it might be sandors redemption
gameofthrones,not_removed,he told ned that the gold cloaks had his back but when ned went to challenge joffreys legittimacy the gold cloaks killed the stark household guard and littlefinger himself put a knife to neds throat only ned and littlefinger really know of the extent of his treachery everybody else would expect the gold guards to back the rightful king and only those present would see baelish point a knife at neds throat who would assume he is merely acting loyally to the king
gameofthrones,not_removed,promised him support of the goldcloaks ended up betraying him in the throne room
gameofthrones,not_removed,he didnt betray ned i think he just dont know that golden cloak is on lannister side
gameofthrones,not_removed,what are you talking about sandor was there sandor varys littlefinger ser barristan cersei joffrey and janos were all in the room when the betrayal took place sandor didnt tell arya because it had little importance then also littlefingers whereabouts werent known to them since the brotherhood is traveling north theyll likely stop by winterfell where they may or may not find littlefinger depending on how the timeline works seeing as sandor clearly feels for the horror that house stark has gone through hed probably spill the beans to sansa on what littlefinger did
gameofthrones,not_removed,they had his wife and his brotherinlaw hostage he didnt want to do anything against the sparrows that would risk their lives
gameofthrones,not_removed,they wouldnt listen theyre an army with an entirely separate command structure goals and ideology
gameofthrones,not_removed,you read his comment wrong
gameofthrones,not_removed,this even though the hound saw it happen he didnt know ned and lf had a deal he wouldnt give it a second thought wouldnt consider it a betrayal varys probably did know about the deal though
gameofthrones,not_removed,how did catlyn hear about it i specifically remember her saying he trusted you to baelish
gameofthrones,not_removed,he definitely betrayed him he even said something along the lines of i told you not to trust me
gameofthrones,not_removed,lots of people were there that doesnt mean that everyone in the room knew the behind the scenes betrayal as far as everyone in the room could see into the situation ned came in with his men and tried to take the crown the gold cloaks protected the king sandor knew that lf put the knife to neds throat he probably knew about the plan but i dont think it is ever stated if he knew the whole story i cant believe he spent so much time with arya and never once mentioned that her dad got screwed by lf giving him a false promise
gameofthrones,not_removed,hmm yeah i just got the feeling if he nipped it in bud before they got so much power all the problems could have been avoided
gameofthrones,not_removed,omg i didnt see not before unlikely disregard my post please but i think if arya went to kl to kill cersei and the mountain shed have cersei in a corner and start monologuing about cersei and joffrey killing ned and the spiteful woman cersei is would tell arya why not just kill everyone who was there ser illyn the dog littlefinger thus adding a new name to her briefly cleared list
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think cat knew about the specific betrayal when she had left kings landing lf said he would help ned next time she sees lf ned is dead and lf is fine
gameofthrones,not_removed,well he was the most dangerous man in westeros
gameofthrones,not_removed,he didnt realize that things were starting to get out of hand until after loras was arrested
gameofthrones,not_removed,he had also drank the cool aid he thought the sparrow in some ways had a point
gameofthrones,not_removed,mmm yeah more like you didnt help versus you betrayed him
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont think dany will take the north before the walkers do i think youll see an alliance between stark and targaryen before a war bran is on his way home and im sure he has some news for jon
gameofthrones,not_removed,okay thats assuming that jon is azor ahai very likely is but its grrm lightbringer is literally a sword jon falls in love with dany and completely ruins all development he had with ygritte and for some reason kills dany to literally fulfil the prophecy anyway maybe jon will perform some azor ahai magic and the khalasar randomly decides to worship him for some reason i mean theyve already done that for dany you know after she broke so many of their rules and traditions spilled so much blood in their sacred city and killed all of their khals
gameofthrones,not_removed,maybe the nights king will kill dany and the khalassar will suddenly have to avenge danys death by joining with jon pure speculation here though edit i would also really dislike if this was what happens seems to cheapen danys character
gameofthrones,not_removed,dany is the azor ahai khal drogo was nissa nissa and her dragons namely drogon are lightbringer the red comet was a symbol of her rebirth as the prince that was promised which is interchangeable as the return of the azor ahai
gameofthrones,not_removed,i hope they stay really far away from each others storylines cause literally figuratively every major character has joined daenerys side cant jon just be the badass he was at botb i mean flay that stark scum or atleast what was left of him after he died horrifically in the botb spear wall
gameofthrones,not_removed,i dont see them killing of dany or jon tbh
gameofthrones,not_removed,if the dothraki commit mass suicide before the ww are defeated i hope a few stay alive long enough to start burning bodies
gameofthrones,not_removed,there will be an alliance and they only follow the strong a lot could happen but honor and dothraki dont really go one and the same
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think danny will arrive once the battle against the ww is well underway she will have to decide whether or not to use the distraction of the ww to seize power or to do the noble thing and ally with the starks against them it will be a very difficult choice for her and im pretty sure that she will chose to help jon and it will get her killed but it will at least be in a moment of bad assery such as taking on the night king and taking him out with her or something along those lines the ww will be defeated but at substantial cost maybe even jons life and eventually we will be left with westeros in ruins and having to rebuild winter ends early and its spring sansa is in westeros beginning to fix things jorah is wandering the world searching for a cure idk who the fuck is in kings landing maybe little finger and gendry is still rowing away haha
gameofthrones,not_removed,at this point the dothraki and iron born would follow anyone to get a little screentime
gameofthrones,not_removed,technically she burned the khals pretty much the same loophole that drogo uses to kill viserys
gameofthrones,not_removed,well she technically didnt spill any blood because burning
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon falls in love with dany and completely ruins all development he had with ygritte can you explain this i dont get what development you are talking about that would be ruined by this
gameofthrones,not_removed,i think dany marrying jon would be an obvious move after the last season she intends to marry someone of influence in westeros jon would be the strongest candidate if she wants a powerful alliance so i have this crazy feeling shell marry jaime
gameofthrones,not_removed,youre pretty sure about this arent you oh well
gameofthrones,not_removed,their former relationship will seem less important if jon stops valuing his love for her and marries someone else especially so soon he rejected melisandre because he says he still loves ygritte which is a powerful scene for him and their relationship it gives the hours of screentime they had together in seasons and more purpose than just a way for jon to bond with the free folk i suppose that coming back from the death might affect this but i hope not
gameofthrones,not_removed,theres no chance shell marry jaime brienne maybe but dany no way
gameofthrones,not_removed,i just think it makes way more sense than jon being the azor ahai the chances of him marryingfalling in love with dany in the last two seasons seems unlikely and in the books sam and maester aemon believe her to be the prince that was promised
gameofthrones,not_removed,jon is the prince that was promised no doubt but daenerys is azor ahai they never said azor ahai reborn and ptwp were the same person
gameofthrones,not_removed,ok i understand what you are saying but at one point he will have to get over it he is a king now and ygritte even thought i dont like the character very much would be the kind of person that do not want him to mope around greaving her for years and didnt the scene between melisandre and jon happened very shortly after ygrittes death like a couple of weeks if so that understandable that he would still love her very much and in my opinion if dany jon happens it would be for the sake of an allianceuniting the north and the south and if you are not robert and cercei at one point youll start to love your wife and she you
