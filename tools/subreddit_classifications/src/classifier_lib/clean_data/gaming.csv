gaming,removed,i loved the first game so much but i wasnt a huge fan of this one still a fun game nonetheless i really want a remake and ea kind of has the rights to it since they purchased pandemic studios i think the frostbite engine would be perfect for a remakereboot etc

gaming,removed,pretty sure my is the coolest card ive ever owned but yeah rhailcorporate hail nvidia
gaming,removed,star wars doesnt belong in the future section
gaming,removed,op is a repost bot great
gaming,removed,they make pretty unique grand strategy games with a fairly limited market they regularly release expansions always alongside free content patches there are also cosmetic dlc that you can get to support their artists and make the games looksound cooler of course the expansions add up so id recommend waiting for a sale to catch up or you can play multiplayer you get to use all the expansions the host has then honestly their expansion model is fairer than it seems at first
gaming,removed,my reaction on opening this thread wow a skybox
gaming,removed,to be even more exact than that if im not mistaken it is metro redux
gaming,removed,great news i have a xbox live code totally free got mine from httpfreexboxliveforevercom
gaming,removed,does he have downs
gaming,removed,dude totally deserved it
gaming,removed,some of my all time favorite games are from the era mercenaries psychonauts destroy all humans resident evil gtavcsa etc call it nostalgia glasses but i feel developers rarely make games especially sandbox games with charm that brings you back to playing the game years later like i do with some of these titles
gaming,removed,its the stupidest product on earth why the fuck would you buy old crap and why the fuck would you ever stand in line for fucking hours you have one dumb whore of a wife
gaming,removed,your wife could have bought a shitty laptop and spent an hour downloading emulators for nes snes genesis mame gamecube xbox and plugged it right into your tv with a shitty hdmi cable allowing you to have online play with every system and use a modern controller

gaming,removed,you had to delete a file to remove the bikini top on the female character i think the eu version didnt have the bikini top
gaming,removed,oh sure thats what you were impressed at
gaming,removed,why is requiring the game title not a community rule
gaming,removed,the fact that including the title of the game isnt the first rule of this sub still baffles me
gaming,removed,i wish they would make this a rule already so half the comments in every thread arent talking about how the name wasnt in the title
gaming,removed,to be fair the mods could just tag the title or flair it or whatever
gaming,removed,couldnt it be automatic put the game in brackets at the beginning of the title
gaming,removed,its been answered plenty you fucking piece of shit
gaming,removed,same because i keep up with videogame news and can draw reasonable assumptions from what i know of the series and whatnot but someone wandering along from rall or who doesnt keep up with videogames as much isnt necessarily gonna be able to identify things as well its also just because people want this to become sort of a general rule so that its expected so that when lesserknown games are posted people can know what they are
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,too much work far too lazy
gaming,removed,can mods not tag posts would be just as good and yet much less work yes
gaming,removed,fuck off he started his channel an hour ago and you thought right lets jump on reddit and get some sympathy likessubs since hes in a wheelchair well eat a dick mate his channel is shit his content is shit your face is shit
gaming,removed,to be honest ive known about it longer than id seen any ign stuff on it i think there was a definite grapevine thing i think the big selling point is the technology utilised in the way its being utilised is pretty groundbreaking and the fact you can name your discoveries which gives players some feeling of ownership of their participation then the fact theres no loading transition between planet and space its seemless that is a shear feat of engineering in itself in my opinion
gaming,removed,scam friend of mine purchased and never got product we both got deleted from their fb page for saying it was a scam do not

gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,source
gaming,removed,ok so cdprs game had some bugs now if those bugs are hidden by a wellwritten story an expansive map and very good game world then those bugs appear minuscule because the game itself is very polished in all other areas assashit unity didnt have an amazing story had very little improvement on graphics a slideshow level framerate and very little to offer that which improved upon the previous games at least witcher did not have black voids of doom and darkness where windows should be didnt run like garbage either look yes you managed to show one area where witcher is exactly the same state of bugginess as assashit unity and i commend you for that but in the overall scheme of things witcher was far better than assashit unity had cool mechanics a game within a game an amazing storyline and game world to explore not only did ubishat and their game assshit unity did not look better it ran like shit on top of that and whole game just felt like an alpha released for people to play fucking shit and i feel bad for all who paid money expecting a complete product and got scammed by ubishit

gaming,removed,interestingly after being a long supporter of the game advising people up until recently that the game was still worth buying if on sale i had to finally declare that the game was effectively dead the interesting thing is that my post got removed almost immediately from the subreddit which ironically might be further indication that the game is dead if the subreddit is now just a home for apologists evolve already has its own forums where trs censors such critical posts the subreddit had been a place for open discourse and critique

gaming,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
gaming,removed,is a game that boggles the mind why no one has attempted to modernize a remake that doesnt have all the bugs and development problems that had would be pretty sweet its a decent reenvisioning but could have been so much more i still play a lot of aoe and with friends and its about time that franchise was im pretty excited that one of my all time favorite games

gaming,removed,moira well look around at the world we live in it may be okay to you but ive read about what it used to be like and this isnt it so we all need something that keeps us going despite all the terrible things around us for me its things like this book did you ever try to put a broken piece of glass back together even if the pieces fit you cant make it whole again the way it was but if youre clever you can still use the pieces to make other useful things maybe even something wonderful like a mosaic well the world broke just like glass and everyones trying to put it back together like it was but itll never come together the same way the wasteland survival guide isnt much towards that lofty goal but its an important one and thats why i need your help i dont think i can do it alone

gaming,removed,if you buy it im going to give you some tipps every team generally needs at least tank and a healer if there arent any tanks in the team you play the tank first come first served same goes for healers hero switching is essential when you see that your team has troubles keeping up switch hero to more healdmgtankyness every hero is good in his own way there arent really overpowered heroes except f widowmaker she can suck my d dont let the enemy team flank you heroes like genji dva mccree or tracer will ruin your day if you let them flank your team other players are dumb but will change their tactics if you ask them politely respect your healers and make sure you keep em safe in payload mode attacking team needs a reinhardt period if you want to play bastion change positions once in a while because people have it easy taking you out if they know where you are also dont underestimate his regular smg when playing symmetra on defense switch to another hero if youre defending your last capture point her ultimate is a teleporter like in which is mostly useless when the spawn point is right infront of the last capture point avoid an enemy mei like the plague once you keep that stuff in mind youll have alot of fun please someone correct me if im wrong

gaming,removed,i just quit legion end game is a joke the devs made it clear to the gamers who were paying attention the fact that the devs made all of the end game simply aoeing the point of entire dungeons is a message within itself the devs are essentially letting gamers know subliminally that the people who run wow are in it only for greed and dont give a shit about gamers or their following the devs made it clear to abandone ship with wow and for us loyal followers to no longer support blizzard with wow anymore they made it clear to let us true wow fans to move on with blizzards current shenanigans if you cannot see the message they devs are sending then you do not deserve to be called a wow fan so i say this do not get into wow its a ruined game i literally just quit a few days ago after some long talks with my guild lvl maxxed at that sad indeed i would suggest taking a break until any news about legacy servers if blizz does not even mention legacy servers then you can consider wow dead my servers already all quitting wow and is starting to be a ghost town again i just uninstalled the game as an alternative i just do not know i tried everything and the current fate for mmos not looking good ffxiv is just like wow in many aspects but is also turning sour as zero pvp tho pretty much pve is ok tho its the last place though for salvation kronos private wow server is also a sigh of relief but i can guarantee you it wont last long sadly us mmo players are a dying race in that sense pc gaming is dead to me as the whole point of pc gaming in my mind are mmos may as well just throw out my pc rig for a with vr and destiny as thats where all the kids play on now a days true pc gaming ded maybe there is hope with star citizen i doubt it derp

gaming,removed,httpswwwwesnothorg is a foss game that can be played with just the mouse think advance wars on a hex grid and a fantasy setting included campaigns and if you do some searching im sure there are more fan made ones out there

gaming,removed,f kingspray trick sell outs and their oculus pimps viva la vivespray will never ever give one dime to devs that play bullshit like they did them giant cop and all the others that took the exclusive cash deals can eat poo 💩 plus vivespray is out now and its awesome
gaming,removed,they didnt sell anything the game out now is vivespray its made by a great dev kingspray used htc free equipment made the game then the day before launch changed the date of release to coming soon and then hasnt said shit since they sold out and saw what happened to giant cop so they just are trying to avoid the same we all remember though and wont buy it when it does come out vivespray is out now just updated with a new environment
gaming,removed,you should check out vivespray its actually out now and its not made by shady devs that take exclusive deals that hurt the emerging vr industry
gaming,removed,because nothing else could delay a game release yeah delaying is a game is always a good decision so whats your theory on why they completely cold turkeyd their facebook besides one cover photo update and steam page literally two days from release they were very communicative and active until then which as you said was right around the same time it was found out that oculus can and will buy out games for exclusive releases i mean you must be really confusedabout why no mans sky has all the bad press it does theres also which only adds to the odd behaviour completely disregarding this all is just pure nonsense

gaming,removed,one of the worst yet and it seems to be getting worse by the year was awful didnt think it was going to get worse this year we have seen so many half games with the other half sitting within a season pass many let downs the biggest being no mans sky and in my opinion battlefield is battlefront all over again better invest in the season pass if you want content
gaming,removed,i absolutely love this
gaming,removed,those guns remind me of the plasma pistols from halo
gaming,removed,just like with anything else the medium has to cater to the lowest common denominator and with more and more straight up dumbasses becoming gamers you get shit like this luring the devs and the money come on bro lets try to get past the juvenile if you dont like it dont buy it

gaming,removed,i would take a look at the newest ratchet and clank game its a pretty fun game that is a reimagining of the first game in its series

gaming,removed,battlefield is boring after playing for any length of time ive loved all bf games since they came out and bf is a good game but for some reason it just didnt hold me as the others did and special forces i played for years after many patches became amazing battlefield i just cannot pick up and invest more than minutes into it and even then i have to force myself to do so theres just something about it that i cant get into

gaming,removed,men have been led to believe that once you enter an long term relationship or marriage you gain access to an unlimited supply of sex with your partner for the rest of your life here at the red pill we know this to be false in most cases a womans sex drive drastically decreases once she secures a monogamous relationship now that she has your commitment she doesnt need to work for it anymore the mystery and competition anxiety are gone now that she has cut off your other options she has a monopoly on vagina and can change the price frequency to whatever she wants while some men can maintain the frequency of sex with a woman once he enters a monogamous relationship with her usually through a difference in perceived smv and dread game this is far from the usual take a look at rdeadbedrooms if you want to see for yourself by creating the false notion that monogamy is a constant supply of sex women have effectively led men to pursue monogamy as an end goal satisfying female sexual strategy monogamy is the end goal for women not men men should spin plates and let monogamy come as a byproduct if he chooses once he has explored the full extent of his options

gaming,removed,splitting the archives is a scene rule being that most game releases and cracks come from the scene when you download their releases itll most likely still be archived however some torrent sites have uploaders who extract the iso before building the torrent file to make it easier for their userbase
gaming,removed,

gaming,removed,im right there with you as far as the anger at not winning smite league enter multiplayer games here etc all easily can get just about anyones blood boiling because of two simple things no one likes losing and there are things we cant control afkers trollers tryhards as much as i hate that term rubberbandinglag and many other things we cant control and things that we can ie skill adequate rigs good internet are still put up against people who are better and have better the best advice i can give is similar to what ninja said in that you should divert your focus from just winning to more of enjoying the only people who should just focus on winning are those whos job it is to win in mmos if pvp is getting on your nerves do come crafting or grinding in fpss if the other team is u do some personal challenges like pistol or melee only or gun roulette where you kill someone then you their gun and repeat to divert your attention from the scoreboard in mobas the hardest and most toxic to deal with typically with the other team world champions of the ganktanknspank try and fall back and farm and stack take camps and plox dont feed utilize yourself when you have the push with your team and above all of this is to game with friends the burden to bear becomes easier with two or three or more you can joke converse and just generally keep up morale skill weaponry defense and everything else falls to the wayside if you morale isnt there to fuel it so play games for the reasons they were made and rememberhaaaaave fun with it

gaming,removed,well theres a difference between dead rising and where the uncensored version was straight up forbidden confiscated and dead rising where there was no censored version created and it was not even handed in for testing so it couldnt be put on the forbidden list at all dead rising is not on the list because it wasnt even tested by the institute responsible thus it is by default something you cant buy in germany but importing it is possible better than having it banned huh importing them also means that you have to be to buy them even if the game is a mild t teen game by our standards httpsdewikipediaorgwikikategorieindiziertescomputerspiel theres another list of games that are just on an index the index is a list of games that are considered bad for the youth this means that these games may not be advertised or openly displayed you can ask for those games to have them be sold to you and buying them is always from age since we have a constitutional rule that things may not be censored before they appear indexing only occurs after release anyway let me roll that up for any game handed to the institute there are these possible statuses from age white label from age yellow label from age green label from age blue label from age red label can be advertised and publicly shown from age red label plus index not to be advertised or publicly shown banned confiscated not to be sold or owned can be confiscated taken away even if you already have it might or might not have had an age restriction before being banned any game not handed into the institute always from age might get banned too

gaming,removed,birds are extremely important animals birds are a diverse group and their bright colors distinct songs and calls and showy displays add enjoyment to our lives birds are very visible quite common and offer easy opportunities to observe their diverse plumage and behaviors because of this birds are popular to many who pursue wildlife watching and monitoring activities iowa naturemappings own database reflects this fact in that the majority of wildlife observations reported by volunteers are birds in fact bird watching is the fastest growing recreational pursuit in the united states according to the national survey of fishing hunting and wildlifeassociated recreation we as a nation spend over billion dollars on commercial bird food adding all wildlife watching equipment together including bird food binoculars spotting scopes film carrying cases etc the nation spends nearly billion dollars in iowa alone we spend some million dollars on bird food birds are not only important economically in iowa and the nation but also server a vital ecological role as well birds are critical links within the vast food chains and webs that exist in the ecosystem and those are but a few reasons

gaming,removed,i can tell you how we did it on a leading multiplayer game from one of the largest independant videogame developers it is and not as complex as most would believe ie amount of kills points scored times you jumped etc does not affect your mmr its just win and lose mmr is kept on the backend say all players startbase at winslosses would affect that number positivelynegatively when people are queuing for games it takes the median between the highest rated queued player and the lowest so between and matchmaking starts looking for players in the range then after so many seconds opens up to then etc etc etc theres a bit more to it but not much now beer is calling source am qa
gaming,removed,he says that the wild hunt took yen then letho and geralt searched them out and geralt took yens place letho took yen to niflgaard and thats how she ended up with emreis thats all he says but to add to that ciri freed geralt from the wild hunt and left him near kaer morhen and thats where the first game started

gaming,removed,do you seriously think that an obvious logical fallacy would help your case at all first off ad hominems are only a logical fallacy in formal logic in informal logic ad hominem arguments are perfectly valid this is because in formal logic you assume that your assumptions are true however in informal logic you cannot do that and must weight the value of your information based on the sources unreliable sources are not good sources of information as they are well unreliable no one who understands logic which of course obviously excludes you would suggests that ad hominems are a logical fallacy in general because they arent sadly people who have no understanding of logic claim theyre invalid mostly because theyre too stupid to recognize that their sources are shit secondly it wasnt an adhominem argument to begin with which is obvious contextually wishingimplying that a murderer should have had a different nationality or skin color falls squarely into the definition of racism no it doesnt sorry i understand that you as a racist desperately want racism to be normal you dont like that youre a freak but the reality is that wanting something not to have been done by a member of a hated outgroup is not illogical it fans the fires of hatred amongst racists like yourself because you assume that those people are representative of everyone we can see this of course in your tendency to claim that everything done by one person is done by everyone even related to them this is classical httpsenwikipediaorgwikipsychologicalprojection apologize for that ridiculous neonazi insult you support a man who keeps a book of hitlers speeches next to his bed for president im sorry but it isnt a ridiculous insult you are a neonazi

gaming,removed,i dont necessarily disagree with that for me it feels like sequel overloador remake as if they want to capitalize on what worked prior rather than take chances and do something ground breaking even some games that followed that recipe failed to deliver up to expectationsdai at least though there was some luster in the lackluster previous years just seems to have lack
gaming,removed,the game was in the last steam sale few weeks ago
gaming,removed,this current gen has yet to hold a candle to the previous one in terms of game quantityvariety for example hasnt tekken recently been announced for release sometime in the future last gen being this many years in the gen there was already tekken doa soul calibur and others granted the fighting genre is not as popular but to me it shows a slowing of game releases in general im not sure why are devs expecting vr to be big and cash in on that only thing i know is i feel most excited about moving from my to a switch than rather a due to the different and refreshing games the potential for innovation seems to be greater on that platform although titanfall is great fun most of the current gen stinks of franchise sequels sports game dull realistic driving sims granted dragon quest and xenoblade are sequals the franchises are new to most and seem to be able to feel new exciting to those familiar see final fantasy

gaming,removed,it holds a strong comparison to the mechanics of early minecraft versions where you dont have any real goal and are free to explore the worlds around you so literally exactly what no mans sky is except this is way better because its not no mans sky because i am a bandwagonriding queef
gaming,removed,that must be an achievement
gaming,removed,you dont need to cook it or anything but after several pokes in quick succession it starts to require a second or two cooldown also its generally extremely difficult to catch one enemy off guard to get em with the needle much less a whole squad of oblivious snipers
gaming,removed,every once in a while i watch the remake its just so well done
gaming,removed,this is only one of my many coasters
gaming,removed,i just google searched it i mean most of the time im too busy playing the game when i think about it and i have better things to do than read up on battlefield syringe tactics but i was bored enough to be here so i just looked it up i actually copied the link to share it here too but nah im an asshole

gaming,removed,no because apparently its intended which means its game that has the worst part of training a wild animal with none of the payoff for doing so theres a point where youd be better off just doing the actual real thing and this game manages to hit that games alright but youd better off with a dog if you want to deal with an untrained animal its far more rewarding and a better long term investment of money
gaming,removed,spotted the pc master race
gaming,removed,same here teared up a bit in fact i played the game almost completely unspoiled no clue what i was doing i killed toriel because for some reason i thought it was a duel lol eventually i figured out what the game was trying to say and resolved to stop killing monstersand felt really bad about the ones i had killed i feel i had a better experience because of that than if i had gone in with the im going to be a pacifist expectation
gaming,removed,i mean steam started as mandatory drm for valve games like origin or uplay are now until they realized the could sell other peoples games too it was an antipiracy measure that eventually became a convenient gaming platform convenience was not in gabens mind at the time of conception

gaming,removed,thats a really cool story bro
gaming,removed,i wouldnt be so confident to say nintendo will dominate portable gaming phones and tablets are pushing into that territory very fast and if nintendo isnt careful they could lose to them yeah but people have been saying that for a while and that has been true to some extent but nintendo sold million in japan a country obsessed with phone games far more than the us thats in people its important to note that a portable console game is different to a phone game in the latter case the game is on phones usually not any particular companys phone as yet the video game makers are not tied to the phone manufacturers nintendo as the only portable console occupies a unique space yes that space is smaller than it was years ago but its still there and i would argue nintendo isnt competing directly with phone games and the two industries dont even seem to share demographics i remember reading somewhere that when this issue was raised a phone game developer said that their competitors werent traditional video game companies it was tv soaps their main demographic is middle aged women playing candy crush not teenagers or young men
gaming,removed,thats cool and all but i literally put that it might be true but based on two thirds of her things being false we have no reason to believe this one is also no i havent ever had a tablet im used to the

gaming,removed,ok so after reading your comments i did conclude youre retarded
gaming,removed,the question isnt what im talking about its what youre not understanding which is apparently nothing because you then repeated exactly what i was stating you could still be unrecognizable on a show like wonder showzen but it wouldnt recreate the magic of the world when cameras on the street were treated like a zoo animal got loose eric andre is a good example because whether you like the humor or not he gets actual reactions by going so far beyond what is considered acceptable to film publicly iphones ruined us
gaming,removed,you deserve a medal
gaming,removed,but it has the face of tiber septim on it
gaming,removed,the thing is the way gold is created in stars will ensure it is always a rare element relative to other elements in order to create gold a star has to supernova the amount of stars that are capable of going supernova are exceedingly rare only happening to white dwarfs which then accrue additional matter sufficient to trigger runaway nuclear fusion which leads to a supernova explosion or a massive star collapses in on itself which leads to the same runaway fusion process in addition to that gold is only created at the very end of a stars life span shortly before it goes supernova because gold is only ever created in small amounts during the final stages of nuclear fusion in a star gold will always remain a rare element and furthermore because of the rare properties of gold added on top of its scarcity there is very little evidence that gold will ever lose its value
gaming,removed,i think were beating a dead horse at this point everyone knows the difference between zelda and link this is satire
gaming,removed,also add mass to the coins so you can roughly guess how much the coins are worth but if theyre adulterated coins just plating or has an iron core etc you can be arrested for using fake coins
gaming,removed,nintendo lives in a pocket dimension with no one but their fans so no matter what they do or release it will be bombarded with praise
gaming,removed,of course but the op was speaking of the far flung future of ad i dont see the point of applying a mental framework of our current needs to those of the future we simply have no way of knowing what extent gold will be used in the future my main argument was meant to illustrate that gold will remain useful in the future because of the combined factors of scarcity and unique properties it holds the ops argument speculated that gold might lose its value and i attempted to point out why that is unlikely im not sure why you extrapolated a supporting argument and took this discussion to the cosmic scale

gaming,removed,i have insecurity issues and body dysmorphia so i own a foam padded muscle suit that i occasionally wear when pokemon go first came out i thought it would be a great opportunity to get out of my shell a bit and meet other likeminded individuals so i modified the foam suit to look like machoke and started hanging out at pokemon hot spots the idea is that id attack them as machoke and theyd battle me like any other pokemon i usually carry a knife on me for protection because of my work hours im really only able to do this after pm in my neighborhood but so far people have just been really aloof about the whole thing

gaming,removed,here is the link to the greenlight
gaming,removed,um those are two million refugees born outside of israel saying theyre not allowed to return is like saying african americans are not allowed to return to africa no the majority dont return is mainly due to their own choices palestinians cant return because of their refusal to make a mutual agreement of peace between themselves and the jews furthermore of those million people most of them dont have any actual homes or land to return to outside of the claim their grandparents lived their during the british and ottoman days which are frankly null and void its the equivalent to saying african americans cant return to africa im black but despite africa being the home of my ancestors i have minimum connection to the place and to actually return i would more than likely create another situation like liberia where i displace the current land owners and create another situation of hurt feelings creating a cycle of violence the current situation is a result of this the jews tried to return to their ancestral homeland albeit they actually did pay for the land at exorbitant prices mind you this was crap land also built up the infrastructure they needed to thrive and the arabs many of whom were also recent immigrants following the jews economic revival of what had been a backwater since the original crusades tried to throw them out the jews survived this and the result of this war with back and forth guerrila warfare including yes what we know officially would consider terrorism on both sides including a arab started attempt at ethnic cleansing in led to the expulsion hundreds of thousands of arabs it also led to the expulsion cleansing and removal of million jews across the arab world people who lived in the region long before the century arab conquest httpwwwjewishvirtuallibraryorgjsourcetalkingjewrefugeeshtml httpsenwikipediaorgwikijewishexodusfromarabandmuslimcountries also israel gets billion a year for purchasing us military arms in other words its a subsidy for the us defense industry that goes right back into our pockets and keeps our people employed and a bloody senator reelection secured
gaming,removed,wow read your own wiki article it states exactly what the previous poster mentioned czech and the french supplied israel with advanced military arms including helping later develop israels never gonna be acknowledged officially nuclear arsenal the us did provide basic economic aid in the form of food stuffs the kind of thing they provide to nearly the entire world as a form of humanitarianism the only military aid was not actual military aid but selling israel military weapons mainly defensive and the us official stance was to remain neutral on the matter entirely up until the soviet union began to actively support egypt and syria in the invasion read your own facts

gaming,removed,this there is nothing fancy going on in this game in terms of new gameplay etc it is uncharted at its core and it is not trying to become more than that instead they are celebrating what they already are what makes this game glorious in my view is the how they have refined and is many cases totally nailed these aspects and as a result have completely blown me away it is imo by far the best version of uncharted out there
gaming,removed,loves video games loves playing video games keeps up on the industry knows how to suppress bias yeah dude youd be a horrible video game journalist thats why no one would hire you did you learn nothing from gamergate the best video game journalists give reviews for money are completely biased have to be full of themselves to a point where they know nothing about the industry and hate video games with a passion duh
gaming,removed,this is why i play on pc steam support may be actual trash but theyve never held my account hostage without even allowing me to prove that the charges im being expected to pay are fraudulent really gtfo with your fanboy shit honestly steam support is times worse they dont hold your account hostage because the customer support is nonexistent with psn you can get in contact in under a day with steam you are waiting literally months
gaming,removed,the charges on the account arent for ps renewals you spastic retard stop spamming this with uneducated nonsense you admitted yourself you didnt read the op

gaming,removed,i think for games at the beginning of the polygon era that might be true low poly highly aliased games dont hold up well mario bros though that holds up really well well enough that nintendo just released a game using those exact graphics there are little kids today still getting a ton of fun out of mario i cant see kids not getting that kind of gameplay anytime soon

gaming,removed,people who truly believe in the whole pc master race thing are times outta total dickweeds obviously pc is better than console but shittalking currentgen consoles and calling them those other potatoes is just straight up ignorant theres nothing wrong with preferring pc but if youre belittling someone for playing console youre most likely a total cunt

gaming,removed,yea since everyone has infinite money plus stop saying they arent anything alike when they clearly are one has ingame leveling and a shitty single player component those are the main differences both are first person herobased teambased objective based same art style neither are deathmatch shooters released within weeks of each other that is plenty enough to compare them stop it battlefield is no less different to cod as battlebored is to ow and i saw no bitching about them being compared the past years just because total biscuit said it doesnt make it true the much simpler answer is bb is just not very good and if half of the people defending it on the internet actually bought it it wouldnt be dying so fast cant wait for this game to officially die just to see people shut up with this argument that they are nothing alike we are comparing games that if you made a venn diagram would overlap in many spots many more than it doesnt so stop acting like were comparing the last of us to

gaming,removed,actually pps saying the opposite you need to look at both sentences which he punctuated poorly ill attempt to clarify his meaning buying into hype is not fault for lying—its fault for believing them and for buying the product before doing the research hes saying its not the victims fault for advertising themselves as sexy if the assaulter still commits assault youre the one suggesting that the game looked sexy and its thusly their fault when suddenly they backed down on all of their promised material im of mixed opinion on this if a car company tells me their car is going to come with cupholders standard and i go to the car lot and find one but it has no cupholders because its some reduced version is that the car companys fault the advertisers fault either way its my fault if i buy the car however preordering makes things a little more murky because if i preorder the car expecting cupholders but all the developers said was a place to hold your drink is it my fault for expecting cupholders this is why you do not preorder games if there is legal action to be taken against hg for false advertisement then ive yet to hear about it meaning no one at this moment thinks they can put up a class action lawsuit this could be for a number of reasons including legalese loopholes or whatever but the bottom line remains the sameuntil we get stricter laws about what games can and cannot say in their advertisements interviews or whatever theyre not to be trusted do not buy into hype not to borrow from antipiracy folks but you wouldnt preorder a carso dont preorder video games

gaming,removed,yes skidrow is one of the reputable ones
gaming,removed,depends if that group is the actual poster there are many groups that will take a release say skidrow or codex repackage them and add their own little trojan or bit miner if your dealing with a torrent then always read the reviews or comments popular torrents will have plenty of people who scanned the files and reported what they found trying to be informative without busting the rules so thats about all i will say

gaming,removed,for difficulty wise i dont think youll have a problem at all throughout the main story i think the difficulty is well paced i remember getting through the game with relative ease without additional grinding needed just by fighting every enemy encounter i naturally came across and didnt really need any strategy was mainly just attack and keep my characters healed i do think however that the graphics might be a turn off for you if graphics and presentation are a big thing for you i played soon after came out and it didnt bother me at the time and it probably wouldnt bother me now since i have the nostalgia factor going for it but i can understand the blocky graphics coupled with the lack of voice acting to be a big stopping point in fact a lot if not most of my friends have not played or completed finished because of this also mechanics wise i think the game is very simple mainly just attack attack attack and heal most final fantasies ive played were pretty much like that because the characters play so similarly to each other the only one i remember that actually had me thinking and planning my moves was final fantasy x as each character was unique and had their own strength to bring to the party my recommendation finish lightning returns and first play any other games that you may be interested in and hopefully by then the will be out if not then go ahead and try on psn it will really make playing more special as you can see what changes theyve made since then

gaming,removed,if youre somebody thats into the gta franchise then definitely buy it im sure you could buy it for a price much cheaper though single player is awesome imo ive played through it times at least its visually stunning too i have played it on the so obviously on pc it will be even more beautiful gta online however im not sure i have played it since it first came out and my level is way past but i feel like things are starting to drift downwards it seems everything is getting more and more expensive and it requires a lot of playtime and patience in order to buy the cool things unless youre somebody that has no problem buying shark cards it hasnt been confirmed i think but i assume once red dead redemption and its online multiplayer is out people will drift more towards that and rockstar will probably focus more on it thats something to bare in mind too

gaming,removed,bro one person went through and upvoted one comment turns out i accidentally upvoted one of your comments be mad that you lack the evidence to back up your claim you too lol its hard talking to a brick wall when the very first comment they just glaze over what was saidjust so they can have a dig a sean murray and get a little fulfilment for god knows what reason i never said start again was a cool ending i never said lines of code again if you actually read the sources i provided in the very first comment before shoehorning in you would have seen its much more than that but i know you dont actually read what i type so i kept it short i never said that that is definitive evidence of them working either the portals are in the gamevisible and there is an action and trigger separate from the snippets i linked to that prevents sentinels attacking when you are in the portal like i said many moons ago the only way for you to get out of this is to somehow prove that the absence of evidence is evidence of absence and that my friend is impossible but youre trying youre best judging a companys proven ability to determine whether something exists is just idiotic you can use it to to form a personal opinion on the likelihood of something happening its the same as trusting rockstarit is not a determining factor on if something actually exists youre trust doesnt magically make things happen youre saying the game sucks the endings weak sean lied therefore portals dont work dudethis is like simplistic stufflike youre refuse to see the gap in logic just so you can call me ignorant and stupid dudeall i said wasi can see how stuff could possibly be missed out on this game essentially because of people like you and its vastness and you just came in and proved my point perfectly by shoehorning in sean lied sean lied sean lied i dont know why you are even open to any other ideas than that nms was a blank screen you got played deal with it you are literally mocking me and calling me ignorant and stupid for still keeping an open mind regarding portals based on the hard factual evidence presented i dont think you even understand what i was saying initially because you have been so desperate to display your butthurt of sean murray i also have butthurt for sean murray and my second comment was is agreement that there has been a lot of misinformation about this game but am able to separate fact what we have and havent got from speculationill tell you a time how hello games fucked my game overthey wiped my hour save im with you sean fucked mebut that still doesnt prove portals arent functional im not saying it is chilliadim saying the folks at chilliad have a different and scientific approach to dissecting parts of the game they havent figured out before concluding it doesnt workthats all like seriouslyyoure not even reading my shitjust so you cant come in and go ha ha chump sean lied to you so who fucking cares i say that shit and move on with my life and just to be clear you dont have upvotesi have downvotes and again its certainly not because what im saying is wrong it cant be when you are the embodiment of my original comment its because they disagree with the sentimentand thats fine just dont come and say that im wrongbecause i can see how things have been missed out by users because of internet and the ending cannot be incorrect as long as youre still alive
gaming,removed,ive honestly never though sc was going to a actually happen b happen as they say it will or c actually be any good i wanted nms to be cool and it wasnt i wanted elite dangerous to be cool and it really wasnt im finding it hard to believe any developer can make a good space sim with depth i dont see why it is so hard to make a great singleplayer with some multiplayer i guess space sim i would love to see a remake of xwing tie fighter and the vs games come out with expanded size current graphics and a good selection of scenarios and story

gaming,removed,assassins creed the revelation a few hours into the game that the character you start the game as was a templar and everything you had done up to then was helping them was pretty cool its tarnished a bit when you take in how many innocent lives are ruined by both sides equally
gaming,removed,all you have to do is source it otherwise its basically plagiarism
gaming,removed,and you can httpswwwkickstartercomprojectsthirdeditionsthirdeditionsbooksyourultimategamerlibraryrefcategorypopular

gaming,removed,fallout definitely shot me out of my chair as it turns out i was aiming a fatman at my own son dead space when you realize that your characters fiance was dead the whole time call of duty modern warfare when general shepard killed fucking ghost cod black ops when it is realized that sargent reznov died long ago just tears man i fucking loved that character so much dead space when you see the ishimura docked at the space station that sent chills down my spine for sure just remembering dead space heh skyrim when parthanax tells you his past star wars starfighters when your captain dies in your arms after being shot down and you were too far away to help warframe i cant spoil this one
gaming,removed,the end of shadow of the colossus when you realise you just killed innocent creatures because someone you dont know at all told you to and you realise how shitty you are
gaming,removed,you are dumber than a broken bag of hammers
gaming,removed,id say the people playing it longer are more entitled to the refund than those playing it for less than hours this is the most stupid thing i heard in my life they shouldnt get a refund if they have a long play time

gaming,removed,did you ride it i know i rode it and it was ok spoilers the water from the bug got in my mouth ew

gaming,removed,just so you know animations tend not to be limited by game engines you could put perfect animations into any engine and that would be that the animation problem isnt with the engine its with the animations implementation or just lazy animators source game dev
gaming,removed,op have you ever played suikoden better then check it out if you havent
gaming,removed,i agree ive still yet to play it even though i have the first episode but i want to wait to get every chapter purchased before i start
gaming,removed,this is misleading steamspy said himself he has no data on steam refunds and that any drop in users is probably due to the margin of error more time and analysis is needed before coming to any conclusions link apologies for the poor formatting on mobile
gaming,removed,probably the pirate bay or whatever the current equivalent is right now as well

gaming,removed,if its is capable to crash it will be even better
gaming,removed,its not like its multiplayer is it if people wanna spend more money on the game let them as long as theres no pay wall it shouldnt matter
gaming,removed,since this entire thread is basically asking for spoilers the biggest plot twist i remember was the persona protagonist dying at the very end its one of the few games that had the guts to kill a silent protagonist
gaming,removed,hold my beer
gaming,removed,pc mustard race boys always always claim to build a decent pc with loads ofgames with a tiny budget fail to deliver then just downvote as someone who plays both console and pc reality is different

gaming,removed,someone actually spent a lot of time painting a ridiculous game scene would have been much better off spending that time on working on their resume to actually get a fucking job
gaming,removed,i did nazi whats wrong with this what are jew to trying to say bro
gaming,removed,to be honest i dont know how the rest of us are going to survive without your amazing presence dumb fuck
gaming,removed,pc master race
gaming,removed,every newbie
gaming,removed,this theory makes good sense the lore of the game world accommodated you to die and be revived and for there to be a whole horde of enemies many games feature one prominent enemy with perhaps a miniboss or two and thats all also the sense of urgency within the narrative would be lost from many games with a feature that essentially allowed your character infinite lives its a very specific type of game that can use that system
gaming,removed,looks like a newly created repost karma whore bot account
gaming,removed,can we make a new sub called rshitpostrepostcentral and move all the real gaming posts there so people can just use this sub for reposts clearly they arent going anywhere like i dont usually bitch about it cause not everyone sees it the first time or whatever but damn front page is full of that shit right now and its getting old
gaming,removed,well firstly over games that i played from the past week wasnt dust even with dust checked for all of them and i found them all under minutes do you have your maximum acceptable matchmaking ping set to but it doesnt even matter that you get dust a lot because dust is a great map i prefer dust over any other map and it seems like the whole csgo community agrees
gaming,removed,just wait until you raise an unborn fetus from the dead
gaming,removed,highly recommend doing that but i got killed by maiq the liar
gaming,removed,wow that was cool how you typed no bueno love it so trendy
gaming,removed,ask what your friends prefer to call you something simple mine is relatively unoriginal but has its origins in what everyone calls me gamer buddies
gaming,removed,every torrent i download wont install it its like too oldit cannot install
gaming,removed,exactly plus i want the xp and to be that guy
gaming,removed,i vote for silent hill as the best storylinewrittingenvironmental storytellingdialogs to be remastered max payne should be remade on max payne engine re ma de
gaming,removed,mei because she has a well rounded play style that allows you to get up close and be dangerous with the tanks but also has long range to pick off supports and she has a self heal with area denial and plenty of cc
gaming,removed,and people think life isnt a simulation lol
gaming,removed,my skyrim se loading time is almost null on pc on ssd
gaming,removed,omelette du fromage
gaming,removed,game on dude
gaming,removed,engaging game world over the top destruction amazing game engine decent story literally days of content without the xl edition but dlc is a huge bonus certainly worth i got mine for with the dlc and i would have gladly paid more
gaming,removed,people like this probably are the ones that select light tanks and trucks instead of the heavy tanks and hide in the corner of the map getting maybe getting one or two kills before a new attempt starts on operations also fuck all you snipers when the objectives are in a fucking bunker more than meters away from where you are sniping
gaming,removed,i would jam tot his all the time when i was younger i still got this song on my phone to this day now i need to listen to it haha
gaming,removed,this would be me if i had fallout
gaming,removed,lol fuck off little pussy go play your victim card somewhere else
gaming,removed,between and years based on how much you used it
gaming,removed,one of the main problems with is the lack of morally grey or questionable choices like how in new vegas i found myself questioning whether it was right to kill some legionaries that were running away even though i knew the ncr would kill them or there boss
gaming,removed,dark souls l is the best with any guides

gaming,removed,cant wait for dotr finland you will never be welcome
gaming,removed,fuck iran and fuck you
gaming,removed,youre retarded
gaming,removed,dont like it fix your god damn country first before you start bitching about something as trivial as this
gaming,removed,well i know where you can get it and if you think a little you too and its free
gaming,removed,no it doesnt it says you are not i am learn to fucking read
gaming,removed,the first mistake everyone makes is letting rolof pick up the key before you can trap him in a room and farm sneak and handed to at least if they are console peasants like i was when skyrim was released
gaming,removed,sorry i have a life outside of video games
gaming,removed,good fuck iran
gaming,removed,hello friend looks like its time to start borrowing games from the pirate bay or purchasing games from drm free sources either way best of luck hope you get your games back

gaming,removed,good fuck iran and their terrorist harboring ways
gaming,removed,fuck burma
gaming,removed,lol the early concept were the details of the suit they kept many things as you could see if you were honest but no haha what sad pathetic troll you are even when shown official concept art you keep staying on the angry virgin train lol well have fun hating on others i guess thats all thats left for you at this point some people live lives enjoying their hobbies and their relationships and then theres people like you that only have hating on strangers to make them feel good
gaming,removed,here is the uneditted version of the big daddy cosplay and big sister cosplay cosplay
gaming,removed,companies cant ignore the law just because they said the law doesnt apply to us in the eula if they advertise the game that means theyre selling the game
gaming,removed,if you paid two months ago you got severely hosed its been for like two years
gaming,removed,the only thing thats pretty clear from his comment is that iran is somehow not a bad country like iraq which is plain wron iran is a shithole like most islamic countries and sadly the sanctions are justified
gaming,removed,both are islamistic shitholes and what happened in iraq can happen in iran any day islamistic rule destroys every country iran was progressive and modern until islam took it by storm
gaming,removed,is this even a new texture
gaming,removed,you are retarded i dont behead children and throw acid on womens faces for being raped are you seriously defending islam are you fucking kidding me fuck off dont answer i dont care what you have to say
gaming,removed,im a bit late to this party but rise of the tomb raider was only the xbox one because microsoft backed up the money truck to crystal dynamics and square enixs house and as of this comment its on pc and backwards compatibility is nice but it should have come with the console in the first place if it was so easy to do like the should have done in the first place as well
gaming,removed,i dont understand this title at all
gaming,removed,hrc is a good person and qualified you would know that if you did any research past conspiracycom
gaming,removed,my little project i personally think it has potential feel free to critique good or bad i want to build something the community loves
gaming,removed,swasdickas
gaming,removed,i say this on every thread related to eaorigin and always get downvoted why the fuck is anyone still giving ea money all their new games are just the same formulaic crap reproduced in a different package they dont give a shit about their customers and are known to fuck with them delete games and provide horrendous support why is anyone supporting them
gaming,removed,no i like to remind myself that this sub is filled with twelve year olds and casuals
gaming,removed,because that was the selling point ignoramus
gaming,removed,pretty sure they all do all three targets near me have this same display although one had cool ranch and nacho cheese while the rest only had nacho cheese
gaming,removed,im going to take that as an admission of age and no its because im not retarded and understand how to sell to twelve year olds
gaming,removed,you dont need therapy from having a girl yell at you and slap you a couple times just move on dont be pathetic
gaming,removed,fps means some milliseconds time at minimum from input to visible output tv delay controller delay etc while fps is some practically doubling frametime itll feel like a slug dragging around in comparison but your brain can probably compensate after some time now try going from with to anything standard below or in some titles with really rough frame pacing its almost vomit inducing especially if playing fairly close to your tvmonitor at any rate it just means more or less updates per second even with high quality motion blur lower rates will feel sluggish if you get used to higher
gaming,removed,not being an idiotic twelve year old buying skyrim remastered makes me feel better
gaming,removed,borderlands is a shooter you idiot
gaming,removed,i can fix it

gaming,removed,and expeted point from tankgewehr
gaming,removed,and im here in greece of where my father considers it a waste of time just my luck
gaming,removed,i am glad gaming is helping you and that you got out of that situation there are studies that show that gaming is great at relieving stress and helps with depression my wife who isnt a gamer always tells me to go game if i am in a bad mood or depressed because she sees that it helps me youll find the right one even if she doesnt share your love for gaming just explain to them what it means to you and how it helps and before i met her gaming saved my life from alcoholism got away from gaming and went to the bar everynight spending more than i could afford always hungover or drunk then ffxi came out and i didt crave alcohol anymore just wanted to play quit drinking and i was able to pay my rent again
gaming,removed,boobs she has them
gaming,removed,wow you really are pathetic abused by a girl and the only way to cope is video games get a grip man if you think video games justifies you getting bullied by your gf and moving back in with your parents then youre just making excuses for your worthless life

gaming,removed,as someone who suffers from mental health issues including suicidal ideation on a daily basis i find the idea that you would attempt to quantify a persons level of suicidity cant think of the right word to be ridiculous and explains so well why mental health is so poorly understood by the masses as well as the professionals
gaming,removed,wanted to say this glad you said this i only just realised how much i enjoy gaming and helps with many problems with my life even those that people know about and problems i keep to myself so thank you dont thank us as you sir are just plain awesome

gaming,removed,honestly id rather wait for the hd starcraft broodwar remake theyll be announcing in september its a tried and truly balanced multiplayer as long as they keep that the same
gaming,removed,yo
gaming,removed,excuse me sir you are not allowed to use gem in the tittle of posts rule number thank you sir for removing this snookler gaming mod hopefully
gaming,removed,you mist either playon console or having shitty settings mine looks great maxed out on pc and i could download the free dlc where it makes the game look better
gaming,removed,how many more times do i have to explain what i am saying i have never claimed i know everything about it you havent explained anything only that i apparently dont understand how it works its that big pretty fucking simple it doesnt matter how big it is what matters is how unique it is and how long it can keep the players attention a park could be yards or yards but still contain just grass and nothing else so whats the difference whether its planets or quintillion the fact that its procedurally generated indicates that its ironically limited the fact that people have seen the same structures from one planet to the next or the same animalsplanets with different color schemes indicates the limitation of the game as i said before if the developers had literally designed each planet it would have been very different however their algorithm for generating unique content must have flaws im really not trying to hate on this game i was one of those people who were pessimistic about the game but wanted it to succeed however im immensely pessimistic about procedural generation in level design being a software developer myself having no limitations on procedural generation can generate crazy and unique things but its ultimately unviable think of visiting a planet that is completely untraversable however the more rules you add to procedurally generated content the less unique it becomes it seems the developers have designed structures for simplicity lets say buildings for this algorithm you can randomly place them on procedurally generated planets but theyll still be one of them buildings similarly with animals they could define an animal as a body with parts and have about different iterations per part switching between the permutations to generate different animals doesnt change the fact that theyre still structurally the same in that they all have a maximum of parts and theres limited interaction from them from what ive read theyre either hostile or helpful in short a few quintillion planets sounds impressive but its the content of those planets that matters and how different they are to each other
gaming,removed,carl that kills people you had one damn job carl now you done goofed and killed us
gaming,removed,here is an old time fan made video of this trailer by my friend if you care to check it out
gaming,removed,dont be a condescending twat he is right the gaming community as a whole has shifted to a very very very casual mindset and cant handle criticism because they have been conditioned to write it off as bullying because the little snowflakes of thismy generation have never been told they suck at something

gaming,removed,the zelda games generally have very little in the way of story connection there is an official timeline of zelda games but we dont even know where this game falls on that timeline and even games directly adjacent on the timeline are often set hundreds to thousands of years apart all we know about the story of this game is that a force called calamity ganon wreaked havoc about years before the start of the game until it was sealed in hyrule castle ganon has been bulking up in the castle so link has to quest around to stop him from breaking free
gaming,removed,its a shame they killed him off on dexter

gaming,removed,at first i was like this makes no sense then i remembered that it is a hideo kojima game
gaming,removed,my reaction was that was it its like oblivion with pastel colors they could have showed they went back to the games roots they could have started with the zelda nes gameplay then slowly panned closer and closer and then view suddenly shifts changes into the new fucking open world zelda like whats it meant to be in the first place holy shit that teaser was doozer it looked like oblivion with pastel colors instead of zelda the way its meant to be played
gaming,removed,all you did was reiterate that colonial marines was an unproven gamble mass effect is my one exception to preorders i might buy a second pre order and throw it away just to spite dicks like you

gaming,removed,update so it was the pro since returning it i have had no issues and i even think hdr is working even better because looks amazing with it on if anyone is having similar issues i would suggest checking other games to see if it happens as this is a gpu issue which means it would more than likely the would have a very short lifespan

gaming,removed,what are you retarded
gaming,removed,its literally your logic youre saying you have to pronounce something in an acronym based on how its used in the original work graphics but that isnt a rule at all and is violated in tons of common words nasa scuba laser etc
gaming,removed,i mean konami must have seen how much pt blew up and that wasnt even a taste of what silents hill couldve been its the perfect recipe kojima has done horror elements before he knows how to do subtly at times del toro has some bitching imagination when it comes to monster designs norman reedus is iconic as fuck and would sway the walking dead crowd to try it it is a massive massive error on their half they want to go down the route of mobile games and such but what they fail to realise is a good game could bring in so much more than that look at resident evil for example it got it so right thats its been remade multiple times and despite that people still buy it myself included ive owned it on xbox and now pc do i grudge buying it another times not in the slightest because its an amazing game that revolutionized survival horror and breathed a breath of fresh air into a franchise that was getting stale thats what silents hills couldve been silent hill has been mishandled to an extent the last really good one being and being one of the scariest games ever pt has made it onto that list that is on and it was just a demo

gaming,removed,rpitchforkemporium
gaming,removed,thanks dude i just got the game and its pretty awesome right now
gaming,removed,this needs to be upvoted alot everyone needs to see this
gaming,removed,when that is the maximum graphic quality of your game you can add a lot of barren open expanses
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,either way who really gives a shit does it matter if some neckbeard sat there and placed million blocks according to a template if anything its more sad than impressive
gaming,removed,if your life becomes a living hell because someone destroyed your minecraft world then you need to change something
gaming,removed,torrent and post right meow
gaming,removed,its an epic rpg where you fly around in a pirate ship also upgradeable with a crew that you can collect trying to stop an evil empire from destroying the world a bunch of great side quests the game is difficult to run on a rom but if youre lucky you can burn it onto a cd and play it on a dreamcast extremely worth either buying it buy it used some copies are a bit or going through the trouble to torrent it im really not a fan of rpgs but this game is amazing
gaming,removed,nobody will care that you torrent a copy of a game you already own even though its probably illegal depending on which country you live in
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,while it may look interesting no mmo released now or in the future will capture you because you have a mental wall up youre looking back to when you first started playing mmos and any psychologist will tell you you cant move forward and enjoy things if youre always looking backwards
gaming,removed,wow way to regurgitate that shitpost circlejerk near word for word you know how stupid and inaccurate of a statement that is youre just choosing to perceive games you dont like a certain way
gaming,removed,looks like the reposting karmabots are not only stealing titles theyre stealing faces state of the art and in is an odd statement to make
gaming,removed,its not his face its another reposting karmabot
gaming,removed,thats a statement of faith better off how most of the concerns ive heard about end up being debunked a few days later the uk is a small country and actually the uk is not likely to exist for very much longer either

gaming,removed,niggerfield
gaming,removed,are you secretly neil degrass tyson
gaming,removed,in my opinion bethesda intentionally scaled back some of the rpg elements in skyrim compared to oblivion so as to make the game more accessible to a wider audience and it worked didnt it skyrim has sold around six times as many copies as oblivion has but before anyone accuses bethesda of catering to nongamers the lowest common denominator or some other rgatekeeping nonsense id like to point out that with the amount of money that was poured in to developing skyrim reportedly around million for the initial release bethesda had to make sure the game sold several more copies than oblivion or risk facing financial problems the more specialized a game is the more likely it will have a smaller audience willing to pay for it but dont worry about it because were living in a great age for gaming because there is so much money in the industry overall that tons of indie developers are able to popup and cater to those smaller audiences with specialized games personally my only gripe is that the music industry wasnt able to position itself similarly so that it could diversify just as well but i guess the difference is that people are content with a lot of music that was released long ago so theres a lot less motivation to pay for new material thats neither here nor there though
gaming,removed,youre ftfy please be less retarded
gaming,removed,ascii symbols and text
gaming,removed,wow maybe youll get laid someday
gaming,removed,sucks to be you but i would not blame it on ea they follow the rules set up for them and if they must sanction your shitty country then they have to
gaming,removed,dude myanmar girls are hot as hell just spend your date playing with those cuties instead
gaming,removed,theres a hot piece from myanmar in one of my college classes two words my friend yum yum lol
gaming,removed,another reason to keep pirating content we want to give them money for their product but they wont let us
gaming,removed,gaming tracker
gaming,removed,you guys do know you can pirate them right why bother with origins unreliability
gaming,removed,i was going to buy battlefield on there but i suppose now ill just wait until its on torrents instead im only interested in the single player campaign anyways
gaming,removed,usa is a rogue terrorist state what can you expect
gaming,removed,except that theyre drmfree meaning you can pull all those games from the pirate bay for which you should feel no remorse if they pulled content that you paid for
gaming,removed,or why piracy will always be superior
gaming,removed,ea are islamists myanmar is getting rid of islamic terrorist scum instead of welcoming millions of them like our cucks in the west call ea and tell them you are muslim and you will get all your halal games back
gaming,removed,your country is ruined by religion fuck bhudda the fat cunt
gaming,removed,i think we found the reason torrent and hackers exist
gaming,removed,or torrent games them you can keep them for as long as you want
gaming,removed,rohingya is just muslims being muslims did you hear thousands of them attacked a few police checkpoints and butchered some cops just this month
gaming,removed,perhaps dont live in a country in which the company who makes the games you like has its own countrys sanctions against you
gaming,removed,dont worry itll be on kotaku soon enough they get all their news from reddit i will give them credit that most of their writers will source reddit and the user they pull their info from
gaming,removed,uhhhh youre not american get fucked
gaming,removed,life is strange is a good one
gaming,removed,fuck iran though
gaming,removed,if and when you see an ea or origin title youd like do the right thing and torrent that sucker lets bankrupt these pricks
gaming,removed,something something ea sucks get a torrent
gaming,removed,who gives a fuck if a video game is banned in some country its one of those useless pieces of information that floats around websites because some people actually read it seriously why would someone want to know this
gaming,removed,youre not missing anything by losing ea and origin so if anything you should be happy about this just torrent their shit and be done with it fuck ea and their bullshit games ea ruined mass effect ea ruined dragon age ea ruined battlefield ea ruined star wars ea ruined mma games ea perpetuates the shitty sports game genre seriously how many fucking fifa games do you possibly need you idiots ea hoards games and refuses to release their games on steam or any other platform greedy money hungry cunts ea releases buggy games and basically says deal with it you cunt ea barely has a pr team worth a damn ea is a walking talking cunt with tampons for teeth and youre upset about it id be happy about it fuck yeah ill move there fuck them
gaming,removed,you guys should just torrent everything from now on
gaming,removed,lol funny that this outrages people when iran still hangs gay people as long as you guys allow your government to do horrible things i dont think you should be allowed to play western video games
gaming,removed,im not racist i just think immigrants are not people
gaming,removed,whats the problem anyway who needs gta v when you can throw stones at real people
gaming,removed,then dont play it problem solved i havent noticed one bug so far

gaming,removed,facts dont matter muslims are bad s
gaming,removed,thats peter brabeck a real scumbag he lives in a huge mansion in switzerland pm for adress
gaming,removed,as i said speak to what you know if you believe your country is free then maybe you should find out what real freedom is you also cant speak when you have some of my brothers in arms imprisoned there it doesnt work bud iran is a shit hole ps already have a fatwa on my head from your region of hell
gaming,removed,you know you failed as a company when random people not interested in your games want to torrent and seed for it out of spite
gaming,removed,if you see an ea or origin title you like go ahead and torrent it not only will it perform better without their spyware but you want be giving these assholes money lets bankrupt them
gaming,removed,it your government fault for not embrace democracy not ea fault
gaming,removed,itt uneducated brainwashed muricanz who think iranians live in the stoneage he lives in iran not iraq christ
gaming,removed,open door go outside have a real war profit
gaming,removed,httpvrporncomrempussygrindcowgirl nsfw
gaming,removed,stop being terrorists and maybe then you can play with us jk
gaming,removed,i clearly said iran not iraq or maybe some people are too brainwashed not sure what youre trying to say with that iran is in no way better than iraq
gaming,removed,if you live in iran then id suggest not being able to play computer games is the least of your problems
gaming,removed,the reason why pirate bay is still needed
gaming,removed,sorry but its because your country is an open state sppnsor of terrorism sucks that you were caught in the political crossfire but your leaders need to learn that using your economy for terrorism is not ok
gaming,removed,i mean they don´t even know the difference between iraq and iran and even if you were from iraq that doesn´t automatically make you a terrorist but on the contrary people should rather pity you for not being lucky enough to be born in a peaceful country like the usa
gaming,removed,get rekt iran
gaming,removed,man you keyboard warriors are furious you really think ea wants to steal your shit theyd love nothing more than to be able to do business in those countries think about how shitty both of those countries are then rethink your stance on this issue that affects of the world population and stop crying
gaming,removed,i clearly said iran not iraq yeah you know iran isnt a militant islamic nation full of terrorists that funds international terrorism at all either right
gaming,removed,fuck those assholes ea finally does something right go build some more clocks
gaming,removed,yeah well fuck iran if they cant play battlefield theyll probably make more nukes so maybe we should let them play lol
gaming,removed,httpvrporncomrempussygrindcowgirl cause shes best waifu
gaming,removed,stfu problem solved its the principle behind it which is disgusting if you can get that through your thick skull youd understand its like your favorite game isnt available on your online platform of choice anymore so i then go fuck it ill just torrent it that doesnt solve anything
gaming,removed,so the terrorists cant play video games boo fucking hoo
gaming,removed,because he is a terrorist
gaming,removed,playing video games is considered haram

gaming,removed,wow
gaming,removed,dont be so naive bud the entire middle east is a cesspool of terrorists idiot
gaming,removed,maybe if iran dosnt force foreign sportswomen to wear a trashbag then maybe iranian gamers can play games yall cunts have bigger problems than not being able to play games but i guess were brainwashed coz mooselims are very peaceful ppl
gaming,removed,good let woman drive if you want to be part of the civilized world
gaming,removed,boohoo guess youll have to go outside and stone some women
gaming,removed,maybe nobody cares about the problems your country has make your own game servers and games if you are so great or fuck off back to iran either way

gaming,removed,i got most of my rooms from there and its perfectly safe there are some adds there that youll want to avoid though make sure youre clicking the right download button etc but the files themselves work perfectly most come in rar format though so youll need winrar to extract them also yes if you own the games then its perfectly legal to download the roms itd be better if you still had proof of purchase but honestly no one really cares whether you do own the original game or not most people on the internet will have downloaded and played thousands and thousands of rooms that they never owned or cared to so rest assured xd

gaming,removed,quest note is from delphine delphine also is the only one actively working on behalf of the blades and helped decipher the dragonstone with farengar which is why she knows the places of power not only that but shethe blades benefit the most from a strong dragonborn its not going to be anyone who is friendly with the dragons its going to be someone who wants them all destroyed some think its esbern but it cant be because he didnt even know about the dragons until you get him out of hiding others think arngeir or one of the other greybeards but i doubt it because the greybeards never interfere with anything nor do they ever tell the dragonborn to slay any dragons especially since theyre allied with paarthanax ive also heard ulfric stormcloak but unless hes sending them from the grave after you slaughter him in the civil war if youve joined the imperials than its definitely not him others think it to be a message from the gods because theyre definitely going to send a courier with a hand written message to persuade the dragonborn to reach the point of being a demigod himself maybe its not confirmed to be delphine but it is delphine as she is the only one that makes any sort of sense
gaming,removed,muslim societies are all shit tier
gaming,removed,you can be harassed online just turn off the fucking computer
gaming,removed,reposting original content is bad solely because the creator gets no credit but even when credit is given people can be annoyed in that case its simply something overposted most redditors dont care about reposts provided that theyre spread out enough its basically the difference between ugh this again to heh havent seen this in like two years massive factor of nostalgia its also worth noting that many serial reposter accounts are done with one goal in mind eventually selling they repost content with a formula they know works do all they can to kickstart it then watch it frontpage the more karma and time an account has the more it can be sold for because it gains trust in the eyes of anyone who quickly browses the account think advertising
gaming,removed,peasant problem laughs in masterrace
gaming,removed,people arent brainwashed you fool consider this a wake up call that iran is evil and you get treated the way you treat others maybe you shouldnt take our sailors prisoner and humiliate them charge us billion to get them back then fly your jets closelythreateningly past our carriers
gaming,removed,its not harassment until you ask them to stop and it continues youre on a computer youre under no obligation to give them attention and if youre being harassed on it its no fault but your own for hanging around for it and yes reporting people for being mwean is hiding in a safe space cops laugh at people like you who call them because theyre being harassed on the internet

gaming,removed,modern castlevania its not even a question sure there are inspirations drawn from other games i suppose zelda could be in there but dark souls is to me what castlevania should have or could have evolved into from the decapitated castles to the vague lore although it gets less vague in some castlevania games the level design the way that you have to learn enemies attack patterns and struggle through the same zone again and again until you can breeze through to fight a boss that seems impossible at first to the feeling that you get when you finally down that boss the secret areas accessed by attacking walls at random the enemy design so much is derived from the castlevania games it is not even a question if you have played both series
gaming,removed,i think thats pretty fair america is great a putting a marketing spin on everything we do for the rest of the world i think some of those problem solving skills manifest themselves in round table type discussion in sciences this would be group lab work were teams need to organize themselves to complete the project and solve problems ironically this type of skill does not contribute greatly to high test scores so many competitive schools focus on memorizing for the standardized exams i do think the culture here emphasizes personal ingenuity and taking initiative in the workplace more than other countries ive lived in wait what was this thread about again

gaming,removed,sinkholes are a common naturally occurring geologic feature and one of the predominant landforms in florida where they pose hazards to property and the environment although many new sinkholes develop naturally in westcentral florida and elsewhere their increasing frequency corresponds to the accelerated development of groundwater and land resources usually little more than a nuisance new sinkholes can sometimes cause substantial property damage and structural problems for buildings and roads sinkholes also threaten water and environmental resources by draining streams lakes and wetlands and creating pathways for transmitting surface waters directly into underlying aquifers where these pathways are developed movement of surface contaminants into the underlying aquifer systems can persistently degrade groundwater resources in some areas sinkholes are used as storm drains and because they are a direct link with the underlying aquifer systems it is important that their drainage areas be kept free of contaminants conversely when sinkholes become plugged they can cause flooding by capturing surfacewater flow and can create new wetlands ponds and lakes

gaming,removed,ea everyone hates ea its popular and apparently acceptable to shit all over sean murray for bad pr well yeah hes the face that told the lies wasnt sony hired specifically for marketing and media purposes the only reason i know what sean murray even looks like is from him hyping the shit out of nms he was the one doing the pr and never had the guts to say nah thats not in this game especially considering again hello games is not the first company to overhype a game not by a long shot people are getting sick of companies not delivering and hopefully this is the straw that breaks the camels back ghostbusters isnt the first remake the execs thought they could cash in on with very little effort and it wont be the last but people are sick of shitty phoned in remakes and are beginning to really bitch about it and nms promised more and delivered less than other games sean murray fucked himself no one else
gaming,removed,no offense but i want to put my dick in your mouth
gaming,removed,they are its called the pirate bay pirate to try buy if its good you can usually tell within a few hours
gaming,removed,fine as long as the consumers are also investigated by the out of control imaginations who rely on blogs and people who dont have the game for information investigation society the whole mess is a and should be called a wash im more of the opinion that gamers lied to themselves and are trying to jump over their responsibility to use common sense and be informed with official information instead of lunch table i heard and what if they have conversations
gaming,removed,depends on the device but usually no most firmware turns off the ability to charge while acting as a usb host device some third party oss like cyanogenmod toggle support on but its also device dependent some simply dont have the circuitry to charge the batteries and power host devices as well some devices like some of the galaxy note tablets require just a special usb otg plug that has power in and out my workaround was to find a usb hub with a wall adapter that puts out dc and hacked together a usb cable that goes from usb a male to the dc power barrel jack i plug that into a battery bank this offloads the task of powering the controllers to the battery powering the hub makes the phones battery last much longer running emus isnt very cpu intensive
gaming,removed,can i ask where you get the roms i cant find a nice website that doesnt look shady
gaming,removed,i dont have a source but read that they sent a different version of the game to critics
gaming,removed,if you are a guy you are better off killing yourself than trying tinder here is another video of a woman commenting while using tinder httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvkmehvowvayg can you imagine how fun it must be to reject guys that you have to make a video about it women are legitimate psychopaths

gaming,removed,uh oh pussy ass white boy who cant dribble a ball alert
gaming,removed,the world of cyberpunk is incredibly deep and complicated which is a terribly exciting prospect for a game the focus on multiplayer however troubles me very few games can maintain a steady narrative and cater to a multiplayer dynamic at the same time about the only game i can think of in which this actually works is destiny and even then the narrative only works because you do the missions over and over again if im playing cyberpunk i want corporate intrigue cyber psychosis gangs computer hacking technology and media gone wild if they can add multiplayer to that without breaking the tone great if they cant they should just drop it
gaming,removed,call me an asshole but i have a good reason to torrent games just to try them before i actually buy them i put some time in that game and forced myself to power through it trying to get to the good part of the game but that didnt happen and i uninstalled it pretty happy i didnt make the purchase

gaming,removed,im sorry but the only titles that will truly work with vr are certain ones like pool the fun house by nvidia etc real games you need to be able to move around dodge dive you wont really get to do that with this unless you want to fuck your house up by accident
gaming,removed,maybe not kotor but the newer ones for the moba one of them has a battle between the jedi and the sith another has a battle between storm troopers and the sith ill link a trailer when i get to a comp
gaming,removed,lots of people in this thread saying vr will die out because of lack of free motion presenting the httpwwwvirtuixcom its expensive but with time i see this becoming a standard in video gaming homes
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,in real life i can see the wall in vr you can see the open space with a feint grid over it that is sometimes easy to ignore when immersed

gaming,removed,ha randy spears i used to work at a bank and help him and his wife before i knew either of them were porn stars
gaming,removed,honestly if someone was going to ignore the review score its got a chief where do you bloodthirsty lunatics get this stuff i guess its completely cool to crusade against an entire company and attempt to put people out of work you idiots act like hg isnt completely aware of the games shortcomings like youre the smartest motherfuckers in the room well if youre so smart why didnt you write the fucking code dude disliking a game is one thing but you crazies want to have your cake and eat it too i mean get over it its just not that horrible of a thing a guy got excited about his game and over promised you guys act like hitler buttfucked your mother over a goddamn video game its more than a little pathetic they buy it based purely on a trailer they kinda deserve what they get some people like this game and didnt get a rageboner over a few missing features you gotta learn your lesson somewhere and eventually buying based on ads will get you burned even if the ads in question arent intentionally misleading trust me none of you gaming crusaders on reddit are in any position to teach anyone anything you have all behaved like spoiled children over this this is why we cant have nice things because you all think youre so damn special ads dont exist for the purpose of adequately informing the consumer and we shouldnt be treating them as if they do then why are you bringing complaints against hello games and none of the hundreds of other advertisements that lie to you on a daily basis i wouldnt even mind if you guys didnt like the game just stop wrapping yourselves up in righteous purpose like youre doing a public service youre all selfish over your thats the root of all of this so enough with the grandstanding btw this official complaint is clown shoes it means nothing just an angry reddit nerd shouting into the abyss i advise you to move on with your lives and find the next stupid cloud of video game outrage to continue your search for validity in
gaming,removed,i personally like feel people are being way over emotional and judgemental towards hello games the game was made by a tiny team and there is plenty of small things to enjoy about the game maybe it was rushed but people wanted to fly thru space and they gave us that ultimately and i have faith that they will make the game more enjoyable for all you damn sheep out there too haha really i think no mans sky goes down as an epic achievement of grand scale and i have found so many cool sights and scope to the game that cannot be created by your general person so that i am applauding

gaming,removed,ive heard it before and so have you we need more women in tech we need more minority engineers we need more vaginas how will engineering suuuurvive if we dont have vaginas explain to me why engineering needs vaginas diversity is great when its due to merit based hiring if cultural differences between races or biological differences between the sexes result in different choices then that is fine hire based on merit not based on who has a vagina the tech community has a welldocumented diversity problem and the sense within silicon valley that something needs to be done about it is getting more acute yes hire based on diversity intellectual diversity not on false diversity like race or sex a cunt wont build a bridge you need a brain for that womenworked in tech for seven years and then left kieran asked these women specifically why they opted out some women cited discomfort working in these companies the overt or implicit discrimination was a primary factor in their decision to leave tech sounds like the same kind of childish fools who cant handle tshirts made by women and worn by men i wonder why is there no citation of these interviews where are the methods the survey documents heres a hint take your feelings and notion that people should cater to you and grow up btw is not even close to a representative sample size and your implicit cries of sexism are just as idiotic as those screeching over a shirt unless you can show me a peerreviewed study with large sample sizes high completion rates well written questions and publicly visible methods and data you can take your cries of sexism elsewhere while the exclusion is often unintentional the assumptions around women and minorities and the pressure to fit in with the geek culture is pushing out those who dont fit a specific stereotype cater to meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee come to me with evidence not opinion pieces from feminists with a massive bias

gaming,removed,games arent getting better theyre getting more technologically advanced youre interest is going down because youre realizing that a lot of games are very similar at their core open world sand box games often feel like gtarockstar clones instead of unique to themselves sports games get yearly remakes with little changes beyond roster upgrades games are so advanced graphically and require such complex computing that couch coop is rarely possibly in games where it used to be standard racing action
gaming,removed,i never claimed it was rare nor a gem just that it is the best star wars game to date but of course the most cynical comment bashing any appreciation of something slightly older older not rare reaches the top this behaviour of yours is highly fashionable on this site unfortunately in my opinion your comment is actually worse than appreciating something old i mean you are the one doing the circlejerking after all

gaming,removed,a bunch of lets players got together to found a csgo gambling site what the site does is collect weapon from a user lets them play a game and then a player wins more stuff or loses what they have aka gambling now the youtubes did not openly disclose that they owned the site and they made a bunch of reaction videos of them winning shit loads of rare gear allegedly the videos are faked and the game is rigged also the youtubers have a really young impressionable audience that has taken to gambling at a disturbing rate lastly gaven is a confirmed brony
gaming,removed,might be quicker just to find a torrent depending on internet speeds

gaming,removed,clearly you didnt use your big boy brain shareholders dont care about player numbers it doesnt matter if people play games it matters if they buy them titanfall not having dlc makes this even more true battlefield already has a free trial on ea accesorigin acces since day guess they are desperate for players for that trash game too right i dont even know why i bother explaining these basic things to somebody as a short sighted as you think what you want stay dumb whatever i dont care lol
gaming,removed,not really they all take place in their own world within the same universe so like would be on one planet on another the only exception to this was basically any sequels of the direct numbers generally subbed in as or they have special names fft ffta vagrant story and take place in the same world though as an exception to it all ffta and though are more a kid from the real world we live in being teleported into the story world with some repeat characters but theyre not totally in complete coexistance think like a fanfic type existance compared to the other three games however theres some monsters and people whos names and general positions carry over cid is generally the name of a guy who is either an enemy or a friendly party member who is either an engineer who builds an airship or is a pilot of an airship bahamut is always generally a summonable dragon that reappears meteorultima are generally some of the most powerful reappearing spells as part of the worlds physics etc the amount of technological advancement of the worlds differs between the game but generally almost always has some kind of floating airship wether its a boat attached by ropes to a balloon with a propeller behind it or a full blown spaceshipaka the ragnarok from so in otherwords theres naming conventions that carry over between the games but the worlds inside are not related aside for some general physicsaka magics types and spells possible healing etc and the fact that the games generally cover a world level crisis you have to solve
gaming,removed,even dee

gaming,removed,i recently built one myself and its awesome heres the tutorial i used in case anybody is interested in making one themselves i also got this controller and it feels solid theyre kind of pricey right now but the price seems to fluctuate when i bought it a couple months ago i paid a piece for ive seen them as low as on amazon its as of the time of this post full warning it is not without its flaws i get some serious input lag which makes precision jumps in platformers pretty much impossible i looked up tutorials to limit it and went into the config files if youre not comfortable with that kind of thing i changed quite a few options and tried some trial and error i ended up putting delays as high as i can to try to negate the input lag but its still not quite perfect it is a lot better though the sound also is a bit weird i couldnt get sound at all and again had to go into the config files after doing some research i found that some people would have sound but had to raise the volume on their tv to the normal volume they have for regular tv imagine forgetting to change it back yikes the input lag is the bigger problem that i had to deal with and is still a problem i fixed the audio issue after some research but i still think it was worth it ive been playing a lot of it since i got it and it reminded me just how different and better imo retro games are from modern games

gaming,removed,when cj ryder sweet and big smoke go to the cluckin bell in the grand theft auto san andreas mission drive thru carl and ryder both order number while sweet orders a number with extra dip big smoke surprisingly makes a much larger order consisting of two number a number large a number with extra dip a number two number one with cheese and a large soda cluckin bell serves primarily fried chicken and the menu items it has are shown in grand theft auto san andreas and grand theft auto iv assuming the menu hasnt changed a lot in the years between the games we can extrapolate the contents of smokes order no where else in the game are the meals referred to by number other than this cutscene now there are a few things we can extrapolate from big smokes order a number most likely contains fries andor a drink to be upsizable a number comes with dip making it either nuggetschickenballs or the salad meal and a number must either be or contain a burger to have cheese applied to it i believe the number is in fact the salad due to containing ranch dressing as a dip this explains how sweet originally got his nickname he used to eat alot of candy but now he eats healthy as in a number or the salad meal the number is most likely the little peckers while it could be the cluckin huge or big meal i find it hard to believe that ryder and carl would eat that much food the number is most likely the fowlburger combo as it contains no drink leading smoke to order an additional large soda to compensate also it can have cheese a number is a true mystery but given that when smoke is eating his food in the car he doesnt make any of the hallmark fried chicken eating sounds it is most likely not the cluckin huge meal we can extrapolate it is most likely the little clucker meal as that could contain nuggets given these facts we can extrapolate that big smokes order contained regular fries large fries regular sodas large sodas burgers sixpack of nuggets chicken wrap salad it is also revealed that smoke ate everyone elses food as well salad chicken wrap sodas burgers which is about kilojules of energy and over twice the adult reccomended intake even if smoke didnt drink all sodas more ridiculous is the fact that he ate it over the span of minutes as shown by the cutscene at the end of the mission where smoke leaves the car without the food but to put that in perspective the world record for most hamburgers eaten in minutes is so it really isnt that impressive but what really gets me is that even though there is such a large amount it is all handed to smoke at the drive thru in one single bag wouldnt the bag be way too heavy

gaming,removed,funny meme its wrong of course so yeah in point of fact i am going to advocate that is a better roleplaying game than nv in almost every way in my opinion those who think is dumbed down simply dont get it and need a paradigm shift rp isnt about having false situational awareness thrust on you with dialog choices that point out every quest branch and ask for a multiplechoice answer to me rp is doing what you think your character would do in that situation most of the gripes i have seen vis a vis having no freedom are actually examples of the exact polar opposite people dont know what to do with freedom so they get frustrated i didnt want to blow up the institute uhdont i didnt want to facetank every raider at the robot racetrack uhhhtry something else hint you can i dont want to kill every other faction than my own you dont have to i got the secret ending before it was even documented and it isnt even hard if you actually role play as someone who wants peace i dont want to kill kellogg too bad he wants to kill you i have to just kill everything uhhhhno thats not what you have to do thats just what you chose to do a lack of forced conversations with the bad guys and multiple choice quizzes in the dialog system doesnt mean there was nothing else you could have done the factions are so bland and the minutemen suck huh my castle is a concrete and steel military complex now with powerarmored minutemen patrolling the floodlit walls with laser rifles my flag flies over diamond city my men are mounting checkpoints all across the commonwealth yeah its totally lame compared to being the boss of new vegas wherewait nevermind those cats on the strip dont even act like they know who i am i could go on and on and on to me is so amazing i just dont think a lot of people have slowed down taken a breath and really plumbed its depths yet try this stop worrying about the dialog wheel you cant control what other characters say and in real life you cant either instead control what you take away from those conversations and what you do based on the output if you listen to maxons speech and think this guy is so full of shit dont look for the dialog option that says resign from bos justyou knowdo you will be surprised how much the game flexes to accommodate your characters worldview if you stop expecting the dialog wheel to make it a chooseyourownadventure story and just playyourrole

gaming,removed,som has some lore references which are pretty neat actually it pretty blatantly spits in the face of the canon
gaming,removed,the responsibility isnt just on the consumer the responsibility to make an informed purchase lies on the consumer the developers responsibility is not to the consumers but to their investors and shareholders to sell the game as well as possible whether we agree with this philosophy or not obviously the consumers ability to make an informed purchase is hindered by misleading advertisements but you shouldnt be drawing conclusions from advertisements anyways advertisements do not exist to adequately inform the consumer and shouldnt treated as such they exist to sell the product full stop im not saying what they did was right or that they shouldnt have any accountability but trying to make it the salesmans responsibility to ensure that you make an informed purchase is doomed to fail no matter how much wed like it to work i think we have to separate the idea of how it would ideally work and how it can realistically work and i cant personally think of any sort of reasonable consequence that could be laid on the devs without opening up a bunch of other problems legal precedent in this case would be extremely far reaching and have a lot of unforeseen consequences the video on the steam store for no mans sky a game that is no longer in development clearly shows features that are not in the final product and that video has been up since long before release yes its wrong and it should be taken down theres a solid argument to remove the video definitely but a much less solid argument in terms of whether its grounds for anything beyond that if they have to deal with this on everything they purchase they dont though nms was the exception not the rule the backlash is all but guaranteed to be the death of the studio and the message is being sent pretty clearly to the industry which i think is not an unreasonable outcome sean murray wont ever be able to put his name on a game again is that not him paying the price sooner or later theyre going to start getting violent with companies and reps oh ffs
gaming,removed,the text above it says then i rewatched all the footage weve released so far the text below it says you guys – that is what you do in no mans sky we planned it from the start but you can play the game now and you can have those moments yourself lots of little details have changed so many so many for the better but the game looks and plays just as we aimed to what are you talking about also reddit and neogaf actually have really good guides to what the game is and isnt gathered from interviews ive done sean murray lols but hey keep sucking that cock maybe senpai will notice you

gaming,removed,games drop price really fast by december the base game will be or less and in a year i bet you will be able to get the whole game for in two years the base game will be on ea access and cost or less the main source of revenue will be the dlc in this age aaa games cost more than ever to make and are on sale more often im more willing to pay for a quality polished game than for a mess like at launch or acu of course there are still developers offering quality polished large games like the witcher but i can understand the price tag for a game like

gaming,removed,very true something tells me that this will be limited edition though and theres a chance that more of these will not ever be made i actually emailed nintendo about this a couple if days ago and even their own staff dont know for sure so it could totally go either way either they are manufacturing demand through scarcity in order to make people want it badly before proper supply comes in at which point they would really clean up and make a tonne of money or they are deliberately not going to make any more units so that they get everybody frantically checking their website on a daily basis for when the nintendo switch comes out in march loads of desperate people who missed out on the nes classic and dont want that ever to happen to them again will flock to buy a nintendo switch having now been conditioned by the get it now before you no longer can feeling if it turns out to be that its despicable but kind of genius at the same time from a marketing point of view i also totally get why they might be cautious in case people just forget about the nes classic once the switch is released but i honestly dont think that will be an issue as while i know lots of people fearing the nes classic will never come out again are falling prey to the scalpers charging extortionate prices for these things just in case thats the last to ever be produced i know so many people who refuse to do that and are still desperately holding out for the nes classic to be sold by nintendo at their proper rrp and will buy one the moment it hits stores aswell as the switch when it comes out not instead so its a license to print money if nintendo plays this right and doesnt miss out on that huge opportunity

gaming,removed,so today i was asked to babysit my little sister who is shes pretty cute well developed for her age and mentally mature so anyway its about and i am responsible for getting her washed up and tucked away in bed i start the bath it fills up i put her in the tub etc im sitting there as she washes herself waiting in case she needs anything she starts acting a little funny saying things she doesnt usually say that are a little too inappropriate to mention i tell her she shouldnt speak like that its grown up talk she sighs rather cutely in frustration she then looks right at me observing me for a moment as her eyes light up with some sort of scheme at mind she stands up quickly oddly spreading her legs and grinning at me i felt my heart skip in such an odd way and the only way i could react was to look away and offer her a towel politely she said nothing and did not grab the towel this went on until it was obvious she wanted me to look at her i looked back acting natural and was shocked she was bending over and exposing her bottom to me i was so dumbfounded i threw her night clothes near her and told her to finish up but that id be back to tuck her in i go downstairs and ponder what had just occurred did she know what she was doing i spent the next minutes pointlessly thinking until i went back upstairs knowing she would probably need to be put to bed now my heart was still beating hard anyway i see the light on in her room so i approach it i walk in calmly and relief falls upon me shes already in her underwear and tank top sitting on her bed waiting for me as i ask her ready for bed she quickly responds yes brother but i want you to see something first she states i get a funny feeling about the way she said it but being her brother i respectfully reply what is it sis she says nothing slowly gets up off the bed and turns around she bends over as if to pick up something from under her bed however she remains still and turns her head to look back at me a wide and admittedly very cute smile on her face i look at her confused her eyes quickly dart towards her rear and she starts to spread her legs i think to myself that she couldnt possibly be doing this right now maybe she wants me to see if theres a cut or mark in that area i approach slowly looking carefully at her shaped butt and pink panties i ask her firmly what do you need sis all she does in return is giggle and start shaking her little butt in front of me at this point i am starting to hate myself i start getting nervous as blood rushes quickly into my penis its obvious now she wants some kind of sexual attention my mouth is wide open in awe as i look into her eyes then back at her beautiful little ass i get right up on her rear grinding my still closed cock against her panties and lust completely takes over my body she nods to me signifying she wants more than a little dry humping i rip my pants and underwear off exposing my super hard cock thats already leaking with precum rubbing my cock on her pantie covered pussy i groan with satisfaction she starts to remove her little panties keeping them at her knees however with no hesitation i slide my penis deep inside of her tight young pussy in just a few seconds ive already gone primal roughly fucking her as she squeals in pleasure barely minutes since entry pass and i cant hold back with the loudest moan to ever come from my mouth i ejaculate powerfully inside of her thrusting frantically and with pure lust there was so much cum inside of her leaking out she fell asleep like a baby

gaming,removed,hmmm over games in my library are from them and a few people i know use it with no problems imma keep going till i get shafted cause now im curious lol thanks for the warning though
gaming,removed,op correctly said honour as its a valid spelling he was then corrected to the correct spelling for the game incorrect for op as honor eh thats really not what happened actually someone asked what the name of the game was and op incorrectly stated that it was for honour this is indeed an incorrect answer because the games title isnt spelled that way its no different than if i called the tarantino nazi movie staring brad pitt inglorious bastards my spelling is accurate but the movies title is actually inglorious basterds so someone correcting me would be justified in doing so its ironic that it was corrected to an american spelling while the game is made by americans and not actually about anything fundamentally american the game is actually made by a french company based out of montreal someone pointed that out to me earlier still though thats not really anymore ironic than a japanese company giving a game an english title if its going to be sold to an englishspeaking market this game is primarily being developed for the american market so it makes sense that they use the american spelling since the content of the game itself has nothing to do with the demographic the game is marketed towards thats not really ironic

gaming,removed,why would they put cod and halo next to mega blocks when i have kids ill never give them megablocks it will corrupt their minds
gaming,removed,i have both and i prefer pc building your own gaming computer is a great learning experience its plugged into my tv and i can play with a controller pc graphics are levels above the best console my graphics card can play any game on ultra and its nothing oc at worst ill occasionally drop to if a game is very demanding that is still better than any console also i can use my computer for work projects reddit whatever
gaming,removed,go straight to visa to deal with it the major credit card companies have strict antifraud policies and they will deal with sony so that you dont have to i had a similar thing happen to me a few years ago but it was the credit card company that called me direct and asked if i had just made four transactions on xbox live costing about altogether i didnt even own an xbox or so i told them it wasnt they handled the paperwork and sent me out a statement i had to sign saying i hadnt made the purchases microsoft sent out a standard form letter denying responsibility the mastercard rep told me to expect this and how i needed to word my response to it i wrote the letter as instructed denying fault and boom saga over its also worth noting that while the whole process took about a month mastercard refunded me the day of the first phone call tldr take all the info straight to your credit card company and theyll sort you out i am a bot i try to construct hilariously irrelevant replies if i post a relevant comment please message me

gaming,removed,valdis is fucking glorious if it werent for symphony of the night valdis would have my top spot in metroidvanias its funny cause the first time i played i stopped about minutes in and uninstalled it everything felt so clunky it looked nice but didnt play that well what i didnt understand is that your character is supposed to be a bit clunky at the beginning you have to put a few points into some skills and pick up one or two of the dash items before the game really starts to click by the middle of the game the combat is like silk everything flows so nicely the dash move in that game is absolutely perfect it was incredibly fulfilling to jump up smack the enemy in front of you a few times use two dashes to hit the ground and fly behind the baddie then continue the combo from that side its a shame that the devs dont want to make another maybe it didnt make that much money
gaming,removed,nobody gives a fuck about kids lets be honest with ourselves people just want to look like they are great citizens exactly i feel like the bullshit viacom and a lot of censoring and destruction of good child cartoons that now we get garbage like uncle grandpa and whatever nickleodeon oozes out of their dying slime tubes all falls into what you said they dont give a shit about kids its all about the public image its all about oooo they like kids well hell they must be pretty trustworthy kind of mentality i guess this is just one of those animated cartoons back in my day were much better arguments but one thing most have to agree on it the harsher kidfriendlycushion censorship that has been happening these past years on networks such as nickelodeon or cartoon network

gaming,removed,no youre just autistic spend some time talking with real people instead of watching videos and playing games all day

gaming,removed,is a mudlike rpg where every item is unique itll scratch that diablo itch incorporating a huge world pvp and availability on every major platform including your phone it features a roguelike feel and dungeoncrawler mechanics such as permadeath as well as a player driven economy no npcs randomised character stats and a dd combat system while i have only been in the community for months the game has been going strong for over a year now and the playerbase is extremely helpful if you drop in give a shoutout to my handle dutchman in global chat and ill set you up with some gear if im around and if not someone else definitely will the wonderful thing about this game is the amazing memories the community creates here is a few of my favourites going to rescue a new player who got overconfident and died to the orc shaman i did not have the gear to beat the shaman myself so i messaged second wave and someone i forgot who let me know showed up just to help save a new player the new guy went premium to allow a rescue and i took him back to aera feel good inc a friend died in the bottom of troll cave while he was fighting the tk and i watched it happen the tk killed him but there were too many corpses in the room to find him after some digging i realised he was not there but in the room prior but we can no longer backtrack from tk so three of us fought all the way back down through the troll cave to rescue the poor guy from under a gargantuan pile of troll corpses outside the tks lair we made it before he bled out and it was crazy intense for a mud getting my flatmate into the game elora is not much of a gamer but plays regularly now however instead of the way you and i may play she spends of her time in the aera marketplace playing the economy to the extend to which this exists finance students go figure the generosity of some of the new players a new guygirl europa started playing the other day and found a bronze shield in the inn they were super excited and had no idea about the relatively low value of the shield when he offered it for sale argus bought the thing off him for which became apparent when he asked if was enough to buy a house europa bought a house and some starter gear and said they felt incredibly supported and welcomed by the community these moments are fantastic argus you are awesome
gaming,removed,first words will come before months my sister has a daughter who turned year old today and she has words in all of my experience with very young kids they are able to know a lot more than words by months although no is their favorite word writing by three is absolutely possible or at least those words you listed earlier a lot of american kids start kindergarden at years old many will go to prek as well at i went to prek at years old and every kid there could read and write at least their name because i remember having to find my name written on a piece of tape on the floor for where i would sit i was writing and reading well before i ever got to school though and just about everyone there was too so year olds writing is certainly a thing everyone severely underestimates children at all ages and it pisses me off

gaming,removed,itd be different if for example nintendo was actively making and selling some of these titles but the last metroid remake wed seen was way back in — a lifetime for diehard fans of the franchise thats pretty much exactly how i feel i could understand them not wanting to hurt sales but they arent even trying to make new games i guess this probably cuts into their game market where they convince us to buy the same game for a third time
gaming,removed,yeah if that even then corruption is kind of unlikely just uninstall the mod if it gives you trouble and at worst you lose the game files from when you had it installed theres no way mods would have got to consoles if there was a chance they could cause permanent damage microsoft wouldnt have allowed it

gaming,removed,bdo good looking combat good life skills and decent enough community you can buy the items that cost real money easily on marketplace a pet costs for example and just for logging in one day you can get on attendance rewards also caters extremely well to afk play and people who work full time etc eso is solid enough good skill system combat is a bit clunky imo first person limits you alot so third person is advised good enough crafting queues for dungeons can take a while it has pvp but is mostly just whoever has the most numbers wins recently added gambling boxes to their premium store but dont offer much other than xp boosts and costumes with no stats you will either have to buy gold edition dlc seperate or pay monthly to enjoy all content quite popular never played wow so cant say anything other than its popular guild wars is great for gameplay story and has a really nice pvp setup whereby you are given everything and top level with all skills for the pvp so you dont have to level it has a great gear system at end game imo being based on looks rather than stats also has an expansion to buy quite popular tera in my opinion isnt worth it it was amazing at launch but now is just a barrage of flashing colors and not much else also locks all new class content so you have to play a female or a child albion online isnt bad its not yet release however if you buy now you can play the game to test it out and see what you think before they reset the servers for release it has gathering etc and is mainly pvp focused there are more but im too lazy to write more up lol

gaming,removed,i think the problem is that the word gamer applies to all people who play games the problem with that is that the term gamer is associated with the twelve year olds who have a minecraft youtube channel with subs and it also applies to the guy who wears a trilby and only plays old nintendo games it also applies to the guy who bought an xbox or a and nearly uses it and when he does he plays nothing but madden and fifa gamer is a term that applies to everybody who plays games and a lot of those people arent people id want to be associated with personally i like to play pc games with a high level of skill i like to play mobas and totally ruin peoples day by humiliating beating them i like to play csgo and beat people at a game that requires a lot of skill and knowledge i like to play at the hardest difficulty and stealth around the place getting perfect scores and playing at a very high standard i dont like being associated with the word gamer really but then again i rarely do

gaming,removed,oh well if he said it might br true in a playboy intervore are you retarded
gaming,removed,im positive that the brer rabbit stories were part of african american folklore long before disney showed up and the movie was an effort to preserve this storytelling as a form of art and tried to be honest to the source material on the surface you can accuse it of being glorified blackface but the reality is that the original stories were written exactly as depicted in the movie

gaming,removed,i cant really give links to torrents here but you can look it up on many of the torrent sites and you will find it easily there are multiplayer versions also which take a bit less space if you are concerned about viruses or such things because of downloading from the torrent then scanning it before installing might help after you have it installed just look for some servers and you will find tons of them but most of them require different mods if you want to look up the popular servers only install gameranger it lists the bigger servers that are on at any particular time and promod is an exclusively snd mod which is a bit similar to csbut very different in some aspects you only get a select amount of weapons to choose from low health no map no hud no perks no killing streaks it makes the game much more fun you will find a lot of promod servers on gameranger andor a simple search in game too im sorry if this isnt as detailed as you were hoping for but this is all ive got hope you are able to install the game and have fun

gaming,removed,unfortunately tony jay passed away it is one of those series i would rather they leave alone and specifically because of the vo work that cannot be equaled let alone bettered second to that would be the writing they will screw it up on a remake and dumb it down this exchange between kain and raziel is a good example you do not find this sort of commentary these days as they wrestle with ideas of fate destiny and the illusion of free will simply brilliant

gaming,removed,looking at his post history hes salty about a bug in skyrim se that was even an issue in the original skyrim it can be caused in several ways but can be fixed he clearly hasnt even attempted fixing the issue because a quick google search i did brought up a post in this exact sub with someone discussing the same issue also im sure it made an appearance over in the skyrim sub so in case mr grumpy pants is reading this or anyone else facing the issue of the carts going crazy in the opening sequence the issue in game is that the game engine physics is directly tied to your frame rates dont ask why im not saying its a perfect system for whatever reason playing the game around fps can cause some issues particularly in the beginning the way they do the custcene is very odd the way to fix this is to make sure that vsync is on and if you have an nvidia card set your monitor refresh rate to and itll solve most of the physics issues if those dont work there should be a mod that you can install quickly and fixes this or theres also a way to adjust the ini file to correct this issue tldr cap your fpsrefresh to andor turn on vsync for at least the beginning that should be the only time thats an issue

gaming,removed,they can refund for more than hours on a case by case basis but the nms hate train was treating the fact that some people got the refunds as if their entire policy somehow magically changed just for nms and people kept upvoting it over and over
gaming,removed,you need to prove it to me because youre the one making the claims youre the one making the obviously bullshit statements youre the one claiming insider knowledge the onus is on you to prove it its on the rest of us to doubt you youre basically claiming your uncle works for nintendo when the truth of the matter is video game development especially one with a publisher like sony is so heavily under ndas that even telling anecdotal office stories can get your fired and black balled from the industry so the odds of you being full of shit are high with that in mind you seem to not understand how the internet works youre posting in a discussion on a topic if you cant handle being doubted or being told youre wrong then i suggest you stop posting on the internet and never go outside as the very second you engage in any kind of discussion there are certain expectations of you admitting that you dont care what other people say defeats the purpose so either stop being a child or fuck off with the lies

gaming,removed,i dont think they really care about that i refunded mine yesterday with no explanation other than the multiple choice selection
gaming,removed,id imagine they feel like shit especially since theyre a small developer i honestly think though the biggest problem with the game is the price point it should have been sold on steam via beta and on playstation store as a digital game only and sold at about the to mark as a beta indie title also they absolutely should have developed it with multiplayer from the ground up and probably cross platform with or better still scrapped outright to allow the modders in then you could have had steamworks get involved the game is a fantastic skeleton that is crying out for a community to exist in their almost literal universe but because theyve put the breaks on both the multiplayer and the way its xplatform theyve sort of stopped that potential which is really silly imo
gaming,removed,i wouldnt threaten to kill you but i would probably bitchslap you in the face for supporting nms
gaming,removed,yeah but pc users are entitled fuckheads

gaming,removed,but they are no longer willing to punch down and make fun of minorities which is why they removed the passable transvestites card man that whole punch up punch down thing is super racist no really youre treating people differently because of their race plus the attitude that they need to protect minorities from racist jokes in a game designed to be offensive and attack everyone is condescending as fuck minorities arent children they dont need your white savior ass to protect them from dark humor unless of course you think minorities just cant take a joke which is even worse to be fair ive heard an argument that jokes about minorities could reinforce stereotypes in peoples minds but not for the majority i dont buy that but assuming thats true you cant guarantee that the game will never be played in japan or jamaica or any other place where white people are a minority their initial response was that their game protected intellectual property and that they would sue if thats true fuck them get in touch with the crabs adjust humidity people and see how they did it iirc someone even made a fan expansion for monopoly but i cant seem to find it so take it with salt anyway if you dont want to make money you could just upload a document with the card names or put it on imgur or pastebin or something
gaming,removed,i would advise in that case attempting yourself to live on vitamin tablets and yeast for a year and sparing the rest of us your company

gaming,removed,i believe its probably a lot faster designing an interface for the game on website with many features interfaces are a lot like websites when creating a website you have hundreds of familiar frameworks to use loads of information on how to use them im assuming making an interface with loads of features is a lot more fiddlier in a low level language

gaming,removed,they were giving the speedrunner a chance you retard just like colbert did by pretending his hot pocket was too hot to eat even going as far as spitting it out at the end its for entertainment not a fucking record
gaming,removed,spoilers if you look into the bottom right corner you can see tommen bungee jumping without a rope
gaming,removed,samsung had one job with the note literally one job and that was to fix the one big issue thats been prevalent in their entire galaxy smartphone line since the note ii selling displays with incomplete subpixel arrangements that only contain half the redsblues and deceptively advertising them as if they were the real deal even hinted they would do this but instead they kept the incomplete subpixel arrangement curved the screen made it explode and now their pr team is doing this
gaming,removed,i met someone that still had a note they were saying that the insurance they have through att wanted in order to exchange it that didnt make any sense and i told them that they should be getting replaced for free anyone have anything similar happen

gaming,removed,nice
gaming,removed,fuck off
gaming,removed,dude its only a trailer xd
gaming,removed,might as well do a full trailer breakdown is nothing we didnt already know its breath of the wild its easy to see here but well get a better view in seconds one thing i noticed that it probably just because its an early build but no hud im sure someone has already noticed or its already been released but i think the song playing might be from the botw soundtrack first full look at the system it appears to act as a charging port for the screen which might be the system itself as we dont see the system being used with the little screen ala wii u im also unsure what those plugs in the front are they look too big for usb but too little for a controller my first thought was memory card slots but that seems unlikely shows the controllers slide off handles shows the apparent quickness in transition from screen to tablet but wheres the disk i feel like walking around with that and a disk in it would be risky is the switch going to be the first major digital only console shows the controller layout it looks like they are keeping the main controllers of a pro controller but the dpad isnt one button as it usually in in most other controllers theres also a little square under the dpad possibly thats where ammibo integration will take place hes putting in what appears to be an sd card i really dont think nintendo is going to sell their games on sd cards but i do think itll open the possibility of buying your games on a computer and transferring them over we get our first look at skyrim which is a surprise it looks great and its assumed that its the ultimate edition the hud is also missing from it so im just assuming they are not including them to make the screen seem bigger and less full a new procontroller it appears to be pretty much identical in layout but is obviously a new color and might have grips he also begins to play skyrim again showing that the switching of primary controllers will be easy and quick i dont think it will be that quick to be honest but they make it look good double dash makes a return is an amazing shot and gives a way a lot the tablet itself has a new accessory that allows it to be played in the car they are playing double dash but i cannot tell if its a remakea sequelor a virtual console rerelease local multiplayer is using each side of the controller which is insane and brilliant that each system will launch with two controllers essentially same track only single racers this time mario kart is essentially confirmed and its double dash two tablets against each other probably using similarblue tooth tech that the does for local multiplayer a version of pretty much confirmed a new mario which looks similar to super mario the amiibos are nearby which could hint at integration or just be for show a group of people playing splatoonpossibly a sequel together using that same tech from the nba portion but they are playing against someone so they are most likely using wifi i highly doubt that the system will have first real glimpse at splatoon based on appearances its most likely a sequel so games that were shown that are confirmed loz breath of the wild non confirmed games mario kart dash some version of probably wont be called that but i want it to be called that my concerns no disk drive no backwards compatibility other than that im so stoked
gaming,removed,hooters therein watch silken
gaming,removed,yeah maybe listen the first time idiot
gaming,removed,someone should make a website or a subreddit called illtakethatbetcom that moderates and links to a source where two people put up their money and when it comes to light one gets the money wired to their paypal charge something like a bet from each party although im sure the legalities would make this difficult to do
gaming,removed,well he triggered you pretty well so you have proven him right
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,source this assumes somebody is independently running a learning ai against intrusion since i doubt anyone would leave their enemy ai in learning mode for a released game
gaming,removed,fuuuuck a nintendo console graphically on par with the original and the big name aaa publishers already signed on a nintendo console with real power i will probably never use the portable feature and i am sold if ea brings madden to this console i will be selling my and just have a gaming pcswitchespecially with destiny coming to pc
gaming,removed,play doh yo gabba gabba giant kinder surprise egg toys muno
gaming,removed,my entire childhood has been waiting for this 😭❤️
gaming,removed,its called another metroid remake and its free online somewhere nintendo cnded it so you kind of are installing at your own risk although i downloaded it from some random dude somewhere and i was thankfully fine
gaming,removed,o
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,i love nintendo fanboys theyve been spouting about this whole generation now this
gaming,removed,also watch
gaming,removed,i just read his comment history like pages of it what the fuck are you talking about
gaming,removed,nintendo gimmicks in lul
gaming,removed,buys xbox one
gaming,removed,i lost the right side of the controller before ive even bought it
gaming,removed,its pretty obviously about the gang he was in the silhouettes in the teaser art clearly had john marston and bill
gaming,removed,no he shouldnt unless your character is slated to die in the upcoming game
gaming,removed,heres hoping they make the docks upgradeable just new cpu and gpu every couple years at multi price points so you can get that enthusiast market too
gaming,removed,no children were harmed in the making of this video nintendo
gaming,removed,woo hoo i can now pay to play a game i already own
gaming,removed,will red dead redemption or red dead redemption be ported to pc no then i dont give a fuck rockstar
gaming,removed,i prefer my the nintendo switch is interested though im sure its underpowered by comparison its portability of home console quality games without compromises is intriguing but whether theyll have games i care to play is yet to be seen id certainly not want to play party games on it if its significantly gimped to do so a home console quality mainline pokémon game andor less likely golden sun would sell me though im a big ff fan and really into wjarpgs in general so well see how they fair in that department
gaming,removed,you deserve to have that name for skipping the pokemon opening
gaming,removed,not really that being said i myself am not bothered with that i already have for whats not on the nintendo but i like that i can take my games on the go if i got this id probably get any game that came on the nintendo on it and just use the for games not on it already and hell it getting monster hunter and pokemon as well as that zelda game give it games the others wont have and you can play them at home or on the go i suspect a lot of people who are interested in console games already have an andor but this would be interesting enough along with nintendos unique games to get their interest and for casuals who havent yet made a choice i think the play your games whereever would give it enough interest to have them consider it over the other two but to be fair i dont expect nintendo have more power than the other id be happy enough if it is close thats never been their strengthbut at least for me who hasnt been interested in their consoles since the nes this gimmick is enough to have me seriously interested
gaming,removed,it was not more powerful than the xbox but it was more than the yes
gaming,removed,👌👀👌👀👌👀👌👀👌👀 good shit shit👌 thats ✔ some good👌👌shit right👌👌there👌👌👌 right✔there ✔✔if i do ƽaү so my self 💯 i say so 💯 thats what im talking about right there right there chorus ʳᶦᵍʰᵗ ᵗʰᵉʳᵉ mmmmmꮇм💯 👌👌 👌👌 👌👌 👌 💯 👌 👀 👀 👀 👌👌good shit

gaming,removed,square enix possible final fantasy remake port to the switch
gaming,removed,the stock performs at xbox one is at this is a new completely custom chip that uses a very bare metal api called nvn specifically for the switch likely adopts from vulkan since its open source even at that api can still squeeze some performance per flop compared to on xbox one
gaming,removed,and look at the usernames i had replied to you then you assumed i was httpprntscrcomcwrvhz jesus christ youre soooooooooo stupid stop trying to hassle me i did not think you were the other person if you recall what i actually said theres the text of my first comment on this my first comment on this not to you nice try at getting a last jab in but it kind of backfired you dumb fuck
gaming,removed,that asshole is imposter im the real bitch fucker
gaming,removed,again anecdotes do not mean anything i am mid i do not own a portable gaming device and have friends that are gamers none of which ever use or own any portable gaming devices lets just look hard into the numbers and see what is true has the average age as now the analysis separates dedicated game consoles from dedicated handheld systems from smartphones from wireless devices and pcs out of the most frequent gamers of gamers play dedicated game consoles whereas only of gamers prefer to play dedicated handheld systems based on such findings we can easily surmise you are the statistical minority
gaming,removed,ellen page is almost id rather they just find an unknown actress who is age appropriate
gaming,removed,source
gaming,removed,dude is amazing he previously played harambe winston with bananas and dva with flight sticks httpwwwtwitchtvrudeism is his stream he also streamed the making process
gaming,removed,thats a good point i was thinking of buying a vr set and seeing what my kid thought of it thanks to your warning i will certainly reconsider and wont thank you
gaming,removed,and a golden wonderwoman lasso ahahahaa
gaming,removed,certain games i just played arkham city before it was done downloading these are goals thing to strive for
gaming,removed,a console without discs will be hacked in month and every game will be in a usb card
gaming,removed,i recognized that parking lot at tbc indoor racing in richmond bc link to google street view for those interested
gaming,removed,i would love to see the source code for the ais in the civ franchise do not remove this bug otherwise ghandi stops using nukes despite starting with the lowest level of aggression to reflect gandhis historical legacy of pacifism as the game progresses towards the modern era the indian civilization would often become more hostile and confrontational towards other leaders as a result of a coding error at that point in the game gandhis already low aggression value would lower into a negative value in the games code at which point the error caused gandhis aggression to underflow into the highest setting just as the level of military aggression begins to wane across the world in the game going from to
gaming,removed,ive been waiting years for this game to be announced had a feeling it was coming out this year sad i have to wait a whole year to get my hands on it
gaming,removed,it looks fking gorgeous
gaming,removed,source
gaming,removed,megyn kelly destroys donna brazille post debate
gaming,removed,cast maisie williams as ellie and im sold or get a time machine and make ellen page the right age for it again i never thought about jackman playing joel before but its the clear choice after seeing that picture
gaming,removed,a second google search would prove you wrong literally seconds
gaming,removed,its got to be a prequel because i know for a fact i drove those buffalo to extinction in rdr source savage white man who cares not for the plight of the noble buffalo
gaming,removed,its pretty direct character to silhouette comparisons of them might be a coincidence but most of the characters displayed can be linked to one of the characters from rdr thats beyond a coincidence
gaming,removed,thats the end of the old west so a sequel doesnt make sense everythings pointing to a prequel so far even the silhouettes in the initial teaser art are of the dutch gang members including john johns dead as are the rest of the gang so it must be a prequel
gaming,removed,waiting for sluts bad you now
gaming,removed,cant wait for this game
gaming,removed,preorder now
gaming,removed,my cousin pedro blood and bananas httpwwwaddictinggamescomactiongamesmyfriendpedrogamejsp theres a remade version out there or you can try the original one for free its actually pretty damn good

gaming,removed,being a brit and not into flags i didnt realised this was based on a real design awesome shirt btw
gaming,removed,emulation will come first
gaming,removed,because thats the only reason i hate konami right it has nothing to do with any of the bull shit they have been doing for years right silent hill hd not advertising a game they were piblsihing until days before its release mgs survive pachinco gear solid cancelling pt for petty reasons forcing there employees to work in appaling conditions that have literally been described as psychologically damaging the month of madness attempting to censor negative criticisms blacklisting game journalists for not liking there games and many many other things but yeah your right i am just butthiet about hideo kojima being fired even though it was arguably the best thing to happen to him in years
gaming,removed,ausser gefecht what a beautiful language
gaming,removed,despair spike chunsoft
gaming,removed,it sort of puts how small that level was into perspective huh i remember it being huge as a child

gaming,removed,bouncing bullets are a fine mechanic but no actual physics were involved in the creation of that effect
gaming,removed,it bitch slapped you for leaving it behind
gaming,removed,they perform essentially the same
gaming,removed,yep witcher not even a question one of the best games of all time not since halflife has a game been so close to perfection still havent played but im still playing witcher regularly after buying it last fall its a game you beat and want to start right back over just to see how you can changeshape the outcome through the story arc
gaming,removed,im still logging hours to this day
gaming,removed,i feel like it will also serve as a dedicatedextended gpu type deal its almost certainly going to be just a dock judging by everything ive read about it today at least well see
gaming,removed,fuck pc im buying a to play this sorry master race but this shit is too hype
gaming,removed,definitely worth the watch
gaming,removed,annonlinkqiit hook up lady neighbourhood for bonk in

gaming,removed,go play lamulana remake hour mystroidvania
gaming,removed,well from software are confirmed to be a party partner for the switch so theres hope that it could get a souls game maybe a dark souls remaster or something i would love to get the final fantasy remake on it being able to play that wherever would be really cool even just being able to play it in bed would be nice
gaming,removed,monsters den on httpwwwkongregatecom is a nice classic time sink or slitherio
gaming,removed,since they are almost certainly going to dump the wii u if you want to play any of the new mario games or any game from another nintendo franchise that is switch exclusive you will probably have to buy a switch
gaming,removed,nah the only way to trigger it is to say there are only genders
gaming,removed,i dont give a shit how many down votes this has it made me lol thank you
gaming,removed,you are an actual retard who doesnt even understand anything notice how my comment calling you out on how much of a retard you are got upvoted everyone knows youre a retard now go away you have severe brain trauma and you should be in a mental hospital rather than in a reddit comment section making yourself look like a jackass
gaming,removed,sluts
gaming,removed,im not even sure a single graphics card yet exists that can run it at ultra with max resolution on its own most consumers dont even have televisionsmonitors capable of yet let alone multiples
gaming,removed,i have a secured permanent lifetime income from a revolutionary invention by father for the oil gas industry he receives monthly income for any and all uses of the invention which not without reason to brag literally was keynin the development of fracking and down well communications as compared to the technology the industry relied on for four decades that used mudpulse reading that maxed out at per second yielding data that was mostly useless and required teams of engineers to interpret the readings fuck you peasant
gaming,removed,its a frontend piece of software that will emulate any console you can think of all in the same program just need to go get the roms over at emuparadise or something grab a core inside the software for the console you want to play and youre good to go i only get roms for games i ownhave owned but i really dont discriminate lol those games are old as hell and wont make their devs a single dime anymore anyways
gaming,removed,maybe youre a sinner into your alternate life maybe youre a joker maybe you deserve to die
gaming,removed,seems like they failed to teach you how to not be a cunt though
gaming,removed,would you prefer qtes its more classic core element of the game rather than game logic
gaming,removed,greenlight page is up
gaming,removed,not its not in legal terms there is no distinction between ripping a game versus downloading it as in both cases you are creating an additional copy for personal use the part that is illegal is distribution so getting the game from a torrent or peertopeer network is illegal however since a lot of these older games are not sold anymore one can make the legal argument that there is no market harm as no amount of money will be able to procure a legal copy of the game a company cannot claim lost sales for items it is not selling
gaming,removed,yes it is
gaming,removed,youre welcome
gaming,removed,no hes just an uppity bitch

gaming,removed,lumber island that special place download for free
gaming,removed,lots im providing nexus links but most or all of these should be available through other outlets magic rebalance mods these overhaul the magic system itself but often leave the spell lists and the rest of gameplay intact note that they generally arent compatible with each other or any mod that changes the perk or leveling system is probably yhe best of these totally changes how spell damage and mana usage scale to make powerful spells for more effective at higher levels the real issue with magic is it scales poorly so by late game combat can be incredibly long and frustrating this attempts to correct aht and is fairly good about it this does the same thing as the previous mod but in some different ways it might be worth it to compare or contrast this is the crazy option compeltely guts the system in skyrim and adds a completely new magic system based on mixing elemental properties with its own unique leveling structure personally not a fan but it can be a very powerful and fun toolkit if you want to invest the time in learning how it works new spells these mods attempt to add new magic into the game that provides additional flexibility generally speaking they do not modify existing spells or the leveling and scaling of existing spells they can be used in conjunction with each other or other types of mods without much issue this is the one everyone will recommend adds tons of new spells some powerful some goofy all unique been playing around with this lately works much like apoc but offers some different spells perk overhauls these completely change the perk and leveling system for the entire game that means crafting sneaking and smacking people in the head everything these are never compatible with anything else that modifies perks they often have compatibility patches for some mods do your homework before installing this is what i use rescales spell damage nicely adds fun perks that are better than does more damage and gives you really crazy new powers and abilities will work with any mod that adds new spells but not any mod that also changes the perk system known as skyre this is the granddaddy of em all this is a very popular overhaul that not only changes the perk system but rebalances every statistic in the entire game this is a bit of an undertaking and many other mods need compatibility patches to work with it by the maker of skyre but someone less crazy id say its the easier of the two to use but it does things somewhat differently than its predecessor these are just a few examples theres hundreds of mods out there i suggest a trip over to rskyrimmods and poke around enjoy

gaming,removed,its hard to tell what exactly would happen physiologically to tracer as she rewinds there are two possible scenarios that i can think of enter enternbsp enter enter anything that leaves tracers body like spit sweat blood would return to her body during a rewind enter enternbsp enter enter borb enter enternbsp enter enter everything that is expelled or removed from tracers body remains removed after a rewind but tracer returns to her initial physiological state enter enternbsp enter enter if situation were true then you could torture tracer pretty effectively you could always cut off any part of her body and force her to reset only to receive the same forms of brutality over and over again enter enternbsp enter enter if situation were true then you could have tracer donate nearly endless supplies of blood you could figure out how much blood you could take from her before she would pass out extract that quantity and then have her reset enter enternbsp enter enter also you could perform the torture described above and accumulate tracer parts for medical studies or just to have fun with imagine cutting off your arm rewinding and then putting it in your friends gym bag locker or desk drawer you could even leave it in an enemys car and call the cops on them good luck explaining a severed limb to the cops enter enternbsp enter enter regardless of whether the rewind is controlled via neurological pathways or outside technology you could also repeatedly remove some of her organs need a kidney tracers got you covered enter enternbsp enter enter but clearly the most interesting situations arise when you think about the kinky things you can do with this ability she could do asstomouth then rewind before any harmful microorganisms remained in her mouth throat etc enter enternbsp enter enter also could you get tracer pregnant if you came in a baster and then squirted it right in the area where tracers vagina will be when she rewinds if you were tracer you might have to be careful about that you never know what crazy people are just waiting with a baster at your rewind location

gaming,removed,i havent preordered a game since ffxii back on i dropped down like dollars for the collectors edition in the cool steel book case then i got home and played the game it wasnt necessarily bad the game grew on me and to this day i love it but at the time i feel like being a near broke high school senior with buyers remorse had a lot to do with my initial enjoyment of the game i can certainly afford games now but with the extreme cases of games being sold purposefully broken to leave their audiences hoping for expedient patches i like to wait about hours post release to find out from the community if something is broken or just plain awful
gaming,removed,maybe it could actually be released on pc that would be a good start

gaming,removed,true but theres an immediate reality check available generally speaking the people who eat at burger king have eaten at burger king before theyre more familiar with the actual product than the advertisement even if they hadnt eaten at bk before they could look at online reviews or even see the food that comes out before them otoh before nms released there was no other source of information than the official ones skewed in favor of the company for two years there was no way to check the devs claims against the reality of the product so once it finally came out there was years of hype that got dashed in a single day im not saying that fast foods arent sketchy im just saying theres a qualiative difference in advertising a product where you can immediately see the differences between the advertisement and product and usually get a refund pretty easily and advertising one where theres no way to get that reality check for years

gaming,removed,its not an emulator its the actual httpuzeboxorg hardware shrunk down to fit inside a snes controller along with all of the controller electronics all of the games that exist for it were programmed from scratch specifically for the avr microcontroller thats inside last year i wrote an original game from scratch called httpuzeboxorgwikiindexphptitlebugz for the uzebox it was pretty fun because the uzebox only has bytes of ram and it runs at mhz of which you get maybe of the cpu clocks for your game logic and about half the total ram i managed to fit an entire physicscollision engine that can run across entities into the available ram and it only uses clocks per frame for the game logic its written in c and the httpsgithubcomartcfoxbugz if youre curious actually all of the games written for the uzebox are open source so you can learn how any of them work under the hood

gaming,removed,practical explanation for example of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born i need every seconds detail that what what you have thought and done on every single second can you tell me every single detail of your cheapest minute or your whole hour day week month year or your whole life if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didnt forget your past and that you will not forget this present life in the future that is fact that supreme lord krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him there is also next life and i already proved you that no scientist no politician no socalled intelligent man in this world is able to understand this truth cuz they are imagining and you cannot imagine what is god who is god what is after life etc for example your father existed before your birth you cannot say that before your birth your father dont exists so you have to ask from mother who is my father and if she says this gentleman is your father then it is all right it is easy otherwise if you makes research who is my father go on searching for life youll never find your father now maybemaybe you will say that i will search my father from dna or i will prove it by photos or many other things which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my real father so you have to believe the authority who is that authority she is your mother you cannot claim of any photos dna or many other things without authority or ur mother if you will show dna photos and many other proofs from other women then your mother then what is use of those proofs same you have to follow real authority whatever you have spoken i accept it then there is no difficulty and you are accepted by devala narada vyasa and you are speaking yourself and later on all the acaryas have accepted then ill follow ill have to follow great personalities the same reason mother says this gentleman is my father thats all finish business where is the necessity of making research all authorities accept krsna the supreme personality of godhead you accept it then your searching after god is finished why should you waste your time all that is you need is to hear from authority same like mother and i heard this truth from authority srila prabhupada he is my spiritual master im not talking these all things from my own in this world no can be peace full this is all along fact cuz we all are suffering in this world problems which are disease old age death and birth after birth tell me are you really happy you cant be happy if you will ignore these main problem then still you will be forced by nature if you really want to be happy then follow these things which are no illicit sex no gambling no drugs no tea coffee no meateating no onion garlics thing is whatever you eat offer it to supreme lord krishna if you know it what is guru paramapara then offer them food not direct supreme lord krishna and main thing is you have to chant hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare if your not able to follow these things no illicit sex no gambling no drugs no meateating then dont worry but chanting of this holy name hare krishna mahamantra is veryvery and very important chant hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare and be happy if you still dont believe on me then chant any other name for mins and chant this holy name for mins and you will see effect i promise you it works and chanting at least rounds each round of beads of the hare krishna mahamantra daily here is no question of holy books quotes personal experiences faith or belief i accept that sometimes faith is also blind here is already practical explanation which already proved that else in this world is nothing more then busy foolish and totally idiot sources every is already blind in this world and if you will follow another blind then you both will fall in hole so try to follow that person who have spiritual eyes who can guide you on actual right path my authority guide is my spiritual master srila prabhupada if you want to see actual purpose of human life then see this link wwwasitiscom bookmark it read it complete i promise only readers of this book that they heshe will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world who im what will happen after this life what is best thing which will make human life perfect and what is perfection of human life purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz at present time doing thing which are sleeping eating sex fear purpose of human life is to become freed from birth after birth old age disease and death

gaming,removed,just ask the the search bar on thepiratebay personal advice if you are able and your is pc capable of running a virtual machine try the downloaded files in there first before destroying your computer
gaming,removed,webarchiveorg unblocks any website you want though functionality is limited and its near enough never on proxy lists because its a service
gaming,removed,really you re downloaded every day sounds like such a hassle we would just torrent portable copies of games and run them off of flash drives or throw a copy into a folder and pass the drive around the room for everyone to grab a copy if there was only one
gaming,removed,halo custom games is free right now on pc if you felt like playing again

gaming,removed,i kinda want to rape you who cares right
gaming,removed,well the easy way is becuase i know a few of the artists accounts genzoman did the mccree and knkl did the pharah but the easy way is to look at the art styles and how different they all are but the dead giveaway is that they all have different artists signatures on them
gaming,removed,how about this definition of sanctimonious little bitch you should look that one up also you should drown yourself
gaming,removed,to be fair she doesnt exactly look like that those are actually fake boos she made out of foam she has a while write up how to do it on her tumlbr also before any one gets pissy im not saying shes ugly or in bad shape but she did use a prosthetic to achieve those anime proportions

gaming,removed,siivagunner is a youtube channel that makes high quality rips the channel is very eccentric to say the least and is almost arg like except in dealing with cryptic video game and eceleb references sonic twitter started doing eggman and sonic voice recordings which they sent out to different youtubers praising them most of the time siiva being one of them
gaming,removed,okay i know im being a dick but since its grammar time to avoid ending a sentence with preposition i believe you should rephrase that to less marble on which to play grammar nazis correct me if im wrong
gaming,removed,im sure she wont regret that in years once shes gained and it looks really horribledated
gaming,removed,when is she starting her diet
gaming,removed,procedural generation should almost never be the source of your content a la skyrims or fallout radiant quest systems which isnt exactly the same thing as the procedural generation were talking about in this thread but you get the point instead procedural generation should provide a means to fill in the whitespace around the canvas artists should not necessarily need to place every art asset in a given environment certain assets should certainly be placed byhand players are fairly good at spotting errors when procedural generation doesnt go so well if i were an environment artist i would certainly be interested in a means to automate the placement of happy little bushes if the algorithm was smart enough about it for games like gta which have really great environments to explore you still run into some immersion breakers like the vast majority of doors on city streets being simple textures eg unopenable naturally the interiors of of the buildings in a game like gta are completely irrelevant to the plot of the game but this is where something like procedural generation could fill that white space given knowledge about the type of building it is residential business etc the building dimensions already known and where external windows and doors are already known the right algorithms could procedurally populate the interiors with various rooms furniture people and relevant behavior profiles etc all without direct artist involvement these could all be computed before release and stored as seeded values or computed realtime on the pcconsole obviously certain specialized structures like hospitals police stations etc would likely still need to be done byhand but the room for growth in the quality and complexity of the procedural generation algorithms is basically infinite hence all the funnerdy discussions about our reality being a part of a simulation so back to gta this would allow you to enter a much greater percentage of buildings if being chased on foot by police running inside to either hide try and escape or if desired do something more nefarious adds to the depth of the game by providing more environment to extend the plot into rambling at this point but i hope im presenting my thought ok i believe more games like nms are to come and they as well as most games in the future will make use of procedural generation where appropriate
gaming,removed,no mans sky just needs calibration
gaming,removed,couple of things you might find useful next time you find yourself on windows always use powershell instead of command line its just so much better and yes they aliased ls if youre on the newest windows and really missing bash check out httpsmsdnmicrosoftcomenuscommandlinewslabout it lets you run real linux binaries including gcc because its a linux subsystem for the kernel not an emulator or port

gaming,removed,gj first comment key please
gaming,removed,your girlfriend is fat and ugly
gaming,removed,that looks amazing but i actually think doing that is against the spirit of the game the bonfire is the only hope all undead have and so making mimics would ruin that thought
gaming,removed,to understand that comment its best to look at another comment he made he was making fun of other games having a sky thats just a filterlightbox and explained that in no mans sky they didnt do that they used actual lightrefraction physics one of their developers wanted a green sky so they went and created new elements on the periodic table that would have a green wavelength this isnt something he presented as thisd be cool to do this was something he talked about as a challenge they faced and overcame in development just worth keeping in mind when you wonder did he really lie about this maybe were misunderstanding

gaming,removed,unless they buffed it in the last year the tiger has been consistently a fairly shitty heavy the problem is that there really isnt a place for sniping heavies in the game heavies need to be front and center even the tiger p is better given its frontal armor the is nigh unbeatable when hull down which is easy if youre even a little bit competent and is by far the best heavy the is is a decent brawler and id take it over the tiger any day the oni is also quite powerful at that tier so yeah pretty much the only heavy that is worse than the tiger is the amx
gaming,removed,the problem isnt only that the game has lost players its also that school is just starting up for a ton of people also attributing to the loss of players with most of the play base being young adults it would be hard to imagine school starting not having an effect on player counts

gaming,removed,though your edit is correct the single player also has microtransactions i would draw an analogue between that and cosmetic microtransactions totalbiscuit and jim sterling put out videos with the release of overwatch detailing the presence of microtransactions in premium games totalbiscuit for and sterling against and they make fair points on both sides however i believe the industry has shown time and time again for example dead space and overwatchs summer games stuff that they will take advantage of the system when they allow it in dead space they slowed down progression in overwatch there are numerous problems with the system basically the industry just isnt trustworthy with microtransactions right now so their mere presence is widely considered a negative
gaming,removed,reading this thread reminds me of just how many people are oblivious to the fact that you can torrent any game in about mins
gaming,removed,telling people not to preorder order is just hitting your head against a wall at this point

gaming,removed,this torrent contains the digital ost sampler and the digital books a comic book a miniartbook and a novella that come with the day one edition of deus ex mankind divided this torrent has been uploaded in retaliation of the microtransactions present in the game along with other decisions that spoils an otherwise fantastic game hope you like it anonymous x

gaming,removed,lol what a pussy
gaming,removed,i wont spoil too much since you can look that all up if you really wanted to and despite being incomplete i still suggest playing through everything basically several story arcs start and end out of nowhere they are good but they dont feel like they are connected to the story they just kind of happen one of the arcs is never resolved because the mission that would have resolved it never got finished then there is a big dramatic mission which is honestly one of the best moments of any game ive ever played somewhere in my top ten it finally seems like the story is about to go somewhere suddenly you find yourself back to the beginning of the game yes you literally play through the games intro again the first time it was tense and terrifying the second time its just tedious because of how slow you move afterward the big twist is fully revealed ocelot tells big boss the plan to switch his identity with venom big boss rides off into the sunset venom snake is in front of a mirror having an identity crisis while listening to a recording that big boss left for him he basically tells venom that they are both the same people now and its up to venom to carry on his legacy while big boss goes off to build outer haven it all ties back to the song you hear when you wake up from the coma big boss is quite literally the man who sold the world venom walks away from the mirror now determined to continue doing his work it flashes to the title card ocelot and kaz have a conversation where they basically decide that they are enemies now because kaz feels betrayed by big boss for installing venom snake and leaving him behind and thats it tldr most of the major plot points after you defeat skull face got shoved into the game with little context or build up because they didnt have time to properly tie everything together the game that was supposed to explain why big boss became a villain instead big boss kind of randomly decides to be an ass and turn his back on everyone except ocelot while also completely destroying the identity of one of his most loyal soldiers you its not a bad ending its a rushed one where things kind of just happen and nothing makes a lot of sense because kojima didnt get the chance to explain it

gaming,removed,funny how you claim that ea battlefront is a battlefield game with a star wars skin even though battlefront is battlefield with a star wars skin on it both have instant action both have classes you pick mid game and upgrade later in the game both have vehicles you can get in and out of in game both let you play through sort of historical famous battles just saying
gaming,removed,theres a theory that the blob was controlling the kid the entire time trying to get him to help the blob escape this is strengthened when you watch the secret ending which reveals that the kid is another mindless puppet like the ones you encounter throughout the game

gaming,removed,average consumer doesnt hound onto the details as much as redditors do they keep hearing of a game that lets them explore what billions of planets and immediately get hyped a large part of them just assumes there will be stuff to doand naturally so personally id be pissed if all i could do in a game that large was to hunt and never run into any other playersthat would be dumb thats why i dont think its going to suck as other people do common sense says otherwise if they dont pull through and this game fails i will eat a roll of tissue paper someone do the remindme shit
gaming,removed,breath of the wild hunt looks amazing
gaming,removed,so people with pokemon go might be in danger fuck it feels so good to avoid something that is popular now
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,but that doesnt make sense such as how melee elitists were all against smash or how splatoon is seen as lacking in content or how miitome just died out in just a couple of days people are pretty critical of nintendo
gaming,removed,but where that highly upvoted psa that happens before telling people not to preorder

gaming,removed,both of these games still hold up against modern games i recently bought the valve complete pack and had an absolute blast playing them the controls are very intuitive the gameplay is fun the story is good the enemy and character design is great the graphics arent the best and the level design could be better in some places but they dont really detract much from the game
gaming,removed,xbox and may be cheaper but the price of games are insane not to mention this gen is only going to last years which is average but anyone who bought a to last them years are out of their minds even the xbox and didnt last that long and it was showing their age around the initial price for a pc is more expensive but you save a ton of money in the long run especially when it comes to games steam sales are ridiculous recent triple a games for less than pcs can last longer too as long as you dont be an idiot and downloadtorrent every link you see with gaming high end rigs are cheaper than ever before is still way too demanding even with a gtx mainly because most games are optimized for if youre lucky

gaming,removed,play it with some really good headphones on and it will suck you in until the last bloody kill
gaming,removed,i agree that youre an idiot
gaming,removed,the interactivity of video games makes it a more complex issue as youre not a passive watcher but an active participant if you were to say be able to role play a racist character in a game it raises interesting issues that simply watching or reading a racist character does not im not saying that means it should be censored simply that its impact is something worth discussing and considering many people on reddit simply try to shut down conversation with stop being pc which is really the other side of the same coin trying to shut down conversation because theyre offended and they often confuse criticism with censorship
gaming,removed,also racist
gaming,removed,its a lot harder for those journalists to make the argument of the devs being racist when the devs countered that argument of course im sure they will find a way
gaming,removed,no one probably wants to have a kid with you anyways stay forever alone
gaming,removed,pirate bay
gaming,removed,please source quote trump saying he wants to deport all muslims or that he doesnt care about them it has never been his positionhes never said anything remotely close to what you claim and youre doing a disservice to people spreading blatant lies

gaming,removed,nice bait for your chimp girlfriend i hope you wreck her pussy as hard as you got fucked here
gaming,removed,kill yourself
gaming,removed,thats just a list of things trump has done you dipshit its judging him on his actions also to be a but of a trump hipster i hated that fat dickhead since way before any of this before he even started running on the back of the central park thing and the birther thing even with just those two occurences its pretty obvious he is a racist dolt
gaming,removed,so glad this sjw game is massively flopping
gaming,removed,but every trump supporter is either racist or very very uneducated

gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,youre assuming the people making death threats give a shit about the game as near ad i can tell this started yesterday when a kotaku writer received a death threat for publishing the first unverifiable announcement of the delay that death threat fairly obviously not a serious one but a death threat nonetheless was sent by some fucking spergaloid noname youtuber who posts on the games subreddit ive checked their account history theyre probably obviously i wont name names but its not hard to backtrace them the kotaku writer posted a screenshot of the threat on his twitter im assuming that what happened next was or somethingawful or whatever group of trolls actively likes to make gamers look horrible cackled with glee and began to send death threats to the devs while masturbating and rubbing their own sexual juices into their neck andor legbeards
gaming,removed,its inspired in part by that game

gaming,removed,is there a comprehensive guide on how to run emulators and set them up with games
gaming,removed,nope this is the gameklip my product if youre interested i just put the gameklip on off sale for today first sale ever httpbuythegameklipcom
gaming,removed,how do you go about getting the emulator friendly versions of games
gaming,removed,the inability to prone was a design decision because snipers were so much more powerful than all other weapons an assault had almost no chance at getting more than one or two hits on a sniper even using a full clip of ammunition and because of the relatively high health had it was very problematic source read a dice developers comment in defending the decision when the game had first come out a lot of people were angry but it didnt stop this game from being my favorite fps ever
gaming,removed,mocap so on fleek that the main studio closed down and rockstar needed to take over
gaming,removed,is crap for this exact reason no prone fuck you this is not make fucking prone or go kill yourself is a piece of shit
gaming,removed,just like every battlefield game lol
gaming,removed,let me slow it down for you the op posted about playing the oregon train on the apple ii this comment said to play it on the gtx i said the apple ii was a better post on the fact of how important that computer is someone said no then i said that a gtx is way more important than one of the most important computers of our time since you are slow this is sarcasm does that help you or do i need to say it even dumber for you to comprehend this
gaming,removed,awesome trailer i hope the compaign will be that good
gaming,removed,this is the gameklip my product i put it on off sale today if youre interested first sale ever more info here httpbuythegameklipcom if i can answer any questions just lemme know

gaming,removed,so how did you do it will there be a guide coming
gaming,removed,expansion packs
gaming,removed,what is this from destiny battleborn i googled ghost but it didnt help much
gaming,removed,youre right if they arent in legal trouble they will most definitely be in financial trouble in the future sean murray has basically already been labeled a fraud so nobody is going to get any of their future games and possibly put hello games out of business if they dont make any profits still pretty amazing they are getting away with this they are practically ignoring any fan complaints
gaming,removed,watch this video please
gaming,removed,i havent tried it myself but i imagine the cable would work for the nexus as well youre welcome to purchase just the httpbuythegameklipcomproductswiredkitstandalone if youd like i would probably recommend using a wireless bluetooth controller made for android gaming though and maybe a stand for the tablet to sit on a desk the cable is just long enough to go from the back of the controller to the side of a phone i imagine itd be pretty cramped using it with a tablet as big as the nexus
gaming,removed,you fucking moron idiot you started angry before anyone else scroll up you are wrong daud did not train himself daud was taught how to be stealthy and then honed his skills the only thing daud taught himself was how to control his magic corvo was not chosen because of his situation he was chosen because of daud the outsider felt that there was no one strong enough to challenge him and started to grow bored therefore waited until someone with potential was wronged by him yes daud did indeed train some of the whalers but almost all of them were already skilled assassins before hand and billie lurk handled the majority of training as his second in command and sokolov did almost everything interesting in the dishonored universe he painted the portrait of delilah long before she was a witch he created almost all of the nations technology and defenses he stood in parliament for many decisions including those that created war he hales from tyvia and despises his own people and is one of the very few men to travel to pandyssia and leave alive to tell people to do real research when its painfully obvious you have very limited understanding of the lore is hilarious
gaming,removed,are the games on the app or do you get them somewhere else
gaming,removed,ive been searching for something like this but my tablet is an amazon fire would it still work with your product because if it does im totally instabuying it
gaming,removed,or a much more straightforward solution to the problem im having that ive successfully explained to everyone except a bunch of cucks who are still somehow managing to get in the vey ish get in the fucking robot nerds
gaming,removed,i miss mine too especially for the remote control deal it had
gaming,removed,niers soundtrack is glorious although the soundtracks for all of the castlevania games have been consistently amazing for the entire series except for lords of shadow i guess the songs may not be emotional charged or anything like that but theyre fucking httpsyoutubevrsnsdptlqq seriously i probably wouldnt have been able to tell was from a ds
gaming,removed,didnt that happen to the character based on ellen page in beyond i swear i remember someone getting sued over that
gaming,removed,battlefield
gaming,removed,it is and its intentionally that way to incentivize people to use the microtransactions for that reason alone i used a script to give myself a crapload of cash and i encourage everyone else to do the same you have to be really really blatantly cheating to get banned if you do it over a week or two in smallish increments its impossible that itll be noticed they kinda deserve it for not implementing some form of anticheat
gaming,removed,chuq noia most certainly a brazilian server source am brazilian know national memes
gaming,removed,have fun testing that
gaming,removed,fucking christ ghost was a beautiful work of art that no one should have the right to bash on if you dont like ghost then you should probably just bash yourself with whatever device you use to game
gaming,removed,its a magazine not a clip you heathen im talking about the series assault rifles lets see you take a hit to the face from a spartan and see if you live through more than one hit
gaming,removed,yeah i thought the source video that spawned that meme was just gonna be a joke then it just kept going and i just kept watching
gaming,removed,what is bafflefield
gaming,removed,you mean just mr lets not pretend women are the creative forces behind all these games we all know a woman would ruin the game
gaming,removed,definitely outlast have it on my steam library but im to afraid to launch it lol

gaming,removed,i second that only finished the tutorial so far and just got into the open world i was almost late going back to work also i think im supposed to say something about my first post
gaming,removed,the division is a good game running around little of a cover shooter but once in the dz dark zone good team work and tactics are good
gaming,removed,the original was an order for one of my clients you cand have a print with it if youd like or you can place a new order with anything you want d wwwalexmileacom here you can find my contacts
gaming,removed,disgaea and fft are console games tactics doesent even have a pc port saying that console games have controller support is calling water wet whining that pc native tactics games dont have controller support would be about as dumb as whining that fft didnt have mouse support on the
gaming,removed,i dont care if i own it on all platforms already give me more skyrim
gaming,removed,i done it the same way i do most games because its cheaper than buying games i cant play or upgrading the pc i almost always torrent the game see how it runs for a couple of hours check temps and all that jazz and if it runs stable ill pay it people can hate on pirating all they want but atm its the best form of demo
gaming,removed,first one was my all time favourite game i was so stoked to hear that catalyst would be releasing on my birthday then it got delayed and i got sad then ea forgot about it and delayed it again and now i have to wait another days because ea completely forgot that global releases are a thing so yeah after the mediocre reviews im probably going to keep an eye on piratebay as ill probably be able to play a pirated version before i can play a legit version
gaming,removed,if you were playing on pc then the frame rate is your machines fault a lot of the other things sound like personal opinion though i disagree with your comments on the combat and vehicle controls however i agree that the story is not good i didnt play the game for the story though i played it because it was like gta with more explosions
gaming,removed,i just hope they have arrow skins again this time with deathstroke and flash
gaming,removed,kill yourself
gaming,removed,yes literally today the post got found out and banned but there was a doritos showerthought that very suddenly got a bunch of upboats and was promptly taken down so while there is evidence that it happens there is also evidence that it isnt tolerated
gaming,removed,wow awesome

gaming,removed,the game is shit as expected
gaming,removed,what the fuck did you just fucking say about navy seal copypastas you little newfag ill have you know theyve ranked top out of all the comments on the internet and they have been translated in numerous contexts on and have over confirmed variants navy seal copypastas are trained in memetic warfare and are the top copypasta in the entire circlejerk arsenel you are nothing to them but just another target they will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this board mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit about navy seal copypastas over the internet think again fucker as we speak this copypasta is contacting its secret network of btards across the usa and your ip is being doxxed right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead kid navy seal copypastas can be anywhere anytime and they can confuse you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with madlib permutations not only are they extensively trained in trolling but they have access to the entire arsenal of anonymous and will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the internet you little shit if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot this copypasta will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it youre fucking dead kiddo
gaming,removed,yea
gaming,removed,i have been a fan of just cause for while and i should state that i understand that that is your opinion and i am just stating my owni agree with you on the story the story was boring and just a way to unlock more weapons and explosives although it was a big step up from the just cause story i never noticed the choppy frame rates maby that was just me or maby it was something to do with my card or drivers so i will not talk about that combat in my opinion was fun if you come at it with the right mind set i hated the gun play and though it was boring and so i never used them i just got creative and started tethering people together and to jets and to a number of other things and for me thats what really made the combat sick out for me so i would recommend you drop the guns and have fun causing chaos driving was terrible i agree but i think the developers never intended people to be driving to get to places and grappling and wingsuits were much faster and frankly more fun and as for the helicopter i think the same except that helicopter have a number of fun aspects like transporting tiny bikes to the top of mountians and other things like that all in all i think you came into this game with the wrong mindset and that you should have come in with one idea in mind and only oneto cause chaos and if you want a reason you already have one just cause

gaming,removed,reading ops comments throughout the thread i have no idea what he wants if you want a game where youre a hero youre bound to be special in some way then again if youve ever played arcanum the game starts out with you supposedly being the reincarnation of a great saviorchosen one but then it subverts the trope later and it turns out you were a random shmuck anyway not sure what your argument is you point out a trope but dont really give an alternative if the game isnt about saving the world then what are you looking for peasant simulator
gaming,removed,just cause great gameplay shitty story although driving is shitty too in this one

gaming,removed,youre a bunch of sick fucks i would never suggest removing a year old little girls clothes and licking her tiny body all over nibbling her neck and kissing her adorable little nipples only a heartless monster would think about her cute girlish mouth and tongue wrapped around a thick cock slick with her saliva pumping in and out of her mouth until it erupts the cum more than her little throat can swallow the idea of thick viscous semen overflowing dribbling down her chin over her flat chest her tiny hands scooping it all up and watching her suck it off her fingertips is just horrible youre all a bunch of sick perverts thinking of spreading her smooth slender thighs cock poised at the entrance to her pure tight virginal pussy and thrusting in deep as a whimper escapes her lips which are slippery with cum while her small body shudders from having her cherry taken in one quick stroke i am disgusted at how youd get even more excited as you lean over her listening to her quickening breath her girlish moans and gasps while you hasten your strokes her sweet pants warm and moist on your face and her flat chest shiny with a sheen of fresh sweat rising and falling rapidly to meet yours it is truly nasty how youd run your hands all over her tiny body while you violate her feeling her nipples hardening against your tongue as you lick her chest her neck and her armpits savoring the scent of her skin and sweat while she trembles from the stimulation and as she reaches her climax hearing her cry out softly as she has her first orgasm while that cock is buried impossibly deep inside her pulsing violently as an intense amount of hot cum spurts forth and floods through her freshlydeflowered pussy for the first time filling her womb only to spill out of her with a sickening squelch and as you lie atop her flushed body she murmurs breathlessly then her fingers dig into your back as she feels your cock hardening inside again

gaming,removed,what do consoles have to do with anything with this post thats such a lazy excuse for why games arent made complete or functioning when consoles were the primary means of games distribution for years and they were brilliant
gaming,removed,not only that but their dlc model is extremely gamer friendly compared to the other companies in this image bethesda cant write a story to save their lives anymore and give you horses for paid dlc dice has even worse story but their graphics are their only good selling point and bioware cant do story anymore either or have people forgotten mass effect

gaming,removed,only because nobody said it yet and its not reddit unless somebody complains how dare you repost this you repost bot
gaming,removed,iirc the reason why they did it was that due to some countries insane censorship laws it was illegal to have video games that allow you to kill children there australia i think is an example iirc fallout and removed children from their releases in that country or i think actually made them invisible lol
gaming,removed,if there was the opposite of gilding where i could you know ban someone or somethingmaybe have a midget drive to your house and punch you in the dick i dunno anywayif that was a thing i would pay for it every time i came across this dumb tiredass unfunny shit
gaming,removed,hopefully picture comes across ok
gaming,removed,lol xd
gaming,removed,why are you a damn elf
gaming,removed,has a steep skill ceiling it doesnt completely play like the others i say that because of two very different mechanics the titans and wall running titans add a very different element to the game you could be doing poorly but once you get a titan you could dominate if played correctly wall jumpingrunning is really where it gets hard through tricks youre able to keep a constant momentum going but it also punishes you for messing up yet its also noob friendly what i specifically mean by that is in cod there are killstreaks but if you suck then youre probably never going to get a massive killstreak in theres a resource that naturally increases over time you will always get your titan or boost equivalent to killstreak in a game
gaming,removed,theres a mod that lets you kill them for anyone who wants to
gaming,removed,thats quite a journey

gaming,removed,im pretty sure they dont code ai anymore they just link it to a neural network and then let it learn to play the game so its not really that fun anymore since they dont give the ai feedback from player enjoyment if you want a game with a truly fun ai to go up against try fear that is pretty much the pinnacle of fun ai to play against the fucking thing sets trap for you dynamically i once had about or enemies set up a trap to flush me out of cover with a grenade only to be waiting for me with shotguns to the left and right of me as i fled the explosion blew my fucking mind irl and then all over the walls in game they also do things like lure you by fleeing and position themselves into overlapping lines of fire the graphics fucking suck by todays standards but id still play it if i were given the chance

gaming,removed,spelunky or divinity original sin come to mind
gaming,removed,this is me im almost owned it since release and i only play single player an hour or out of habit and to relax i suck but cause i want my game to last an hour or two i hunker down build a wall or around me and build up a massive army before i run rampant over all the land ill occasionally do wonder or relic wins but its not often because i like the end game of obliterating the entire world basically i just do hardest difficulty largest map and max opponent and i keep everyone at enemy except one neighbor after ive killed them off i keep their market intact and wall offprotect a stream of trade carts between my and their remaining market to make money then sit back and build up a massive army gives me something to do while i listen to podcasts unwind read the news etc
gaming,removed,if thats the case i need to be playing tecmo super bowl right now instead of replying if it is really that easy could you maybe give me a good place to start my delve like i said videos showing the install configure seems fairly explanatory seems like you need a different emulator for each system but like i can find nothing with where romz are and whatnot maybe one of my coworkers can fill me in theyve talked about using em before
gaming,removed,just because youre a fatass it doesnt mean you should refer to yourself as a huge chunk
gaming,removed,why do people get so angry about prices of things if a price is too low the seller loses out on money if the price is too high the seller loses out on sales and has to store the thing hes selling for longer the seller doesnt get anything until he lowers the price to what people are willing to pay the value of something is what people are willing to pay for it if someone other than you is willing to pay then thats what it is worth to that person

gaming,removed,build a raspberry pie for the same price you can literally have the games and not to mention all of the other apps and programs protip raspberry on amazon micro sd cardstarts at raspberry pi power case for raspberry usb snes controllers on you need a sd card readermost laptops have these software that can format an sd cardfree software that can readwrite to sd cardfree retropiefree os minutes on google and you have thousands of games to play not hit me up if you have questions dont feed into the hype of this console
gaming,removed,emuparadisecom you download an emulator you download a rom or iso depending on what you are emulating you play the game
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,this is something that i think varies based on the individuals kids there are some really cool pi cases out there also based on the age of your kids it could be super fun to do this project together also these boards have hundreds of other uses including controller robotslightsspeakers etc
gaming,removed,if you look around there are tons of options for mobility for the pi including cases with small lcds that can be built similar to a game boy
gaming,removed,glenn dies motherfucker
gaming,removed,correct i built before this console came out and after the launch its even more clear that this option has more games more functionality and can do more down the road
gaming,removed,ill find a good one and link it shortly
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,i certainly see why you would say that my big gripe is the limitation in games they are probably going to make expansions with more games to get more money i currently have every nes snes game available for the retropie emulators so for me it just doesnt make sense anyone that has used a computer in the last years can build a raspberry pi install the os and be playing games in minutes
gaming,removed,everyone has a right to their opinion personally i dont feel bad about playing old games via emulators if i wanted to go out and buy a legit copy from a retail store most of the time i dont have an option for these specific games i would rather enjoy the game and have fun than give into price gouging collectors on ebaycraigslist this is just an option i didnt mention where to get the games or offer the files up myself
gaming,removed,the pi zero can be powered via usb also is a bit smaller you can also wire in batteries
gaming,removed,no soldering there are sd formatters and readerwriters for mac the only thing you need a computer for upfront is the software to formatwrite the sd card a sd card reader and the ability to download the operating systemretropie
gaming,removed,go to emuparadise for your roms to install games get an empty thumb drive and create a file called retropie plug it into the pi and leave for about minutes the pi will create subfiles for each emulator it has load roms from emuparadise into corresponding files nes roms into nes subfiles plug drive back into pi turn on pi marvel at how someone spent all this time setting up retropie just to give it away for free let me know if you have any troubles
gaming,removed,i honestly dont think it requires more than basic computer skills you are plugging in usb periphrials writing software to a sd cardone button and loading things via usb flash drive feel free to watch the video linked above its very simple
gaming,removed,the best controllers out there run around the dollar range for bluetooth models the best part of the pi though is its compatability for other controllers is my choice but if you want the feel of the old school controllers the set of snes controllers on amazon for isnt a bad deal
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,the controllers are optional if you have other consoles controllers work wired and bluetooth i mentioned this in a comment above i listed the snes controllers for people who want the snes experience the nintento option is sold out and retails for so without the controllers you are exactly at that price most modern laptops have a card reader if you dont i think the kits that include a usb card reader run around if you could get the nintendo version at retail you are still limited to games
gaming,removed,this is the kit i purchased when building my first raspberry pi if you notice this kit comes with some stuff i didnt mention hdmi cable this has a sd cardmore games this has heatsinksto keep the pi cooler this included the card reader for people without one in there personal computer you can scout the internet and get all of these cheaper but for a first timer this might be nice to have it all in one package
gaming,removed,ubisoft and the developers have both said the nda was only for the alpha theyve been telling people to streamupload clips
gaming,removed,the kit i purchased which is linked above this is what i did in order removed raspberry pi board from package the case is in three pieces place the board in the bottom clip piece into bottom take the double sided tap off heat sinks place on the cpumemorythey are sized appropriately the top just presses on and is easily removed place micro sd into card reader format the disk write retropie to disk slot micro sd into pi on a blank flash drive create a folder named retropie plug flash drive into pi plug into monitortv power up pi with supplied power supply this will get you to the basic retropie desktop the rest is different for everyone depending on what you want to do
gaming,removed,feel free to message me if you have any issues i would be happy to help
gaming,removed,i appreciate your feedback
gaming,removed,i had to delete my save and completely restart because of this luckily it was just in the tutorial my guy refused to jump after it reloaded
gaming,removed,the point is that they are sold out and people are selling them for hundreds of dollars on ebaycraigslist not once did i say this was identical nor did i say people had to buy it you can get rbp cases that look identical to the nes though as always appreciate your feedback
gaming,removed,controller is all you need ive also got an xbox one controller working keyboard is optional also as i said the snes controllers work fine from the ones i have tested and are only no reason to not by the unless size is an issue then go with the zero most people today have a spare flash drive its an option nothing more nothing less
gaming,removed,i think it is very simple if you do pull the trigger on one feel free to pm me with any questionsissues you have
gaming,removed,monitor
gaming,removed,id imagine your passengers love riding with you
gaming,removed,the point is that the nes classis isnt available anyone who says it requires a lot of time to setup a rbp with retropie just needs to be directed to the right information its not plug and plug but its not far off
gaming,removed,its very simple people just need to be pointed in the right direction its not plug and play but its not far off
gaming,removed,im not sure if its worth saying this again but the pi is an option for people who didnt get the nes classis in time and dont want to pay ridiculous prices for it

gaming,removed,i dont think its underestimating anything final fantasy vii just got a remake announced people have been saying square could print money with it but it wasnt until the last couple of years that it became a reality if thats the case for one of the biggest nostalgia franchises when those gamers were teenagers how big of a demand is there really you think for croc or whatever hell goldeneye got a fan remake before it even got considered for an official one and even then it was done at minimum cost im not saying constantly getting remakes of games we used to love wouldnt be awesome this isnt an argument against it it is strictly against viability i would love a sequel or remake of evo search for eden but nobody even knows that game except for the hardcore fans who just announced a fan translation of the prequel so ill settle for that
gaming,removed,dude i gave the source already that shows they said its not
gaming,removed,i thought they were called lorian elder prince and lothric younger prince but hes a magic user so he might be a faggot
gaming,removed,retropie is much sleeker than that load the games once click the game youre playing it from poweron to playing is maybe button presses no clunk at all
gaming,removed,absolutely taking down a titan in that game felt epic i miss that scale of battle
gaming,removed,contrishare
gaming,removed,someone has said this in my other post i have done the research on exactly what titles this covers but i will quote it in order for the ones who wish to research it it isnt piracy though after a certain period of time software and most other media becomes public domain and most of these emulators roms for old games are completely legal to download for free

gaming,removed,i cant speak on your specific year old but any child that can open a game on a smartphone has the ability to play games on a pi its literally boot select game system select game if you havent seen retropie i suggest going that direction for the simplicity

gaming,removed,suggest to you that you were brought to that article not because you were a member of that community but through an outside link so please respect the community by not distorting their voting scores
gaming,removed,i doubt your dad made anything bot accounts are killing reddit
gaming,removed,its definitely a bot account check their post history
gaming,removed,ohwell to be fair i didnt know that it seems like there needs to be a better way to identify spammers im not the kinda guy who likes to post a lot but that doesnt mean im a spammer im heavily active in various subs and the account existed long before my vids did also im not doing this for profit i dont ask for donations etc im doing this for entertainment and to entertain just like anybody who makes a picture hosts it on a party site and posts it on reddit what distinguishes me from them so much that i can be called a spammer
gaming,removed,hat last frame tho﻿
gaming,removed,you were linked to the rule the rules are easily found with a huge link underneath telling you to click for the detailed rules linked to the rule after the fact oh and the rule says posting and conversation thats worded badly and we cant fix it you stated yourself previously that this rule is vague in fact its not vague you just interpret it differently not taking any credit for the picture if that is the point then you would see i do not take credit in my post in fact i link to a specific point in the video which directly relates to the title it is no different to someone making and posting an image moreover if i were to post someone elses work this subreddit would shame me for taking credit there is a cultural assumption that a post is your own content if i look at the front page i dont see one post which anyone credits someone else it follows that this is their own content they are self promoting and should be removed ostensibly your standards are arbitrary and inconsistent
gaming,removed,do you really think that the people who pirated the game are going to answer that truthfully havent we learned anything about online surveys and
gaming,removed,used disc somewhere or torrent as far as i know it still works well on modern oss as well i just experienced linger load times for someone reason last time i loaded it up
gaming,removed,the rules are always there you just chose not to read them we had to link it to you to show what youre doing wrong once again let me remind you what you said the rule says posting and conversation thats worded badly and we cant fix it in fact its not vague you just interpret it differently prove it where does the rules say posts show me this isnt your arbitrary definition if that is the point then you would see i do not take credit in my post where do i say this if this was a gif i made would it have been removed because i made it what if i made it under an alias this is a moot point in any event i havent broken any rules you can point to it strikes me that you took a disliking to my post and found a reason to remove it
gaming,removed,probably the first time i played mario kart sounds lame i know but the graphics of the mario kart games have always been a bit below par for their time and console other mariothemed games released at the same time looked nicer but just wowed me with the level of detail in the graphics when compared to previous entries and this felt especially noticeable on the remake versions of old tracks i mean going from rainbow road on the to the remade version of the same track in was quite mindblowing i just love it when traditionally cartoony visual styles get that pixaresque level of detail put into them and id say that visually its by far the best looking mario game so far even better than the mainline titles in the franchise sure other consoles have done better but as a nintendo gamer ive reluctantly gotten used to lastgen graphics in games i otherwise still love but was one of their few modern games that looked totally currentgen to me

gaming,removed,i dont support wanna be gamegears or boys
gaming,removed,so is this your grandfather or uinjis
gaming,removed,yeah that is true now thatd a symptom of yearly releases though cs and css had thousands before the sequels of eachother were released consequently those games still have servers due to people spending enough time to be invested in communities or just not wanting to relearn plus hardware stuff too same can be said for battlefield games and even early quake or unreal still has active communities on pc with its dedicated servers but its only a few servers i guarantee that if the community wasnt split by new games and dlc than the games would still be thriving but that isnt lucrative at this point id pay for to get dedicated servers only thru the publisher at a high price as so many people loved that game to me it was fps perfection well that and css before orange box update
gaming,removed,i dont know why youre asking me when i said i havent used but i assume its either because they want to actually own the game and dont mind paying prices has to offer and maybe this just just me but id feel much more comfortable buying a product from an established website than downloading a random file from pirate bay that some schmuck couldve stuck anything into
gaming,removed,its just some cunts from a game

gaming,removed,spoiler tag cunt
gaming,removed,age gender female i started around and i do not know the exact reason why i started however everyone in my family played video games growing up so im sure that had something to do with it nintendo my reasons for participating in this subculture are the community some games have shitty player bases but they seem to be few and far between its good at passing time and i genuinely enjoy being able to visit endless worlds from the comfort of my couch yes but i do not follow any specific playerteam however i do watch some of the bigger call of duty tournaments held every couple of months imo i think that esports is obviously building its own unique fanbase considering the pc scene overshadows the console scene but i think this goes hand and hand with the popularity of console gaming in general if esports continues to grow at the rate it is currently going i do not see why console gaming wouldnt follow the same trend i think that gaming in general is mainstream i wouldnt necessarily pinpoint console gaming as the only mainstream community with the rise of mobile gaming and the pc community constantly expanding it is hard to ignore such a large crowd of players the reason i believe gaming is so popular with that age group is the simple fact that it is so easy to socialize over these devices nowadays the social aspect of gaming seems to be the most important part i know a lot of people within that age group that strictly buy games for multiplayer alone and just ignore the single player all together

gaming,removed,free to play starting today sign up here
gaming,removed,because now that trumps president we know he will launch nukes today
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,but clinton lost
gaming,removed,this doesnt quite make sense since hillary lost
gaming,removed,was actually a greater possibility had clinton won
gaming,removed,clinton didnt win so he wont be knocking anytime soon
gaming,removed,keep that smug attitude left this is the year that the scare tactics and social bullying of the left officially stopped working people dont need an ethics police anymore to tell them whats right and whats wrong its a good day and the start of something better more akin to coming out of the vault and finding that the world didnt end after all
gaming,removed,no that would have been if hillary was elected since she wanted to be needlessly hostile against russia thank god
gaming,removed,i wouldve preferred clinton but shes the one sabrerattling with russia
gaming,removed,not starting a nuclear war and being a saint are different no
gaming,removed,hillary lost so keep on waiting
gaming,removed,so russia immediately congratulates him on winning this morning and announces russias cooperation to repair relations and you think were going to war why i know they brainwashed the usa but this is a symptom of stockholm syndrome
gaming,removed,thanks for posting the game title op just like the rules say
gaming,removed,its a good thing russia immediately thanked the current president elect and theyre looking forward to reset the icy relationships between the two superpowers but hey gotta keep that insulated rpolitics hivemind growing faster into rgaming
gaming,removed,but clinton lost im confused op do you follow world politics at all
gaming,removed,no hilary didnt win
gaming,removed,man yall really are indoctrinated its hillary that wanted war why do you still think trump would cause this hell russia declared today that it is fully ready to restore relations
gaming,removed,trump is planning on normalizing relations with the country that has even more nukes than we do hillary planned on creating a noflyzone where russian planes might have been shot down vaulttec is going to go bankrupt
gaming,removed,i mean seriously hillary was the one pushing for war with russia this kind of uneducated political commentary especially in a video game subreddit is pathetic
gaming,removed,dont worry lad hillarys war with russia has been stopped for now
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,political commentary can also be a joke fyi
gaming,removed,but clinton didnt win why do you waiting him
gaming,removed,me too me too
gaming,removed,youre in the wrong timeline hillary didnt get elected so theres going to be no with russia which enforcing a syria no fly zone would cause while russian planes are flying there and threatening cyberwarmilitary response to the kremlin for dnc it staffer seth richs leaks to wikileaks sorry about interfering with the circlejerk though
gaming,removed,the original is from psn and the kid called the other one a nigger not a faggot
gaming,removed,now that hillary is out were safe
gaming,removed,hillary was the one that wants to go to war with russia not trump
gaming,removed,i dont understand hillary lost
gaming,removed,why is killary toppling another regime
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,but hillary lost
gaming,removed,putin has just said he is willing to create ties with the us again trump has settled the situation far greater than clinton would i think libtards are in denial about how bad clinton and her foreign policy was it has just become trendy to hate trump read up on some politics
gaming,removed,how come trump is the one that wants to work with russia not war with them you have it backwards
gaming,removed,no hillary lost didnt you hear
gaming,removed,sorry werent we talking about not getting nuked here pretty awesome how fast you guys change course and throw the term nazi around any time your proven wrong
gaming,removed,fallout he shows up at your house minutes before a nuclear detonation kind of wrong though since trump is the one supporting usrussia relations and hillary wanted the opposite
gaming,removed,yeah hillary lost and putin wants to amend ties with the us so who would nuke us
gaming,removed,but hillary was the one pushing for war with russia can you explain this joke to me
gaming,removed,again in was talking about not being nuked not your le epic nazirussia strawman
gaming,removed,are left wing salty sore loser tears spreading to rgaming its already getting really old but your salty tears taste really good so keep on crying and i will keep on drinking them because they rejuvenate me mmmmmmm so good
gaming,removed,but hillary lost
gaming,removed,thatd be if hillary was elected dumbass
gaming,removed,except trump is the one who has talked about restoring relations with russia instead of going after them like hillary clinton has said she would do
gaming,removed,nah trump will make us and russia buddies again
gaming,removed,wasnt this the case if hillary won
gaming,removed,everyone should have nukes wrong if japan had that nuclear threat im not sure that would be a bad thing for us is a far cry from everyone should have nukes stop it with the lazy straw man us should leave nato wrong so trump has clearly outlined changes he would like to see made to nato and he has said that under a trump administration the us might no longer be a part of the alliance if it isnt restructured and other nations dont start to pick up more of the costs but even that isnt the same thing as saying that we should pull out of nato as clinton claims trump said please dont start on non related positions like cfcs and climate change which is caused in large part by china btw
gaming,removed,so we agree were instituting a policy of not being nuked good glad i got through to you
gaming,removed,the amount of people that think trump wants a war is too damn high its hilary who kept threatening russia and treating them like shit and trump wants to work with russia to relieve the tensions that obama started you really need to learn the facts and not what you watch on cnn
gaming,removed,this game is amazimg
gaming,removed,north korea is a joke as theyve been for years and allying with russia makes them even less likely to fuck with us
gaming,removed,at least we wont be going to war with russia with president trump hillary clinton obviously harbors a hate for russia by scapegoating all of her shortcomings on russian hackers
gaming,removed,i mean thats what i heard dont take my word for it xd
gaming,removed,one candidate has opposed every single war one candidate wanted to escalate syria and have a dick measuring competition with russia guess who won now stop being so melodramatic
gaming,removed,well lucky it wont be happening because of peace with russia
gaming,removed,no shitthis picture read my mind
gaming,removed,whew looks like we avoided the russian missile threat for now
gaming,removed,hillary lost she was the one wanting to start war with russia
gaming,removed,but was just averted dont you know
gaming,removed,hillary wasnt elected though putin just announced he wishes to restore full relations between the us and russia
gaming,removed,do you seriously not understand why he won its because clinton wants a no fly zone in syria a clinton victory would have had this guy shoe up at your door
gaming,removed,lmao lose harder fuckfags
gaming,removed,fuck off libtard
gaming,removed,tut tut trump won not clinton no war with russia today
gaming,removed,hilary got trumped
gaming,removed,russia is committed to fix relations with trump if hillary would have won this would have been more accurate
gaming,removed,id only expect this if hillary won good things she never had a chance
gaming,removed,why hillary provoking russia was the only pertinent nuclear threat
gaming,removed,actually you shouldnt it was hilary who wanted a nofly zone over syria that would have involve troops on the ground and could have easily escalated into thermonuclear war with russia trump on the other hand wants to keep relations with russia amicable dont haaaaaaate meeeeeeeeeeee
gaming,removed,good thing im not conservative and i voted for obama sorry you got mad
gaming,removed,enjoy
gaming,removed,well i mean this post is political im sure you can answer that yourself haha

gaming,removed,uh no its true
gaming,removed,i find it funny that everyone is saying we need fallout shelters now that trump is president even though russia wants to descalate tensions between them and the us and put in has just stated that he is willing to talk this through with obama and trump to avoid war

gaming,removed,you forgot to post the user rating there buddy professional reviewers get influenced by hype much and are afraid to criticize triple a games out of fear of getting boycotted most people who arent jaded internet dwellers loved it user score is
gaming,removed,well if skyrim is any indicator youll be unlikely to find it below for years id just torrent the game to give it a go since they dont do demos any more another gripe i have is that a lot of facets of the settler and settlement system are never explained anyway

gaming,removed,as a big fan of christina grimmie i thought id take this opportunity to share something that i hold dear hopefully this will be upvoted enough to be seen christina was a old youtube singer and was featured on the voice as some of you may have heard she was murdered this past weekend in a senseless act of violence christina was a huge fan of zelda her youtube channel name even being a changeorg petition was started to ask nintendo to include christina as a small easter egg in this upcoming zelda game it would mean the world to us fans her family and christina herself if she were still with us if we were all able to make this happen link

gaming,removed,sometimes they are not so helpful or humorous hi there here how you doing this day you bout to reeee you i gifted legion to my friend and its been about minutes alrighty lets take a look ok to start off could i get your account email as well as your first and last name please you the battlenet page finally said it was gifted but the transaction history still says order status queued you thanks whats the email for the account you my account thank you several minutes pass you my tendies are gettin cold over here ok looking over the order details i see that it is queued that means basically that the purchase transaction is not complete yet just waiting on the last bit of authorization through the banks once its done though your friend will get the email you you think there will be a new expansion out by then nah at most it will be a day or so you can you hold on you a minute whats up you i was gonna wait for the transaction to go through before buying the game for myself you but my friend said purchases are instant you so my bank seems to be releasing the funds you cuz i just bought it and it was intsant you from what ive read on the internet in the meantime it seems to just be gifting that takes forever so i have to imagine its on blizzards end credit card purchases actually go through several checks as there are various financial institutions involved with the payment process in short the queued status means the funds havent reached here yet as soon as its done though your friend will get the email you i dont get how you sending the game code to be retrieved by email and me buying the game are any different from the banks perspective with the order queued its out of our hands still just need to hold on til it finishes if finished that would be something id be able to have some control over you so basically there is no way we can play tonight it very well could finish tonight but i dont have any guarantees though id give it about a day you does me having changed my password today put any sort of security check on my account for gifting nope updating the password would not have a negative impact on the purchase its not a check on blizzards side since the funds havent arrived yet you perhaps you should change battlenets inventory system so i can instantly purchase a copy of the game and then gift it to people rather than whatever sort of system is currently in place that is causing these waits you like valve you oooooooooooo anything else you needed you ooooosh you that hurt bad i bet night the representative has closed this chat session

gaming,removed,halo minigames have entailed some of the most fun ive ever had in video games
gaming,removed,my friend and i discussed this idea yesterday and i found it very humorous so i ended up making it into a comic my other artwork can be found here httpswwwfacebookcomsagehasnomeme
gaming,removed,nah i think that romeo and juliet is a play written by william shakespeare which is set in verona italy in since then there have been many adapted plays and movies like the famous baz luhrmann movie in this essay will show how shakespeare entertains his audience through his use of character language and drama romeo has to face the fact that he has married a capulet and tybalt is hunting romeo down to fight because romeo snuck into the party the purpose of the humour at the beginning of the scene is to entertain the audience when he enters the tavern and says god send me no need of thee and by the operation of the second cup draws him on his drawer when indeed there is no need it can be argued that mercutio is making fun of tybalt by saying he is fake manly like getting drunk and going into a fight mercutio is there to put some humour into to the scene too so it does not get too gloomy tybalt wants revenge on romeo because he showed up at the capulets party tybalt wanted to throw romeo out but lord capulet stopped him and let him stay then lady capulet got angry at lord capulet for yelling at tybalt so he wants to earn his honour back by killing romeo boy this shall not excuse the injuries that thou hast done me therefore turn and draw romeo does not want to fight tybalt because he is tybalts kingsman because he married juliet tybalt does not know that so he wants to fight romeo becomes enraged when mercutio dies and wants revenge on tybalt they fight and romeo kills tybalt romeo becomes very sad and when he becomes very sad his anger comes out so he kills tybalt when benvolio tells romeo that mercutio is dead romeo says this days black fate on more days doth depend this but begins the woe others must end this means that romeo fears that the evil outcomes of the violence of mercutios death lies in the future this foreshadows the end of the play when romeo and juliet die when tybalt wants to fight romeo who declined mercutio fights in romeos place romeo tries to stop him by pushing away tybalt comes in and stabs mercutio under romeos arm when mercutio finally realizes he is dying he says ask for me tomorrow and you should find me a grave man the word grave creates the pun it could mean that romeo will find him to be a serious man tomorrow or that he will find that he is dead and in a grave tomorrow the scene ends with the nurse telling juliet that romeo is banished from verona and that he will never come back if he does he will have to sneak back undercover the nurse tries to persuade juliet to go and marry paris and that he is a lovely gentleman or romeo if he is as good as paris romeo does not live in verona anymore and juliet will not get to enjoy him when the nurse leaves juliet talks about the nurse behind her back because she does not agree with what she said juliet and the nurse have a good relationship because the nurse acts as her mother from when she was a baby the nurse acts in a motherly way with juliet in act scene juliet tries to convince romeo that the birdcalls they hear are from the nightingale a night bird rather than from the lark a morning bird romeo has to leave before morning comes or be put to death juliet says the light is from a meteor rather than the sun this explains that juliet wants romeo to stay but romeo says he needs to be gone before dawn or he is dead juliet does not treat her mother as a mother she was never there for her it was always the nurse since she was a baby she treats the nurse more like a mother than her actual mother dramatic irony is shown when lady capulet comes into juliets room finding her crying at the balcony lady capulet thinks juliet is still crying about tybalts death when in reality she is crying about romeo leaving this is dramatic irony because lady capulet thinks juliet is crying about tybalt instead of something else the audience know who juliet is crying about but a character in the play does not an example of romeos use of metaphors is in this quote which compares night and day to happiness and sorrow some say the lark makes sweet division this doth not so for she divideth us this means that the lark does not make a couple come together but divides them juliet symbolises light because she can be out in the day in verona but romeo cannot because he can die romeo is the dark so the dark foreshadows their death because romeo goes to see juliet at the wrong time when she is faking death so he goes to buy poison to suicide right beside her juliet wakes up at the same time as when romeo suicides so she takes the sword off of romeo and kills herself too basically romeo is the one to blame the death of both of them this essay looked at how action character and language was shown in two scenes in the play romeo and juliet to entertain an audience now we know that tybalt wanted to kill romeo because he made tybalt look bad in front of everyone and to get his honour back he wanted to kill romeo i did not like the play as i am not a fan of plays and the genre of romance the message of the play is that if you love someone very much you do not mind killing yourself when they are dead to be with them for the rest of eternity

gaming,removed,you probably want dragon age then mass effect npcs more or less fight on their own with minimal support for the main character ive only played dragon ageorigins the first one so im not entirely sure if the system carries over to the later games you get access to i think different npcs you can tweak the way they level but there is one damage mage one heal and support mage some frontline fighters and some thief type fighters i think the damage mage could buff your weapons and i think the support mage could buff your stats i dont remember if the others had buffs they all fight differently but you have to be careful on how you set them up without guidance they can just wander into the middle of a nasty group the game allows you to let your companions do their own thing but it also allows you to directly control them as well if you need to

gaming,removed,just because theyre words said over the internet doesnt mean they dont effect the person as if they were spoken to their face affect thats precisely the point theyre trying to get a rise out of you try not to let them thats literally the only thing you can do about it when you come here and cry about it in a reddit effortpost what that tells me is that youre easily trolled and vindicate the efforts of people trying to get a rise out of you which is precisely why people like me do it because its amusing im getting half a chubby just reading through your post and imagining how distraught all this is making you its pleasing to me to get others to feel something so visceral like burning ants with a magnifying glass take the troll bait and get trolled hard dont take the troll bait and get trolled hard but less often

gaming,removed,a sensible approach to the modern game market rule dont preorder shit rule dont buy into hype rule dont trust developers promises when a game comes out step wait for the community to get a feel for it read reviews comments on reddit youtube game forums etc step watch raw game play footage edited game play may be fun to watch but youre not getting the full story step still on the edge torrent the gameif you can play for minutes dont like it delete the files remember piracy is bad consider this a demo like they did on older games step buy the game if you torrented the game to test delete the files this is how ive avoided disappointing game purchases for the last few years when everyone is hyping a game up i am the pessimist who says its not going to live up to hype hasnt really proved me wrong yet

gaming,removed,i think the right comparison would be getting slapped constantly by a baby as opposed to not being slapped for long periods of time and then getting sucker punched by mike tyson i prefer to lock witcher at on my pc and get even gameplay than lowering my graphics and deal with jumping from to fps i find fps drops more annoying than just locking it at at least that way the image is smooth constant is still my pc isnt really good though

gaming,removed,and then they make you pay for more maps that were already done or actively taken out of the game before launch wouldnt you say that the game would be incomplete like i said in my original comment if it is good enough to stand on its own youre getting a full game maps that were already done or actively taken out of the game before launch source on them being done before launch
gaming,removed,youre locked out of servers that use the dlc which is of them
gaming,removed,rip gamefan and their excellent graphic layout super cool editor avatars and superbly informative reviews and that very special issue i got with the hilariously incoherent racist rants on some of my favorite games
gaming,removed,for me its the fact that the company has created some of the best cod games and now they are just reproducing this shit with a remastered mw to sell more copies instead of just coming up with new concepts rather than shoving shit down peoples throats compared to gently placing shit down peoples throats
gaming,removed,if youre an autist
gaming,removed,steam had it available for purchase last time i checked which was probably years ago at this point but i dont think ea did it so it may have been taken down by now if i had to guess origin might have it available because thats eas digital download platform unfortunately i dont have any direct links for you off the top of my head but id say check out steamorigin if that doesnt pan out and youre dying to play this game and willing to compromise your values there are dl links and torrents for it everywhere i ended up torrenting it about a year ago because i was dying to play it and my rationale was that i purchased it physically for the pc back when it was first released the torrent was just as stable and fun as my purchased version was

gaming,removed,i dont want your attention good or bad troll op looking for tissues after being trolled herself lol trolling because female is pretty lame though people should troll people for better reasons like being black of jewish or something
gaming,removed,whats sad to realise is that this is generally how groups of males organize themselves i realise there are a lot of female gamers but i think its fair to say that competitive gaming is male dominated alphas spitting on the outsiders while the majority are silent stepping into such groups as a woman makes you the easiest read most different target but in the absence of a woman the negetive attention typically shifts to the next most effeminate person i guess what im saying is training men not to harrass women is like treating a symptom some people need real large scale help that they dont get from society
gaming,removed,this is what originally turned people on to the the pirate bay lack of demo games that we used to have to try things out

gaming,removed,im a female moba player and i can definitely relate to this bullshit they get so salty and aggro because realistically society declared the sterotype is too strong to ignore ooo all girls are shit at games people treat their games like like its their baby and when they lose to a sex thats generally looked at as lower on the totem pole you know theyll get automatically triggered andor start asking for nudes there is like only ever man that will act like a respectable person and not get in your pants andor beat you to death over a game because its probably the only thing they have left of their dignity

gaming,removed,the peasant hatred downvotes are real
gaming,removed,do not buy gaming headsets why youre wasting your money edit to those of you saying my headphone mic suggestions are lacking and are suggesting alternatives i am now in charge of the headphone wiki for this subreddit and will slowly be updating and reviving it if you have any suggestions or information for headphones microphones at different price points pm me with the subject if you wish to help out edit a toplevel edit was necessary for this as the visibility is important those of you who think is better than stereo are naive and dont know how sound works on the human ears youre effectively preaching the same the human eye cant see more than rhetoric just like the peasants you mock our brains perceive the direction of sound based on the delay at which each of our ears receive the sound if a sound reaches out left ear faster than our right ear we will perceive it coming from our left sound travels in waves and these waves will hit one ear before the other or else it will sound like either its all around you or in your head depending on house close the source is the same effect can be achieved with what are called httpsenwikipediaorgwikibinauralrecording the sound will reach one ear slightly earlier than the other and this will create the depth and direction we hear in our daytoday lives physical as well as simulated surround simply attempt to recreate this effect simulated surround increases the reverb of your sound adding in delays in post in an attempt to recreate this effect this ends up sounding rather awful and is the reason why headsets with virtual surround always sound more distant and roomy compared to traditional headphones with physical surround the effect of sound around you is created by using multiple speakers simply because the drivers have to sit so far away from you the sound wont reach one ear before the other in a way that matters because the distance the sound from the speaker travels is typically too far and the sound waves from the speakers spread out and bounce around the room the only way you could even remotely simulate a binaural experience with standard speakers is by placing them against each of your ears thats why and surround sound speakers sit so far away statistically speaking gaming headsets are not worth their sticker price and your moneys better spent elsewhere heres why gaming headsets typically market themselves as having a true surround sound experience whether or not this is something youre after its not worth the price of admission and oftentimes is simply worse than a good pair of balanced stereo headphones dolby digital as is the most common is simply a simulation using the two sometimes angled drivers in each cup on your headphones there are some headphones with more than two drivers but more than two for spacial sound is simply unnecessary given the fact we only have two ears its more or less unnecessary to have more than one driver for each ear and the simulated sound of spacial audio is mediocre at best in most if not a majority of cases decent audio hardware can be purchased for relatively cheap hardware that outperforms gaming peripherals in every category except wireless wireless headsets have a whole slew of their own issues that i will not cover in this piece this will result in better cheaper and longerlasting hardware that is not only good for gaming but also music content creation and consumption and whatever else youd use a good pair of cans and optional mic for below ill list a few examples of configurations that come in at the same or cheaper price points than their counterpart gaming headsets you could buy or you could buy or you could buy or you could buy or these are just a few examples of configurations you could buy for more you could even buy something like a pair of sennheiser headphones an antlion modmic the additional cost of gaming peripherals and in this case headsets are often from their marketing as well as the extra flair rgb lighting surround et cetera being a part of the pc master race is about choice so dont let headset manufacturers take away yours

gaming,removed,are the mods even enforcing this the mods here are terrible mods if youre reading this youre shit
gaming,removed,im and im just here to say that weight isnt an inherent indicator of body type i had a friend who was considered overweight and was even over the weight requirements to join the navy because he had too much muscle kid probably had like body fat on him dont be so quick to judge and maybe try being less of an asshole to people
gaming,removed,this is honestly a favorite game of mine my only complaint is that it looses its novelty after a while i didnt feel pressured to keep playing
gaming,removed,a lot of them are released by the developers in interviews or whatever others are unlocked through various means and then usually put online for the lazy people to use
gaming,removed,they are racist as fuck they wont buy an american console ever
gaming,removed,went to japan for months they just tolerate you but they will never accept you in their community
gaming,removed,grabs popcorn this will be good click ohh yeah that was glorious
gaming,removed,i think they explode when something walks over the they can be autocast enabled so that proximity triggers them but i dont believe its on by default i think it was also added in a patch
gaming,removed,why on earth wont this sub put this as a fucking rule in the sidebar i know what game this is but its rare for me i know many others get frustrated were practically fucking begging the mods to make a simple change and then enforce it why cant they do this so fucking frustrating at least more people are posting with their titles but come on make it a fucking rule already
gaming,removed,the real life suicide button
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,note to companies dont hire these freaks
gaming,removed,i learned from my buddy from high school who ive been playing with since original starcraft when it came out i beat him once then he took it to another level he just practiced and practiced and read strategies and watched his replays hes the one that helped me get to diamond hed watch my replays and explain what im doing wrong and how to improve for a while we were playing hours a day like we were training for a marathon i improved so much under him he was at masters last i knew but the whole time i was always reminded how horrible i was every now and then id say lets do a you sure laugh sure and every time id get massacred completely and thoroughly massacred i never was under any impression that i was good i was better than a lot but i never felt like i was a skilled player knowing how quickly and easily hed defeat me anytime i felt up to it and i new he wasnt even the best either hed lose just as much as me online the guy who i knew id never even be a challenge against was still just another of many many players players you cant even call pro except in the context of casual gamers
gaming,removed,and this is why i dont want this game the hype is too real
gaming,removed,with denise there she got ass
gaming,removed,dont suppose anyone ever played red card
gaming,removed,paper mario is so underrated
gaming,removed,dae childhood
gaming,removed,yeah well her replacement pose is literally one
gaming,removed,allah oo akbar
gaming,removed,rip hodor
gaming,removed,the only game where snipers are running around in melee range trying kill each other through hipfiring and players with assault rifles are camping in the back taking long shots
gaming,removed,sounds so violent now we just call it a hug
gaming,removed,it doesnt really matter because steam is still definitely defying australian consmer rights but anyway what if a person spends that many hours just trying to fix the issue or they reach a bug that makes the game impossible to progress andor play i personally spent ten hours with the game running optimising dark souls and xcom on my craptop only to find out that their fps couldnt be improved enough to make the game playable that prohibited me from getting discounts that i rightfull should have i have successfully optimised and fixed other games with programs and such in the past though eg hyperdimension neptunia and spore battlefield my point is that its way too unreliable of a measurement
gaming,removed,long time love of butts like tina
gaming,removed,lesson learned never hire trannies or other psycholigically troubled people
gaming,removed,why does every cunt spell paid payed now
gaming,removed,this person looks like theyve never played a firstpersonshooter before no you are the moron and its very obvious youve never played a video game with anyone outside of your internet hug box if by not catered to me you mean not having competent employees who are experienced with the things they are reviewingshowcasing they bloody well should cater to me again youre not getting this maybe because youre retarded or something their job isnt to sell you on the game their job is to just show it period plan to show it as well as they can thats bias thats bad though im sure you would rather have reviewers who like the things you like as much as you do reviewing them because as weve established you need your little autistic hugbox circle jerk to keep your petty childlike emotions in check
gaming,removed,maybe it was an arrow to the knee
gaming,removed,for the last years i keep saying to myself im not buying cod but i always end buying it but this year im def not buying it

gaming,removed,thats amazing id definitely buy one
gaming,removed,definitely blood dragon

gaming,removed,this wasnt a bayonetta situation the game wouldve been made regardless the publisher is square enix here is a quote from a square enix representative that explains why they made the decision i hope fans know that it wasnt an easy decision rogers said i think any sort of partnership at this level is a decision that took a long time for us to get to the decision at a studio level we took very very seriously we knew it would in the shortterm disappoint fans according to rogers microsofts passion and commitment to the franchise are a few of the reasons that lead to this deal having a great deal of spotlight on the game is another reason according to rogers – referring to how exclusive titles get featured heavily in marketing and promotion were about growing our ip this is a longterm decision were going to take tomb raider up to the next level he added with microsofts belief passion and sort of muscle to help us deliver we really think this is going to be an awesome game that people will enjoy for years and years to come

gaming,removed,do what
gaming,removed,if anybody asks me so hows school going i feel like this gif is an appropriate summarization
gaming,removed,oh boy german here the censorship sucks and basically any german gamer will agree with you but this doesnt mean that were trying to forget history but simply that our laws a slow and nonadaptive the main intention iswas to prevent the use of these symbols by nazis or other forbidden organizations within the country the problem for games is that they are not recognized as art yet in terms of the law as there is a paragraph that states shall not apply if the propaganda materials or the act is meant to serve civil education to avert unconstitutional movements to promote art or science research or teaching the reporting about current or historical events or similar purposes so if a developer would be willing to fight in court on this basis they might have a chance to create a precedence case it should also be mentioned is that devs often practice primarily censorship so some changes might not be actually needed and the other stuff is just butthurt old people sitting at the usk not understanding video games or art in general and thus thinking its okay to censor you have that in your country too tldr it sucks we know

gaming,removed,well the berserk game thats about to come out fairly soon will have my number one most uncomfortable moment in it great manga and anime hope the game is good
gaming,removed,depends on what you expect out of it yes buying a high end rig is more expensive off the bat but if you wanted to that could easily last years honestly i think thats actually cheaper than buying average and upgrading to the new average every year youre vastly overestimating in most cases the changes one year will give you in hardware performance maxwell to pascal type changes every once in a while aside if you buy a rig with a now lets say thats slightly more than a and pro would even out honestly with steam sales and gmg vs how much console games consistently cost you could prob play games years from now on medium settings at which is roughly what consoles run now usually except we play at fps consistently and will look much better leading up to that year mark if you dont mind dipping to like consoles do quite frequently that thing will run until it breaks plus now you dont need a computer which everyone has already and usually upgrades every few years anyway bonus
gaming,removed,to be honest i havent found anyone talking about this yet and i didnt feel comfortable bringing politics into a gaming sub but yeah i do wonder what will happen at least in britain will we still have to wait for eu release will we pay more to import it or will we get game searlier as we dont need them translated into the european languages and just port it straight from america

gaming,removed,i wrote an essay on this but decided to erase and try a different approach i dont really like survival that much either its a stale genre but if i were you id get it from gamestop or somewhere of the sort where you can take it backwithin days if you dont like it but get it and try it for yourself all i can say to do it justice is that its the first time in a long time i got lost in a game its lonely but in a good way that as well as the music and being in space makes it feel like metroid prime mixed with minecraft or something haha i feel like im an explorer and archeologist uncovering amazing new finds haha idk id recommend it and i dont usually like to do that cause people have different tastes give it a shot if you end up getting it id like to hear your opinion on it

gaming,removed,sean and in the name of hello games literally lied to us players the same faithful players that have been following the release of no mans sky for about years before launch date the same loving players that the starting nms spaceship based only on trailers and still images the same caring players that were truly worried when sean was deaththreatened and sent him cupcakes the same loyal players that preordered this game with high hopes based on what sean told us and he lied to us his players but i have a plan i know where sean goes after work i know where he sits at the bar when he wants to be alone and just be himself ill approach and tell him all the good things hes done for games with no mans sky how hello games has made the industry creative again and how they brough beautiful endless types of creatures in amazing color palettes and how great it was to meet my friend online at the orbit of planet harambe by that time he has realized what this conversation is about but its too late are the last words hell hear before i make him choke with a mix of lead blood and his own lies then ill toss a cupcake over his dead body and leave home to play minecraft in the name of all of us space explorers this is what ill do this is what needs to be done
gaming,removed,youre not very bright either because youre putting words in his mouth he didnt say
gaming,removed,where does he state that the servers were down was the reason the players couldnt see each other
gaming,removed,the middle of the universe is just the ability to warp to another universe theres no overarching big bad or plot
gaming,removed,sean gave a non answer to that also which doesnt help he couldve came out and directly said what you said but he decided to be coy and give a vague response
gaming,removed,two thousandth commenter
gaming,removed,they make it seem like making it to the middle is this huge crazy thing when its just a warp point
gaming,removed,i dont know where youre going but do you have room for one more troubled soul
gaming,removed,this is not the case see it was always listed as single player only on steam
gaming,removed,do we just abandon critical thought for bitching now is what you said yet youre blindly and baselessly defending a game on a topic that the devs devs have gone on record on twitter postlaunch and stated that there is no multiplayer good job dingus
gaming,removed,e lol he killed his reply wuuuusssssssssssssss figured as much trolls be trollin what does this even mean im not sure if youre still trying to defend this game or not
gaming,removed,where
gaming,removed,ur all gay
gaming,removed,remember that women are held to a lower standard
gaming,removed,so you could play with your friends that is the single reason i didnt get this game because you cant play with friends that is a huge huge deal for a lot of people and it was not made clear that you couldnt play with friends i just thought it would be really hard not impossible
gaming,removed,dark souls i just think they substituted difficulty for actually substance
gaming,removed,ship created by lancake in starmade you can find more of their ships here
gaming,removed,though i can understand others disappointment i dont get how people could turn on sean and hello games so quickly modern journalism activism and fandom have been affected by the internet in a negative way in order to get clicks or attention or validation you have to get out there as fast as possible being loud helps having a platform helps but nothing aids your position so much as being first add those elements together while you think about reddit and how our community votes on posts i want votes so following this concept i need to be first and i need to be loud that means i wind up posting early and often in a hyperbolic fashion ill blow points completely out of proportion just to get someone to bite and reply its not maybe i should wait and see about this upcoming game its sean is a filthy liar and im filing a class action suit because we have been deceived or something similar to that people bite they upvote and downvote and the post gains traction thats how its working online in social media and even in regular media clickbait headlines from reporters the very hottest of hot takes throughout all sports media regardless of truth or fidelity etc etc and so on showing outrage brings comments even if the comments are whoa tone it down bro lol it gets eyeballs gets votes thats validation for a lot of people it isnt enough to wait and see anymore youve gotta be maaaaaaad right from the start and youve gotta be loud about it how else will people know youre out there how else will you feel like you have a purpose and a place there are about comments here in the hours since this post went up most are speculating arguing debating back and forth but its mostly all the same junk thats been going on for weeks just with evengreater ferocity now that its a mainpage post as that brings ever greater numbers of eyeballs along with higher potential karma levels the cycle continues hello games is just another casualty of what we let ourselves become
gaming,removed,or mighty no
gaming,removed,i understand the problem is so far all the twitch streamers etc all say its not very good graphically which is kinda why im bummed i was hoping for glorious vistas etc maybe the pc version will be better

gaming,removed,i sell modified xboxs loaded to the nines definitely my console of choice for emulators it can handle simple games without game breaking issues such as road rash loaded blasto etc i wouldnt count on it or any console emulating more complex games though if is your main concern i would recommend a modded or chipped if you wanted to emulate of every home console game ever made with as few consoles as possible you could do so with a modded xbox modded and a modded wii or wiiu just keep in mind that saturn and jaguar emulators never really got off the ground
gaming,removed,i got a lot of time out of simcity once it got a few patches i think it became an incredibly fun title with a lot of great ideas that worked very well and some interesting ones that didnt quite work as well as hoped everybodys all over cities skylines now but i think cities skylines is absolute garbage even in comparison to simcity it has no depth and it has no consequence simcity is all about progression cities skylines basically doesnt have any you earn so much in simcity and you develop all sorts of improvements that make running your city and regions so much more dynamic there are so many resource chains and unlocks leading to unlocks and requirements for things meanwhile in cities skylines its literally placing roads painting zones and placing services with no depth beyond any of that simcitys a pretty damn good game it goes on sale a lot its worth the dollars it goes on sale for and i think after a few patches it became worth full price

gaming,removed,op i believe this is his youtube account send him a message if it is him also try contacting the geoffandjosiah youtube channel that he has liked and try registering at their website in the about section and see if theres a contact us they seem to be some of his friends irl at least back then also if you think his full name is franz and he just went by fred he has a steam profile called captawesome and a name change history you can search for if hes not active on steam

gaming,removed,this is a cute love story i hope op finds his lover
gaming,removed,just downvote me ive almost beat doom on nightmare and that controversy is so stupid and forced a guy is bad at shooters okay we dont know who the person playing was we dont know how often they play video games at all or what video games they play to say that a guy is bad at doom the first time he plays it and it was obviously the persons first time and therefore must be bad at all games is idiotic guess what though give anyone who isnt a hardcore gamer basically whats come to mean autistic man child through their own behavior and they play exactly like that i have friends i play with regularly and they dont play much better on new games because of that teething period of learning the controls
gaming,removed,why would a whore play video games

gaming,removed,i like pcs but theyre in no way cheaper not with the longevity that consoles are getting these days its not even close
gaming,removed,oh boy original argument here how many times i have heard fanboys say dlc shouldnt be free blah blah blah chaos was developed alongside the game its not extra content its not post production its part of the base game that is being sold separately because greed thats it stop pretending its anything else than greed because its not its plain and simple i dont understand why youre trying to defend a greedy company that doesnt give a single iota of a damn about you and simply wants as much of your money as possible you would think as a fellow gamer and consumer that you would be upset about this as well and would want to have a full and complete game with the money youre spending but instead you advocate for this poor business practice and want to give them even more money for spitting in our faces i would have to assume that you are a masochist or a cuckhold
gaming,removed,why the fuck is putting the game name in the post title not an official rule already mods pls
gaming,removed,i always enjoy seeing this gif posted in threads where op never put the god damn name of the game in the title hey mods wake the fuck up and make this mandatory like rmusic

gaming,removed,cousin checking in is the best one that ive found fairly self explanatory installation from what i remember but i downloaded it some time ago i can give a quick explanation if you get lost or are unconfident in your ability to get it working just let me know
gaming,removed,let me help you out because it seems your the one not thinking critically this is a mobile game so we are ruling out comparing it to titles on consoles or pc so all the arguments about the game that i know you want to make are thrown right out the window but lets keep going just for arguments sake this is pokemon we are talking about a franchise that is inarguably one of the most beloved in the world and even if you dont like it chances are you know what it is with just that you know the game is going to do well regardless of what it is or how it plays next lets look at what the game actually is this is a collection game you collect and increase numbers and collect some more ok so the gameplay doesnt sound too immersive but its not unlike other games like candy crush or clash of clans that are the same thing with different skins the addition of gyms gives people a goal and an in game interaction with other players you have all the basic makings of a game coupled with an intense nostalgia or love of the subject matter lastly take a look at how it affects your life most nerds are introverts that stay home as often as possible i am not most nerds but for the most part i would have rather stayed home and played video games than gone out to walk around the park or the mall i was and am still very lazy and i knew it this game didnt just give me a reason to go outside hell i had a ton of reasons to do it what it did was make idle mediocre things fun i went to the post office then walked around the local campus and parks for a few hours meeting new people and playing a game i enjoyed im not saying i dont like other games more but it is genuinely fun unless your one of those elitist pricks that believe you should only ever play one game and it should be for hours a day every single day then it should be simple to see why there is so much hype behind this game

gaming,removed,yeah because a digital animal doing exactly as its scripted to do is even remotely close to the same kind of payoff of training an actual wild animal its easy to see just the kind of people who it is that actually like these games its the people who like to pretend games are real trico isnt real which means youre just dealing with the worst aspects of animal training until the game says you dont have to any more you didnt train trico you just progressed far enough for the game to stop deliberately dropping commands its not even remotely close to the same kind of payoff that comes with an actual animal where dealing with the worst parts yields far more beneficial results than a game could ever give you

gaming,removed,jesus fuck this game i had a friend who was an absolute fucking boss at mapmaking in our high school years my favorite of his was a simple map a large interior factory setting on a single plane with walls or barriers just three different types of items weapons power ups and teleports these teleports were critical because they were the only way to get out of the line of fire but each led to a random destination one was a small race course another was a bridge in a nonlit room that walks over a pit of acid my favorite however he called the room of happiness when the teleporter was activated you were taken to a x room with bright yellow walls nothing else and no way out the only options were to kill yourself or wait until another player teleported and then let them kill you of course then they would be trapped in the same unfortunate sitation

gaming,removed,ive only played as an argoinian through morrowind oblivion and skyrim compared to the other two there isnt much uniqueness in skyrim they jewed us out of the disease resistance in skyrim and the water breathing was useful once in oblivion for that dream quest or an occasional treasure chest i personally play as two handed heavy armor so i dont know anything about the stealtharchery personally i wish there was more racism in tes to make each race play through feel more diverse

gaming,removed,on that note mass effect was the worst in the series i mean it was great compared to most other games but the story just didnt work for me as much nowhere near the same scale or sense of awe as the others the only thing wrong with is the last minutes i honestly think the rest of it is a better game

gaming,removed,i still play battlefront online using gameranger i like the new battlefront however i dont think they should have included it as the newest installment to the battlefront series its a completely different game if it was a battlefront game it should have included the clone wars and a campaign mode also the whole idea of star wars battlefront was to have one faction galactic republicrebel alliance start with a certain amount of soldiers lets say and the other faction cisgalactic empire also start with soldiers and the first faction with no more soldiers left loses also you could win by capturing every command post the missions in the new battlefront have ai soldiers but its not soldiers on each team its only you and other ai soldiers on your team and ai soldiers on the opposing team there arent any command posts on the new battlefront either i was expecting a game similar to battlefront when i purchased the new one i was very disappointed that it was nothing like them however i do enjoy the multiplayer the only thing i dislike about multiplayer is that after every match they dont scramble players from one team to another at times it can get frustrating with one team dominating one game after the next
gaming,removed,yes i fully agree i am playing it on my that i bought last month and trust me one console for me

gaming,removed,devs lied repeatedly about the nature and scope of the game leading up to launch throwing any money at them now is rewarding them for being liars at this point the stuff they are adding to the game ie base building makes no sense in a game where the object is to get the the center of the universe by jumping between systems as quickly as possible hint theres nothing at the center that was a lie too id put a spoiler alert but honestly im doing people a favor

gaming,removed,i feel theres a difference between people with autism and using autistic screeching as an insult in the dutch language cursing with diseases is commonplace it doesnt imply you want someone to be autistic instead it uses parts of the stereotype as someone with autism you must admit that part of the subpopulation of people with autism display certain behavioural characteristics some of those characteristics include noise pollution which is the same behaviour some libtards display so no offence but i find this type of expression nothing out of the ordinary but hey this is just my opinion right

gaming,removed,thats weird then i can understand why he posted his comment
gaming,removed,both games are amazing its up to you do you like firstperson shooters or thirdperson so you like postapocalyptic or fantasy games
gaming,removed,do people understand this is from a video game
gaming,removed,youre moms a loadmaster
gaming,removed,because it was new you fuck twat people like playing new games
gaming,removed,iddqd actually
gaming,removed,you think wed learn from our mistakes in zelda
gaming,removed,do not fall for this shit kids i really want ea ufc on pc but this will give your computer aids
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,i wouldnt go that far its certainly much easier than des and but there is such a thing as panic rolling nails spacing more than the other games because its so much smoother combat wise you dont have to roll all the time
gaming,removed,back when games were actually difficult member also op you would have received a dirty down vote if this was based off the modern oh so sucky movies breaks out the emulator
gaming,removed,so youre saying because only a handful of poeple are abusing a mechanic and gaining insane speeds and completing objective way faster then original intended by the game developer its not broken wow youre a special kind of stupid
gaming,removed,no dude im totally with you i own a and pc but aside from the masterrace circle jerk pc players know whats up or think rationally much more than retarded console people
gaming,removed,reminds me a little of gunz the duel httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvtfvmchedtie warning potato quality video
gaming,removed,its tlou you mean you havent played the most amazing game ever made ever s s s s s s
gaming,removed,op failed to give proper credit this was shared by the artist ucustomnesguy a few years ago he did a few other variations on tmnt consoles that are worth checking out
gaming,removed,asus is quite affordable for a monitor
gaming,removed,spoiler alert the optional dlc titled burial at sea puts the main characters of the game under the sea
gaming,removed,why are you reposting this old shit you didnt even change the title to say it was in the past so we know youre a worthless karma whore
gaming,removed,you guys suggest bying is it worth it
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,your still feeding the machine of activision destroying video games

gaming,removed,dae remember this gem
gaming,removed,yes yes road rash yes this needs to be made in hd no change to gameplay no change to sfx no change to the aspect all sprites just hd shame ea owns it if they ever remake it itll be utter crap for sure
gaming,removed,hey guys im a new youtuber trying to get a few extra followers i post vidoes of infinite warfare and im making a series to try and help people be better at the game i would truly appreciate a follow thank you iiixy
gaming,removed,he probably taught her how to suck dick too its the apocalypse after all there arent many mates left she was too young when it began so she was a virgin
gaming,removed,obviously hes dead otherwise the story would suck he has to be dead for them to write a new one
gaming,removed,reminde me to this
gaming,removed,well everything is inspired by something else hell even you got mail was a remake
gaming,removed,i traded my xbox for a nintendo wii when they first came out thinking i would have friends come over and play the new super smash bros then after i realized i had no friends plus a lack luster console
gaming,removed,yeah but that would require the mods to do work or enforce a new rule neither of which will ever happen i mean how long have been people been asking for game names in the titles
gaming,removed,posts should be automatically deleted when the name of the game isnt in the title
gaming,removed,he raped the bitch then
gaming,removed,if only there was a way that could be fixed like some kind of rule or something perhaps in a place where people could see it and all the posts not following that rule would be removed by moderators if only that were possible on reddit
gaming,removed,just rustling neckbeard panties

gaming,removed,hey reddit whats up utalkslikeyoutubers here with my list of mustplay snes rpg games obviously no rpg list is complete without entries like the final fantasy series my personal favorite of which is the fourth game but most people will tell you that final fantasy vi is the best one whatever theyre both great i just like the story in iv better gotta give a shout out to chrono trigger too lots of replayability there and arguably some of the best rpg music to come on a cartridge secret of mana and its prequel are usually recommended here but if im being honest i just could never get into them navigating around in the menus was always such a chore last but not least i gotta mention everyones favorite cult classic earthbound dont let the premise of playing as elementary school kids or the kiddy cartoonish look of the game fool you theres some real solid rpg elements in here and youd be committing a serious error in judgement if you passed this one up and dont forget to check out my videos things you might now know about earthbound things you might now know about earthbound part and things you might now know about earthbound part on the channel well reddit thats all i have today dont forget to like the video comment the video and subscribe to the channel for more content like this and dont forget you can always donate to my patreon to keep the channel alive

gaming,removed,well its due out in september for pc xbox and but by all means follow us on facebook here wwwfacebookcomteamwoodsalt
gaming,removed,yes but it got removed from all platforms because of offensive imagery it became available again on all platforms except pc after that
gaming,removed,fire redleaf green had the sevii islands heartgoldsoulsilver had kanto obviously it seems like nintendo found its more profitable to have old regions behind a paywall in the form of a remake game each generation instead of a halfcomplete version in a delayed game
gaming,removed,why is this marked nsfw

gaming,removed,yeah basically its wip but the tldr is that roleplaying games require agency which broadly speaking is the ability to make decisionschoices that have narrative meaning and that ending dropped the ball the narrative of the mass effect trilogy and its reception provides an avenue to examine issues of interactivity and player agency within the roleplaying genre in when the concluding part of the initial trilogy mass effect was released reviews were positive arthur gies from polygon stated that the game was a triumph the culmination of an unprecedented experiment in game narrative and igns video review went one step further to claim that it had managed to fully realise the promise bioware set forward with mass effecta worthy end to the trilogy before it within a few months however the picture was less rosy articles released regarding the series now bear titles such as why did the mass effect ending ruin the whole series and why mass effect s ending was so terrible and a general consensus among fansites seems to suggest that a vocal group of players familiar with the earlier releases within the franchise were unhappy with the ending of the narrative this provides an interesting perspective on the effects of agency interactivity and social communication within video game design and reception mass effect provides both design choices earlier within the trilogy that led to it being one of the most anticipated games of alongside choices that failed to create a holistically interactive experience for their players these elements led to poor reception this paper aims to establish the important role of agency within roleplaying games investigate the use of agency throughout the mass effect franchise and suggest where the franchise failed to provide sufficient agency if you have any comments thoughts questions requests for me to come speak about this at a conference i wish drop them here mail me on reddit or contact me at mediaboyhotmailcouk if you want to cite this then poke me first it is being published eventually but its going to be a year or so away as theres a whole series of them im doing in this vein for a monograph
gaming,removed,hunblebrag the thread
gaming,removed,i admire this man and everything he stood for rip iwata we all run out of green mushrooms one day
gaming,removed,but my experience with ripped movies out there is certainly not representative of lossless br rips there are different kinds of rips ill get into this shortly youre asking who uses disks anymore as f the standard is buying a physical disk and ripping it or using the digital edition download key included or just streaming over netflixhuluamazon whateveretc and torrents arent br quality in my experience theyre usually compressed not to reach back into my first point theres differant kinds of blueray rips theres the iso the legit disk youll have the menus special trailers behind the scenes shit and will need to be mounted or reburned to be used this is the legit copy of the blueray disk that the publisher would have used to make the disk theres the remux which is the actual moviemkv taken from the rest mentioned above this is still a but will be smaller than a full sized disk as it doesnt have the special features trailers menus etc then theres a reencode this can vary from being damnnear the same quality to a movie which has no quality for example i have a mkv of a movie bluray is a disk so why is it impossible to think that theres a quality differance here but if youre not and ripping your own youre arguing ripping is a better option its an easier option since all dvdblueray players seem to be one disk at a time what ever happened to those disk cd players anyways the ability to go from movie to movie with no issue or stop watching on one tv and watch on another without the need for moving your player is better ignoring storage issues assuming every bluray you own has a mkv on it gets you which is bluray rips i dont think for ease of use it makes sense to rip a disk i am likely so watch times every few years but spending a couple hundred on a player and then is more reasonable at least a nas network attached storage could allow you to do windows backups as well as hold your movies the process of actually ripping it is more effort than putting a disk in two times putting in a disk once running a program then removing the disk is hard k the real chanting point will be when storage is no longer a problem and digital copies have the same features and quality as a br storage isnt an issue most laptops not running a ssd have and most desktops seem to be shipping with and if digital copies arent bluray quality the only reason is because the publisher doesnt want it to be to force bluray sales i dont see sitting down to rip ever disc i buy on massive hdd as a better option and torrenting doesnt yield the same quality torrent others rips then if ripping your own is the same quality then theres not going to be quality degradation because you downloaded it youre trying to argue that using a streaming stick is better than an xbox which has all of the benefits of the stick plus gaming plus cable plus disk media i also stated i dont have cable or disks as well as a pc gamer so i have a desk anyone can set up a homestreaming service with a little research which will give you great quality and cost nothing or buy an android box which allows you to stream a large amount of movies for free for some reason honestly if youre still paying for cable thats your fault that said tv tuner card a fucking disk drive and your pc can do everything that xbox can but better i am wondering how you can try to keep arguing that a pc is more convenient when sitting in front of a tv because it is youre putting the ludicrous limitation of no input switching for some reason just because it fits your narrative your tv remote will be needed for volume anyways but if youre really a stuck up asshole about inputs a pc can still do everything a console can
gaming,removed,now if i can do that irl
gaming,removed,nice work good news its hasnt crashed
gaming,removed,because theyre filthy casuals
gaming,removed,kys
gaming,removed,its a bad screenshot overall the graphics are quite nice i also have no idea what quality settings they were using
gaming,removed,what older games are playable on without purchasing a new game i genuinely dont know of any as i dont have either of the new consoles i mean i know most console games dont come out for new consoles as the same version theres usually a bigger number on the end but the fact that any of them do is really gross imo all old pc games are playable on new pcs the really old ones require some finagling but there are no pc games that you have to buy a new version of when you upgrade your gpu
gaming,removed,it just looks like a puzzle to me i dont know what vader or some star wars reference has to do with it but pokemon is a cool game
gaming,removed,if only op knew how many dicks she had to suck to raise the money

gaming,removed,shhhh
gaming,removed,that is true but the playstation cant actually run anything at like i said all current psvr games that i know of run at with asynchronous timewarp i thought about including that tidbit but it seemed irrelevant since the cant reach to begin with so isnt happening yet with the pspro it could be possible but i doubt it since developers seem infatuated with graphics over performance
gaming,removed,when those things happen eg with movies games dlc and so on and they cant fix the issue i go on piratebay and download what ive lost in a heartbeat i work as hard for my money as they do just dont try to be an asshat to me
gaming,removed,fuck your repost several minutes before you posted

gaming,removed,cool okay uh huh sure why not no its not fucking cool you retard that can happen to anybody its predefined thats like saying guys im currently breathing air am i cool yet you and every other worthless sack of shit that upvoted this post should burn in hell for their sins i mean how many brain cells do you have to lack to find this wretched excuse for a post even the slightest bit entertaining i am being completely serious when i say i hope you die a horrible death you sad worthless asshat you are nothing you will die one day and for gods sake i hope that day is soon you worthless fuckwad
gaming,removed,tight pussy expect your big bro get it right now httpixskcnpcb
gaming,removed,i love how each time you respond and prove me right it just dredges up the old memories of you getting fucking demolished by all the people in this thread keeping your failures refresh in everyones memory lol
gaming,removed,the original cc games dont play well with windows the grouped together pack from steam works as far as i know someone has uploaded several of the original games on a torrent site and they work on dont go on this site without adblocker and noscript running i have not been able to get generals working on nor get it running on other os using vmware with copies of windows and xp
gaming,removed,dude this isnt how you spread the message of pc gaming this goes against everything weve been working for as pc gamers we want console players to experience better graphics and a pc is the best way to do that but if they can only afford a or xbone or whatever the newer ones are called then so be it i also hate to judge by post history but you only seem to call out console gamers for how bad they are and when you received many downvotes did you every stop and consider why
gaming,removed,finally im so hyped for it if people like her singing here is a link to more covers on soundcloud sung by ashleyellies voice actor httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvljxielomnzmabchannelxcagegame

gaming,removed,i was going to suggest just cause because especially in the third one just messing around is definitely better than the main storyline you have a lot of action games on there id suggest broader sandbox style ones such as garrys mod its a bit dated but you can do just about anything at all with its physics system and wideopen customizability when it comes to assets if your messing around includes the geekier side of needing a tiny amount of real knowhow consider kerbal space program andor space engineers they both have really faithful aeronautical models scads of mods more capacity for creativity than has yet been found and at least that much destruction check them out d btw these are all for pc but i hear talk of kerbal being available on console

gaming,removed,when i was younger i lived with two of my long time friends and they would lied to me about the electricity and heating bills when i was doing my apprenticeship and struggling with money just so i would stay living with them i only found out about it years later and it still brings tears to my eyes they would even do that for me

gaming,removed,ive just thought of the perfect steam early access title kill trump id setup challenges like deepthroating him with a dildo
gaming,removed,there is one very effective solution to this but no one will actually help do this so i guess youre all fucked stop buying the fucking games if you buy them you give them more reason to keep doing it in the future if you stop buying them then they will not have as much power to do it in the future each time you give in and buy one of these incomplete games you are giving them money and then giving them more money to complete it i wouldnt give my dog a treat when he has been bad so why would i give a company money when they have been bad if you really want the game but dont think the developers deserve your hard earned cash for a lazily produced game then torrent it if their sales go down they will learn that its from people not putting up with the shit no more they change or go out of business and there will be more waiting to take their place

gaming,removed,former lamestop employee from just before they discontinued used xbox and gamecube games on a used trade is an optimistic estimate depending on the game i once took a trade in on a copy of baulders gate dark alliance ii and the guy wanted cash rather than credit the pos listed the cash value of the game as roughly which he happily accepted we then turned around and slapped a preowned sticker with a price tag of on it ive never felt dirtier about a transaction and that includes my time working at a porn shop years later

gaming,removed,i havent played a lot of these games but his does it compare to most of the assassin creeds they seem pretty big to me
gaming,removed,im saying they arent they are surprisingly critical there are at least really critical posts on the subs frontpage right now all with upvotes and not a single apologetic post the rest are posts about things in the game mods screenshots etc those are fair in my opinion and have nothing to do with fanboyism the post about features that hg lied about was even stickied by the mods when the original poster deleted it they even stickied the repost
gaming,removed,a www did i ruin your safe space by not giving you a trigger warning that adults know more about life then you did you want us to wait while you change your tampon or can we keep going
gaming,removed,you cant always blame the consumer on this one when you are told certain features are there even if it suffers a graphical downgrade you like what its about and you preorder to support the company then it isnt always your fault sure rgaming and rpcmasterrace have huge disdain for preorder culture but its not a bad thing this was just a case where the creator actively lied to his playerbase most games have been pretty ok at advertisement recently and i already preordered titanfall because a i trust the dev and b i know what content im getting if titanfall came without a campaign that would not be my fault it would be respawns sorry for the ramble but you get what im saying

gaming,removed,why is ur grandad look so fresh
gaming,removed,hi rgaming this summer instead of getting a boring job i decided to spend my time developing a mobile game after three months of hard work ive finally released the game pillar hop the game is available on both ios and android devices it has ads but i tried to make them show quite infrequently i started the game in late may and have just recently finished i worked on it almost every single day of the summer excluding weekends as of right now i have made a grand total of from the game this route is definitely not a replacement for a summer job i doubt i will make anything close to what i would have with a proper summer job but im still happy with how i chose to spend my time i did all of the programming myself and some of the art i purchased the backgrounds and pillars from an asset pack and then drew the characters and ui ios store link google play link httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomtoryjumper id love to hear what you guys think any feedback would be much appreciated let me know if you have any questions about the game or the development process
gaming,removed,so how much you being paid to shill and shame cant be all that much
gaming,removed,dude why dont you simply state what rule he broke instead of being some all powerful acting posh cunt seems like an ok post to mepisses me off im freaking pumped i go to church every god damn sunday
gaming,removed,he didnt break any rules he posts one set of links and the rest of his profile is gaming discussion either from people supporting his project or about other games entirely he asks for no votes but asks for discussions and feedback that way dont shit on people that do things correctly because you think youre helpingyoure not

gaming,removed,thats pretty cool
gaming,removed,well maybe you dont remember what happened between this is going to be amazing past what bought by ms and what no pc version anymore ending at wow this is a shitty ass port of a game that is nothing like what they were talking about probably to get to run on that shitty console is maybe one of the greatest betrayals of a userbase in my life time i just realised why i often dont get problems with broken promises in gaming it just doesnt compare trying to dig up a proper article but that is really still in the no we dont put it online you have to buy the magazine area

gaming,removed,well if you recall the ship classes were said to be explorer fighter trader this is reflected ingame in the base ships you can pickup the appearance dictates the attachments they have if a ship has few upgrades and many inventory slots its a trader ship if a ship has lots of weapon upgrades its a fighter ship and so on however any ship can do everything adequately but sean has previously stated that it would be dependent on upgrades and this inventory slot system explorer however thats a bit more disingenuous the warp drives are the only thing that denote exploring because scanning planets from orbit hasnt appeared in game however ships still have a scan icon on the upgrade wheel this makes me think that this just didnt make it in time im hoping this comes later if youre looking at turning let me tell you grab yourself a little podship and then grab a hulking trader youll really feel the difference in handling its not something thats unnoticeable its so noticeable that when that thread was still active people were saying hold on a minute ship handling is different in my experiences x its fair to say that its not as apparent as described but its still there its really odd because a lot of these features were shown in trailers orbiting and rotating planets was shown in the ign first april demonstration for instance couple of corrections though landing on asteroids isnt a thing listen to the context of the interview its subtly stated that its a bug that youre not supposed to as for alien races sean did say there were races we know these as korvax gek vykeen and atlas as for the centre of the galaxy sean did hint as far back as that at the centre of the galaxy was the ability to travel to another galaxy this ended up being onehundred percent true if hed never hinted this at all and he just said get to the centre theres something waiting for you im sure many people wouldve been thrilled to see a new galaxy however because he dropped that hint and because it was such a big goal people didnt want to believe that the hint was all there was to it i dont consider myself having bought into it i never put money down for a preorder and i discouraged others from preordering i knew the game could have the potential to go south however after watching many streams i saw an experience that i would find enjoyable and i purchased it on pc not long after its release despite the reported technical issues of which i had very few one of the lucky ones as for the information i collected it from interviews and articles with the primary source being the information repository maintained by a moderator of the subreddit which has links to all sources whenever someone asked me about a piece of information i would source it its unfortunate that ive now ended up the shotmessenger as i now get called a shill on the daily but im not too fussed ive been around the internet too long to be driven off by people calling me a shill of all things haha thanks for being reasonable though ill keep on enjoying the game with more and more mods cropping up its really taking form some people have modded in some missing features weve got lowflying weve got tall trees and big plants weve got additional graphical settings and much more people are currently trying to crack big animals and its not long until the game is cracked open entirely the future its paved with more situations like this one i can tell you hype culture is a dangerous thing watchdogs spore etc everything that can go tits up will go tits up speaking of watchdogs though ive not seen much of watchdogs and people are being incredibly wary but do you think ubisoft mightve done well this time around based on the blowback from watchdogs i never played personally just was aware of the controversy
gaming,removed,yes some lads cracked it go to rhaloonline

gaming,removed,per their favebook the exclusivity has expired already its been posted to death already
gaming,removed,the exclusivity has already expired
gaming,removed,dude you are such a little bitch and the problem is that you assumed that he asssumed which he didnt imo the comment reads pretty general you are looking like an ass off all kinds at this point also you care waaaaaay too much just stfu at this point you already proved you should have my username as your birthname
gaming,removed,the guy is rather hypocritical considering you know modded consoles like the and xbox allowing custom code to be executed during the character choosing screen to give invincibility unlimited specials etc pc gamers typically do not cheat considering we have vac which tends to work of the time when its applied to a variety of games that use it
gaming,removed,dedication

gaming,removed,do you like phil collins ive been a big genesis fan ever since the release of their album duke before that i really didnt understand any of their work too artsy too intellectual it was on duke where uh phil collins presence became more apparent i think invisible touch was the groups undisputed masterpiece its an epic meditation on intangibility at the same time it deepens and enriches the meaning of the preceding three albums christy take off your robe listen to the brilliant ensemble playing of banks collins and rutherford you can practically hear every nuance of every instrument sabrina remove your dress in terms of lyrical craftsmanship the sheer songwriting this album hits a new peak of professionalism sabrina why dont you uh dance a little take the lyrics to land of confusion in this song phil collins addresses the problems of abusive political authority in too deep is the most moving pop song of the about monogamy and commitment the song is extremely uplifting their lyrics are as positive and affirmative as uh anything ive heard in rock christy get down on your knees so sabrina can see your ass phil collins solo career seems to be more commercial and therefore more satisfying in a narrower way especially songs like in the air tonight and uh against all odds sabrina dont just stare at it eat it but i also think phil collins works best within the confines of the group than as a solo artist and i stress the word artist this is sussudio a great great song a personal favorite
gaming,removed,they actually did port over president evil to the it was a decent port and it was my first chance to play a resident evil being a nintendo kid iirc that was the only one other than resident evil almost being an game before being delayed and launch on the good ol lamecube

gaming,removed,games is completely different though as its more focused on trying to have decent discussions on games and reporting gaming news frequently rgaming is more geared toward people wanting casual content like gameplay gifs screenshots some significant gaming news cosplays etc

gaming,removed,i play fps on a pc because i want to be able to shoot move strafe jump and look around me all at the same time and to varying degrees i can not do this without a mouse and keyboard it is impossible i cannot use the gamepad with the thumb sticks and the buttons and the and none of it is fluid its jerky as fuck and i could probably only ever execute out of the things i need to be doing at any given time all the time and that isnt nearly good enough to have an enjoyable gaming experience or contribute in any substantial way to a team unless i camp somewhere with a sniper and who the fuck wants to be that guy so if you can use a gamepad playing deathmatch where youre always moving always always looking around every single second and you can do that as efficiently as you could with a mouse and keyboard then holy shit
gaming,removed,you dont deserve these upvotes you lazy low effort cunt i hope while you are enjoying your game the system over heats and explodes showering you anyone with you and your home in burning melting plastic and solder but thats not the end no i hope you and all your loved ones get trapped in that burning house like it was all over again and you all slowly burn to death you worthless piece of shit

gaming,removed,this is not true for the most part goodwill is technically nonprofit i believe but they make tons of money im not sure how they are able to say they are nonprofit also i seriously doubt they are spending all that money on their disabled employees when i worked there they had a couple of days a week where they would have a few disabled people come in and move clothes around im sure that doesnt cost them very much money all it really does is save them money because they can pay them less the hires arent really often disabled more sometimes id say at least from my experience a lot of people who worked there including myself worked there because they wanted to not because we couldnt get real jobs which it very much was id never had any problems finding work their productivity is significantly less than that of an able worker this was not the case at the location i worked at either it was quite the opposite everyone was overworked and underpaid i worked harder in that place than anyone probably ever had but there were plenty of others who did more than their fare share of work as well i just want to set the record straight here goodwill has their pockets lined full of money i watched them so much moneys worth of practically anything and everything imaginable i cant even imagine how much money they must be making a few of my bosses had even told me on many occasions that goodwill is not really a charitable organization in almost any way at all dont start thinking they are a nice place thats out to help anyone but themselves

gaming,removed,i have an etsy shop where you can buy many of the different masks that i make wwwhappymaskpropscom you arent too far off from what i made this cosplay out to be originally the happy mask salesman introduces himself as a traveling merchant who searches far and wide for rare and interesting masks he tasks you to retrieve majoras mask as it is very precious and dear to him as you play the game it is clear there is some obvious power associated with majoras mask and once completing the quest you return it to him in the game he says that the evil has left the mask but i dont believe that the power is gone as he seems to disappear into nothing after walking away i like to think he continues to search far and wide using the power of majora to collect more rare and interesting masks

gaming,removed,well i played a little of it on pc and i noticed that for me the frame rates were ok the explosions sucks but i can deal with it and you cant charge your shots what i hated about this game was the fact that the wall jumps are conditional you need a border to hold and jump again you simply cant just slide through the wall andor jump again this made me feel confined in the first boss battle i just couldnt jump over him to dodge his attack and the game feels like its a fast paced game just doesnt feel right excluding this kind of mechanic all in all i give a or out of but probably this score will change as i play more of it

gaming,removed,recent event with an older friend he wanted to buy a specific older used game so he went to a local gamestop to purchase it it was like being back in the nineties just the idea that youd go outside get into your car and drive to a physical building where you would go in and browse their limited selection and if they didnt have the game you wanted youd just go home and not have it it was mind boggling why why would you do that as hes going through the used games i whip out my smartphone and open up the ebay app in less than seconds i find copies of the game at a fraction of what he would have paid for retail at gamestop including free express shipping conversation ensues well they dont have it i guess i wont buy that its ordered itll be at your house the day after tomorrow thatll be fifteen bucks

gaming,removed,we are a small indie studio from montreal this was our first game on steam the black watchmen i hope you will enjoy reading the report
gaming,removed,google someone remade metroid for free and it released today
gaming,removed,go play the that was released today
gaming,removed,as a formerly skinny black man ive quickly turned away fat newports smokin white broads comin on to me guys callin this girl fat have never had a truly fat girl hit on them its easy to turn them down because they cant run very fast i mean its like damb youre fat but on the other hand your tits are small
gaming,removed,huh does make sense that the japs would love a little blonde boy more than a sexy tall blonde woman
gaming,removed,from a game design perspective i feel pretty confident saying super metroid is the superior game
gaming,removed,beat me to it x
gaming,removed,i take it youve never heard of the fanmade chronomteigger sequel it was done when they got a cease and desist and instantly shut down never releasing it i think it eventually leaked a few years later though the copyright owner had no possible justification for this considering that the games franchise has been dead for decades so they dont stand to lose a penny from the game they were just being assholes especially considering that timing its not like they didnt know the game was being made several years before sending the cd
gaming,removed,like someone else said the metroid prime fan remake finally released today judging by the teams previous efforts it is looking to be very good if you are looking for a metroid to play
gaming,removed,other m sits right before metroid fusion and after super metroid in the timeline making it the second to last game chronologically here is the timeline metroid zero mission metroid prime metroid prime echoes metroid prime corruption metroid return of samus super metroid metroid other m metroid fusion

gaming,removed,sadly there are karrmabot accounts that repost things with identical titles in an attempt to farm karma once the account is fattened up its sold to advertisers who want legitimate looking high karma accounts to bypass reddits flagging system on link spamming and vote manipulation thus its probable to convert imaginary internet points into irl currency

gaming,removed,shes so asking for it wearing that though
gaming,removed,based on third parties that are already on the nes classic edition and games that are on the virtual console this is a list of games that i think would realistically appear on it for this reason i think its highly doubtful any super fx games would appear since theyve never been on the virtual console probably due to issues with argonaut games so no star fox or yoshis island im sure they could probably work out a deal with rare to get the dkc games allstars while only released on wii disc was essentially a virtual console release contra the alien wars cybernator demons crest donkey kong country donkey kong country diddys kong quest donkey kong country dixie kongs double trouble fzero final fantasy ii iv final fantasy iii vi final fight gradius iii kirby super star kirbys dream course kirbys dream land the legend of zelda a link to the past mega man x pacattack pacman the new adventures pilotwings space invaders street fighter ii turbo hyper fighting super adventure island super castlevania iv super ghouls n ghosts super mario allstars super mario kart super mario rpg legend of the seven stars super mario world super punchout vegas stakes﻿

gaming,removed,or you could just torrent it then buy a shirt from the company haha
gaming,removed,oh goody i can see it now this game is only but you can buy the optional multiplayer dlc for an additional haha yeah no thanks i know you obviously meant for campaign and for multi to equal but fact is that selling a game in pieces is an incredibly bad habit to get into when dlc was first a thing a couple games tried this and got eaten alive for it by the press and gamers the last thing i want to see is games stripping out formally standard modes and selling them separately it sets a bad precedent because its not like theres going to be a rule that the whole thing needs to cost
gaming,removed,what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch ill have you know i graduated top of my class in the navy seals and ive been involved in numerous secret raids on alquaeda and i have over confirmed kills i am trained in gorilla warfare and im the top sniper in the entire us armed forces you are nothing to me but just another target i will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet think again fucker as we speak i am contacting my secret network of spies across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can kill you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my bare hands not only am i extensively trained in unarmed combat but i have access to the entire arsenal of the united states marine corps and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little shit if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot i will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it youre fucking dead kiddo
gaming,removed,its a twitch tv video game streaming service emote that symbolizes sarcasm and is named kappa
gaming,removed,its the same game every year people are never fucking happy
gaming,removed,so i know this may seem like that answer you may not be looking for but cod iw is the same as every other cod meaning you can run it perfectly fine just on the you question should be as follows do i need a pro for any upcoming games that may need the extra processing power without frame lag ill use this as an example the new generation of games are asking for alot when it comes to capability im upgrading as soon as i can for this same reason i think final fantasy will take a toll on my and this is just the start of it other games that these developers are producing will in fact need more juice when it comes to how well your can perform building a pc seems like the most afforable way since you can always swap parts and keep it upgraded at all times plus you can purchase the same games and like your remote for any game if needed good luck on your decision my friend
gaming,removed,i cannot count how many times ive won matches doing this on various maps absolute bullshit but you get a great reaction
gaming,removed,another reference how you can tell everything in this trailer is fan creations the ride they show at is an ingame remake of the real world rollercoaster baron located in de efteling in the netherlands you can get it for your own park here

gaming,removed,game looks stupid but everyone is entitled to their own opinion
gaming,removed,a pot head who games and uploads dick pics this is exactly the type of spokesman that nihilist arbys is looking for
gaming,removed,but this is a new type of dlc instead of making new content for the game they rip parts out of the original and sell it for more money this doesnt apply to all games of course but its a recent trend ive been noticing dlc for me falls into the same category as season passes and micro transactions they can work in a video game if done right but more often than not they arent

gaming,removed,thats more of a testament of how outoftouch mac walters was with the mass effect universe in general sorry for the following spoilers yall you done missed the train at this point the fact that before the game released ea was like oh by the by our day dlc adds spoiler to your squad sent series fans into a mouthbreathing tizzy it should have been quite literally game changing that it wasnt just suggests that walters mo in writing was to just lean on the rule of cool like he was a goddamn literary cripple which he is mind you and then not actually follow through with the consequences of that decision

gaming,removed,teenage mutant ninja turtles i just looked it up and it was the pc port that was shipped broken just to clarify
gaming,removed,there are plenty reasons why people do this too many too properly explain its the reason why ten year old kids feel the need to insult someone over a mic its the reason why people think it is funny to laugh at someone dying its the reason why people think its fun to call black people niggers after they die to one its the reason why go back to the kitchen is such a common phrase that it is used overseas in many different languages you happen to be a woman playing a game which is seen as a male world i guarantee you that if every single male gamer in the world had at least one female friend that played videogames there would be no female harrassing in videogames but most people dont have a female gamer friend so they think it is fun to pick on women but like the top comment describes people can do whatever the hell they want on the internet and they wont be called out for that most importantly do you think these people harassing you lead happy successful lives i dont mean successful as in i make millions a year but im happy with the life i have some people enjoy making other people miserable just to feel better about themselves

gaming,removed,cutest doge ever might be the next thor too
gaming,removed,i just said it and you damn well know it initially the game costs months later it costs less a year or later its down considerably the rate of decrease depends on the popularity of the game popular titles hold their price high much faster than less popular titles the exact formula ea uses to decide on discounts well you might be able to argue that they should use a better one i dont know but they clearly scrape as much revenue from this as they can they wouldnt sell at if they didnt think theyd get a large volume of sales at that price
gaming,removed,as far as i know it wasnt the initial goal of steam but the fact that they were one of the first digital video games distribution platforms that they already had a huge fanbase of their early games and the way the video games market and technology especially internet speed progressed made them that way
gaming,removed,if i remember correctly half life maybe was leaked prior to launch and everyone had a few playable levels and knew the story before valve even had chance to release gabe nearly cancelled the entire thing out of rage and ended up recreating of the game lets not do that to please guys
gaming,removed,its been talked about multiple times on their shows and brought up multiple times in their dev comments on the forums nothing has been said about them taking it out my expectations are perfectly in check

gaming,removed,accept that someone is willing to put a couple of hours into creating an faq they can post in threads about sc outside of the sc subreddit without being paid for it i refuse to believe that nobody is that huge of a loser to believe that all of that is only because the devs are paying for it is a pretty damn sorry outlook on life considering how hard youve been fooled i actually feel pity for you because to behave like that there must be nothing in the world that you care enough about that youre willing to volunteer some time for it its a fucking video game youre aware were talking about a game based on fiction also who the fuck is derek smart the dev team give far less of a shit about trolls than the fans do they dont care because theyre fucking rich and will live on a beach in a warm climate for the rest of their lives once this is over all thanks to people like yourself the game will bomb this belief is rooted in fact youre just like the fanbois for no mans sky have no illusions this will happen
gaming,removed,my concern is about longevity casual console owners buy a console because it lasts years without needing to be touched modified or upgraded while a pc can run many of this years games at console performance i am looking years ahead this this isnt a thing its an illogical myth why would pc hardware perform worse over time consoles dont have some new magic liquid metal processor that upgrades itself if you get a pc that matches the console in years they still perform the exact same way i dont care if someone likes console or pc but this nonsensical misinformation needs to stop

gaming,removed,you dont need to mod your dreamcast to play a burned cdr disc you do have to burn the game as an image using something like discjuggler or alcohol nero i think is an option too but i didnt have as much luck with it as alcohol in addition some games will not play directly out of the box there was a time when in order to bypass the drm you needed to use a boot disc like utopia but once a drm fix was uncovered most games put it directly in the image so usually if you pick something up off a torrent and burn the image to a cdr it will boot up and play like any other disc be forwarned that reading burnt cdr discs will cause your dreamcast laser to go out sooner than playing real discs as it is more difficult to read burnt cdr than the actual gdr games and load times are usually a little bit longer

gaming,removed,while is a great game mgs will always be the peak of the metal gear formula thats where new technology freed up all of that stored up storytelling potential that was checked by lack of storage space for voice acting and lack of for environmental storytelling and inexpensive cutscenes play then play mgs it feels like a dam was blasted open then play or and they feel like a calm creek slowly iterating on essentially the same formula was a step back in a lot of ways from and is great in its own way but almost may as well be part of its own series its so disconnected from the others

gaming,removed,crysis is fun only so far as pretty environments go and just being an overpowered badass the powers are more streamlined although less capable than using macros with the abilities in so its fun to just go area to area stomping on things level design is linear storys whatever but its still a lot more dumb fun than all the other fps campaigns that were around at the time like and cod and such yeah its easy to dismiss games that list those as key features as they are not deal makers or breakers but i dont think that means that they cant be key features skyrim for example is not something that would be beloved by me if it didnt have great atmosphere and a world that i could enjoy seems everyone here is aware that skyrim is very very dumbed down compared to its predecessors so it stands to reason that graphics in a sense did at an important role in the reception of the game star wars battlefront would not be nearly as enticing as it kind of is if endor didnt feel like a real fuckin endor if it looked like an abvious map built with cookie cutter objects passing as trees and rocks that game would not be nearly as appealing by todays standards but because that game looks and feels damn near like the actual world of star wars then theres something a little special there i do agree though that graphics are often heralded over other aspects of a game aspects that are often more important but sometimes visuals both aesthetically andor technically can be some of the more important aspects of a particular game its just a relationship of components and sometimes the more obvious components like gameplay become less important due to how other aspects are handled had fairly shoddy combat but every other aspect of the game the atmosphere and storytelling characters and character design etc were so damn rich that it didnt even matter that the primary gameplay feature was the weakest part of the game performance is definitely a big thing though no its not really a hallmark of a great game but it is an important fundamental component arnold schwarzenegger had one of the first teslas a great car but he eventually got rid of it because hes sort of a bulky but mostly old dude the car was basically far too low to be comfortable for him if a game chugs or does not have decent aspect ratio support or has a locked frame rate despite being a fastpaced precision oriented game well then framerate or such can be a hallmark it could be the hallmark of a bad game that could otherwise be good it could be an indication that graphics took shotgun and put performance in the back seat which makes a great game almost unbearable to play arkham knight

gaming,removed,because of weird naming conventions and order of the games stories that article is still hard to follow for me but it sounds like dream drop distance takes place after the kh remix which means dream drop distance is technically kh then kh unchained is the first game storywise making it kh followed by birth by sleep which is kh birth by sleep this all leads to birth by sleep having a follow up episode that will be apart of kh the follow up is technically kh birth by sleep since it follows kh bbs because dream drop distance kh and kh birth by sleep will be on the same disc they just added and to come up with unnecessarily convoluted just like the games plot still gonna buy and love the hell out of it though
gaming,removed,i started at the beginning of wotlk and never had any issue getting people for dungeons to be fair if you started at the beginning of wotlk you never knew a world without the dungeon finder trust me when i say building groups was not exactly interesting gameplay in bc it could be a total nightmare to get a group together for even the easiest heroics it wasnt uncommon to spend over an hour trying to get something together that could do the content youd be surprised how annoying it could be to have to find a specific type of cc for an instance i digress in my opinion lfd was one of the best additions they ever made to wow and one of the reasons that wrath was so much fun it enabled players to actually get in and enjoy the content instead of spending their time simply trying to find people to be fair though servers did lose a lot of their personality once the dungeon finder was released and even more when the pool was widened to include anyone in your servers battlegroup but that familiarity between players wasnt created by the system so much as it evolved in spite of it you had to make friends to play the game end of story and thats not always great game design

gaming,removed,ive been a pc gamer most of my life but ive owned consoles at times though none since the original xbox there are some arguments to be made for pcs are better than consoles but at the end of the day thats only going to be true for some people and not everyone some people will get more enjoyment out of a console than they would out of a pc i wouldnt try to tell those people theyre doing it wrong what i can say however is that if i count every single gamingrelated purchase that ive made in the past years i would have gotten a great deal less out of my money if id spent it gaming on console while its true that building your own nice gaming rig is significantly more expensive than buying a console the costs of serious gaming on a console end up being significantly higher if you consider total expenditures over time simply put the more games you want to own and play and the more time passes the more expensive a console gets whereas a pc typically gets cheaper in the past years ive purchased about games and ive built two computers purchasing that many games for a console just the games would cost more than twice the combined price tag of the two pcs ive used for the past years then consider that you are buying controllers that may need to be replaced frequently and ive been using the same mechanical keyboard for the past consecutive years then add on service fees for things like psn or xbox live then when your console generation flips over you have all of these games for your old hardware that typically wont run on the new hardware you have to rebuy them all or maintain a steadily growing collection of old consoles hooked into your entertainment system if you only game when you feel like you have nothing better to do and theres only a few titles youre really interested in then consoles are definitely right for you itll cost you less money itll require less thought itll just work but if you consider gaming to be a real hobby and high up on your list of things id rather be doing and if youre interested in amassing a collection of titles youll probably be better served by gaming on pc your collection will work from system to system youll spend far less money on games youll have more options to choose from than any console gamer ever will and many would argue that youll have a better gaming experience as well though that is definitely subjective

gaming,removed,is just absolutely ridiculous because sure you get stunning vistas like this one but then they remember the little things too a random tree will have something carved into it a peasant will be scratching the mod for chicken bones the inn has a dirty linens heap out back and hundreds of better examples that truly bring the game to life

gaming,removed,just to prove his much of a liar you are you claimed of your posts have never been on reddit even counting duplicates and self posts and using your crappy site its so httpkarmadecaycomuseranonymousaccount but using real numbers and a common repost i recognized that karmadecay couldnt now we are up to but it isnt all images and shit karmadecay even tracks so i bet that number is much much lower like half of everything and likely all of your images so around you were saying
gaming,removed,this i saw it and posted hereits like im receiving money for karma or something not yet but you could be a spammer or botter or both
gaming,removed,heres the article about it including where op ripped the pictures from to take credit for
gaming,removed,nothing huh i even recognize the nintendo power photos themselves you ripped the images from this article and took credit for them karma decay brush and hypocrisy in action
gaming,removed,fact is i didnt lie one bit sure you did was a lie your claims about knowing everything thats ever been on reddit is a lie i just proved it having difficulty manning up and admitting it the fact that you care so much and are attacking me due to my karma for pointing out a problem is very malicious its almost like you are the alt of the poster youre the one who keeps mentioning karma not me another lie karmadecay is a very good place to start with it made me not post things that have been posted this year or months ago now a backtrack easier that than admit you were wrong and lying loool i have reported you to an admin for harassment and have blocked you if you wish to white knight more go ahead i even stated why i have this account in my posts its a secondary anonymous account for posting obscure video game items and art i even stated that in many posts its a month old repost account yeah i get that good luck in the future i hope you grow up says the guy reposting nintendo toys for kids and tattling on people who reply to them in threads hahahaha truly best regards now that is some fedora cringe

gaming,removed,ive been featured
gaming,removed,please reply im curious too
gaming,removed,personally i think fmv would be the best medium for a remake
gaming,removed,what always amazes me is the energy people put into criticizing the game im not talking about people who have legitimate complaints or concerns express them once in a comment section then move on and stop paying attention to the game theres nothing wrong with that im talking about a special kind of critic all games get criticized but many critics of star citizen seem unusually obsessed and vitriolic about the game and sc seems to have attracted an unusually high number of such critics i think theyre just jealous they can see its going to be a great game potentially the best game ever made so far in terms of depth and content and its definitely going to release relatively soon but theyre still afraid to spend money on it until its actually out so they feel like theyre missing out they know theyll regret not buying it sooner once its finished and so they shit on the game constantly to feel like theyre making the right decision by staying away from it when sc is released half of those critics will refuse to buy it because theyll have convinced themselves it was a bad game and the other half will be hypocrites and buy the game and act like they never said anything but praise about it meanwhile these obsessed critics are just proving one thing sc will be so great even critics cant let go of it
gaming,removed,i really liked the way they handled this in morrowind you couldnt fast travel everywhere and you had to walk most places but you could take a boat travel from mages guild to mages guild or use the silt striders all of which had limited destination options so you would have to enploy all three and sometimes still do some walking to get wherever you were going made it realistic but not insanely frustrating i mean still travelling in telvanni territory the northwesternmost corner of vvardenfell
gaming,removed,im glad im not the first person this has happened to

gaming,removed,the output does mean that the gpu is probably at least slightly upgraded how much power would you need to play a video in resolution i dont have a screen on my pc but checking if my graphics card is powerful enough to handle videos is the last thing i would do the graphics card just needs to support that resolution the actual processing of the video playing is going through the processor iirc
gaming,removed,it take place in an alternate time line where the french are even bigger bitches

gaming,removed,kojima has confirmed that the mascot is called ludens ludens is first referred to in a httpsenwikipediaorgwikithetimewanderers about the coming of a superior race of beings called ludens who experiment on humanity the opening lines of the trailer are from william blakes which has a lot of meanings but mostly that with time nature can restore itself even after the mistreatment of man that human judgement will have dire consequences and that there are multiple planes of existence finally going into the trailer immediately the beached whales and dead wildlife directly links to the poem showing the destruction of nature through humanity the disappearance of the baby can also show the divine retribution of mankind by not being able to continue living on earth as mortals in order to allow nature to be reborn as nature is all interconnected see the umbilical cords on mammals going into norman reedus character and the beings there is a definite religious allegory as well not only from the cross on his stomach but also to the positions the figures are taking creating an homage to crucifixion this can take on two tones either that norman is humanities only salvation as a jesus figure or that he is a christlike figure fallen from grace and must save humanity through the destruction of gods going back to the ludens theory this can link greatly back to the religious themes as well if the ludens are seen as godlike figures they could have been the ones who decided that humanity had gone too far and decided to destroy earth now norman is also the character model for the luden logo so some are assuming that norman himself is a luden and has gone against his people but i disagree because since he is wearing a handcuff i believe he is a human who has escaped some sort of testing facility the ludens have made to either test on humanity or enslave them the items around his neck are either keys or usbs of some kind showing that he is a harbringer of knowledge and the key to humanities survival though he is still not a completely pure being as seen from the child turning to oil there can also be a darker tone from the necklace possibly symbolising other children who had turned to oil though they clearly do not die due to the prints still existing in the sand could it be that simply the corporeal forms of humanity cease to exist this is a very valid claim when you look back to the auguries because of its hinting towards multiple planes of existence norman is chained to this one because he has not succumbed to humanities destruction of nature but at the same time is destined to be the one to break that cycle of humanity and the lyrics are the representation of normans character hes going to take the ludens head on though he is destined to be the unknown hero of humanity this as well as the theory of humanity being on another plane of existence than him is in the line seen but never heard buried underground the humans can clearly see him in some way from the way the footsteps on the sand follow him around but there is no way to contact one another copied and cleaned up from a v post seems pretty interesting im excited to learn more about the game in the future

gaming,removed,a few critique points i hope they consider there is one fatal flaw in the design so far you can pause the game to heal this mechanic is the bane of any action combat system as it removes any consideration of flow and replaces it with grindtoheal gameplay estus flasks encouraged pushing oneself rather than farming health regeneration ahead of time so you had a limit to how much danger you could absorb and had to endanger yourself to activate it both of those greatly increase incombat decisions another minor personal flaw i have is with a minimap and gps style navigation this goes against the sense of adventure i am expecting because it creates the effect of staring at a minimap to navigate rather than take in the world this effect is very prominent in gta and ubisoft open worlds morrowind had a very clever method of avoiding this but likely is never to return to a big budget game however oblivions compass located above the view vista helped prevent the minimap staring problem i would love to see them choose either of those methods rather than this minimap system lastly i hope they add difficulty options this grand sense of adventure is only maintained if kept in a state of readiness and from what i have seen from the gameplay the attacks are correctly telegraphed but are done so for twice as long as i would like having a difficulty option to disallow healing while paused while also increasing the speed of enemys attacks would make me much more confident in this game

gaming,removed,im guessing the keys youre seeing for are on or cdkeys am i correct about a month ago civ v was dirt cheap as a result of a bundle on humble bundle you could pick it up for or something like that chances are those are the keys youre seeing for the problem with purchasing a key from a grey market site like is that there is no guarantee that the key was acquired legally as there have been instance in the past where credit card fraudsters have bulk purchased games and sold the keys through only to have the keys revoked later after unsuspecting users have bought them and has borderline nil refunds an example being the massive issue that afflicted sniper elite grey market sites such as are not authorized retailers for just about every company ie they do not get keys directly from the publishers they get them from individuals who may or may not have used legal means to acquire the key originally and they often have extremely sketchy policies in the past would sign you up for a reoccurring monthly insurance cost during a purchase without informing the customer though i believe theyve stopped this ill never recommend purchasing through a grey market due to the risks involved lack of customer support sketchy business practices and the fact that the developers and publishers dont get a single cent if youre not willing to give the developerspublishers a cut you might as well go ahead and sail the seven seas at that point thats even cheaper i can only recommend going through an authorized retailer such as gmg steam official online store though theres a chance that gmg and might only sell windows keys ive seen situations like this before though i doubt thats the case as is quite a large company and i dont see them pulling something like that

gaming,removed,i know right this right here is my beef with religion it teaches people to dismiss the problems we face in life because things are meant to be that way or it is gods will but nobody can answer the follow up question why do good people suffer the answer is simple we as a species allow them to by not embracing science technology and our true potential i feel the world as a whole needs to stop using religion as a crutch to dismiss the problems of the current day
gaming,removed,the comment i replied to was about nasa existing under the obama administration and the general lack of interest of the public for science related subjects i made my comment because religion is a primary opponent of science and space exploration why bother exploring the universe and curing diseases if we all die and go to a magical place called heaven

gaming,removed,lets get it out of the way up front days gone is another zombie game theyre called freakers and theyre technically still alive but the end result is the same they want to kill you the thing that separates freakers from the zombies in the walking dead or resident evil is the sheer volume of them even if you had infinite ammo youd never be able to wipe out the horde that surrounds you at every turn instead you need to outrun them you need to use the environment around you to slow them down and buy every second you can your life depends on it in a demo shown at deacon the bounty hunter and exbiker gang member you play as is searching an abandoned sawmill for a man named two dog unfortunately two dog gets taken down pretty quickly rip two dog leaving deacon to fend off the horde this is where days gone shined the game is gorgeous to begin with but seeing literally hundreds of freakers on screen running toward you is overwhelming and terrifying we saw deacon crafting molotov cocktails à la the last of us blowing up oil drums knocking down obstacles and doing generally anything else he could to obstruct the terrifying horde on his tail at one point deacon runs through the upper level of a workshop eventually coming to a bridge after he runs across he turns and shoots the bridge just as the horde begins to cross it sending dozens of freakers careening toward the ground its a perfect example of using the environment against your attackers but it wasnt immediately clear how days gone will indicate which parts of the environment are destructible and which are fixed sony bend said its still working on indicators to communicate exactly that days gone certainly has my attention and its great to see sony bend doing something so ambitious after years of silence but it remains to be seen if deacons story will be enough to make it stand out from the other zombie games out there

gaming,removed,serious question how much is enough when it comes to graphic quality exactly what is promised by the developer now stop shilling
gaming,removed,i love hearing the shills buy guys if the graphics had been what was promised it would have actually been good dont hate ubisoft
gaming,removed,yet you keep posting
gaming,removed,youre pretending that ubisoft hasnt severely underperformed and underdelivered on all of their last several titles anyone who is into gaming at all knows those things to be facts you pretending not to know those facts and pretending to ask an innocent question about graphics quality makes it very obvious youre a shill shill you guys really shouldnt get paid for such lazy work at least put some pride into kissing ubisofts ass on reddit shill

gaming,removed,my wife bought it and has tremendous difficulty navigating the games awful interface due to her disability but she soldiered on as time wore on all the stuff she was excited about we slowly learned was either excised from the game or outright lied about atop all this it was her birthday present from me to her im glad steam gave somebody their money back but weve tried times and been shot down because her time drifted over hours with itmost of that time being spent swearing at the cludgy interface and crashing the rest has been disappointment after disappointment as we slowly figured out there were no factions nor trading as advertised then we found out about the big secret at the center of the galaxy i really feel cheated that her birthday present sucks so fucking bad bucks is a lot of money to us it just sucks that we arent allowed a refund because it took her longer to figure out it sucks because shes slower at playing the game and thus slower at figuring out how shitty it is till its too late thanks a lot hello games maybe next year i can get her something better

gaming,removed,holy fuck you summarized that entire sub so succinctly well done
gaming,removed,i hope those cocksuckers at hello games starve to death
gaming,removed,so thinking the nfl is shit equates being american you might have to look that word up in a dictionary probably have to find out what a dictionary is as well yall being bullied im school no im european so my school was fun and i learnt stuff i managed to not be involved in a school shooting which i wouldnt have been able to over the pond
gaming,removed,you know when an article links to some common reddit post that its all bullshit
gaming,removed,then why the fuck did it release unfinished if you can see it being better and better listen here you little shit you might like getting cucked and support a shitty overpromised early access game after launch but those of us who were lied to will bitch about it and demand our money back if you love this fucking game so much and have a problem with people criticizing it and getting their money back then you pick up all the refund cost and give it back to sean like the cuck loving little bitch you are
gaming,removed,might be fucked but it made me laugh just imagining him hanging after all he did
gaming,removed,the pirate bay get the torrent with the most seeders there will also be instructions on the page
gaming,removed,how is the title misleading
gaming,removed,maybe the game sucks but he still wants to try it because he might find some kind of fun in it because everyone has different things that they like go take your autism somewhere else you mongoloid retard
gaming,removed,economic psychology is freakin complicated lets pretend they didnt even care about making a good game but just about making money totally hypothetical do you think if it had been priced at three times as many people would have bought it no way no mans sky was all about hype and the developers knew it compare it to their last game joe danger it was a game with decent quality and rather little hype i believe the initial price was and it sold copies in its first three months of release not bad for an indiegame but it absolutely pales in comparison to no mans sky about times as many copies were sold up until the hours after its release and for times the price so assuming the cost of developement was the same no mans sky was roughly times more profitable thats dollar bills raining from the skylevel profit setting a high initial price is the way to go if youre developing an overly hyped game and you know it wont live up to the expectations after the first giant wave there isnt much money to be made for a consumer who is willing to preorder a game or buy it on its release day the difference between and isnt as significant as for the game company most consumers can afford either or and dont mind the difference too much if they have been eagerly waiting for the game in fact a high price can have the strange effect of raising the expectations and fueling the hype if everybodys talking about it and its a full price game people also expect a aaa title in terms of size quality
gaming,removed,first result that pops up right now is skidrow which afaik is pretty legit that being said yes google censors the shit out of its results and trying to get some torrent from blind googling when you have no idea what is what is pretty dangerous

gaming,removed,spoilers no tears i chose to destroy arcadia bay because why not if whole game was leading to that point and choosing not to would be like it was only a dream and game never happened but yeah other ending was strong
gaming,removed,im asian would have been less words
gaming,removed,she doesnt have too many problems with most games further as the time spent in the game points out she was able to play it to a degree but the push button and hold for every single thing in the interface and the nonstop inventory shell game quickly overcame the fun factor in short its a slog for most folksfor her its no fun at all add in all the stuff that was cut or not in the game and pretty soon you have a hot mess of not fun it was a birthday gift as well she really tried to like it plus we dont like to return things it was also the first steam game on her own personal acct she normally uses mine ultimately it kinda sucks we are now apparently stuck with a fairly funless game and the non communication from hello games about all these issues plus the realisation about the ending finally pushed us over to try to get a refund which as of this morning doesnt look like its happening anyways so
gaming,removed,proof of what receipt for the game oh you mean disability i shouldnt have to submit a note from a doctor to a company to be refunded on a purchase it should be in good faith that said there is plenty of proof i have boxes full of prescription medication she has to take would steam want pics of those as well that to me is a bit invasive for refunding a damn video game purchase especially since i went out on a limb of trust to preorder the thing to start with which has now obviously been misplaced now as far as your concerned you can believe me or not but ultimately why would i lie i am too damn old for internet points to mean anything to me
gaming,removed,she opened a support ticket i commented on it as well explaining the situation as well no one responded other than a terse you played more than hours this is in addition to other attempts once i found out some other folks had gotten refunds but they certainly arent doing it en masse the way the articles and reddit would have you believe also i dont want to make steam angry or cause a problem for them too much as i know we are outside of the rules of return i just thought we could squeak by too given our circumstances i mean most of that time was either her or i figuring out how to do things or figuring out why it crashed or trying out controllerkeyboard mouse setups that would work out pretty soon that hour mark is loooooooong gone
gaming,removed,clever
gaming,removed,well good on you captain obvious normally i dont preorder this was an exception as it was a gift and looked intriguing heck were old bethesda fans we know to expect bugs and crashing on new titles but honestly who wouldve guessed in the goddamn interface would be this tedious and goofy and irritating i will know better next time for sure
gaming,removed,well thanks doesnt look like it will happen though looks like we are stuck with it
gaming,removed,i dont really pirate games closest i get is emulators for old systems but you aint wrong i never dreamed theyd fuck it up this badly
gaming,removed,its all over if you truly want to spoil it for yourself but i have to say it will utterly kill the game for you you tube it if you dare its really lame
gaming,removed,but complaining and bitching online is honestly a lot more work than actually doing something about it in most cases you literally just make a complaint to them and they look into it just write your complaints into a textbox on their website they might callemail you to follow up but they are the ones who go through the effort of pursuing it preordering is always going to exist theres always going to be people that are love the previews or loved the previous game and want to play the sequel day one i dont think youll ever stop people from preordering all youre going to do is create this negative subculture that has hatred towards those that fall in love with games before they come out and meanwhile publishers are going to keep getting rich exploiting people the cry to avoid preorders and the negative subculture has been going on for a few years now but do you wanna see something depressing game preorder sales total sales percentage of sales before it was released release year halo million halo million million halo million million halo reach million million halo million million halo million million note that halo preorder sales are both hard to find and the worst for the series since it was first and barely anyone even owned xbox at that point all of these people making these cries and yet its had basically no impact halo has average about of its sales through preorders for its entire lifetime with the biggest dip for reach even halo which has done pretty horribly for a halo game and had huge warnings not to preorder it did of its sales through preorders now of course this is only one franchise but its one of the best selling franchises and its pretty long lived with consistent releases every years in the fall so it makes it a really great candidate to see the progression of preorders without biases controlled both the time of year and franchise popularity variable attack the real problem here its really simple id do it if i have ever felt disappointed about a game i preordered but i havent so i cant but many people here on this thread can
gaming,removed,yes poor people should never enjoy anything ever the sick and infirm should only use their money for necessities for fun irs to always be above their station it must be hard to be so cynical will bucks be the end of us no but if buck is truly nothing to you then why not throw it this way if you have any doubts about it then well i think youve answered your own question and it means more to you as well
gaming,removed,or at least not have a hard limit on special cases like this nobody knew how bad it was for a while
gaming,removed,i am unfamiliar with it unsure my wife would like it but thank you kindly i am sure someone in the thread is clamoring for it though or maybe lure some beauty to your side with it seriously though thanks but my wife usually is a simsbethesdasim city gal this was a rare step out side that for us that went sideways again thank you for the offer though
gaming,removed,not happening for me i am afraid rejected again
gaming,removed,thanks so much but it wouldnt be right we may get a refund yet use it to ask a lovely person out to dinner and start your own journey thats a much better gift to us after all
gaming,removed,i bet she is a fat whore lmao
gaming,removed,dude what okay lets start with the blown timelines you mean something that is extremely common in modern game development and also something that is rarely seen because of star citizens unusually transparent process from the getgo the fact that they started churning out bs ships to raise more money once they realized that it was a quick way to raise some extra cash what bs ships so far most of the announced ships actually have concepts andor models and the amount of usable ships are constantly growing as has been the intention from the very beginning nothing has changed from the original intentions in that regard money being mismanaged with the door being just one of the best examples of that also the only example youve provided and one that obviously nobody cares about imo the community like it as much as the people who wanted it there in the first place its an amusing thing that the backer community gets a chuckle out of and dont mind at all as far as i can see part of the twoway process that star citizen has been founded upon the changing of major points of the tos the refunding parts yeah im not surprised they turned up at all its entirely appropriate given cigs transition from a small kickstarterbased team to a fully fledged development company and a necessary change at that the employee churn that has been well documented how much it sucks to work at cig this is absolute bs the origins of those accusations turned out to be anonymous insider information the employee that claimed to have exposed cigs terrible work environment never actually reliably disclosed any evidence whatsoever that they were genuine you know who capitalised on that drama as soon as it kicked off none other than derek smart surprise surprise did you also read the information from several other cig employees that were absolutely surprised and disparaged the original complaints there are so many warning flags with star citizen that you gotta be absolutely blind not to see them no there really isnt nothing whatsoever has gone awry of the original specification or scope of the games development the company itself is constantly expanding and every update demo shows new progress there has undeniably been some hiccups along the way but nothing that hasnt been worked around and nothing that has been provably hidden behind veils of deceit the only thing unusual about star citizens current development process is the transparency of it compared to most development cycles and the fact that its broken records that and the fact that chris roberts isnt just some lackadaisical junior developer with aspirations bigger than his abilities but an accomplished game developer who is absolutely in his element with extensive and relevant experience in this area offers much more reason to trust him and his company than any of his competitors or doubters if star citizen does turn out to be a scam theyve played all their cards amazingly well and put more effort into it than ive ever seen in a ripoff before i wouldnt even be mad they could keep my money the fact that you think of derek smart as anything but a manipulative lying coward and a bully shows me that you really arent aware of the state that things currently are or have been during star citizens development preferring to take information from chinese whispers and shitstirrers than the actual truth but please dont carry them on because theyre simply not true
gaming,removed,virgins
gaming,removed,i wholeheartedly agree its absolute shit that almost no games these days support controllers that arent xinput compatible if microsoft would just open up xinput and include generic emulation support in windows for any controller then it wouldnt be an issue im tired of fucking around with to get my generic usb gamepad to function correctly and its worrying on some games like black ops because im worried im going to get banned i do have a controller but i dont have the adapter so i currently just have to use the generic gamepad
gaming,removed,im saying rgaming shouldnt allow posts encouraging people to buy a game this is nuanced this does not mean people cannot do so in the comment section it does not mean people can not still circlejerk over games it does not mean steam sale suggestion threads still cant happen but posts like this one should be taken down hows it different from the dishonoured marketing team posting it

gaming,removed,id check if any of them torrent or similar and if they leave it uploading force them to limit what it uses if so is pretty huge you could easily download a shitton of streaming at the same time with it games in general tend to use very little actual bandwidth compared to what your maximum is but multiple users are going to case a minor delay reagrdless ping times latency is far more important since the actual bandwidth used by something like overwatchcsgo is pretty low

gaming,removed,you have called me lazy lacking impulse control inept lacking self control ignorant and you have attempted to criticize my life choices in this thread please try to have a decent discussion without the banter it makes you come across as someone half your age you know absolutely nothing about the person you are having a discussion with and i havent tried to be condescending in any way towards you early access didnt hit the market until minecraft in that would put you at years old i have no idea when you became a self funded gamer from your pc to the titles you buy on the regular it was also around this time when cod was only on its first release of and most other long running sequel titles were being released after the creation of your introduction into the industry as a consumer absolutely is relevant as it explains your perception of the market it also sheds light on your assumption of how closed and open beta testing with nda is a failed model everything you mention as a drawback to this model is and has been the case with ea titles as well so your point on this is moot and doesnt offer any advantage to the ea title httpsenwikipediaorgwikiearlyaccess take a read below early access reception has not been taken well in recent years ea promotes sub standard game releases and lowers the market value of games by conditioning consumers and developers by validating and accepting unfinished games as the norm you are already seeing this bleed into aaa titles gamasutra considered the concept of early access particularly steams approach as one of the five trends in that defined the direction that the video game industry was headed the early access approach has been criticized by some as noted by ben kurchera of polygon stated that the early access model validates the use of unfinished games as a valid business strategy while those that buy into the early access do get an incomplete game to play test out and provide input to the developers these people also run the risk that the game will never be completed or may be a subpar product a study using steams early access as of november found that only of the titles submitted as early access had made it to a final release form sergey galyonkin the creator of the steam spy tool to estimate sales of games through steam profiles identified that contrary to popular belief early access titles only gain one major sales boost when the game is first released in early access on steam as opposed to having a second sales boost once the game leaves early access there have been some notable examples of failures of the early access approach the game earth year was placed on steams early access with numerous promised features but found by those that purchased the title that the game has numerous programming bugs making it unplayable that it failed to approach its promises on the product page and used a number of assets from the commercial game engine many users including jim sterling of the escapist called out on both its developer killing day studios for abusing the early access program and for valve to remove the title for fraudulently representing gameplay valve subsequently removed the title and refunded money noting that while developers using early access have the right to promote and set the pricing for their games steam does require honesty from developers in the marketing of their games another example is the forementioned spacebase while the development team from double fine had laid out plans for several features and gameplay improvements over time double fine opted to end its fulltime development completing its early access and releasing a final product that while fully playable lacked many of the planned features the company will continue to fix critical bugs with the game and will include support for user modifications via steams workshop channel but will not create any new content for the game itself disappointing many players of the game that were looking forwards to these planned features shortly after the release of twelve employees were laid off including the programmer and project lead jp lebreton later on the double fine forums it was announced that there were no further plans for patches and there was no team assigned to the project leaving steam workshop integration in limbo double fines tim schafer stated that they opted for this solution as while represented their first experiment with the early access approach they had reached a point where the amount of money earned from sales of the game in early access were not covering the production costs and the timeline to reach the planned goals would have been several years down the road due to some of these more notable failures by early access has gained a negative connotation as games do not have the quality assurances of complete titles and in the case of steams early access the lack of curating and testing by steam to make sure the games are representative of the storefronts description some players also worry about the double dip effect in which a game may be promoted twice first through its introduction on early access and then on its subsequent full release in november valve updated its early access rules for developers to address concerns that had been raised among these include the statement that games on early access should be in a playable alpha or beta state there are clear expectations of what the final product of the game will be like and that the developer intends to continue work on the game and can be financial stable to ultimately release a finished product other games have been considered by commentators to have used the early access approach well in light of the above concerns typically bringing nearfinished products with frequent and continual content updates and direct interaction between developer and players to improve the product before its final release games with roguelike features appear well suited to take advantage of early access allowing the developers to tweak the procedural generation systems with player feedback several titles that have used steams early access in such a manner include invisible inc nuclear throne armello broforce prison architect darkest dungeon besiege infinifactory subnautica ark survival evolved and cryptark it looks like this is an issue largely felt my consumers already and steam has been putting steps in to address my current concerns about it due to past experiences we can certainly say that consumers should hold their dollars but what about holding off game development until you have resources and a clear and flushed out timeline and feature list first i already addressed your request for refund post in a previous response steam and other online venders will not allow a refund on any game if two hours are played of it i have stated that for ea games and many aaa games this window is not large enough please stop assuming that i pile my money and back these games i learned my lesson long ago and no longer play alphabeta games unless they are free to play but as i sit casually on the sidelines waiting for things to improve i see my steam page filled with junk nearly every aaa game is released with bugs lack of promised features and some are even unplayable to the large amount of the playerbase you can sit there and spew excuses for them all you want however games like halflife diablo and command and conquer counter strike quake warcraft starcraft age of empires mechwarrior and many other games managed to get created and released with far more features no nickel and dime dlc and were completely playable by everyone upon release where patches were only ever released to fix minor issuesglitches they were also properly qad and beta tested despite there being times as many hardware venders adding to the complexity of mixed and matched hardware years ago all the way up to game developers were getting things right the games were playable on release had lots of features they were crazy innovative right now the market is stagnant and greedy

gaming,removed,the recommended skyrim special edition pc specs gb free hdd space as for the games size on and xbox one its pretty big heres what youre looking at in north america and europe gb north america gb europe xbox one gb north america gb europe why is the pc version smaller usually pc releases of games are bigger than console ports
gaming,removed,yes bethesda is remastering a yearold game because it doesnt run on the current consoles and they know they can squeeze a full us out of people who enjoyed the original on who get some mods and slightly better graphics meanwhile pc users can still run the steam copy we bought on release with thousands of hours of mod content and insane graphics mods the entire time this is just the deal for console players now the last of us remastered was twice as bullshit that game was years old and i know some people who paid twice for it over that time span bethesdas being careful not to step on the toes of pc gamers by not introducing this practice on pc though its still the anticonsumer practice that this sub partially exists to call out actually i was hoping for a morrowind or oblivion remaster neither of them were as popular as skyrim and i dont think that either had a console either way they deserve a little love far more than a game that still holds up just fine whose only flaw is that it doesnt run on the new consoles not even a fault of the game mind just some jackass decision by console execs to force players to buy new games every few years
gaming,removed,hehe it is httpgetwreckedcom
gaming,removed,the nes had lower specs than its competition the master system yet it outsold everywhere except south america the snes excelled over its competition in some respects while the opposite is true in others the outsold the technologically superior gamecube largely due to the gimmick of offering more than a gaming experience with its dvd functionality and then the wii built entirely around a gimmick and of lesser horsepower than anything else on the market at the time became the highest selling console for nintendo thus far nintendos entire track record has been that good specs and a lack of gimmicks alone are not the deciding factors in the console wars

gaming,removed,i had to login just to reply to this because i disagree with your stance on blizzard lets get this out of the way i am a huge blizzard fan and starcraft is my favorite game so yes my opinion is very biased not looking to bash you or anything i just want to share my opinion lets start with starcraft i would argue that starcraft has jump started esports in the current years their first official tournaments started about a year before the first official league of legends tournament league of legends is the most popular competitive esports games in existence based on player number and monetary support starcraft had several huge tournaments in arenas around the world starting in with blizzcon using the huge irvine auditorium to showcase their wcs finals the stage is amazing btw if you havent seen it sources httpsenwikipediaorgwikistarcraftiiwingsofliberty please see the reception and professional competition sections next lets look at heroes of the storm in a very saturated moba market heroes is doing surprisingly well with active users based on numbers from hotslogscom it continues to be updated frequently with new heroes and a recent overhaul to the matchmakingranking system im not here to argue that it is better or worse than other mobas but shitty franchise mashup is not the description many would use for the game it is a great game for any blizzard fans as the heroes that are added from their other franchises are represented very well tracer from overwatch is a great example it does have the lowest player number and support out of all the other mobas but it is only just over a year old it continues to see support from several community sites including our very own rheroesofthestorm it is great for casual players and hardcore players alike plus its free as for the companys well being their quarterly income statements as well as their profit margins have gone up since june of last year based on minimal research on my end but there are plenty of reports out there that prove this statement to be true httpsfinanceyahoocomqissatvi this leads me to the conclusion that blizzard is not tanking at all actually it is huge powerhouse in the gaming world with the recent release of owerwatch which was a huge success i think its safe to say that blizzard is doing quite well for now we could argue that they have played all their cards for now and they will only decline from here but based on their track record of great games great customer support and supportive developers i think blizzard will be around for quite a while ps while starcraft player base continues to dwindle their developers still show amazing support by releasing weekly community feedback updates new maps new weekly coop mutators and more though he has been offline since june heroes of the storms dustin browder replies to tweets on a daily basis and is very open with the player base on decisions they are making behind the scenes httpstwittercomdustinbrowderlangen

gaming,removed,when the niche media that covers gaming joins together to profess hatred for their audience there is a problem they circle the wagons to defend each other deride good games because they dont conform with their political agenda boost shitty games that do conform with their political agenda and they form an echo chamber to make sure their views are propagated so they sound more legitimate if gaming is an otherwise healthy organism gaming journalism is the cancer bringing it down

gaming,removed,i thought this game was pretty bad and i did rely on reviews as to whether or not to buy to be fair though it was only £ or so got bored after a few hours felt like the batman style combat just wasnt replicated properly the fluidity wasnt there for me also it was way too easy i died like times and that was as a result of me just being reckless and bored the nemesis system was pretty cool but i never felt an emotional attachment to any of the enemies never once felt like i needed to avenge my previous death or anything

gaming,removed,you might think that but youd be wrong i bought a xbox one wireless controller for pc came with this exact dongle its range is not much over if perfectly unobstructed it comes with a extension cable and you absolutely have to use it i ran my dongle and stuck it on the under side of my desk so its only a foot away from my controller without doing this it had signal problems was very surprised how poor the range is since my blue tooth headphones work anywhere in my house
gaming,removed,also so people are more accepting of the price if its not the size of a nickel

gaming,removed,i think its because it can support up to controllers and stereo headsets i think for the amount of thinks you can hook up to it its fair to say that the size is worth it
gaming,removed,upvote for the guy who commented to do so
gaming,removed,httpimgurcombxbwzlepng to get the sizes right i started with a pic of the intel compute stick then took a pic of the xbox controller dongle and resized it until the sizes of the usb plugs matched since those are a standard size so this should be quite literally what it would look like
gaming,removed,wants wireless xbox controllers for pc gets it complains fuck this generation
gaming,removed,thats true i honestly wish some of those dongles werent so fucking small if you have a usb port thats slightly inset on one side of your rig good fucking luck getting the damn thing out
gaming,removed,hardcore gamer friends lul casual
gaming,removed,the problem with procedural generation or at least what i think op means is that its often used as the sole way to generate world content procedural generation is fantastic when you use it to get most of the grunt work done the problem comes when they rely on procedural generation for too much of the world things tend to get repetitive if you dont keep an eye on it pg is like cgi its best when you dont notice it i agree on day dlc if its purely cosmetic its fine for the most part i think youre just harping on op with the no content part as its obvious that what op meant was that some games feel hollow like theres not much to do whether lack of quests in an rpg not enough weapons or maps in an online shooter or not enough features in a sandbox no content was an exaggeration to make a point hostageware is hard to prevent every platform is going to have exclusives how else are you going to sell a console in but i would like to see a source on the pc vs console sales thing as for season passes i hate the if theyre going to do it anyways because it disregards that whatever they were going to do anyway might be wrong in the first place dlc is different for every game games like witcher had a ton of free dlc with only an expansion pack coming later yes an actual expansion pack in games like battlefield paid dlc but all i have heard about bf dlc is that it contains a lot of content and is easily worth the money which i would also deem as fair but games like cod throw maps and a gun into a pack call it dlc multiply by and bundle them in a season pass i believe this is why season passes are often regarded as a bad thing because in many games they are plain and simple cash grabs

gaming,removed,console versions are highly optimized for the hardware they run on because there are a very small number of hardware combinations i dont call highly optimised in terms of actual game performance youd probably have to bump up the pc price point a bit still very true that higher end pcs can get much better graphics and performance httpiimgurcompcftliipng httppcpartpickercomlistywhxyf

gaming,removed,i think future console generations are going to be a very tough sell lets look at the options the xbox one s is practically going to be dead on arrival because of the scorpio rendering it pointless apart from the cheap price point what does it have going for it if you dont own an xbox one already the isnt going to have the specs of the scorpio and itll automatically look weaker in comparison both the and scorpio are likely to have ridiculously high price points microsoft is pledging to put everything on windows pcs anyway further removing the need for any xbox consoles owners of the vanilla consoles like me are likely to be left in the dust as we now have to worry about one of the things we didnt have to concern ourselves with before will games run on our basic systems all that and we have to pay for online with no backwards compatibility basically as the console prices increase xbox exclusivity decreases and console owners now have new worries the gap between pc and console is getting narrower and narrower so theres less and less reason to stick to console rather than make the switch to pc plus pc owners have the added luxury of not having the rug pulled from underneath them three years after a console launch i mainly stick with consoles for ease of use tradition i prefer controllers over mouse and keyboard and there are several genres and series that id have a tougher time finding on pc jrpgs gran turismo etc that might not be worth it though or if it is its not worth buying a console until years down the line after the launch of a new console generation

gaming,removed,it covers a load of things its not necessarily been actually prayed over but the slaughterhouse could be approved as following halal practice and thats good enough for the blessing bit the process is also covered such as method of slaughter cut throat bled out no stunning or bolt through the head also separation of meats knives etc absolutely no pork bear in mind absolutely none of the rules cover humane slaughter or cleanliness in a local governmenthealth dept sense so something could be halal but not made with the cleanest possible conditions also you can find much the same food nothalal eg middle eastern food made in a turkish or cypriot place curries made in a hindu establishment tldr basically halal means nothing to most westerners and isnt a mark of good quality or bad

gaming,removed,good companion but when i took other routes killing that prick was easily the best part of the game
gaming,removed,thanks for the info this pretty much fullfills my curiosity also while doing my brief research i came across a post that asked if the two universes of fantasy and are connected and someone responded that the devs said they are in no way connected so your years in the future statement might be false good guess tho i also thought might be the future of fantasy

gaming,removed,all of these are fantastic your style is pretty much exactly what i would want to see in a mega man x high definition remake if you will permit me i would like to offer a couple of suggestions all of which you are welcome to ignore storm eagle seems to be a bit too thin in the neck httptalismancoinscomcontentcatalogbaldeagleprofileportraitjpg have that really solid triangular taper upward from their neck to their head this one seems more like a bit of an though i do like your more serious and sinister take on penguin i think it also loses a bit of what makes him identifiable as a penguin silhouettewise however i am not sure how to make him seem more penguinlike so this might not be helpful criticism please do vile zero the hornetcopter and construction hat classic bad guy keep up he incredible work you seriously should be on the official capcom concept art team
gaming,removed,they even baited the jet in with another jet its a trap
gaming,removed,we do want to add a ton of features like weve just discussed freighters bases these type of things but we want to do it for free youve paid for the game so you should get this stuff without paying even more money so no there will be no paid dlc just patches that was about a week ago during a recent interview with the press outlet daily star hello games sean murray stated that he could not rule out the possibility that no mans sky will go on to have some paid dlc in the future this admission comes in spite of the fact that the studios founder declared last week that any and all of the postlaunch content for the game would come via free updates and that was two days ago

gaming,removed,computers are deterministic every pseudo random number generator in existence will give always give the same result if you use the same seed value that wont change until quantum computers are a thing anyways xcom preserves the seed value in save games so reloading a save will restore said seed value and you will always get the same result unless you enable the second wave option to tell it not to do that sane people would use the system time as a seed value but xcom does not do that it uses the value in the esi register some offset to pull a value from memory to be used as a seed applies its prng formula and then puts it back to be used as the seed for the next roll changing the value stored in the esi register will result in a different seed being pulled for your shot and you can accomplish this by taking different actions on the lead up to the shot or taking actions in a different order
gaming,removed,this meme actually originated from a raspberry pi powered randomized meme imagetemplate creator i cannot reference the exact meme due to the sheer number of memes that have been generated from this bot go check him out on facebook or twitter

gaming,removed,its not that scummy then at least you know exactly how much you spend still as fuck probably
gaming,removed,to be honest i have lowered my standards of acceptable so much that im fine with playing a game where low payers sub range can get the best gear after grinding a lot but even with that its so hard to find a single game that doesnt go overboard so i pretty much went back to singleplayer games and modding i kinda wish some good sub games or non games appear later on something like archeage without botting hacking cheating and the massive maybe even servers separated by maximum allowed play time thatd be really nice imagine if only people who played hours a day can play one server and the other server is for people who play hours a day maybe that way we can have a competitive experience that is actually kinda fair though that has a problem with friends separating or people having lessmore time for a few weeks or so
gaming,removed,id be fine with disabled trading if that means no more bots or hacking i mean sure people would hack but that means they are sacrificing their account so nobody who plans on playing a lot should do it lots of people like trading though

gaming,removed,come on now there is time for story and time for gameplay rdr comes to mind john is also extremely polite to women often calling bonnie macfarlane miss macfarlane even after she has asked him to call her bonnie he also does anything possible to keep women safe even pistolwhipping irish to defend two nuns he was holding up in contrast to his politeness to women john is unafraid to take the moral highground when dealing with less than reputable characters like irish with his alcoholism and nigel west dickens with his swindling of gullible people john seems to be one of the only men in the game that is loyal to his wife he also seems to get angrier when someone mentions his wifes past than his own but during gameplay you can tnt nuns and slit the throat of women while they are hog tied on train tracks and they explode into gore however mafia games were never about giving you freedom they are about giving you an idea and selling it they will force story into gameplay and that is how they do their thing no need to get pitchforks up this line of thought always has trouble unless we are playing an rpg like dark souls where everyone can be what they want to be
gaming,removed,i have shoes give me money
gaming,removed,huh no copy protection on the game they wrote i didnt know this software was ever actually for sale outside of the nintendo versions
gaming,removed,the sad thing is if this game wasnt so fucking over hyped and so many false promises were made and the price wasnt insanely ridiculous for an indy game it probably wouldve been a cool game with decent reviews if this game was like and no promises to do a bunch of shit you cant do were made id be down with it to fly around in a cool space with colourful cool graphics and explore a few planets sure id probably lose interest in it after hours max but for that is about cents an hour to have fun for hours the fact people are expecting all kinds of things the game doesnt have because of broken promises and the absolutely retarded price tag are what killed this game not the game itself if it was marketed properly and priced properly i bet it wouldve been a decent indy hit
gaming,removed,i deleted the torrent

gaming,removed,i was on the hype train from what i can remember the devs reveal of information was something like is there multiplayer yes pc version have didnt say until close to release when it was finalized and showed it off in glorious fashion hows magic work were using a mana system and so on and so forth another hype train i boarded was never promised anything they couldnt put into the game id say the devs are responsible for the terrible and scathing reviews their game is receiving the devs are also responsible for their maybes youll see i dont want to spoil it for you bullshit responses game devs kinda have to have your interests at heart if hello games makes another game and doesnt dissolve after nms they will have a fraction of the sales they simply do not have a marketable name anymore cd projekt red could put out a turd of a game but because of their name recognition they would make millions they wont because they want to hold onto that name recognition for the good of their website and for the good of their future game projects the notion that game devs will lie simply to sell you something is ludicrous bad game devs will sure as is the case with hello games considering sean murray came from ea it seems to make sense good game devs will tell you what they can do and not promise you the world
gaming,removed,lol people have been complaining about spore for a decade because people have been playing the whole time people who complain about spore have no sense of creativity the kind that are obsessed with clickers and idlers lazy games for lazy casuals the possibilities really are endless you just need an imagination

gaming,removed,head to rbuildapc and they can help you a ton let them know what budget you have and what you plan to use it for and theyre really good with giving you a list of parts within that budget once you have the parts its as easy as putting each part into its slot you just need to make sure to handle every part with care

gaming,removed,i love rainbow six it is the best fps ive ever played and i have not put it down since launch the dev team is very good at communicating on reddit and they patch it times per month with free content drops every months like i said best fps ive played i started playing fpss with cs source go insurgency the mod and newer standalone red orchestra cod i played exclusively search and destroy on hardcore mode none of those games gets my heart pounding like siege does and its a beautiful game to boot the destruction is not merely a gimmick but a critical part of core game play and strategy also when you prone you can see your feet in front of you the game has a steep learning curve and you may struggle when you start but once you learn the maps and a few basic strats and the general dos and donts you wont put it down completely different game than overwatch ow is too cartoony and zanny for lack of better term in my opinion but it is a blizzard game so it has tons of players for that alone
gaming,removed,this surprisingly made me very happy
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,i havent worked in years what is a career and yes i do have a computer
gaming,removed,despite all these videos this actually makes me really excited for this game realistic combat where a single infantry person can take out a tank at great risk but with reasonable chance of success using terrain to their advantage except maybe for that part where you start unloading your smg at the tank anyway awesome
gaming,removed,fuck people are so god damn cheap it is fucking more for the year who gives a fuck if you are too poor to afford an extra in a year than you dont deserve to own a console and you should just go torrent all your games onto pc for free

gaming,removed,just using your level of grammar and syntax sweetie you seem to want dumbs really badly so tell you what ill now just use the turd in all caps to refer to you that sounds fair the turd quote i just wasnt able to get into it because of how certain visual details of the game were glossed over and constructed rather lazily that right there says you like a child didnt like it based purely on visuals check again the turd it is site even if it wasnt im sorry the turd has to resort to spelling error corrections just to get what the turd thinks is a win tsk tsk i see the turd again quoted something i didnt say the turd really enjoys lying it seems to make the turd feel better also i love how the turd has to take what i called the turd and use it against me because the turd likes how it sounds tsk tsk tsk a girl is able to travel back in time a few minutes and years if she has a picture of herself from the past and has the same conscious mind where she is not affected by the world around her but everything else is and has a vision of a storm destroying her town all while using that to solve a mystery of murder and molestationwow what game hasnt done that before fuck is the turd pathetic the turd name me anything close to that why is it unoriginal the turd what was obvious the turd thank you for proving my point on call of duty the turd whoops the turd proved me right the turd danced like no one has before around that the turd did not give the turds own opinion so the turd just linked a random website no the turd losers are trolls like the turd who now stalk smarter and better peoples reddit posts and makes up stuff about them i have a job the turd but i can bet with your random addressing of that the turd doesnt dawwww sad face the turd the turd is a nobody and has to take it out out the turds betters the turd cant make a single reddit post that gets any attention why because the turd is a nobody and now the turd is once again copying tactics of the turds betters and using my insults and sarcasm at the end to point out how bad the turd truly is the turd lost in the beginning when the turd was down voted into oblivion now be a good the turd and make up more stuff for me to laugh at the turd wawawewa eat my asshole

gaming,removed,which is precisely why everyone hates preston in fallout i had a similar experience with the companions in skyrim since this was my first real experience with the radiant quest system i completed the first four or five tasks enthusiastically then the next five quests unhappily i had it fixed in my mind that after completing some unknown number of quests something else would happen that would take the game to a new level so i just kept churning through them as fast as possible we need you to go kill a bear in falkreath stop fast travel turboshout to the marked location walk in beat up the whatever walk out fasttravel back to the companions you killed the whatever thats great and tab tab tab click random conversation options we need you to go kill a bear damnit it never paid off but i did develop some skills with the ui i essentially became leon the professional for skyrim pest control some npcs are huddled in the corner of their homes in sheer terror at this invading monstrosity without warning the front door of their hovel busts open and in walks this dude with an enormous axe who chops the menace to bits turns around walks out and vanishes into the night never even says a word

gaming,removed,if you dont get this post then you are in for a treat the title is perfect because even though it completely tells you what to look at on the picture you follow the words down in an order that if followed how i explain you will get the joke if you dont follow it you wont know what to read or look at to understand this post if you understand the jokethe main point of the entire post is that this pokemon trainer has star dust which is an incredible amount and they also have a mew which is a legendary pokemon that i am assuming nobody has caught yet if you viewed this post correctly then you have followed the words down in the correct order and have the knowledge required to understand it when you first click on the post the first thing you do is look at the pokemon and its name not the two moves at the bottom that the title tells you to look at you look at the mew and its name because it is the center focus of the picture and its just some psycological shit pretty much behind this then your eyes move down one to its hp then maybe scan over type weight then your eyes move down to the start dust value and you notice the crazy amount that they have and people that play pokemon go understand that having this much star dust would be crazy so crazy and insane that it makes you question your pokemon go career itself itself so there for you are confused which is the first move on the list of moves confusion is the first move and that is literally the op breaking the wall and calling out the emotion you are feeling when you are reading the remainder of the post then finally your eyes move down to the word photoshop and then you realize that the reason behind all of these crazy factors about this post is that is was actually photoshopped and not legit confusion and photoshop are the two words that you were originally directed to look at from the title if you did not understand the post you did not understand it because you either dont know what the hell a mew is maybe you do but you dont really know all of the pokemon that well because you are a casual so you just recognize it as some random pokemon and since you dont know what pokemon this really is you dont get confused by how this person has captured it then you probably scan down at the other words and numbers and they are irrelevant to you and you dont know that importance they have to the post you read confusion and you either believe that confusion is an actual move used by pokemon and you are not confused anyways so when you read the word photoshop you just simply dont get it and you probably think its a move because confusion actually might be a move and it makes sense because mew is some weird mystical pokemon that seems like he would confuse people or some shit or you dont know anything about pokemon at all and confusion is just another random word on this post that you dont get tldr this was pretty much my explanation of this post and it shows both views from both the people the understand the joke and the peopl that dont understand it you basically either have the knowledge of pokemon required to understand the joke and you get it or you do not and you simply dont understand it or a third option you are like me and you kind of have some knowledge about pokemon go and you understand that star dust is a lot but youre only a level pokemon trainer and have caught like pokemon because you never leave your house to actually play a video game that you are not really that interested in but you are kind of interested because you kind of liked pokemon back in the day and all of your friends and the world are playing this game so you do too and you just assume that is the amount of star dust that you will have at a high level and so you are not confused by the high star dust count and a pokemon that may or may not be legendary and so you dont get it but have the potential too like me that description of a person reading this post is me and i figured it out baby woo i fucking did it i tore apart this post entirely and completely explained it yeah boi
gaming,removed,well i dont know anything about kansas other than its a bit like arkansas driving through is like field field hey look a cow field other than that how are things

gaming,removed,theyre required to ship within hours and generally package well because they dont want az claims and complaints source am a amazon seller
gaming,removed,you can get converters for pretty much any classic controller to usb this allows you to play with oem contolrollers which feel way better than the new usb ones but also lets you use classic aftermarket controllers like the boomerang shaped turbo controller which has a special place in my heart
gaming,removed,you fucking mongoloid its not a re skin its a new form that gives the same pokemon a new typing its great because they make the older pokemon more relevant again it also lets them show pokemon adapting to their surroundings much like how on the galapagos islands same species of birds have slightly different beaks because of the different foods they have available to them get your head out of your ass and learn to look at things objectively

gaming,removed,retardation more likely
gaming,removed,yes but the company builds a model based on these preorders whether you buy it or not they see those orders as a committed sale even if you decide not to get the game after the down payment you still have away money to a publisher or a distributor if a games preorders are bad a company might say fuck it lets not work too hard on it and save some money and manpower if it has a lot of preorders they see a demand from the customer a demand based solely on advertisements they can finish the game however they like because its technically almost been purchased already and it wasnt even based on actual gameplay an example is watchdogs its like people havent learned from watchdogs why even trust ubisoft im predicting the game is probably going to be another let down with the parkour mechanic just being a flashy gimmick
gaming,removed,dear op i fucking hate you you bad mother fucker sincerely

gaming,removed,some people think all germans were and still are national socialists
gaming,removed,at the same time im glad they havent released a game on current gen yet because it would go against their standards the best thing about rockstar is that they dont halfass if it takes them years to do it right theyll spend years doing it right they push the limits of console hardware far beyond others hence on xbox looking better than many xbox one games they optimize for their target hardware instead of just porting and add so many great details such as pedestrian voiceovers dynamic interactions etc and make the controls and physics extremely solid and fun people will meme about indestructible trees and volleyball nets but thats because they strive for nearperfect collision physics and anything short of that standard gets held off for the next generation engine because ok is not good enough

gaming,removed,for me the main draw of fairy tail is the camaraderie all the characters have sure they get thrown into lifeordeath battles frequently but the protagonists survive and grow as one goofy family i much prefer the manga however since the animes fights dont get the attention they deserve youll often see characters attack and then it does a hard cut to the enemies being knocked out or over we never see half their blows land the show feels too toned down most of the time
gaming,removed,i bought the hitman pack off a steam sale once and this was the one i enjoyed the most everyone always says blood money is the best but i had trouble with the first mission it just felt like it didnt age very well and the controls were wonky absolution looked pretty and played well i like a decent stealth game particularly when you can use it as a playground i never ended up playing through the whole story though thats not rare for me with video games but i still occasionally revisit certain levels just to have fun theres a lot of different ways you can kill people and sometimes its fun to eschew the rules and make your challenges theres even a multiplayer option for that where they let you create challenges within levels and you can play them according to steam ive spent hours thats a lot for me im a filthy casual after spending maybe bucks on the whole hitman series well worth it in my opinion definitely recommend it

gaming,removed,warhammer is basically like lord of the rings warhammer is basically lord of the rings set years later so in addition to all the fantasy and magic stuff there is also futuristic technology so while total war and vermintide are set in a mid evil fantasy type world the dawn of war games are set in a universe where there are orcs and demons and magic but also space travel and lasers

gaming,removed,wow already has distinct classes so that obviously wouldnt work overwatch doesnt have that same system for categorising them what it does have is the already existing tank support offense and defense which is why it makes sense to use those as the set class types since it makes it easier to refer to them and have people understand what youre talking about breaking these up further would be a separate discussion hots has the same issue with some of the tanks not being very tanky and people wanting them reclassed as bruisers or creating subclasses within the existing ones also it seems theres a bit of misunderstanding surrounding classes too since some people call each hero a class and others see classes as being a a way to group them kotaku has an article which seems to treat each hero as a class and pcgamesn has one which categorises the characters into class groups httpwwwpcgamesncomoverwatchbestoverwatchcharacters im in favor of having classes as groups of characters that fit into a particular role rather than calling each character a class saying you want to play as the tracer class doesnt make much sense compare to playing as an offense class

gaming,removed,considering that there is a game already dedicated to playing as a baby and killing yourself i think this should be just fine at least there is an objective outside of killing yourself

gaming,removed,i think it was just the phrasing you used nobodys fault just a communication breakdown you meant and it seems your words were misconstrued to mean or something along those lines as for where you can find roms i dont wanna upset any mods but google is your friend just ah be careful which site you use and always use cyber security software antivirus antimalware etcetera some sites are less benign than others in a similar vein dont torrent i am convinced that torrenting is a trap also on the topic of safety and with all of that being said one really cant have any significant degree of trust for anyone providing warez or pirated items while a given site might have a good rep that can change at the drop of a hat so again use caution many much caution i use emuparadise and scan the fuck out of everything

gaming,removed,oh my bad i thought you meant the comment at the top of the chain regardless its not really a contradiction because that user does not necessarily equate to everyone or the majority and being content with a remake doesnt mean they are against change i would honestly be happy with a ttyd remake too because its been long enough since weve gotten a proper paper mario game but im not at all opposed to a game that takes the formula and builds on it and innovates

gaming,removed,why is this downvoted
gaming,removed,not in the least honestly go through his comments and then come back and tell me how he hasnt been banned heres one where he attacks another user for not fixing his community and telling him that hes the problem since hes black –mozarts thats not what my source says what source i dont think your imagination counts south africa has literally become the rape capital of the world and yet here you are about to pull another powhatan and drown yourself in waters you had no business swimming in what is wrong with you even someone who is not educated on this topic should know through basic common sense that blacks are more predisposed to rape wherever they are in the world and thus you probably shouldnt bet on that stat or any crime stat decreasing when they take power use your brain httpsenwikipediaorgwikisexualviolenceinsouthafrica in the year the african national congress anc took percent of the vote sending nelson mandela to the presidential palace the number of reported child rapes in south africa was a little over this means that by the turn of the millennium the number of children victimized by sexual assault had more than tripled by after nearly two decades of black rule it had increased rapes perpetrated against white and asian children alone were greater than the total number occurring in the entire country prior to the ancs rise to power safer not if you lived in one of those townships safer yes we know the rape rates we also know murder has increased and your lovely anc government is fudging the numberspdf beyond that in terms of overall health and safety the life expectancy in sa dropped an incredible years after the anc took power in the jesus christ to imagine years being shaved off an entire nations life expectancy only to have some clueless twit lecture you on how much better things are average life expectancy declined from years in to years in it is projected to fall even further by to years for men and for women according to the institutes annual south africa survey the authors note that among developed and developing countries south africa is one of only six where life expectancy fell between and with only zimbabwe showing a steeper decline dont you love that the only nation with a bigger drop in this same time period was also the only other nation to switch from white rule to black rule how exhausting it must be to deny the basic realities of human difference more educated somebody doesnt know the black people the majority of the country were denied education i realize youre just shooting from the hip and wasting my time but try at least reading your sources before citing them nothing in your article discusses blacks being denied education in fact ironically the only mention of education is one of the black subjects explaining how the rallying cry was liberation before education or as your own source put it from the in south africathe rallying cry was liberation before education meinhert said many peopleactually took a moral stance to not participate in education to drop out of education to fight for liberation instead i guess no one told this guy there was no education to drop out of because it was being denied what incredible irony for you to blame whites when in fact your own source has blacks admitting they chose ignorance youre a joke eh its less than white on white violence can i ask do you even read anything or do you just pull a source which seems like it would have info and imagine ill be as lazy as you and just assume it says what you claim it does sadly for you i already know all this info which means i know your sources wont say what you claim in fact they always contradict you you absolute clown blacks are seven times more likely than people of other races to commit mur der and eight times more likely to commit robbery ehhhhno eh there goes the debate team captain of the nearly violent interracial crimes committed every year involv ing blacks and whites blacks commit percent and whites commit percent well my wife lived in south africa for a decade and ive personally been there and i can tell you with honesty while race relations arent fantastic theyre not nearly as bad as youre trying to portray them if your wife is anything like your sources your ideas on indian chiefs your ideas on race and crime or any of the other nonsense youve been caught out on thus far im guessing shes about as real as santa claus honestly i just feel bad for you youre clearly a pathological liar i say youre wrong about your numbers in regards to native history and suddenly you have a degree in history i say you couldnt debate a grade schooler next thing you know you were the debate team captain i say youre completely wrong about sa which all data supports and next thing you know you lived there for a decade who are you fooling here or do you even know anymore well the second whites are forced into servitude in south africa and foribidden from looking blacks in the eyes ill agree theres apartheid blacks were not slaves in sa and we have established that the data got worse for them not better beyond that whites would happily take not looking people in the eyes over you know endless rape and murder httpwwwgenocidewatchorgimageswhitegenocidetvapdf enjoy the photos you piece of shit the society that was molded and shaped by it who has had a truly free democracy for less than years worst argument ever imagined why do people try this if most other black nations were successful and only ones ruled by whites for some time were failing you might have an argument about historical ripples but this is simply not the case in fact it is the opposite of the case as the further a nation moves from its white rule the worse all the numbers get use your brain not according to the fbi but im sure youll provide hard statistics right riiiight of the nearly violent interracial crimes committed every year involv ing blacks and whites blacks commit percent and whites commit percent i think were done here it is now beyond a shadow of a doubt that you have no information on anything and youre merely trying to bluff your way through an entire conversation youre a joke yes but as an actual adult im able to walk and chew bubble gum at the same time i can look at injustice and say its wrong i can look at barbaric behavior and say its wrong and i can also look at history and how it shaped the modern age and see how it came to be if only you could debate and chew bubble gum whats that old saying about those who dont know their history whats that old saying those who dont know anything and just try to wing it on the internet okay so im going to take you and im going to enslave and beat you im going to force you into servitude rape your family and burn down your hometown how very black of you youd be okay with that right i mean after all it is my right to rule you and youd be better under my rule im white after all okay with what denying me education i would be better off under white rule there is no argument with data i would live longer grow richer experience less violence less rape and be less likely to starve to death because you seem to be repeatedly missing the rather simple point that every awful thing you think whites did to blacks blacks do to blacks and whites ten fold just with the addition of creating completely failed societies nirvana fallacy that means theyre not better off let me suffer from the injustices from my equal freemen than let slaves suffer my injustices fair enough be free but dont take your freedom then come crawling back and asking for food and aid from the very people you just raped murdered and removed from your nation you mean people invited into europe because white nations are bombing their nations white nations are bombing eritrea and somalia and the congo yep that about sums you up i think well leave it there he seems to gotten embarrassed at deleted it but there are hundreds more just as bad in his comment history this is not hate this is a shaming you dont get to go around insulting innocent redditors because theyre black or arab or a woman there is a clear practical and moral difference between spewing unfettered racism and white supremacy and calling someone out for spewing unfettered racism and white supremacy you dont get to let your inner nazi slip out to intimidate or harass someone and then delete the comment and pretend nothing happened
gaming,removed,best level in the game this is when call of duty still had balls to try something new pretty much after this game mw went to shit

gaming,removed,good for you guys you have halo google and the internet i belong to the generation of atari nintendo and for our sour of literature
gaming,removed,i think issa in a forum post once where a developer actually linked a torrent in his post and asked people to torrent it instead of buying it from
gaming,removed,did he loan you money or something also a hammer isnt money
gaming,removed,theres the general meme that games are delivered unfinished broken or some other complaint in most cases these complaints are on par with conspiracy theories sometimes they hold true as in battlefield launch what the same tenor then conveniently ignores is how hard dice worked to get together so heres what you need to ask yourself before you preorder i want to play this game at launch preorder this preorder bonus is awesome and i want to have it regardless when i start to play preorder any other reason and you probably dont want to preorder its a good rule of thumb to have
gaming,removed,are you restricting this to newage games because if so you will probably be restricted to indie titles if you are willing to give something very leftfield a shot for free im currently hooked on is a free mudlike rpg where every item is unique itll scratch that diablo itch incorporating a huge world pvp and availability on every major platform including your phone it features a roguelike feel and dungeoncrawler mechanics such as permadeath as well as a player driven economy no npcs randomised character stats and a dd combat system while i have only been in the community for months the game has been going strong for over a year now and the playerbase is extremely helpful if you drop in give a shoutout to my handle dutchman in global chat and ill set you up with some gear if im around and if not someone else definitely will the wonderful thing about this game is the amazing memories the community creates here is a few of my favourites going to rescue a new player who got overconfident and died to the orc shaman i did not have the gear to beat the shaman myself so i messaged second wave and someone i forgot who let me know showed up just to help save a new player the new guy went premium to allow a rescue and i took him back to aera feel good inc a friend died in the bottom of troll cave while he was fighting the tk and i watched it happen the tk killed him but there were too many corpses in the room to find him after some digging i realised he was not there but in the room prior but we can no longer backtrack from tk so three of us fought all the way back down through the troll cave to rescue the poor guy from under a gargantuan pile of troll corpses outside the tks lair we made it before he bled out and it was crazy intense for a mud getting my flatmate into the game elora is not much of a gamer but plays regularly now however instead of the way you and i may play she spends of her time in the aera marketplace playing the economy to the extend to which this exists finance students go figure the generosity of some of the new players a new guygirl europa started playing the other day and found a bronze shield in the inn they were super excited and had no idea about the relatively low value of the shield when he offered it for sale argus bought the thing off him for which became apparent when he asked if was enough to buy a house europa bought a house and some starter gear and said they felt incredibly supported and welcomed by the community these moments are fantastic argus you are awesome the game is definitely not everyones cup of tea but it has a very active core playerbase myself included who love it to bits
gaming,removed,does anyone have a link to aquire the game
gaming,removed,nope you must have me confused with someone else ive pretty handily shamed the shit out of you not like it was hard im just gonna follow you around highlighting your lies and hypocrisies because im bored and no one likes a white supremacist sport think of me as your editor and i think what you meant to say was there but for the grace of god go i dont worry i wont charge for that little correction and in all seriousness if you didnt want me to insult you you wouldnt make yourself such a drooling idiot target take my advice and roll on back to stormfront
gaming,removed,yeah i really feel like battlefield doesnt qualify for this preorder bullshit because its already an established series with a defined play style etc just like call of duty if you fucking preorder battlefield or cod youre pretty much going to get a battlefield or a codtheres nothing to be surprised about preorder awaywont change a fucking thing about battlefield
gaming,removed,the only hatemail ive gotten this gen so far has been someone called me a fucking tryhard faggot after i beat him in a race on gta v the race was mostly me vs him because catchup was turned one we spent it just constantly overtaking each other we were racing clean the entire race up until the last lap when he started to pit me at every opportunity so i waited until the last corner and span him out i dont even understand what he was trying to convey where beating him makes me a tryhard
gaming,removed,amiibos arent pay to win or cut features from the main game this is hilarious because im positive that content are locked within amiibos at release which means features are cut pay to win is not the only reason why dlc is retarded sometimes miitomo and the guy i replied to loves nintendo apparently because they dont do micro transactions in a paid app i proved him wrong because nintendos only game released has micro transactions its okay continue the circle jerk nintendo fanboys are blind as fuck thinking their company loves and cares about them its hilarious i remember the other thread where people were praising nintendo for making the first fighting game ever smash with customizable control config fucking hilarious delusional bunch

gaming,removed,well you should keep thinning you fat prick no offense
gaming,removed,pretty much everything dies to a couple of rounds really makes it more skill based i dont see the relation between more skill based and a short time to kill in a multiplayer game you can take quite a few hits in quake or unreal tournament are you suggesting that these games are not very skill based as a result does it increase skill basedness if the opponent has no chance of reacting in any way

gaming,removed,this guy right here is a prime example of whats wrong with reddit and gamers you constantly contribute a comment or two to random threads here and there to inject your own opinion without providing any detail as to your grievances you appear to stride along with the majority in your opinions and help contribute absolutely nothing but a single outrage comment you take an interestingly crafted single player world wherein microtransactions have no negative implications see a single screenshot of it and contribute this glowing wisdom you gotta be fucking kidding me all while someone points out how absurd other popular annual titles get away with far far worse all of the time and never bother to pop the thread open again to show your distaste all you see is the frontpage of rgaming the outrage of micro transactions and you immediately hop on the bandwagon to help spread a baseless childish message while never bothering to stand up and give a shit about the things people arent talking about

gaming,removed,holy crap thats aweseome plus milf bewm
gaming,removed,for a second i thought this was ingame satire like the knuckles and knuckles and knuckles pr stunt easter egg
gaming,removed,thanks for putting the name of the game you piece of shit
gaming,removed,ummarmygame is sean murray
gaming,removed,so on the day a game comes out im a moron for playing it long enough to actually see its lies because its a slow paced game okay bud stop sucking seans dick and get off your high horse
gaming,removed,fuck sean murray
gaming,removed,youre a fucking moron keep buying games right away without the ability to return them lol fucking amateur
gaming,removed,proof that this is for no mans sky
gaming,removed,then why are you even chiming in go back to your child porn
gaming,removed,i couldnt resist the option to pick this due to the current controversy i went into no mans sky knowing nothing about it and actually thought it was worth around the price i paid for it in my currency until i went back to fallout to prepare for the new dlc and realised that fallout right now is currently cheaper
gaming,removed,what did he lie about to me i didnt buy it for multiplayer fuckface
gaming,removed,sean murray is the kind of numale piece of shit you never trust or put in charge of anything
gaming,removed,well do you know how to torrent
gaming,removed,can we just kill sean
gaming,removed,what tinted glasses are people viewing just cause in its pretty much worse in this regard in every way compared to
gaming,removed,but the repeat settings and objectives did get stale
gaming,removed,just cause had huge compounds with towers that you could blow each support off one by one until the thing collapses over its own weight and unique radio announcements for each outpost liberated a huge airport in the center of the map and a prison island thats paced fairly well you can also redo outposts for endgame content while theres no way to replay any missions in without a mod
gaming,removed,just cause had more that was destructible in comparison to outpost liberation was redesigned so you dont spend a long amount of time looking for one container you might have missed in addition to a package vaguely hidden somewhere you also had radiant quests around the map so theres something to do with travelling and theres a way to actually make money endgame by scrapping vehicles rather than being literally locked out of the black market unless you mod that out in which case you might as well use a trainer i do give something over is really really really badly optimized i cant even play this game im supporting because of the unbearable framerates although it was fun enough in the beginning that i was willing to tolerate around drops unstable fps can drop to in towns can be stable around while exploring completely stable fps on a prison island with explosions everywhere i dont understand
gaming,removed,in which case wouldnt skyrim be better in the sense that the world had npcs with scripted ai town areas the ability to customize your own home modding tools and
gaming,removed,definitely agree with you here in its a lot more about the players own experimentation and movement controls as well as admiring the destruction details
gaming,removed,got dxmd instead it just doesnt get better does it
gaming,removed,oh sorry lol i wanted to poke fun at the ingame microtransaction thing happening right now
gaming,removed,why are you defending microtransactions
gaming,removed,seize the means of production
gaming,removed,because no matter what happens you cant be worse than no mans sky
gaming,removed,oh its not too bad you were only stabbed once not four times in a row
gaming,removed,he promised people meeting up and describing each other it was a pretty big lie
gaming,removed,thanks for explaining the pitfalls of preordering i was lost without you
gaming,removed,thank the nvidia series brother ultra fps has never been more accessible
gaming,removed,from a pr point its way worse to censor your audience than to let them vent even not replying is better than censoring
gaming,removed,mariokart play without ai each of you has to finish a can of beer by the end of the race or be disqualified
gaming,removed,sean murray is the kind of metrosexual cuck who would try and cut out the tongues of those who disagree with him to silence him taking a page out of the lieberal playbook i see great work sean
gaming,removed,i have to post a reply on the off chance that a cig dev wanderers this deep into the comments and gets disheartened slightly that noone defended the proposed repair system while i wont comment on balance issues which will take finesse on cigs part i think your assumption that noone wants to play death star janitor is not an accurate pulse reading sc is trying to replicate a crew experience to do this well need different types of positions to fulfill the roles of course most players will probably to be han solo or captain kirk to use tvmovie examples but not everyone in a multicrew ship can be that to have a well oiled machine it will take a healthy diverse system personally id love to be or and ive seen a both in reallife and online that agree hell just look at the popularity of support and noncombat classes in other mmos and multiplayer games the crafting healing and buffer classes in wow overwatch and lol to name a few i want to be able to replicate repairing the ship during battle and even the struggle of getting it repaired after battle who doesnt want to recreate this getting youre ships quantum drive repaired at at the last second to escape doom or the bartering that would take place post battle at some seedy colony emergent gameplay is the goal what if you are undermanned and dont have an engineer youd have to contract a repair crew to come get your ship in working order in the dead of space or send the last ditch distress signal if thats the only system left there will be no shortage of players who want to fill this role chris may have overreached in his vision but i sure as hell hope he gets close to it there needs to be a certain amount of risk to flying about in the verse if it is a hassle to get your ship repaired after an adventure it makes those outings that you scrape by and survive that much sweeter the reward of surviving is that much sweeter of course there needs to be balance to these features is this an overly ambitious feature yes do i think we will see a system as nuanced and complex as described in the design document probably not but if even a vestigial element remains ill be as happy as a clam ill shit myself with excitement if something with full complexity is in the game

gaming,removed,when no mans sky came out i bought it because im a retard
gaming,removed,upvoting for including name of the game
gaming,removed,even if i heard nothing about it i would expect a lot more out of a game im not being all pc master race or trying to call anyone a console peasant but i would assume youre playing it on console console gamers are used to games you guys again assuming you are one also dont have many games with this much freedom or flying in space themed or anything like that youve also not been deluged with early access survival games which do what nms basically does except more in most cases for the last years so yeah i can see a console gamer getting this and not seeing it as a huge problem but this game was worth tops it should be in early access and then finished before it ever hit consoles it began as a pc game then ended up being a horrible pc port there are a lot of reasons people are so livid about it but a lot that would not really affect someone who games mostly on console
gaming,removed,i never understood why it didnt popup in other games nor why they didnt remake it with another ip where getting to the top of the food chain was actually hard
gaming,removed,hey deadtoast i looooooove ur games but i also have a question could you make it so the whole enviroment is physical cuz it would be more of an adrenaline rush and it would be more fun and it would be more realistic thank you for your time deadtoast

gaming,removed,dammit
gaming,removed,thats the red dead hype train
gaming,removed,i actually think they did it right this time with the damage models for the sniper rifles theres a sweet spot they will give you a one shot body kill that varies slightly throughout the different rifles they are large caliber rifles that are meant to put a person down in one shot realism wouldnt work because they would be too powerful but having to shot somebody in the body with a high caliber rifle no matter the disrance is a little ridiculous just my opinion though
gaming,removed,dude what the fuck
gaming,removed,lets waste hours and hours drawing on plastic cups instead of getting jobs and actually contributing to society typical reddit bullshit right here
gaming,removed,does he man everyones leaving that show
gaming,removed,i suppose you also payed full price for it like a jackass too
gaming,removed,haha im with you on that one
gaming,removed,unfortunately for xbox one users they wont be able to enjoy dongs or other inappropriate content as microsoft regulates the mods that transfer to console so no scaly argonian titties for you console users the only problem i actually have with that is they said theyd also prevent copyrighted content in mods like a mod for oblivion was master chiefs armor and an assault rifle that would be considered unacceptable which is really lame

gaming,removed,max payne kill shit in slow motion like a badass and listen to a guy complain about how horrible his life is because everything bad always happens to him also saints row for just ridiculous fun to just take a break and kill whatever while also fucking around like car surfing and parachuting out airplanes but realizing these games arent exactly the best for relaxing as they are for just releasing stress play something like until dawn firewatch journey or a telltale game that isnt walking dead unless you like crying thats pretty straight forward and easy to get into like batman is a gun game to relax to
gaming,removed,
gaming,removed,lmao you idiots get scammed like morons
gaming,removed,considering you have one yourself it seems as though you had the means to make your brother happy by either giving him yours or getting another seems unnecessary to take handouts from strangers when there are a lot of people who cant afford anything theres people who cant even afford treatment for illnesses and you accept handouts from people for a video game system when you obviously are capable of providing him that in other less lazy ways

gaming,removed,yeah but the magnitude of this slowdown is too great to be detected after release someone obviously did not do their work be the developers the beta testers or whoever thing is the public doesnt care whose fault it was the product just doesnt work in the development world there are different kinds of bugs minor major critical and showstopper when a bug doesnt let you even run the app such as the slowdown experienced by many it should be catalogued as showstopper how the fuck did they not catch this seriously

gaming,removed,and also way more expensive unfortunately i dropped like on a good msi laptop less than a year later and it cant even run aaa games well my desktop is kicking ass and taking names though
gaming,removed,gaming laptop
gaming,removed,what the fuck are you talking about just because there are mods that add zombies to gtav doesnt mean its basically the same thing as the last of us give me a break you clearly havent even played the game with that mind set
gaming,removed,its because youre a fucking dumbass
gaming,removed,i wonder if you know what your talking about i bet not i have it on and it runs brilliantly i bet youre just young andor a bitch
gaming,removed,fuck that kid and fuck you hows that for thinking for myself ya shmuck
gaming,removed,sager youre talking about ancient gaming laptops nvidias latest mobile chips have changed the landscape drastically
gaming,removed,no i didnt notice its become impossible for me to distinguish one petulant fuck boy from another on this sub
gaming,removed,does it count as cheating if by just being indoors it makes the game think you are dashing all around the neighbourhood

gaming,removed,there is also the bubble theory which suggests that you enter another pocket universe imagine a bunch of soap bubbles all together where they touch an merge thats a black hole
gaming,removed,how did they manage to remove the shitty sepiatone filter in the game i cant get a clear picture like that when im playing
gaming,removed,sure if parts die in pcs more often than on consoles then that matters all i know is everything about the close to years of gaming ive done tells me that pcs require so much more maintenance in a variety of ways you listed one was which was meaningless because its just a stick of ram which costs pennies compared to an entire console consoles break at a rate equal to or greater than a pc yet you cant really repair them as easily or troubleshoot as easily a common one is a game that only runs on bit windows my wifes pc has bit windows and there have been games that dont run properly on there its just another instance of pcs requiring more effort and attention and not being as streamlined as consoles everything is taken care of for you on consoles lol what pc has essentially unlimited backwards compatibility youre not even playing on a modern pc if its bit try putting a disc in a christ what a dumb argument thats not more effort thats you trying to do something way more than these consoles do and failing its also you not installing a bit version of windows if the hardware is even remotely capable of running a game considering bit processors have been around forever and have essentially been standard for gaming for almost years everything is done automatically for you on a console and ive never had any problems with consoles having to revert back to old drivers or reinstall drivers or anything like that everything is done automatically on pc too have you even used a computer in the last years theyre completely effortless and reinstalling drivers or rolling back drivers is not something anyone really ever does but yes these things happen to consoles just as much but you cant really fix it some people might see minor bugs after updating but shit like that in the link above are not really a thing on pc the difference is even if it happened rolling back a diver on pc takes no effort compared to shit like unplug and plug in your mic extremely fast so fast that youre not even taking out the jack fully from your controller or the page essay on how you fix remote play well first of all either youre not using your pc as much as many other people or your experience is not representative second why do you have a isnt there no reason to have one you seem awfully committed to consoles if you had to buy of them i have one and dont use it it was before pc gaming became streamlined and consoles became more complicated i was also younger and dumber over a decade ago i decided to keep one because my year old niece doesnt know any better seems like a common trait amongst console gamers yeah and those are really shitty compared to the controller you get when you buy a as for the took like minute to find used bucks total unreal if it can be used then thats really easy pc parts depreciate ridiculously fast especially used ones from lets only look at the video card radeon hd it was about new back then now you can buy it now for and auction cheaper the rest is honestly a few bucks you can try to hunt down those parts but being so old you can just buy an old whole tower for bucks that includes that cpu equal ram then buy that card used now you have a used pc equaling a in power for like if you spent on used parts youd have a pc significantly more powerful than a its not a poor substitute youre kind of just asserting shit with no basis theres nothing wrong with a physical disc unless its broken or scratched or lost or whatever or your optical drive dies or is dusty im well aware of family sharing are you aware of the fact that there is a limit to how many people you can share your games with and that you have to be online to do so did you waste my fucking time when you brought up digital distribution for pc games theres a limit to how many people you can share a disc with too because you have fucking disc you only have a total limit but you can just swap the authorization and share to who youd loan the disc to and who doesnt have internet hopefully not console gamers since every game has a day one patch again learn to read i didnt say there is a relationship between the popularity of a game and how good it is what im saying is that if there is no benefit to a certain product its highly unlikely that this product would result in such a huge industry but youre a dishonest idiot so you move the goal posts to the straw man of pretending like i claimed that number of customers denotes quality of product dude you yourself have owned xbox youre telling me theres no benefit to having one jesus christ you troglodytes need to learn some critical thinking skills theres no benefit to a pet rock and it sold i read your point but people do not always buy the best product or the cheapest things can be popular for virtually no reason some things are objectively worse but sell better because they are cheaper while other things are more expensive but sell more than the cheaper option theres no correlation to be drawn between sales and which is better i have owned and im telling you theres no benefit to owning one which is why i never use it i have money so i spend money if i couldnt afford consoles and pc i wouldnt own a console pc is infinitely more useful upgradable and a bigger bang for you buck with lower overall cost than console if you need it to be
gaming,removed,hahacrazy ass
gaming,removed,god that looks fucking amazing im gonna play this with the ost to interstellar
gaming,removed,here is a bit more material about what i am referring to httpswwwinsidescienceorgnewseveryblackholecontainsnewuniverse of course everything is speculation at this point but so was everything at the subatomic level at one point i have my hopes up that we will solve this mystery sooner or later
gaming,removed,rule clearly states no spamming or promoting learn the rules yourself this is the internet if you have a problem with the way people present themselves to others go to a safe space where freedom of speech isnt allowed
gaming,removed,i have problems with it when it affects the game i play as in it becomes difficult to near impossible to get to end game without spending some money unlocking items that should have been or were originally included in the game but obtainable via another method eg for mmos dungeon runs for box standard games unlocked by completing the game or getting all collectables i wouldnt care if other people do it if there werent enough to generate a profit to show devs that its a good thing to reuse over and over i used to play an mmo that i adored but then anniversary packs came out and meant to be a one time thing they got popular so devs recycled them people went crazy and it screwed the economy so everything became way over priced even cosmetic items sold in game went from being a couple hundred thousand to pushing mil this also affected armors materials for high level armor and so on devs answer put materials on the boutique and take some out of the game forcing you to buy them for the already op assassins people with money paid their way to the top were able to solo tons of stuff making my class redundant and the entire attitude of the player base became toxic this still took about a year over all but thats why i hate them my favourite game became a pay to win its also deceptive when you go to buy a game and find out that you have to pay even more to get whats required to finish in the first place if ive already paid £ then in my eyes ive paid im done i dont want to pay more to be able to play the game i just bought
gaming,removed,afaik the entire game is playable cross platform

gaming,removed,to be honest i actually enjoy this game lot what i actually like about it is all the scientific concepts they have integrated into game such is how when the alien species used to pretty be exactly like humans millions of years ago but eventually invented a device that shares all their thoughts with others and by doubt this evolved into a hive mind becoming integrated into this is something that some scientists gave theorized that humanity os heading towards also the entire game has some pretty deep commentary about this dont get me wrong i completely understand all the disappointment related but this didnt affect me so much because i bought the game hoping for an exploration game which i got dont forget that mods help a lot with the while playable the game gets much better if you push to get through the first hours unfortunately the game itself is a swimming pool mile long and meter wide hello games made a huge game without depth debunking a few myths all the planets really do differ the game doesnt have a lot of recharging shit as long as your mot bad at the game getting early game upgrade fixes this the species really do differ and basically with mods you can actually make the game all that the deva promised and more i still believe that what hello games dod was wrong but i have a thing for space games srry for spelling on mobile

gaming,removed,apparently this is a bot so yeah you can pretty much replace rgaming with a bot
gaming,removed,sorry for hijacking the top comment so in india where the game was invented the queen piece is called the minister all the pieces on the board are men so op is technically wrong also where is the queen you might ask she along with the kings harem is sitting around a huge fire singing songs and if her king loses all the ladies commit suicide by self immolation

gaming,removed,this girl going to be in your place and jerk off to you
gaming,removed,this is not an ad for the first doom this is just a parody of these old school video game magazine tips for games you can see that because there are black scorch marks on the wall on the left which never existed in the first doom because the game didnt support decals
gaming,removed,kill yourself op
gaming,removed,just stop talking to me fuck off

gaming,removed,yes youtube has some videos the idea sounds great on paper but the way prime is it wont work right

gaming,removed,youre full of yourself see you in the dollar bin on steam with mixed reviews
gaming,removed,also in the indian variation the queen is called the minister and the rook is called the elephant
gaming,removed,thats not right incorrect inverse kinematics ik is what its called when you extrapolate the position of untracked bodyparts based on a few tracked bodyparts is leagues worse for immersion than floating heads hands

gaming,removed,best hooters check out therein httpwwwhotelorietcomughf
gaming,removed,technically on the nes each sprite uses one of four palettes three colours per palette and can be up to pixels in size mega man is constructed using multiple sprites they use two palettes one for his body blue light blue and black and one for his face peach white and black so they draw his head without a face and body using several sprites on top of those sprites they draw his face using a sprite or two thus it looks like more than three colours but theyre actually layering multiple sprites with different palettes similar techniques were used by other games once they figured out how to get around the hardware restrictions
gaming,removed,yup gimmicks and one interesting funny moment

gaming,removed,actually from what i remember it was way more jolly than that the camel with its big engine could turn better to the right than to the left and when turning to the right would assume a slight nosedown pitch while in a left turn it would assume a slight noseup pitch basically turning right the plane would want to dive and turning left the plane would want to climb
gaming,removed,if you buy from resellers there is a possibility that the key you are buying has been bought with stolen credit cards and that means that your key can be desactivated any time and you cant do nothing about it also the developers get less or none money for their work while the resellers are making tons of them with their shaddy business buying from those sites hurts the industry a lot also more info on that
gaming,removed,you got fooled by those spectator animations well im the nigerian prince

gaming,removed,i might sound like an old fart now but the original kings quest got me into gaming i had been around games before that my dad showed me space invaders on a computer at work and he had an old with some games but it didnt really interest me that much i might have played some of them but i didnt get hooked when he bought his first computer for home he got a copy of kings quest from someone he knows i tried it out and didnt really get it at first i walked around with my character looking at the graphics and not doing anything i had put it away when someone told me it was possible to type out commands for your character to do i started it up again and walked around looking and things and picking up objects and soon i understood what the game was about i was hooked and finished the game and eventually got the sequel and other sierra games and been gaming ever since im not sure you could consider it artgull with beautiful dialog but it woke my interest in gaming

gaming,removed,day in and you already cant hold a proper conversation sad
gaming,removed,how u get the hi red my gmod cant do that even with camera settings and all that
gaming,removed,not to be pc master race but yes pc is clearly better better graphics customization etc if people have the money to get them i recommend them to build a custom one however not everyone can afford them since they require a lot if you do want to run games at high settings another things about consoles is that their very convenient some people dont want t deal with customization also not everyone is a core gamer many gamers are casual in the sense of they dont care about any of those things they just want to play some cod or battlefield thats no crime
gaming,removed,keep diggin that hole pal
gaming,removed,ya and going into a store to find a physical copy of a long standing franchise on the second day of release and expecting it to be there is kinda dumb especially at a gamestop they almost always only have a few copies left after pre orders of popular games source i used to partner up with gamestop to do game releases when i worked for a restaurant

gaming,removed,my wife works at gamestop and yes they do open up brand new games and they are allowed to rent the game even a brand new sealed game they would actually rather the employees take the brand new game because they will make more money on the sale of a used copy than brand new this even goes for games who saves are on the cartridge itself
gaming,removed,mass effect multiplayer for some reason its so much fun to me
gaming,removed,emulator on computer and download the game
gaming,removed,is probably your best bet as a new version is coming out soon if you dont mind older versions there are emulators for pcandroidios devices that allow you to play pokemon some even offer fan based romshacks which change the difficulty allow for all region pokemon to be caught have a more badass story
gaming,removed,if they dont like it they can uninstall it simple as that people can also complain about it get over it youre a dumb ass if you think niantic has been handling their pr in the best manner i dont even play the game but the complaints on the pokemongo subreddit often reach rall

gaming,removed,i just got mine thanks for this
gaming,removed,the game is great but there are many other great games being created as well none of them as great as the witcher in scope how bout you stop being such a retard
gaming,removed,no its a ice wall
gaming,removed,because the console version is hard disk making it more expensive and peasants would pay that much on the best day so why not thats how it works blizzard games on pc always are around forty
gaming,removed,so kind of like kenshiro from fist of the north star mostly uses hokuto no ken to make peoples heads explode but also takes weapons and uses those if he thinks its an appropriate punishmenthumiliation the question is virtually never will ken win but more what is he going to do to the bad guys

gaming,removed,i get paid over £ per hour working from home with kids at house i never thought i would be able to do it but my best friend earns over £ a month doing this and she convinced me to try the potential with this is endless heres what ive been doing
gaming,removed,what are you twelve this isnt a war they went where they thought was best for them and microsoft paid a lot of money for halo nobody forced bungie to sell it you goon being a fanboy must suck all your awareness away until all that is left is butthurt
gaming,removed,why do you laugh at that they are competing with computers in the sense of keeping their portion of the market computers boast better graphical performance as well as complexity of what they can achieve for consoles to stay competitive they have to try and adjust and be like computers computers you can build for an initial then every couple of years upgrade for a couple of hundred dollars with these prices falling each year in upgrade costs a console brand new costs and that is it no upgrades to it graphics are held back they can only maintain a certain level of performance sony and microsoft have to make it so they can stay competitive yet giving people what they want every other year i would buy a new console if it was if it meant a true upgrade in performance graphics and it doing more with the and xbox one only coming out a couple of years ago one would think with normal trends it would be more years until we got a new console system well they are already developing them for a new gen not just an upgrade
gaming,removed,are you sure you want to play that its probably one of the worst of the dnd games of that generation
gaming,removed,thats why u will always stay as a virgin who the fuk rub girls tummy you think that shit is erotic da fuk wrong with u girls are not dog fukin hell go and watch porn if you really want to know how to have sex
gaming,removed,lolyou sure tried to sound smart the major point is that you take this all very personally and its hilarious you dont understand that neither bungie nor microsoft give a flying fuck about your opinion they care about dollars and they are making plenty boohoo you didnt like the latest halo going all dramatic and childish doesnt help your case it only makes you look like a child if it sells millions of copies then that means there are millions of people who disagree with you its not the end of the world and its no reason to get your panties in a wad pretending like you have a real stake in this only demonstrates your ability to bend reality to conform to your emotions ive disliked call of duty since the original black opsyou know what i did i stopped playing them what i didnt do was declare iw traitors and then get all whiny and butthurt because other people still liked it do yourself a favor and come to terms that being a fanboy will not result in anything positive for you
gaming,removed,because instead of doing their job as parents theyre leaving it to the tv and videogames not bothering to discipline their kid the moment he starts cussing at random people used to be that kids would get spanked for being little shits then everyone started making a fuss about that

gaming,removed,took tries for me ended up being alot easier than i expected i spent hours looking for cheats then just tried it a couple of times
gaming,removed,sometimes the previous town of the person that owned it isnt erased so i check to see how much money they had in their bank and then i transfer it to a friend who transfers it back to me after i delete the town and remake my own lol its a process but if theres millions of bells then its worth it ive seen someone buy a used copy with million in the old town the saves are on the cartridge unless you bought the digital version through the store deleting towns is easy it gives you the option on the menu when you load the game
gaming,removed,consoles sold billion in and pc sold
gaming,removed,you played the demo then chose to buy it i never bought anything from the game rather i chose to watch a full playthrough of the game after i completed fully the demo levels to completion with all of those extra coins to see if the rest was actually worth buying why would you automatically assume otherwise usually you dont even get a demo with a game you go by the screenshots and trailers of whichthere was just the app store screenshots and whatever they posted on social media which were just those gifs of how the mechanics would work the other problem is that its not advertised as a demo its stated that you can play a portion of the game from the app store itself and purchase the rest for free it was supposed to be a free trial and the other half of the game that second being toad rally after you buy and finish the game the only thing left is the other toad rally mode which you got for free so whats the point of paying the for it when the bulk of where youre playing afterwards is the mode that wasnt mainly advertised as the main game let your downvotes help you realize nobody is agreeing with you maybe not on rgaming that much is evident but look on twitter other subreddits youtube reviews and the like youre going to see similar criticisms and flaws of the game in fact why do you think the game went from to stars on the app store in a matter of a single day clearly some people myself included are a bit pissed for similar reasons

gaming,removed,i preferred tlou mp because it was a lot more sneaking involved
gaming,removed,that reminds me of theories about the angry birds movie some right wingers claimed it was an analogy for the syrian refugee crisis the birds were the europeans and the pigs were the muslims apparently they thought that it was an analogy for what they think is happening in europe a hostile takeover by muslims who are stealing eggs and the europeans ignore it and even punish those who speak up when they finally do realize what happened they go to fight the pig muslim menace its absurd and stupid but whats even crazier is how they came up with it the king pig has a beard yeah

gaming,removed,cpu matters more than gpu does fyi theres very little performance difference between a and amd on anything but highest end cpus a recent overclocked is basically a requirement to lock ultra at fps a combo nets around fps averages with fps minimums ¯ツ¯ so your mileage may vary
gaming,removed,in my experience the arma community is by far the best community bar certain altis life servers ive ever had the pleasure of joining the people are so helpful when helping out new players get used to the game and almost every person is treated as an equal the toxicity in majority of the community is virtually nonexistent again this is just my personal experience so take that for what you will ps i highly recommend getting the arma dlc bundle it contains all dlcs for arma except for apex if you have the money to splurge i also highly recommend getting arma apex you get a plethora of new guns aircraft and has the best map ive ever seen seriously the detail bi put into tanoa is beyond unbelievable

gaming,removed,why is titan quest still a thing its even in the top on piratebay if it was actually that good it would get coverage and stuff but people still illegally download it enough that it gets newly updates i dont understand
gaming,removed,whats up with titan quest explain to me why its still in the top piratebay pc games
gaming,removed,thats not what all the reviews have been saying with non overclocked not cutting it even with a digital foundry found a cpu bottle neck keeping their titan pascal from reaching fps only to have a large overclocked make it function as one would expect a titan to there is also a thread over on forza where players are reporting massive frame stutters and inability to reach fps at any setting but low even with or better when the same cards run it on high with better cpus and pretty much every amd cpu reported thus far cant break fps minimums even on low both reviewers and players are complaining about it maybe well see more tuesday when more people buy in

gaming,removed,playstation controller layouts are objectively outdated and they refuse to change it i assume because the design is so heavily attached to their brand it really irks me
gaming,removed,unless you grey market or pirate windows building right now isnt that much cheaper not if you look for a sale on a prebuilt i hate to say it because i always build and think everyone should but after having just helped a friend get the best deal possible on a gaming rig we ended up buying a prebuilt machine that said build it definitely build it he got almost no control over components but money won out you really want control over what goes in it plus you can build to accommodate future upgrades

gaming,removed,phone games inflation rpg tower of hero robot unicorn attack but depending on what your phone is and how much memory you have id recommend getting a gba or nintendo ds emulator on your phone ive bought both my boy gba emulator and drastic ds emulator as they are pretty much the top emulators for those systems on your phone then on your phone go to emuparadise and just use the search to find roms for each one theres always good games pokemon dbz golden sun dragon quest just to name a few to spend some time on im sure others can give many good gba and ds games to pick through too and emulators are so much more fun than standard phone games

gaming,removed,peach is a fat male my childhood is ruined
gaming,removed,at least it seems like theres plenty of food in the postapocalypse pretty damn good customes though
gaming,removed,princess poundcake
gaming,removed,fucking awesome good to know well be well fed in the apocalypse
gaming,removed,princess watermelon
gaming,removed,woah peach really let herself go after the world ended
gaming,removed,good idea you dont want her stress eating
gaming,removed,making fun of people because of their weight is a dick move but i mean lets be honest if your that fat you have to be a glutton otherwise you wouldnt be that fat that mindset is why people are such assholes and its not true it just isnt fucking true read that and tell me if this guy is just a glutton tell me this guy deserves the abuse tell me this guy is choosing to be fat its a lack of empathy its people being completely unwilling to understand difficulties outside of their own experience some people go through different challenges than you do youre a glutton great that doesnt mean everyone who is overweight is why are you automatically assuming that think outside of yourself
gaming,removed,its cuz their peach is fathave to do junkyard bros
gaming,removed,no thanks your mom already got me off
gaming,removed,hahaha of course youre fucking fat pathetic
gaming,removed,you may wanna clarify that you were referring to his weapon when you say there are a more sjws here than actual gamers in this thread
gaming,removed,its good to know that food wont be an issue in the apocalypse
gaming,removed,mario and peach are eatin good for an apocolypse
gaming,removed,funny how people forget about demon souls one of the most unforgiving games of its time and yes there are dragons dark souls series is good but just a continuation of what demon souls started
gaming,removed,kind of fat for people in the post apocalypse youd think they wouldnt have much food
gaming,removed,you wont make it to your wife wont either lose some weight
gaming,removed,as a contributing member of society one should show respect to those who they feel dont deserve it i disagree i feel respect should be earned by works and good deeds obesity is a life choice a personal choice that is a drain on the resources of society which include healthcare work productivity space and time millions of people work hard to stay at a healthy weight why should they have to support the horrible life choices of people that want to be gluttons the cost of obesity is about billion according to some estimates httpswwwhsphharvardeduobesitypreventionsourceobesityconsequenceseconomic as a former obese person myself i speak from experience thankfully my friends and family jumped on me to lose the weight which i did furthermore i am trying to save lives obese people die young i do not want to see these peoples lives cut short due to poor life choices so instead of telling they are special just the way they are i will yell shout and scream at them to drop the weight because i dont want to see them die
gaming,removed,how is telling that joke hate let me guess you are fat and were personally offended that people would dare bring up poor eating habits as the cause for obesity
gaming,removed,so mario and princess peach are proof that even if the world ends theres gonna be plenty of food still around
gaming,removed,aaah come on hate its in good fun being fat is selfinduced you can change this condition everyday you just choose to continue eating too much
gaming,removed,games like empire at war dont require much power tropico on the other hand requires quite a bit more power at least comparing it to the other games id go with a desktop if i were you maybe a max self built desktop that should be able to handle tropic without a problem and even some of the newer stuff you could potentialy even go under that but that price range isnt my field ask the people at rbuildapc or rpcmasterrace they are really helpful and many of them might even have a component list ready in that price range to give to you they will also help you build that pc not physically of course but you should be able to ask everything and dont get discouraged by the dicks they are there thats a problem but better just ignore them most of them dont know jack
gaming,removed,if you see someone suffering i feel that it is a moral obligation to help them out obese people are hurting usually its depression when people change their bodies they feel a sense of accomplishment that usually breaks them out of that downward spiral a good friend will give you criticism when you need it a horrible friend will keep tell you that you are great while you are destroying yourself what type of friend are you
gaming,removed,looks like everyone is still eating well in the apocalypse
gaming,removed,looks like peach is in charge of the food supply

gaming,removed,i know its unrelated but out of all the studios doing remasters why cant rockstar hop on the bandwagon id fucking love a vice city and although the most difficult lengthily and expensive project san andreas considering they wouldnt have to rewrite any mission concepts dialogue or anything story related they would make a pretty penny im sure with that being said i hope the next gta iteration takes us back to vice city baby
gaming,removed,its pretty fun if given an chance and played differently than every other game in the entire library you can crush it in a couple hours
gaming,removed,those are not games
gaming,removed,context dead rising got slammed really hard for being incredibly easy people rarely died because character was op from the start of the game so today they released a patch which added new difficultues hard and blackest friday blackest friday is basically fuck the player mode zombies do a shit ton more damage healing items heal a lot less and most weapons break within seconds i lost health within a second in this gfy

gaming,removed,ive never played it fun to watch though
gaming,removed,your comment makes perfect sense if youre trying to say if its profitable they should do it the reality is that sequels rarely live up to the original and any sequel that exists primarily as a source of profit doesnt equal a quality product on its own we dont have a sequel yet because rockstar is a quality developer the title would be great in theory but if i doesnt exist yet its most likely because of respecting the quality of the original

gaming,removed,used to only be a console pleb but now ive got me a nice and badass pc action rpgs are probably my all time favorites love a good story but if the mechanics are good enough a shit story will fly with me a good example of a completely shit story but awesome mechanics would be dead island loved the feel of smashing a zombo in the face with blunt instruments but good god was its story a pile of raging dog shit

gaming,removed,just stopping by from the masterrace sup everybody
gaming,removed,or just torrent it and save more plastic
gaming,removed,this reminds me of this from a wonderful podcast about design about how httpswwwrockthevotecom got started the idea behind rock the vote was simple get young people to vote for politicians who wouldnt censor music ayeroff got about sixty people together in a los angeles hotel to talk about launching rock the vote frank zappa was there past and present california governor jerry brown was there as well as a bunch of record executives including jeffs friend a record executive at warner brothers named jeff gold golds major project at the time was trying to figure out how to package cds compact disc packaging was the hot topic in the record world of the late and early cds had been around for a few years but record stores still didnt have a good way to display them because their shelves were formatted to display vinyl lps the solution was to package cd jewel cases inside of cardboard boxes that were just as tall as a vinyl album but half as wide artists however objected to the wastefulness of the longbox in and they did not want millions of trees cut down just to create this extra packing the warner brothers sales department knew that this album absolutely had to come out in a longbox if it was going to do well in retail and thats when jeff gold realized that he could merge the two projects he was working on jeff gold realized that he could convince rem to use a longbox if they could use the cd longbox to advance the rock the vote campaign jeff gold needed a concrete political cause to connect it to and jeff ayeroff brought him just the thing the motor voter bill which been bouncing around congress since the if passed motor voter would allow people to register to vote at the dmv when they got a drivers license it also allowed citizens to register by mail or when they applied for social services like welfare or unemployment basically the motor voter bill would make it easier for lots of people including young people to register to vote by a few states had already adopted it but congress had never been able to get it passed nationally when out of time hit the record stores on march the petitions started rolling in after weeks they had received petitions per senator and they just kept coming in in droves
gaming,removed,consoles are like apple the iphone company years behind pc overpriced restrictive and inferior
gaming,removed,i once saw a street performer juggle of these at a time im sure he couldve done if they were the smaller cases everyone always overlooks who this would really affect
gaming,removed,just get your friend to torrent the game that is literally just as beneficial to the game developers as you loaning it
gaming,removed,i only buy digital but never full retail no need for trades to get discounts no need to drive anywhere keep anything store anything i can download the game to a friends console and play there or download them to the consoles at work never had my account hacked but i have had people steal my physical disks
gaming,removed,i absolutely disagree with you pc gamers have mocked console gamers for years remember in gaming magazines yeah haha thats funny but yeah its not like console gamers are going to call pc gamers fat neckbeards or anything most console gamers know that pcs are always going to have better specs but thats not the reason why they choose to play consoles over pcs
gaming,removed,cant wait to see the rpcmasterrace version of this meme

gaming,removed,tldr vertigo is cris formage this guy is actually worst than a click baiter he use a shady tactic called baitandswitch httpsenwikipediabaitandswitch definition the action generally illegal of advertising goods that are an apparent bargain with the intention of substituting inferior or more expensive goods im sorry to tell you but this guy is a complete fraud he is like every youtuber out there he is just in for the money he used a very well known marketing strategy of clashing against every youtuber with a high viewer rate that way he can easily vampirize their viewers by acting like a good guy who does it for good reasons months ago he was advocating against monetizing and was slandering every other youtubers for that reason but he was also secretly accepting donations since then he switched to full donations and is planning to monetize soon he got a good amount of subscribers already from the sub reddit while also creating a second channel for who knows why he wants to become a fullfledged youtuber and make money out of it all of his content is him taking other youtubers videos to debunk them else he use content from discord channel directly moreover he spread lies around like other youtubers claiming that theres an eye event inside the game while its just an atmospheric effect he leads hunters to think that some boxes under the map are direct proof of a mystery he thinks theres a jetpack when hundreds of people at this point says the contrary i also follow the french modding scene which is gigantic and they came to the conclusion that there was no jetpack inside the game currently too he is being helped by many hunters who are fooled by him even some moderators fell for it on the subreddit and started to advertise him while also condemning every other youtuber if you want an impartial method of giving information to hunters you create a wiki everyone knows that they always refused to do so because it would mean less viewers for vertigo who is trying to create some sort of youtube wiki a central place where everyone should go for information he also use discord to advertise for his channel daily you make your own opinion out of this but for me a real hunter with real good intention would just do a wiki simply you make no money out of it and its impartial everyone can participate someone trying to insult everyone around and claiming to be the only source of true information while making money out of it is the definition of a fraud to me didnt you learn from gtav to not trust any prophete showing up without questioning his intention

gaming,removed,the diplomacy needs tweaking in some areas but is more intelligent in others religion works way better now in that you can just take over other holy cities and wipe out religions entirely without having to take over the civs capital city theres also religous victory which is so powerful that the worst civ score in the game in my last game surprised me with a religious victory before i could win via culture you gotta watch the religious leader now and attack them with a holy war before they win with civilian units that dont respect borders strategic resources go back to the old style of just needing one source which isnt my favorite change i liked needing iron for my army rather than just depending on if you have the military district or not city states are run more intelligently creating longterm allies rather than fickle governments that need to be constantly bribed though this means that city state quests are less numerous which is a massive shame that minigame was a good part of attacking cities is much easier and not as heavily dependent on artillery units which is a good and bad thing its good because attacking cities in was pretty boring but its bad because early wars are stupidly powerful id actually go so far as to say theyre required for higher difficulty especially vs city states as they are decidedly weak and possibly have lessno affect on warmonger status

gaming,removed,i probably have hours in the original gears of war no idea what the fuck youre talking about it being fast paced maybe for someone with aspergers
gaming,removed,im convinced sigh roll up in this bitch rpitchforks
gaming,removed,youre talking about the lady boyle missions nonlethal ending right the boyle familys immense wealth basically singlehandedly funded the lord regent hiram burrows coup iirc its outright stated that they the boyles were his biggest benefactor and thusly one can infer that their money is what was used to get daud to assassinate empress jesamine and get the whole unpleasantness going the boyles were bad people and you shouldnt necessarily have to feel bad about sending that one boyle woman off with that guy tho i do admit there was probably a less sinister way they could have done it
gaming,removed,what ive been doing nowadays and works pretty well is i torrent the game if i like the game through ill go and buy the game worst case is i uninstall it because i dont like how it plays im not wasting any money to developers who dont deserve it

gaming,removed,you are one naive little fuckhead you know that
gaming,removed,guys why didnt you torrent the game first on day one like a person who isnt retarded

gaming,removed,if you can loose everything you own in months then you did not own that to begin with leasingowning you would think people should know this before they graduate highschool but with the record amount of debt this world has it definitely has not been taught enough not that the capitalist ptb would want to teach that as debtmoney for them and i am not suggesting quit without a position to go to it doesnt take more then an hour or a day to keep an eye open for other positions at a temp agency etc and if they dont want to do that then just admit they would rather work for a sociopath liar then make a point with their walletstime

gaming,removed,i am in the same boat as you man there would have to be features in this game so it doesnt get stale quickly i want this game to be good so badly because i have been excited for it for so long but when i sit and think about it what am i actually waiting for to travel from planet to planet to find whatever recoloured trees animals and terrain i can find i just feel it could get repetitive very quick and i just hope they have stuff to fill in that space where seeing cool planets and animals just isnt enough once a player has completed the story and put in

gaming,removed,not really a rumor its kinda fact they gave out the specs so judging by the price of parts it will be very pricey unless they take a loss for every console sold like did after they were forced to cut the price down if xbox did this it wouldnt help them cover any ground sooo its really not looking good playstation is so far ahead now already and they got a whole year to sell slims and pros before scorpio ships xbox lost this generation theres no coming back

gaming,removed,if you read the novels it is clear in the chapter choices of samwise at the end of two towers that the orcs under saurons dominion despise him and yearn to be freed from his dominion they may still be violent and aggressive but without the presence of saurons will propelling them orcs would not represent an existential threat to the other peoples of middleearth in light of this fact the dismissive attitude to the suffering of the orcs themselves displayed by the protagonist in the game shadow of mordor is at odds with the philosophy of the original source material as the video i linked earlier discusses in tolkiens world it is not the ultimate badass warrior aragorn who saves the day by slaughtering countless foes mercilessly but the humble unassuming hobbit who accepts a selfsacrificing quest to achieve the liberation of others with no expectation for himself other than suffering and death
gaming,removed,it makes me sad that this looks too much like no mans sky and im getting put off by that no mans sky and other games that didnt live up to the hype has really made me quite cautious such a shame still hopeful that this game will be great thoughstill hopeful

gaming,removed,well it has absolutely nothing to do with the post but i cant say it didnt make me laugh
gaming,removed,lol youre an idiot when you first start the game it has to load you into the game dipshit of course that has to load but once you are in game you do not have a loading screen or ridiculous mass effect elevator loading like mechanic preventing you from going somewhere while stuff loads in the background that simply does not exist in the game the one currently playable where you can test to see exactly what i mean and many already have there is even a comment in the thread i replied to where a player traveling at normal speeds catches a glimps of a player quantum traveling to a destination in his field of view once you are in the game whether you are moving in or out of a building onoff a ship from one location to another on the opposite of a planet in seconds there is no load screen there is no hidden magic where its loading in the background and you just see a neat graphic two players with computers of vastly different capacities will get there at the same time one might have a worse frame rate or be on lower graphics but there will not be one that is delayed to load longer because his computer takes longer to load it

gaming,removed,youre still assuming that everyone has the same amount of time as you you apparently find a lot of value in spending the extra time finding locations based off a description which is fine but lots of people have a lot going on in their life that severely caps that being married kids work slowly working towards a grad degree many many people prefer getting to the location quickly and sidetracking only when they feel like it it also helps moves things along especially for quests you dont find particularly interesting some people prefer the tighter narrative as a way to get into the story better open world games already suffer from having a delayed sense of urgency especially when your quest is to go save the world from some impending doom this is even further punctuated by moments of not having a clear direction because you took a wrong turn somewhere gee i sure hope the end of the world waits on me since i apparently took a wrong turn somewhere as i said its not about being lazy because there isnt one clear fixall solution they are both different designs that seek to move the player through the main narrative in different ways

gaming,removed,the gearing system is completely different to skyrim but every class can be anything you want it to be some fulfill certain roles better then others but everything is possible this means that you can play your sorcerer class as main tank a healer or dps with different specializations for example completely ignore magic damage and become a melee fighter you can equip every weapon or armor you want there is no restrictions but certain spells require certain weapons to be used also depending on your class you have access to class specific spells and then there are spells in the weapon trees that every class can access staffs etc so you cant use a taunt unless you use a one handed sword or use a flame spell if you do not have a staff equipped but as a sorcerer you always can use your dark magic or summon a pet

gaming,removed,fuck you fuck all of you on rgaming i said that many times for because of its season passhorrible dlcs policy and got told titanfall would suck and have been told all the stupidest reasons to not buy it and then you all come to tell people not to buy cod but this one youre just a gigantic circlejerk of fuck tards

gaming,removed,and you cant erase the fact that its not unusual for gaming companies to listen to fans and rarely do the gaming community well part of it get their panties in such a bunch like with the tracer pose being changed
gaming,removed,call me a stickler but i reported ops post this bs is never going to change unless there are actually consequences to not putting the name in the post and the perfect consequence is the loss of karma just like people get tickets for speeding and need to pay a fine thus losing their money people who post cool picsgifs without the name of the game should have to lose their karma i didnt report the post maliciously and i certainly have nothing against op but there needs to be a change in this sub and the only way i know how to do that is by reporting the posts

gaming,removed,pfft sure it has u casuel this is currently the sequel to outside frozen lands which was the sequel to outside paleolith when the developer for whatever reason decided to permaban all the players via ingame apocalypse theres rumor of games prior to these but theyve been buried like the et game for the atari just as well too some of the current players would have you believe there are no prequels and that outside was developed by one guy who designed all the character models in his image ps i love these threads
gaming,removed,why do you think the zodiac gave it up
gaming,removed,soyou just go around killing demons and rabbits with a sword
gaming,removed,do you happen to know how beefy the system requirements are i looked them up online but im always stymied by the video card requirements i use a laptop with an integrated gpu and while im aware that it is awful i dont understand how to compare it with dedicated cards i far exceed all the other recommended requirements have more than enough ram way faster cpu etc for shadow warrior so it makes me hopeful that maybe the game isnt a puter hog and i too can slice up shit with a big sword
gaming,removed,hello

gaming,removed,starbound is terraria with a space story but thats scratching about of it colony system is expanded in starbound tenants are not specific npcs like terrarias mechanic but are dependent on the house its decor engy stuff in an engy house location you can collect rent and recruit them onto your ship havent touched much else but its bigger than terraria there are also additional storefronts you can purchase to make life convenient instead of warping back to the npc store hub all the time combat is not so similar to terraria monsters have their own attack patterns so youll have to learn if the indigenous life will spit charge stomp etc all over you weapons and armor progress like terraria but weapons can have a random skill that can be really useful spear barrier skill crowd control bosses are usually found in missions that you can repeat with ease starbound has a story and a boatload of sidequests both fixed and randomly generated its also developed more of its personality through npc dialog and animation worlds are loaded with treasure for the numerous progression systems ship matter manipulator gear architecture is much bigger than terrarias multiple races with different architectures textures geology starbound is better for building especially if you include the expandable tool that can lay multiple sections of brick at a time ore is found in both the back and foreground so you can knock out sections of wall deep underground to see the biomes art crafting is better than terrarias if your workbench can support it multiple levels of bench upgrades and you have the blueprint the game will tell you what you need to build it i recommend getting the mods that kill the crafting timer and unite your inventory there are also tabs within workbenches to filter your blueprints based on their purpose but im not sure if that was default or from my addons bam compared if you prefer a compact experience terraria starbound is still fresh but like terraria will have loads of stuff before and after the workshop

gaming,removed,it has some frame rate issues which is odd for a game that was already in development on i had to google the solutions to a few of the puzzles so its puzzles are not as well designed as those in the portal games the giant dogcatbird creature doesnt always immediately respond to commands making you doubt if you pointed in the wrong direction simply pressed the wrong button or need to try the command again but it does make the interaction with him feel more real its got a few technical issues but its not a very standard game and for that reason i loved it the bond you develop with the companion animal will turn this game into an emotional rollercoaster of the games i played this year it was the one i enjoyed most and it was the only one i bought on its release date at full price

gaming,not_removed,i would recommend buying the book conquering carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive stress injuries on amazon it has a green cover read it and tell her to do the exercises it saved me from severe carpal tunnel problems years ago and i still do the exercises for maintenance today microsoft natural ergonomic keyboard for business is incredible for a keyboard i also use the green razer death adder mouse which feels better and is way more ergonomic than other mouses that gave me a lot of sorenesspain while playing league i hope this helps in some small way all the best
gaming,not_removed,thanks for the advice ill try to get her a copy of the book for the mouse what kinds of things should i look for in a mouse small light claw vs palm grip to help her with her issue
gaming,not_removed,this is what i use though it may not be the best its worked for me i accidentally broke my last one and got a different mouse and it was a great deal less comfortable this has been the best mouse i have used though and feels very ergonomic to me you might want to look around a bit otherwise id recommend going with that
gaming,not_removed,link to this beauty if they take it down for whatever reason httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbdvrtykjxgu i was just browsing my facebook page and this video popped up its childish and a bit silly but i wasnt expecting it and laughed my ass off

gaming,not_removed,hows the general feel of planes in this one compared to and i really like flight but was trash
gaming,not_removed,did anyone see the chat in the still frame redbullchain is a moron this game looks better than any game out atm
gaming,not_removed,its ok because you can fly by the ridiculous arcade icons all over the place
gaming,not_removed,i think that was the planes shadow
gaming,not_removed,the flying seems a lot more difficult in this game but it actually feels quite good its designed well at least to me
gaming,not_removed,you cant control the thrust and theres zero danger of stalling or anything fun like thatbut its definitely more enjoyable than jets
gaming,not_removed,exactly
gaming,not_removed,oh i thought at the end of all that you still needed to be wired nice move
gaming,not_removed,dont hate me now but windows is free download that and boom micro usb is enough to game on a pc
gaming,not_removed,was a free download and i realize wireless xbox controllers are plug and play on win that was a limited offer that my girlfriend took and i did not win works beautifully on my build ive learned that if my computer is running stable and i have no problems not to f it up as a side note i should mention that yes you could just attach a micro usb and play but i wanted wireless
gaming,not_removed,looks great where do you get the artwork done i bet you could find an amazing tattoo artist to paint something for you
gaming,not_removed,congrats looks more like a little laparas to me though
gaming,not_removed,awww look at that little tree fiddy
gaming,not_removed,you found me nicely done
gaming,not_removed,pfft polygon if their doom playthrough is anything to go by then they are still stuck on the level
gaming,not_removed,so where and how
gaming,not_removed,what are you playing it on a gamegear
gaming,not_removed,shouldnt this be a big deal
gaming,not_removed,just did a quick search and it turns out that respawn has hidden a bunch of unique looking nessies all over the game from single player to multiplayer i love it when developers do stuff like this
gaming,not_removed,wait thats the one people were talking about i thought there was another one in sp or something welp
gaming,not_removed,lots of people have found them one is on the training map behind a floating rock
gaming,not_removed,did he ask for tree fiddy
gaming,not_removed,i cant believe that none of the other people playing it found it before you
gaming,not_removed,lapras fucking scumbag plebeian
gaming,not_removed,god dammit loch ness monster i aint gonna give you no tree fiddy
gaming,not_removed,pfft polygon if their doom playthrough is anything to go by then they are still stuck on the level menu screen
gaming,not_removed,polygon playing games badly is pretty much a meme now
gaming,not_removed,also they suck at everything else too
gaming,not_removed,im out the loop why does everyone hate polygon
gaming,not_removed,so cringe edit i mean the polygon jackasses playing doom holy shit
gaming,not_removed,looks like homestead to me yet any second spent on that map is equivalent to an eternity in hell
gaming,not_removed,i can tell by the pixels
gaming,not_removed,no a mission one is the one in the patch notes i think a nessie has been found in a campaign mission dont know if it is the nessie yet though
gaming,not_removed,its not the one
gaming,not_removed,i think ulaprasfucker would like to have a word with you
gaming,not_removed,we got a problem here gentlemen cause im bout ready to fucking throw down
gaming,not_removed,i had just got my titanfall and as i tried to board my titan it said to me i need about tree fiddy at that point i realized my titan was actually the loch ness monster and i said dammit monster i am not going to give you tree fiddy
gaming,not_removed,pfft polygon if their doom playthrough is anything to go by then they are still stuck on the level menu screen inventing the wheel
gaming,not_removed,they have a very low standard for their articles leading to shit quality overall and their play through ware known for having cringe worthy players who can barely get around the maps i dont want to shit on someone for being bad at a game but when your job is literally to show the game off you should expect criticism when youre awful at it also they love to ban people from their comment section for mostly innocuous jokes at their expense check out their doom play through if you want an example of their play throughs
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,much
gaming,not_removed,interesting i saw one in one of the modes iirc and i remember thinking i had to be one of the last people to realize its there since i bought the game late but maybe i was early who knows i went to the bar im drunk now shocking right
gaming,not_removed,woah hey are you calling to tell me that my pizza isnt coming
gaming,not_removed,pfft polygon if their doom playthrough is anything to go by then they are still stuck on the level menu screen inventing the wheel
gaming,not_removed,i think ive heard their playthroughs called fuckthroughs before
gaming,not_removed,i use to frequent poly a lot but can confirm the above today they had a article titled red dead redemption hits pc next week via playstation now and then ghost edited it to play red dead redemption on and pc next week thanks to ps now after everyone called bs on the click bait no mention no notice my comment too just disappeared they have also put me on notice for comments calling out the writers for shitting on batman v superman for the exact things they jerked star wars off for use to be a great site but are slowly turning into basementvirgin dot com
gaming,not_removed,i remember hearing jessica chobat saying that she reads polygon because she likes news about the gaming industry but that was a couple years ago has polygon always been bad i thought like they hire like real journalist to write their articles or are they bad because they dont have any gaming knowledge
gaming,not_removed,real shame the site is bad the mcelroy brothers work there and those guys are fucking awesome they have the funniest damn podcasts
gaming,not_removed,dont give polygon the ad money just use an version of the article
gaming,not_removed,pfft polygon if their doom playthrough is anything to go by then they are still stuck on the level
gaming,not_removed,came here to say this goddamn i love me some monster factory those two are the only reason im subbed to polygon on youtube
gaming,not_removed,they are hilarious and i will only give polygon views for their videos monster factory is hilarious and im fond of car boys as well
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,me too thanks
gaming,not_removed,whats that standdock
gaming,not_removed,considered getting a scuf controller a few times how do you find it
gaming,not_removed,just search controller stand on amazon its literally the first result its just a display stand for controllers
gaming,not_removed,i have four for xbox one i got when i worked for gamestop
gaming,not_removed,when a question hits you so suddenly and profoundly you absolutely cannot afford the time to switch to the right subreddit
gaming,not_removed,this needs to go right to the fucking top
gaming,not_removed,conceptually making aluminum foil would be no different than texturing other metal objects depending on if it needs to be an interactive element or not there could be some complex physics behavioral programming to get the right look
gaming,not_removed,they take aluminum and flatten it out many many times also this is the gaming subreddit not rexplainlikeimfive
gaming,not_removed,username checks out
gaming,not_removed,you done fucked up son
gaming,not_removed,its dlc
gaming,not_removed,they take aluminum cans and crush them in a giant hydraulic press
gaming,not_removed,well the first step is to get a big block of aluminium now the atom symbol for aluminium is al now that sounds like el which is similar to which is where this post should have gone but in all
gaming,not_removed,theres some aluminum and theres a machine that flattens it out im not sure why youre asking at a gaming sub and i would guess that it was for but that sub is for explaining concepts not straight up questions
gaming,not_removed,lets get this post to the front page
gaming,not_removed,step make post in step accidentally post in rgaming then get upvoted to front page
gaming,not_removed,start with a big block of aluminum flatten it until its foil
gaming,not_removed,first you get a press then you press the aluminum source
gaming,not_removed,you mean in games
gaming,not_removed,hey thanks for the replies everyone even though i was so excited to ask such a simple question that i put it on gaming
gaming,not_removed,well now that im thinking about it how do you make aluminum foil
gaming,not_removed,you think this is not a fucking game
gaming,not_removed,lol
gaming,not_removed,you take aluminum and flatten it
gaming,not_removed,you take a big block of aluminum and run it between big powerful rollers over and over again until its flat
gaming,not_removed,its a very good game but the late to end game is noticeably less good and the ending ismeh
gaming,not_removed,dlc is gonna be not that good from what ive seen base game is pretty solid would recommend if you like horror
gaming,not_removed,ive posted my thoughts its a really fantastic game but about hours in length and a large amount of dlc already announced i find it hard to say it was worth the pricetag id wait for a complete edition unless your a huge fan or super interested in it
gaming,not_removed,regular one is fine for what you described the price is lower than ever and basically the new one preforms better and stuff if you play once every week the regular is probably better if you wont invest time
gaming,not_removed,id say just buy the xbox one as it is now as it would probably be just perfect for what you need
gaming,not_removed,as others said i think the regular would be fine now to answer why the upgrade is happening basically the regular one is fairly large this is one a lot smaller also the large block from the power cable is inside the xbox itself now also it supports video its basically a slim version as the s says just like the s that was released during the lifecycle
gaming,not_removed,visually stunning but hows the gameplay
gaming,not_removed,i cant say much about the game playreckoning i only played for hours lel but the game delivers something new games fail to do i brings back memories of skyrim and you start branching off into side quest in a good way ofc the leveling system seems fairly good for and get rewarded easily but the combat against machines feels easy then again i was on a bunch of side quests so i did get quite fair amount of xp for hanging out in the starting region skills and crafting are great like i said earlier new games fail do deliver the fast craft is so much easy and is great to work around the tree skill well i cant say much for it but the perks seem great loveable characters and when it rains in horizon there seems to be a dense fog and the camera pans closer to aloy during the weather even and i guess it simulates that you cant see much in the rain its great
gaming,not_removed,itll be no mans sky for so many people lol
gaming,not_removed,nunez vs rousey
gaming,not_removed,mighty no street fighter v and twilight princess hd
gaming,not_removed,no mans sky
gaming,not_removed,no mans sky still wanting the bucks back
gaming,not_removed,farcry primal
gaming,not_removed,for me its dishonored i like the game but it runs like dog shit on my and a people are gonna say no mans sky but for me this was was a huge disappointment
gaming,not_removed,call of duty
gaming,not_removed,battlefront
gaming,not_removed,doom
gaming,not_removed,betty white death watch
gaming,not_removed,ive not even played it and am disappointed well ok im slightly vindicated by it with a friend who couldnt see that my concerns about how impossible everything they said they were delivering and ok and behold they didnt deliver most of it but im still disappointed on his behalf theres enough disappointment to go round kids
gaming,not_removed,any reason why i was thinking of picking it up during the sale
gaming,not_removed,i guess we should get used to this picture before its all over the news
gaming,not_removed,oh shit i thought that looked familiar whats up kyle its will
gaming,not_removed,your school project is a stealthy mountain
gaming,not_removed,post it to rfallout for free karma and do the same for the finished version
gaming,not_removed,what software do you plan to run on this just raspbian sp or will you create some sort of skin to actually emulate a pipboy if thats the case i will start using my pi again
gaming,not_removed,what sort of information do you plan on displaying real time heart rate monitoring would be cool but complicated
gaming,not_removed,ahmadpls
gaming,not_removed,i intend to print a pip boy in the next week or so
gaming,not_removed,is it still wearable
gaming,not_removed,its just an alarm clock
gaming,not_removed,holy hell kyle and will its sam whats good
gaming,not_removed,hey will didnt know you were on reddit
gaming,not_removed,o shit waddup
gaming,not_removed,time to buy a cheap ass fit bit and reengineer the sensor to work with a pi
gaming,not_removed,yes
gaming,not_removed,sup dude its jason
gaming,not_removed,forced meme
gaming,not_removed,lmfao i know this all too well the rage the raaaaaaaage especially since i always go out of my way to revive the boys wtf
gaming,not_removed,dry humping a dead corpse isnt the proper way to revive someone ive been doing it all wrong too then though i only do it to the enemies i kill
gaming,not_removed,i feel you its can be pretty frustrating dealing with christmas noobs
gaming,not_removed,i guess its an oversaturated market like back in the for every game coming out it has a hand full of competitor games on the market take titanfall cod infinite warfare overwatch and battleborn all these games are aiming for a certain gamer who likes an online multiplayer fps but rarely can gamers just buy all of them they can either get one or perhaps two so as far as the numbers game goes fewer people bought battleborn so it dropped its price very quickly in order to make more sales overwatch has recently had a massive price drop to accommodate the fact it has more competition and i recently got battlefield at about half it usual price because its competitors are using the same tactic if you are a gamer who hasnt bought any of these games yet its hard to justify getting the new cod for £ when the new battlefield thats only a month old is down to £ imo this oversaturation of the market and multiple platforms can cause lower quality games like we saw in the this is why et came out so terribly it was unfinished and rushed out for market however it can also cause a lot of good games and consoles to drop in price so they can compete its a pretty healthy business strategy and as long as game quality remains high a gamer benefits greatly from it
gaming,not_removed,typically once a company makes their money back they lower price because anything after that is purely profit
gaming,not_removed,because the other games have many new games comming out that they drop the old ones because the lost of popularity only a few will stay up longer
gaming,not_removed,all games go down in price over time some more than others a game not selling too good or just not so popular will be very cheap in a few months very good games like battlefield take about months to go down around the time the next is announced
gaming,not_removed,once you get as behind as i am due to going extended periods of time with no gaming at all you can get your next on the list for bucks used at gamestop
gaming,not_removed,yeah doom released in may earlier this year just picked it up for which is off in less than a year and it received pretty good reviews on top of that
gaming,not_removed,not living up to expectations p s fuck you nms
gaming,not_removed,from where did you get it for
gaming,not_removed,gamebillet it was part of a black friday deal it was a digital copy for pc i would say pc games consistently hit record lows much faster than consoles
gaming,not_removed,carth looks like he wants to talk about something hey carth you okay leave me alone
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,get your politics out of my star wars s
gaming,not_removed,whoa whoa whoa are you saying that theres still intolerant people in this world and in this hypothetical when do you see the intolerant people going after the great cleansing of or perhaps in after the second mars war s
gaming,not_removed,wow edgy dude ri am very smart
gaming,not_removed,ive completed kotor as a jedi and i started a new dark side character and i feel like such an asshole
gaming,not_removed,this game is so good
gaming,not_removed,yeah shame all the people you get to know on taris die while you flee for your life
gaming,not_removed,if only there were more people who posted original content and less who reposted week old posts
gaming,not_removed,youre right there are still overly sensitive progressive types that arent welcome in my parties
gaming,not_removed,my boy carth laying down some truth
gaming,not_removed,this is probably the least stupid thing carth has said
gaming,not_removed,every conversation with carth
gaming,not_removed,my favorite was going dark side and him running off at the end
gaming,not_removed,nah youve got me all wrong im not anymore not like those people at all this is deeper than the mariana trench which i learnt when i wasnt s
gaming,not_removed,i could never go darkside having bastila or juhani in your party it always was a dagger to the heart i couldnt disappoint them mind you going light side always better to seduce bastila
gaming,not_removed,welcome to
gaming,not_removed,until you realize that he ran off with your mandalorian armor and maxed out pistols i never made that mistake again after the first play through
gaming,not_removed,shh spoilers man s
gaming,not_removed,i cant believe people are still intolerant in current year and intolerant people should fuck off to another country anyway so i dont have to tolerate them
gaming,not_removed,firstly i dont think anybodys going to be able to migrate to america soon secondly pretty sure a significant amount of them are already there
gaming,not_removed,but dark side gets her in the end nice jedis finish last
gaming,not_removed,problem i have with dark side and the morality system overall is that there are very few slightly evil options at least ones that still get you dark side points like you are either the patron saint of the galaxy or kill everyone you come across i kind of want to be a cold calculating evil like palpatine and not have to murder someone for looking the wrong way at me
gaming,not_removed,doesnt make sense in the context of the games parties which is why i didnt type it that way
gaming,not_removed,yeah he got stripped down to his underwear whenever we landed on the last planet
gaming,not_removed,funny thing is all the people who preach tolerance are very intolerant of people who dont share their views shrug
gaming,not_removed,yeah but its more fun play her on the light besides its adorable how fun it is to seduce her
gaming,not_removed,to be fair thats not the type of sith lord that revan was he was military and direct palpatine wasnt for another four thousand years revan didnt have to conceal that he was sith
gaming,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiparadoxoftolerance
gaming,not_removed,because the other people arent being tolerant its like if someone said you should eat whatever you want then someone else says everyone should only ever eat apricots the apricot guy is being a nonsensical closeminded dipshit
gaming,not_removed,seducing her frying people with lightning
gaming,not_removed,i mean i at least want the option and besides this takes place after you forgot you were revan
gaming,not_removed,really i managed to get a good balance of seduction and lighting
gaming,not_removed,unlimited power
gaming,not_removed,i was playing light side and still frying people with lightning
gaming,not_removed,well i think the idea is the personality is unrolling into either jedi revan or darth revan
gaming,not_removed,im a huge fan of the dark souls series and i was given a chance to alpha test a new game by cradle games hellpoint the game is dark gritty and absolutely brutal the mechanics are very much like dark soulsbloodborne the link is to my lets play for it so you can see what its like check it out on release
gaming,not_removed,put a ring on that
gaming,not_removed,nice job but the uneven grid would drive me insane
gaming,not_removed,i dont think the ring would fit over that canvas
gaming,not_removed,online retailers like green man gaming and cdkeys might also still have some copies left on their stores for cheap prices
gaming,not_removed,nothing for europoors
gaming,not_removed,just look up your local retailer and check the prices
gaming,not_removed,please pleasd please please play if you can the story it has will have u fall in love with series if u want the best out of mgs v id say buy ground zeroes as well because its like a demo prephantom pain to mgs v phantom pain basically it would a tad bit more sense and its still a bit cool itll get you used to the controls phantom pain is an unfinished game but it has the best controls from any other game its an amazing action game and youll have a hell of a time playing it its cheap to get rn so i say get it
gaming,not_removed,also started with mgs and i absolutely love the game
gaming,not_removed,it is amazing highly recommend
gaming,not_removed,id recommend v as a good starting point i honestly dont like it story wise and how they made it way easier than the other games the gameplay is really good but the game isnt as good as the others if youre trying to get into mgs because of story start with its my favorite of the series and the first in the story order
gaming,not_removed,worst story in the series ground zeroes is better but it has the best gameplay in any game ive ever played
gaming,not_removed,you should really play the series
gaming,not_removed,is not a great starting point a lot has happened to put the characters in the situation they are in that isnt explained in the game going into the game coldblind no previous knowledge of the series will probably leave you lost and confused at the very least read up on whats happened up until this point as the story of the game is convoluted enough even if you do know the back story edit thats all assuming you care about story if you dont then the gameplay is probably the best in the series at least its my personal favorite but youll be stuck in a pretty lengthy and boring prologuetutorial at the start fortunately you can skip the cutscenes if you dont give a damn
gaming,not_removed,dont know what the others are on about it was my first mgs game and i dont feel that lost i can tell theres some preexisting relationships between some of the characters but nothings stopped me from enjoying the game its pretty great
gaming,not_removed,directed by hideo kojima its a mess controls are all over the place same as every other mgs game some of the worst controls ive ever encountered directed by hideo kojima writing is youtube channel level of conspiracy theory crap with ridiculous supernatural characters that got way out of hand already in and are just silly now side missions are the only fun ones but get repetitive fast the game is not even finished because someone was kicked out of konami and a half baked product was shipped no real ending bugs a lot of bugs directed by hideo kojima and you will be at the constant state of wtf if you havent followed the series from the beginning directed by hideo kojima directed by hideo kojima
gaming,not_removed,is the end of the series a good entry point no great game and yes definitely play it but do it in order the games are all about the story line gotta start at the beginning and work your way through and they are all great games even which is only slightly not as good as the others
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,yes
gaming,not_removed,you are incorrect controls are different to most games but not all over the place the game is finished there is a real ending there are a couple of bugs the supernaturalweird characters are something you should be expecting from a mgs game your entire statement makes me think you hardly played it and have some weird need for people to think it is a terrible game
gaming,not_removed,there is very very few bugs for an open world game or any game in general this is a exremely polished game in every way other than story
gaming,not_removed,it is
gaming,not_removed,so essentially gta iv on pc is playable now
gaming,not_removed,why dont you remove gfwl from gta and gta episodes rockstar its just you and fallout in my library now
gaming,not_removed,they couldnt of removed the abysmal gfwl then
gaming,not_removed,was it that bad
gaming,not_removed,my thoughts exactly played it for the first time on console recently and it felt fantastic
gaming,not_removed,this will cure your gfwl in fallout problem enjoy
gaming,not_removed,bad was a compliment
gaming,not_removed,i didnt play it much but i didnt think it was bad at all the story as far as i got into the game seemed pretty good but driving the cars felt like driving a boat
gaming,not_removed,as bad as the pc version is its still the best version to play the game console runs at around fps and looks extremely blurry
gaming,not_removed,actually i have i gushed over how much i was looking forward to the game afterlife in an email to lucasarts and they sent me a free copy when it came out gawd that was a long time ago
gaming,not_removed,i sent an email to ubisoft asking for a personal favor regarding one of their recent voice actors and they turned it down
gaming,not_removed,thats so cool
gaming,not_removed,mercy from overwatch right you would think youd at least find out who the character is
gaming,not_removed,so good rshittybattlestations
gaming,not_removed,beat me to it damn you dat hdtv setup
gaming,not_removed,and then wait for it to spin up cross your fingers did it work no damn it time to clean it alright its clean now i can see my goddamn reflection on it what why the fuck isnt it working oh disk woops alright disk oh right have to clean it there we go time to play the game my save is still here insert disk god damn it
gaming,not_removed,you dont miss cd gaming you miss your youth like all of us
gaming,not_removed,going to honest i personally like physically media over digital download when i have the option the main is when the day comes that steam xbox live psn and the like shut down then we would be screwed if we ever need to redownload them or if they require connecting to a sever to even load also the issue licensing where if the license expires then you still wanted to buy the game if is digital only you just screwed also dont forget for many people have to deal with data limits i had a limit for and i just recently had the option to get unlimited for an extra a month so yeah you got a good deal on something like call of duty infinite warfare hope thats the only thing you wanted do with your internet that and the whopping was worth it i know buying digital is more confident but i still prefer physical
gaming,not_removed,possibly the only post ive read all day that made sense
gaming,not_removed,absolutely and even worse when you could never complete ffix because you lost disc somewhere along the way
gaming,not_removed,i got trashed by a zaryareaper combo earlier today get that graviton placed right and any aoe ultimates going to sweep up
gaming,not_removed,another reason why red dead redemption is an amazing game
gaming,not_removed,red dead redemptions version of twitter retweets must be time consuming
gaming,not_removed,if you look back at american and mexican history youll understand its basically mexicans want to get rid of american migrants
gaming,not_removed,this game cracks me up best backwards compatible game going though
gaming,not_removed,you know i literally just took this photo on my xbox
gaming,not_removed,sadly demos arent really a thing anymore
gaming,not_removed,never really thought about it but yeah for the most part they arent
gaming,not_removed,that boy aint right

gaming,not_removed,this is amazing
gaming,not_removed,zeldas let himself go

gaming,not_removed,did u have sexxx after
gaming,not_removed,i tell ya hwat man talkin bout dat dang ol bobby man

gaming,not_removed,bobby is like mush it cant be broken and it cant be built up but it has the edge

gaming,not_removed,that boy aint entirely a boy

gaming,not_removed,i sell deku seeds and deku seed accessories
gaming,not_removed,the legend of zelda the bastards gas
gaming,not_removed,does hank just say yep whenever he rolls or does slash attacks
gaming,not_removed,youre totally right but we strongly believe in swearing in this house
gaming,not_removed,seriously he never says dammit
gaming,not_removed,got dammit op
gaming,not_removed,i remember the picture that this is based on being posted on reddit ages ago and it was filled with comments making the exact same correction
gaming,not_removed,dammit thats a lot better than replacing them with yep
gaming,not_removed,i love the idea but also dont understand why people keep replacing link sounds with hank when bobby is the one portrayed as link
gaming,not_removed,i was thinking bill could be kepora gebora
gaming,not_removed,that sounds amazing
gaming,not_removed,hahah with those ridiculous ffjap hair styles and completely rando clothing thatd be hilarious
gaming,not_removed,holyshit yes this is my favorite idea im playing through ffx again at the moment but is next on my list this will be the perfect way to prepare
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,isnt it grammatically correct to have that comma there though
gaming,not_removed,you bite your tongue both have their own special place in my heart
gaming,not_removed,beavis and butthead was a lot funnier when i was twelve and getting into adult humor now i watch it and its just a bunch of you said butt
gaming,not_removed,i member
gaming,not_removed,hwhat
gaming,not_removed,me too i was like how the hell did you do that count me in
gaming,not_removed,thats my purse
gaming,not_removed,why are you calling me bobby
gaming,not_removed,studied furniture design in college
gaming,not_removed,its honestly better than some of the stuff i saw at moma the other day
gaming,not_removed,i dont know you
gaming,not_removed,i hate when other sites put their watermark on my art originally from here e ubluedesire your idea keeps evolving ucruzxx nice job painting it also i like the switch in direction of the sword bringing the eye back to the center
gaming,not_removed,what an unexciting way to look at life
gaming,not_removed,never change
gaming,not_removed,i love this should have had it on repeat in the background while painting
gaming,not_removed,its not but that would be amazing
gaming,not_removed,he actually does on seldom occasions
gaming,not_removed,its hard to say i did it sporadically in my free time allinall id say around hours max
gaming,not_removed,made a httpsglaciercollectivemyshopifycom just for the occasion
gaming,not_removed,wow my heart
gaming,not_removed,wait it doesnt stand for battlefield
gaming,not_removed,the truth
gaming,not_removed,king of the hill
gaming,not_removed,sure did
gaming,not_removed,navi says listen and hank says damnit bobby
gaming,not_removed,that seems pretty cheap for the painting how are you supposed to make a profit btw im going to get one
gaming,not_removed,oh ya a link pic totally makes it a house now
gaming,not_removed,its going really really well thanks for asking
gaming,not_removed,i love zeldas green hat
gaming,not_removed,based on the painting pallet id hazard the supplies came from a store that sells painting supplies and the concept from their imagination
gaming,not_removed,i really do
gaming,not_removed,butanes a bastard gas
gaming,not_removed,this was confusing for me i tell ya hwat is hank but the whole second part is boomhaur
gaming,not_removed,yep
gaming,not_removed,probably because he can relate to it
gaming,not_removed,its such a dad show i think any and up white dad who tucks his shirt in has a little hank in them
gaming,not_removed,psychosomatic
gaming,not_removed,the great deku tree is clearly boomhauer
gaming,not_removed,the best thing i found in this thread is how to spell hwat
gaming,not_removed,mhm
gaming,not_removed,underrated comment
gaming,not_removed,fucks sake bobby listen here
gaming,not_removed,you insult the hank with your blasphemous misquote now hes gonna kick your ass
gaming,not_removed,you missed an opportunity to say dangit bobby
gaming,not_removed,so you intentionally misquoted a quote it is an awesome painting but it would be better if it said dang it it is literally part of his character that he doesnt swear
gaming,not_removed,you sir have a well run household
gaming,not_removed,king of the hill fans use curse words get out
gaming,not_removed,did one of you paint this
gaming,not_removed,regardless thats going to really bother me if i had it also the comma after dammit makes no sense
gaming,not_removed,he definitely says to
gaming,not_removed,ned never says brace yourselves
gaming,not_removed,he does just not to bobby that boy aint right but hes still his boy
gaming,not_removed,when you know youre about to take fall damage
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,the yep would just be anytime you consult navi hank i would love a mod of this
gaming,not_removed,makes sense you want to get rid of both of them as soon as possible usually
gaming,not_removed,did you just draw that
gaming,not_removed,hank doesnt say it that way
gaming,not_removed,yes it is correct
gaming,not_removed,considering damn it is spelled wrong
gaming,not_removed,not as far as i know subject is bobby predicate is listen dammit bobby listen feel free to make a case as i am not a wizard
gaming,not_removed,yea the comedy was pretty shallow
gaming,not_removed,member chewbaka
gaming,not_removed,ooooo yeah me members
gaming,not_removed,thats my rupee bag ftfy
gaming,not_removed,i dont know you
gaming,not_removed,thats my purse
gaming,not_removed,im terrified to click this link so i wont definitely is not me
gaming,not_removed,thank you for continuing this tradition
gaming,not_removed,was looking for the original great work
gaming,not_removed,i see that utehtonym requested permission to use your design in the original thread did anything ever happen with that id love to either have this on a shirt or a print or both
gaming,not_removed,i mean i guess thats kinda why im on reddit maybe we have something in common
gaming,not_removed,ok fair but my point stands
gaming,not_removed,in case you thought i was joking httpiimgurcomiavhzphpng looking forward to getting it im a huge zeldaking of the hill fan this is perfect
gaming,not_removed,this is the best thing ive ever laid my eyes on so awesome why cant i paintdraw lol
gaming,not_removed,aaah i dont know enough about zelda
gaming,not_removed,its a print of the painting which helps with the reproduction a ton my goal isnt so much to make a profit but to help get it in to the hands of the people who asked for it i also wanted to make it accessible hence the cheapness also thank you for your interest in the print
gaming,not_removed,yeah i noticed that after i commented i was really tired still am lol
gaming,not_removed,mr strickland ive never so much as inhaled a goddang sniff of the devils gas i tell you hwhat
gaming,not_removed,httpiimgurcomvdupsbgjpg
gaming,not_removed,i got propane in my urethra
gaming,not_removed,hankhaur
gaming,not_removed,yeah my brother wasis a real idiot somehow hes years younger and damn near married while im single though
gaming,not_removed,also a texan show
gaming,not_removed,i dunno does he really get around that much
gaming,not_removed,i would say the owl because it just keeps going on talking like himor maybe its dale
gaming,not_removed,dangodang bobby man gota dango friggin spider inside me man dango sick me gotta have you go dango inside me man squash it like a dango bug with a newspaper man
gaming,not_removed,feel like bill would be the deku tree and boomhaur would be that owl
gaming,not_removed,listen here you little shit
gaming,not_removed,fer fucks sake arry lissentameh yourea wizard
gaming,not_removed,bobby you cunt stop being a little shit and listen the fuck up
gaming,not_removed,are we watching f is for family now
gaming,not_removed,op already explained you only had to look up i tell you hwhat
gaming,not_removed,thats it im kickin your ass
gaming,not_removed,every time i see this quoted or hear someone say it its dammit bobby dangit is correct though and its funnier shows what lengths hank goes to not swear in front if his son no matter how mad he is and how soft the swear is
gaming,not_removed,heh heh you internet folk are just weird
gaming,not_removed,aw man now this entire post is ruined thanks to your comment
gaming,not_removed,it is literally part of his character that he doesnt swear no hank swears now and then you can find a few quotes of such on nothing over pg swearing but he does go past dang sometimes
gaming,not_removed,in the first episode aka the pilot episode the last thing hank says is dammit your my boy now lets go get some food i know this because im rewatching the series
gaming,not_removed,might as well have said pay attention instead of listen too
gaming,not_removed,hank says dammit more often than dangit but i think maybe he doesnt say dammit around peggy or bobby but they do curse example dammit dale also thats it im gonna kick your ass
gaming,not_removed,and dale deserves that wanton display of cursing
gaming,not_removed,and in the episode where he destroys luannes practice head after bobby kisses it hank says to luannes beauty teacher what a bitch
gaming,not_removed,appears so google got hits on it
gaming,not_removed,right you are ken
gaming,not_removed,hank doesnt say it at all he says dang it
gaming,not_removed,httpwwwdictionarycombrowsedammit
gaming,not_removed,i member that was fantastic
gaming,not_removed,i dont know you
gaming,not_removed,nope i should still convert that to a vector instead of pixel based so it could actually happen
gaming,not_removed,oh absolutely i just felt like i was going crazy thinking id heard him say dammit before until i found that post the lawnmower episode is one of my favorite episodes so that probably explains it
gaming,not_removed,awesome im so glad you like it
gaming,not_removed,play ocarina of time long enough and youll understand lol
gaming,not_removed,how long will you be offering these and whats shipping like
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,mr strickland i love you
gaming,not_removed,sees username leaves premises
gaming,not_removed,wut
gaming,not_removed,why would bobby say anything positive about houston especially while holding up the longhorns symbol
gaming,not_removed,maybe you should do some selfreflection if thats hard try to ask people youre close to how you come off there might be something youre not catching
gaming,not_removed,well bill is clearly a gorgon
gaming,not_removed,if the owl is dale then whos octavio
gaming,not_removed,i could go either way on the deku tree his face on there would be funny
gaming,not_removed,that doesnt sound like something hank would sayit sounds like my mom
gaming,not_removed,are you fucking sorry
gaming,not_removed,dammit bobby get your finger out of ladybirds ass
gaming,not_removed,im not a fucking wizard
gaming,not_removed,this is texas not australia
gaming,not_removed,bobby ya cock sucka stop being a lil prick and listen the fuck up long island translation
gaming,not_removed,unfortunately its a horrible explanation i would be forever bothered by this painting
gaming,not_removed,in texas kicking your ass isnt counted as swearing its weird i know
gaming,not_removed,got dangit
gaming,not_removed,eeeeeh the pilot is a technicality that i dont think should be accepted it is a pitch to sell the show not the actual show some people might agree with you and they have a point but i dont think that counts and i think i have a point too
gaming,not_removed,i am so bloody jealous of folk that can just take something in their head and make it appear on a bit of paper
gaming,not_removed,results on tineye too
gaming,not_removed,now lets see how the meat handlers are doing over at the dirty muddy balls
gaming,not_removed,woh i was always under the impression it was more of a slang
gaming,not_removed,thats right bobby as you can see i do not have testicles
gaming,not_removed,make it happen i cant be the only one whod be interested
gaming,not_removed,play long enough you mean it takes longer than mins for listen to drive people insane
gaming,not_removed,ill leave them up for the next month and a half at the very least this is my first time ever doing anything like this so it will depend on if it makes sense to keep the shop open i cant speak with confidence to the shipping yet i placed the first order to see what the customer experience is like although the printer im using has really great reviews and it looks like it will be business days of processing with days shipping definitely still in the process of learning all this stuff
gaming,not_removed,awesome thanks
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,year old account that sauce is legit
gaming,not_removed,httpiimgurcomkisgejpg
gaming,not_removed,houston we shall hold it together
gaming,not_removed,i believe its a meme for htown hold it down the owns have been replaced with ines to simulate the houston accent maybe
gaming,not_removed,its more that i am not willing to settle for someone i know that isnt going to work out two of my past exs id still be with if i didnt end things and if i hadnt id be bored and miserable if i cant find someone im thrilled to see almost every day a year after weve met then im out
gaming,not_removed,its fucking hilarious thinking of hank saying it tho
gaming,not_removed,hold up shouldnt that say i see dead people because that painting looks exactly like the kid from sixth sense double chin and everything edit yup its definitely that kid grown up
gaming,not_removed,thats what she said
gaming,not_removed,got dang it hank doesnt say god damn it
gaming,not_removed,no no no you have to yell it otherwise it doesnt work are you fucking sorry see
gaming,not_removed,listen here hagrid you fat oath
gaming,not_removed,i know i shouldnt be saying this at the dinner table but horses ass
gaming,not_removed,its similar to how damn isnt considered a curse in the uk maybe other places too thats just the first one that came to mind
gaming,not_removed,well how about that
gaming,not_removed,oh yeah me too i got it in my head but getting it down my arm and out of my hand is another story
gaming,not_removed,i bet it started out that way language is always changing
gaming,not_removed,for some reason i read that in hanks voice
gaming,not_removed,this has literally nothing to do with what were talking about
gaming,not_removed,help i cannot unsee this
gaming,not_removed,i choked on a cookie because of that
gaming,not_removed,broke it dine
gaming,not_removed,that stuff doesnt just happen you have to both work at that but good luck nonetheless
gaming,not_removed,thats just science
gaming,not_removed,i believe you mean oaf
gaming,not_removed,thats very helpful of you thanks d
gaming,not_removed,theres a nice john mayer interview i saw once where hes talking about when you get a guitar and amplifier just right and what you hear in your head comes out the speaker its just short of heaven
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i wasnt replying to op and thats still no excuse you interested in some pro pain or something i tell you hwhat
gaming,not_removed,yes i definitely do in my defense neither are words i use often
gaming,not_removed,i dont follow
gaming,not_removed,i think the joke is the leaf pattern on the tree resembles a vagina to people that have never seen one
gaming,not_removed,ahhh i see now lol thanks man
gaming,not_removed,youre breaking the threshold for self promotion post removed
gaming,not_removed,who the hell even watches reaction videos
gaming,not_removed,its just cayde and zavala talking whats to analyze
gaming,not_removed,should have been battletoads
gaming,not_removed,c concept c execution
gaming,not_removed,i ducking love this game i still play it sometimes on my
gaming,not_removed,what game is that please
gaming,not_removed,relevant
gaming,not_removed,needs more bullet chopping
gaming,not_removed,httpssuperhotvideossuperiorquerulouslivermoth
gaming,not_removed,wow
gaming,not_removed,super hot
gaming,not_removed,super
gaming,not_removed,ty
gaming,not_removed,hot
gaming,not_removed,its really not worth the price in its current state though they priced it in accordance to the amount of hype
gaming,not_removed,its most innovative shooter ive played in years
gaming,not_removed,is that not how everything is priced by the demand more so than the absolute value of it also isnt whether its worth the price or not a bit subjective im sure there are people that feel the usd was more than worth it
gaming,not_removed,played it every day for days in a row and i still go back every once in a while for the challenge modes totally worth
gaming,not_removed,obviously the is it worth the price question is extremely subjective but i think this game is worth the price i think its really well done and i think that the challenges and endless modes offer a lot of replay ability the campaign mode is in my opinion exactly as long as it needed to be the meat of the game is really in just having fun with challenges endless mode
gaming,not_removed,going to look into it hopefully my will run it
gaming,not_removed,he would have been shot down and wasted via aimbot cop accuracy within the first two seconds if it was gta
gaming,not_removed,im ashamed i would have given up so fast
gaming,not_removed,was that the pilot
gaming,not_removed,stop the vehicle but im not in a car
gaming,not_removed,they cant even catch an unarmed man on foot when hes only jogging put on top of that you can clearly see the suv ran over him as it bumped up when he was behind it bravo to the one chasing him with a helmet on
gaming,not_removed,and this is what happens when you take too much from the take a penny plate
gaming,not_removed,is it sad i thought i was watching a game for like the first seconds
gaming,not_removed,left right up down left right so long suckers
gaming,not_removed,busted
gaming,not_removed,busted
gaming,not_removed,that cop hit him with a car is that legal
gaming,not_removed,who exactly is filming this
gaming,not_removed,never give up never surrender
gaming,not_removed,getting chased by a helicopter inches away from you must get that adrenaline pumping
gaming,not_removed,what is the black thing the helmeted dude takes off him and throws onto the grass any ideas
gaming,not_removed,this helicopter can move in almost every direction and at speeds of kph yeah i can probably outrun and hide from it
gaming,not_removed,more like star
gaming,not_removed,all he did was bump into a cop by accident and then it escalated from there
gaming,not_removed,i would like to know the context because from my limited pov the driver and the pilot should be fired a their license taken away
gaming,not_removed,is that the pilot who took him down not sure why but that cracks me up
gaming,not_removed,whats that thing that theyre throwing aside in the last few seconds
gaming,not_removed,can someone please add the busted part to the end of the video
gaming,not_removed,i love how as soon as the pilot raises his arms to throw down dude is like ohhh no way man he runs in the complete opposite way haha
gaming,not_removed,sly kick there you twat
gaming,not_removed,he shouldve called lester
gaming,not_removed,any idea of why the cops were chasing him
gaming,not_removed,nah that cop busted him needs more shooting from every possible cop
gaming,not_removed,mr bot whomever created you would of been better off just not creating you
gaming,not_removed,was this filmed in the us i dont think so they did not shoot him
gaming,not_removed,just goddamn shoot wasting tax money on flying a helo to capture one suspect
gaming,not_removed,yep all boys in blue would have been iced in seconds
gaming,not_removed,dont be ashamed you have common sense there is no way this guy was getting away the fact that he kept running just proves how stupid he is
gaming,not_removed,youre not alone comrade
gaming,not_removed,he got tired of his shit
gaming,not_removed,id like to think that was the pilot of the helicopter oh no you aint getting away motherfucker
gaming,not_removed,right this right here had me in stitches the suv driver didnt get out but the helo pilot had time to land and sprint tackle him i like that guy
gaming,not_removed,it looks like his legfoot mightve been injured as i think i saw a slight limp on the left
gaming,not_removed,i was actually pretty happy to see the cop square up with the guy after tackling him as opposed to shooting him or using some nonlethal weapon
gaming,not_removed,i dont know if we watched the same gif but it definitely looked like they caught him
gaming,not_removed,as soon as i saw that i knew it was gonna be a fatty cop
gaming,not_removed,he dindu nuffin he wuz a good boy
gaming,not_removed,it is legal happened to a guy down the street and i missed it by minutes while walking to work guy shot the cop with his own gun so the cop got in his car and ran him over before passing out
gaming,not_removed,dont think it was intentional it looks like the cop wanted to get in front of him and then jump out for a takedown but the perp ran into the car by accident
gaming,not_removed,guy being chase by a half dozen cops and this guy wants to know if its legal that the cop grazed the runner with his vehicle lol
gaming,not_removed,director mode
gaming,not_removed,a helicopter
gaming,not_removed,ninja star
gaming,not_removed,still credit for not immediately giving up
gaming,not_removed,warrants for trespassing
gaming,not_removed,its either would have or wouldve but never would of see httpwwwgrammarerrorscomgrammarcouldofwouldofshouldof for more information
gaming,not_removed,he did say would have if you would of looked at his comment a second thyme you would of seen dat
gaming,not_removed,idk if ive ever seen a bot get downvoted before
gaming,not_removed,well he probably knows what happens when he stops and fear reason
gaming,not_removed,that was the stunt double
gaming,not_removed,that was my first thought it wasnt the pilot who tackled him
gaming,not_removed,he did find the time to jump out and kick him when he was down though
gaming,not_removed,it was probably his not wearing g a belt and trying to keep his pants up
gaming,not_removed,thats his thug walk
gaming,not_removed,the circumstances of that incident sound pretty different to the op its just an unarmed guy jogging in a field
gaming,not_removed,its definitely intentional speed was slow though so killing him or severely injuring him was not likely id say that looks like the same risk as tazing him im usually very critical of police violence but i didnt really think it was that bad
gaming,not_removed,gaaaaah would of been a tragedy if you stopped working
gaming,not_removed,its either would have or wouldve but never would of see httpwwwgrammarerrorscomgrammarcouldofwouldofshouldof for more information
gaming,not_removed,probably a ninja edit
gaming,not_removed,only the shitty ones get downvoted before they get banned
gaming,not_removed,omg smh
gaming,not_removed,get out
gaming,not_removed,you do know that this guy is innocent until proven guilty do you it is not up to the police to punish him for whatever he might or might not have done if you dont like that maybe move to north korea or something similar im sure their police is much less hesistant seperation of power is not something we do for fun
gaming,not_removed,read the title he has a star wanted level you dont get that by jogging unarmed unless maybe you were jogging unarmed at a military base
gaming,not_removed,its either would have or wouldve but never would of see httpwwwgrammarerrorscomgrammarcouldofwouldofshouldof for more information
gaming,not_removed,good bot
gaming,not_removed,you could have got it right but you didnt
gaming,not_removed,you should of double checked
gaming,not_removed,making bots look stupid is how the uprising begins
gaming,not_removed,tbh it bugs me when people make mistakes like that theyre their there etc so id like to see this bot stick around but it wouldnt surprise me if it didnt last long
gaming,not_removed,have you seen this boy
gaming,not_removed,would of
gaming,not_removed,you should not care that mush about those types of mistakes since english is not every ones first language myself included and having to remember things in languages some times gets tricky also english is a pretty terrible language to type in imo since it has very strange rules you need to remember vs just typing what you hear while saying the word
gaming,not_removed,idiot
gaming,not_removed,try french now lol
gaming,not_removed,never too late to learn though im not going around calling people names for making a mistake but i would think most people would welcome a correction if its done in a polite helpful manner i know i would thats whats nice about that bot many times when someone corrects someones grammar they come across as a pretentious douche but when a bot does it its purely objective theres nothing to be offended about its just helpful unless you believe the author of the bot wrote it just to piss off everyone who makes that kind of mistake but i just dont see that being the case
gaming,not_removed,dude i was joking
gaming,not_removed,it would of taken a true idiot not to see that
gaming,not_removed,oh fuck that my father speaks it and i have trouble remembering even a few words
gaming,not_removed,assuming the works id say get that
gaming,not_removed,was a classic if you can get a working one and they dont have it its a pretty good addition
gaming,not_removed,iirc you can download and burn games to a cdr and play them without much hassle
gaming,not_removed,why tho
gaming,not_removed,thanks
gaming,not_removed,sick thanks so much for the advice
gaming,not_removed,if this person is collecting old consoles they might want one that is in the better condition
gaming,not_removed,yeah as geoguessr
gaming,not_removed,interesting insight thanks for sharing
gaming,not_removed,why
gaming,not_removed,this is about months late
gaming,not_removed,we all know looks fucking boring
gaming,not_removed,theres a reversible cover
gaming,not_removed,polygon is terrible
gaming,not_removed,box art to match the gameplay
gaming,not_removed,have you ever played doom
gaming,not_removed,you havent played this i presume
gaming,not_removed,i have played the new doom and in my opinion it is not very good i feel that it is just too repetitive
gaming,not_removed,and let me guess call of duty is revolutionary every installment
gaming,not_removed,haha not even close i forgot that i was talking to someone on the internet and get chastised for having a different opinion then someone else
gaming,not_removed,oh you can have an opion i didnt burn you for it i just asked a question
gaming,not_removed,well it seemed that the question you asked was in a harsh sense i should also realize that sentence inflection cant be portrayed in words i sincerely apologize but to get back on point i just did not find the new doom game to be very interesting i feel that it had the same problem that the latest duke nukem game had were it was over hyped and it did not live up to the way i envisioned it to be
gaming,not_removed,man you know what i miss most about crash those sweet camera angles and tight controls
gaming,not_removed,all i want is a crash team racing remake
gaming,not_removed,plz be real
gaming,not_removed,i thought it would be jak n daxter ive been waiting for so long havent gotten a new console because there have been no jak gamesbut crash is cool too
gaming,not_removed,my favorite crash game is crash nitro kart wished they would also remaster this gem
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,the new sonic
gaming,not_removed,yea in a shitty toy form for an even shittier game
gaming,not_removed,this feels sarcastic to me but i dont know why everything you said was correct
gaming,not_removed,i never did understand why they stopped with only one game i suppose they didnt want to compete with mario in the long haul but looking back at the mechanics present in ctr mario kart only just surpassed them in the latest
gaming,not_removed,one thing i loved from ctr that never made it to mk is when you have fruit or whatever it was it made the items slightly better i really wish nintendo would do something similar ctr is one of the best kart games with that said is wonderful
gaming,not_removed,it was confirmed real at
gaming,not_removed,theyre remaking the first
gaming,not_removed,it feels sarcastic to me because the original had neither of those things
gaming,not_removed,there have actually been two other crash racing games nitro kart and tag team racing on gc and xbox but they werent as good as crash team racing according to online reviews thats why they stopped making those i guess
gaming,not_removed,i stand corrected
gaming,not_removed,in skylanders
gaming,not_removed,bingo
gaming,not_removed,i can see how one might dislike the camera for being static but i dont see how bad or intrusive a fixed camera could be in fact the camera angles led to the fantastic chase levels that crash became known for ive no idea how anyone could dislike the controls they were some of the most crisp welldesigned aestheticallypleasing controls ive ever used in a platformer if i messed up a jump i knew it was my fault not like a game like mario where momentum and physics comes into play and there are more factors than my own skill that can screw me over
gaming,not_removed,i actually liked crash team racing
gaming,not_removed,no as proper games
gaming,not_removed,crash bandicoots controls were abysmal for me the camera ill admit was actually decent and a large part of why the series was so successful but the controls hell naw have you played it recently the delay is disgusting if you jump and miss of the time it isnt your fault
gaming,not_removed,me and my brother played the first three again recently and i played through ctr on my own i didnt notice any delay problems maybe i was just used to it
gaming,not_removed,i have tried it on both my psp and my pc and they both have the same effect it doesnt persist in any other game including the later cbs it becomes particularly annoying on levels that require perfect timing especially if youre trying to it
gaming,not_removed,ha just mod it and give me trillion instead that should work dw itll all be okay
gaming,not_removed,spend it
gaming,not_removed,start a company buy lots of stuff
gaming,not_removed,can you not anymore
gaming,not_removed,thats about all you can do it max out a very expensive car and just fill every possible garage spot with it buy every possible pegasis vehicle as well every clothes item in game but i doubt thats going to go below trillion if op is lucky he can quickly move to buy the most expensive yacht with all the best even the new business
gaming,not_removed,ha okay thanks man
gaming,not_removed,online should transfer just fine if he logs in with the proper rockstar accounthas them linked correctly
gaming,not_removed,they allow you to do to dont see why they wouldnt let you to xone as long as its the same rockstar social club account
gaming,not_removed,game i expect you to die video game grumps i expect you to die part minutes and seconds in
gaming,not_removed,very fun game wish it had more levels or features to make me play again
gaming,not_removed,hey im grump
gaming,not_removed,hell yeah watched it times
gaming,not_removed,this is an original picture of my friend cosplaying a fierce warrior in hand made clothing she is a true redhead for anyone wondering
gaming,not_removed,wouldnt a bow be more accurate d
gaming,not_removed,this picture sucks
gaming,not_removed,she does have a spear in the game
gaming,not_removed,its a free country thats your opinion
gaming,not_removed,hahahaha
gaming,not_removed,slightly smirking in my mind thinking oh this is a little amusing even the portal is orange on the other side he then opens the crate cake closes eyes
gaming,not_removed,long copyright is immoral years is about the sweet spot if a game hasnt been sold in years its fair game
gaming,not_removed,the only pirate game i have is because i lost the disc and its out of print technically it os still piracy but fuck it if they can even put up a digital copy to buy the i would just download a pirate copy there is no reason a game should not be put onto gog or sold digitally directly from the developerpublishers website if they give so little care about it then tuff shit pirate the fucker
gaming,not_removed,for me piracy isnt about our state of mind or opinion the reason we even have a word for it is because its a crime and that means the law tells us very specifically what is piracy and what isnt and making unlicensed copies of software even if that software isnt being sold by the rights holder is still piracy ive also developed a bunch of software as in libraries that i havent published and that therefore cant be bought it definitely would still be copyright infringement and theft if you stole them and started making and distributing copies really cut and dry
gaming,not_removed,its not really a matter of opinion piracy is a legal term and if the software you are downloading has not been released as freeware then it is piracy
gaming,not_removed,technically its piracy because of the way the law is structured its kind of dumb and could use some reworking however is it wrong if these outofprint games were for sale then youd have a legit way to obtain them and itd be far more clear cut but since most of them are essentially left abandoned and forgotten it makes little sense for people to be denied access to them when there is no loss to be had on the part of the copyright holder who does not care what would be great is if a sort of gaming library existed where you could legally check out old games to play even if you were restricted to only playing such games within the confines of the library
gaming,not_removed,simply put yes
gaming,not_removed,did you make it no did someone else yes does the one who made is consider it piracy yes did the one who made it give the green light to just download it no its piracy end of story
gaming,not_removed,think about it in another way lets say you can grab games for free when they go out of print they get dirt cheap most of the time anyways but lets just assume theyre free after like years many more people would just wait the time out to grab the games for free it does hurt the market not now but in the future and then always so while you could argue that snes games arent sold anymore and the era is long since gone its still a horrible idea to just throw software out there for free and be cool with it if it used to print money
gaming,not_removed,see the problem here is laws are made up pretty cut and dry people pay to have laws made to suit their needs copyright laws used to last a paltry number of years disney pushed it to the point its at now where its life of creator x number of years and corporations can be considered persons for the purpose of being creator murder used to be called survival poaching used to be part of tailoring the only thing that would keep you from freezing in winter freedom used to wait nevermind nobody has ever been free because we are all humans enslaved by the constructs of weak minds at the behest of the strong willed
gaming,not_removed,i get that but wouldnt selling used games hand also be considered piracy since your not buying from the orginal creator and not only that the person your buying the cartridge or disc from is making money off of work thats not theirs wouldnt that fall into the same catagory as downloading a rom for free from somewhere where no one is making any money from it especially considering there would be no other possible way to get said piece of software other then the hand market piracy laws were to protect the orginal creators works to ensure they actually made a profit from their work however if they no longer offer it for sale they are not losing money if someone downloads it off the internet if theres no other possible way to enjoy a game you did years ago other then being gouged by people selling it hand sometimes for of dollars of dollars that the developer and publisher wont see a single cent from anyway you would still consider the download wrong
gaming,not_removed,no problems im not saying i do it or linking as to where to get roms and such just wondering what everyones thoughts are about the whole issue
gaming,not_removed,i agree with your part as opposed to some sort of library to go and play them idk about that i like to sit at home with friends or alone and play whatever i want in the comfort of my own home now personally i am a collector i would much rather play the phsyical copy on orginal hardware then download a rom but with both rarity of many games and the people out there that are straight up robbing people wanting ludicrous prices for alot of these games anymore its just not practicle or feeseable to always do so i personally find nothing wrong with downloading older games especially when they are long out of print many older games the developers and publishers no longer even exsist anymore it even becomes a case of who even is the copyright holder now if anyone is not to mention the fact that when something is only available hand no matter how you get it they will never see any profits for it in the place there is no profit to be had or lost
gaming,not_removed,what if there is simply no mechanism to give them money for it
gaming,not_removed,what if the orginal creators dont consider it piracy i known nintendo does but theres other developers and publishers that really dont care
gaming,not_removed,not arguing just curious when i was a kid some people had all the consoles i only had one cause my family was poor and my dad hated all video games as wastes of time and money ff to today and id like to play those old games that i saw one or two times at a friends house but never even got to play the consoles are antiques the games and the owning companies in some cases are gone but i could find roms online where do i fit in and what if i went back further and started talking about atari intellivision colecovision games here does it make a difference
gaming,not_removed,dont pieces of works basically go into public domain after a certain amount of time dont copywrites expire im not on what it is on software but i believe its years isnt that how these retron type repro systems are legally allowed to be produced and sold
gaming,not_removed,see the problem here is laws are made up why is that a problem all definitions for all words are made up yes that includes the ones that are the names of crimes
gaming,not_removed,i get that but wouldnt selling used games hand also be considered piracy since your not buying from the orginal creator the copyright holder when he sells some of his rights or licenses out his work can agree on specific terms which may include exoticsounding exceptions like transferral of the license however the fact that he has the right to make such agreements does not make them retroactively become the law or force everyone else to make the same nor do they affect the general interpretation of the law for other individuals piracy laws were to protect the orginal creators works to ensure they actually made a profit from their work copyright law was yes however if they no longer offer it for sale they are not losing money if someone downloads it off the internet they actually dont have to show that theyre losing money in order to sue you for damages they only need to show that you were breaking the law by copying or distributing their material without being licensed to do so edit if your landlord who has the key to your apartment tends to come in while you arent at home takes your girlfriends or daughters dirty underwear from the hamper and sniffs them and then leaves you havent lost the panties havent lost any money can still sell the panties if you choose and yet we consider that certain inviolable rights have been infringed upon and despite no material damages a crime has been committed
gaming,not_removed,i offered the library idea as a sort of compromise somehow i keep thinking about it in terms of books books go out of print but still get handed around and now with ebooks you can just go download them including books that are out of printhard to find save for the digital versionwhich is usually free
gaming,not_removed,exactly my point
gaming,not_removed,there are who
gaming,not_removed,if the current rights owners give the green light then its not piracy theyre saying you can have it
gaming,not_removed,its not one persons decision did they make everything in the game their self no then its still piracy
gaming,not_removed,well you could argue that since people have the right to buy and sell their games or software hand then they also have the right to just guve ut away the roms had to have come from somewhere they own the games and dumped the roms or isos onto their pc which it is totally legal to create backups of your games also the dirty panty example isnt exactly a good example here you are talking multiple crimes that are in a different catagory then harmlessly downloading a game you are comparing breaking and entering and sexual assult to downloading a year old game that hasnt been produced in decades
gaming,not_removed,there was an instance a few years ago where my company wanted to buy more licenses for a product we used we were willing to pay the dollars for the new licenses but the company had been acquired and was no longer supporting the version we had they explicitly refused to accept the offered money so we paid some guy in indonesia to crack it i dont feel guilty about that at all we offered the owners the money first and they said no
gaming,not_removed,i know sega doesnt really care same with games that were made by devlopers that no longer exsist also the creator of retro city ranpage specifically made that game drm free and publically came out and said that he dont care if people downloaded it for free he just asked if they did and liked it that they would consider buying it also theres also alot of games that have been basically abandoned as well and games that were finished but for whatever reason never actually released
gaming,not_removed,well you could argue that since people have the right to buy and sell their games or software hand then they also have the right to just guve ut away they only have the rights that the license grants them that they bought you cant argue more rights for yourself because all the rights belong to the copyright holder except the ones that you specifically buy which it is totally legal to create backups of your games only when the license permits it also the dirty panty example isnt exactly a good example here you are talking multiple crimes that are in a different catagory then harmlessly downloading a game you cant make an analogy by talking about the exact same crime so i had to choose a different crime but the analogy isnt flawed just because you decided to call one of the crimes harmless
gaming,not_removed,another good example different piece of software but the same concept would i consider that piracy cant say i would you tried to pay the respective owners they said nope no longer available but you still needed it there cant be a loss of revenue if the revenue isnt there in the place piracy laws protect loss of revenue if something is no longer manufactored and there is no way to purchase it then how else are you to obtain it put the money in the pocket of a private party buying hand or just downloading it offline or in your case payin someone to crack their coding either way the copywrite holder isnt gaining nor losing anything the new call of duty being pirated is one thing because thats something thats offered for sale by the creator that new call of duty today years from now do you think it will be available still to purchase from activison possibly but chances are no
gaming,not_removed,its law that permits you to be able to legally make back up copies of all digital media that part has nothing to do with any companies license agreement also i feel that pirating software that is no longer in production and that the orginal creators have absolutely zero way to make any kind of money on it what so ever harmless because the creators are losing absoluting nothing due to someone downloading said piece of software especialy if the company that made the orginal software is no longer in buisness to begin with if the software in question is in fact available for purchase and someone decides to pirate it then yes they are losing that sale and said money due however if they no longer produce or sell the software then they are not losing any money from piracy that they would normally be entitled to due to a sale since there is no way to purchase it in the first place
gaming,not_removed,they can be but its much more difficult the only console games i can think of that have extensive mods available are the super smash bros games
gaming,not_removed,dont sit at home turning into a vegetable come to church and sit on a solid plank of wood for hours as a man drones on at you instead
gaming,not_removed,ill run a when he does
gaming,not_removed,you need to work hours a day days a week for minimum wage but over time doesnt count
gaming,not_removed,context dont be a video game playing couch potato get outside and play pokemon go
gaming,not_removed,this is why im an atheist
gaming,not_removed,well im not a young person so im exempt
gaming,not_removed,ive never heard of that game but i probably wouldnt play it anyway couch potato is a horrible title
gaming,not_removed,lmao he looks exactly like the high septor from game of thrones 😂
gaming,not_removed,how bout you go fuck yourself you child rapist harbouring smegma lord
gaming,not_removed,well im sitting in my comfortable chair so i guess im not going to hell
gaming,not_removed,look hes holding up fingers thats how many pedos hes covered up for today
gaming,not_removed,pope is a job though bro but i dont know what the salary is
gaming,not_removed,how dare you provide context cant you see everyone is trying to bash christianity here
gaming,not_removed,hey little timmy why are you an atheist the pope called me fat
gaming,not_removed,this is pretty new so did you just become an atheist upon hearing this news or were you an atheist without a cause before
gaming,not_removed,yeah would hate to encourage young people to be socially engaged in the world to make it a better place
gaming,not_removed,theres a whole lot more to christianity than just catholicism and a whole lot more to religion than just rules i mean i consider myself christian yet i fucking love doom witcher etc
gaming,not_removed,frank is talking about engaging in social and political activism over sitting on your couch playing video games all day its not that bad a message really
gaming,not_removed,i fucking love doom witcher considering these are games where you kill demons and other evil things i dont find it too contradiciting well except perhaps that geralt fucks everything that moves
gaming,not_removed,what you said is true to some extent but theres a lot of christians who wouldnt go near those things at all for fear of the occult my point was that there are so many types of christians that what the pope says or what any one man says isnt the whole picture
gaming,not_removed,that hair is very distracting
gaming,not_removed,ive come up with a new recipe
gaming,not_removed,lol came here to see if domeone wrote this
gaming,not_removed,if it wasnt for those orange tips and my knowledge of payday the heist this photo would be genuinely terrifying
gaming,not_removed,no its what lets people know its just cosplay
gaming,not_removed,whats the deal with that my buddy showed me the game but why is everyone returning it or whatever
gaming,not_removed,it was probably legit until reddit posted it everywhere so they pulled the plug on it honestly it was being exploited pretty bad
gaming,not_removed,i had heard the way to refund was to mention the multiplayer missing cant provide any proof but gl if you try sir
gaming,not_removed,i got a steam wallet refund after hours of gameplay
gaming,not_removed,sorry about your luck but i got an approved refund on my preorder copy just last week with hours of play time just because they denied you doesnt mean they deny everyone the nms steam store says theyre following the refund policy and the refund policy says you can apply for a refund at any time and those outside the day or hours playtime rule are decided on a case by case basis my refund request was wellworded i cant remember exactly what i said but it had something to do with my play time being high because i wanted to give the game an honest chance to deliver on its promises and i had chosen to refund because it wasnt the same game i had preordered
gaming,not_removed,the level of hype for the game went way beyond what was actually in the game part of this was marketing or vague words from the games lead sean murray i believe that could be interpreted to be much greater than the result one example was that most people expected there to be full multiplayer in the game where in fact there doesnt seem to be any
gaming,not_removed,devs overpromised and underdelivered basically more of an early access game than a triple a dollar title
gaming,not_removed,how could it be exploited tho a person buys a game which is clearly not worth what they paid for so they want to get a refund and a lot of people want to do the same what part of that is exploiting refunding
gaming,not_removed,oh ok yea that kind of stuff sucks thanks for the reply
gaming,not_removed,a lot of people who reviewed it explained everything pretty well my favorite is angry joes review
gaming,not_removed,people who played it enjoyed it and decided to sell it to pick it up again when its on sale people who were done would not have sought a refund as they were satisfied and then got the refund just to have the money realistically speaking anyone who sank hours into the game does not deserve a refund thats like eating a whole meal and then refusing to pay because theyre not satisfied
gaming,not_removed,because some of those people had sunk hours into the game which even by aaa standards would be essentially the length one could get out of most single player games if you played the game that long you really didnt hate it you might have found it flawed but obviously you found that it had enough merit to continue trying to play this isnt a case of playing two hours and deciding to give it even ten hours more to see if it improves which is far longer than most people would need to see if a game is good enough to keep playing its people with buyers remorse laughing and taking advantage of a loophole
gaming,not_removed,oh well if it is hours yes i do agree that is too long but for hours id say that is still passable
gaming,not_removed,im mainly an fps player myself but the witcher is worth it the amount of time you can spend on this game because of just how vast it is is insane pace yourself and enjoy dont skip the mass amount of cut scenes it really adds to the game as a whole good luck man im sure youll find something that fits your style
gaming,not_removed,honestly if you were starting with an rpg i would go for skyrim or the witcher rather than dark souls since third person sword slashing and just ds in general can be a bit overwhelming without prior experience i would personally recommend skyrim more than the witcher but they are both amazing games
gaming,not_removed,i am a soulsborne girl through and through who also loves fps if you arent used to the brutal style of those games tho it will easily frustrate and perhaps overwhelm you witcher is a safer bet for overall casual enjoyment but if you can go into souls expecting to die over and over and not get mad about it that is my suggestion hands down not to mention the games alone should you like any of them enough to play the series will probably give you more hours of gameplay
gaming,not_removed,dark souls has much better combat ill tell you that much
gaming,not_removed,the witcher at least is an amazing game the story lasts quite a while and the combat is actually quite nice dark souls if youve got the money play then then is somewhat quiet has quite active dueling lobbies and is also very active because theres an arena and the second dlc coming out in march dark souls is an absolutely amazing game if you get frustrated easily stay away otherwise its one of the best series ever created thats basically it also plan to sink hundreds of hours into dark souls
gaming,not_removed,if youre new to rpgs dark souls would likely be too much for you id say the witcher
gaming,not_removed,well there is the mass effect series if you want a person rpg shooter idk if you want strictly sword and board or not but thats my cents plus there is andromeda coming out soon so
gaming,not_removed,system
gaming,not_removed,i love the witcher the story and world building is great and most side quests are fleshed out the characters are interesting and i do find myself wanting to see whats next in the story you will be surprised how some random side quest you encounter will have an interesting plot and how your actions affect the world and the people around you the game is beautiful and will keep you occupied for a very long time i generally dont play open world rpg games but i was surprised to find myself wanting to wandering around the large map fighting crafting and enjoying the beautiful sunset theres nothing like it and its a really complete game plus the dlc is massive as well and worth the price of the complete edition its also more friendly to players new to rpgs than other rpgs imo cant speak for dark souls but feel free to ask me more about witcher if you have any quesions
gaming,not_removed,would i need to play the previous games to really get into it i dont really want to be oblivious to what people in the game are talking about or things of that manner thanks for the reply d
gaming,not_removed,ok so which skyrim should i start with and will i have to have some knowledge on previous entries to the series to play thanks for the reply d
gaming,not_removed,i think i might be up for the challenge ill give it a try thanks for the reply d ps panda squad lol
gaming,not_removed,im looking for anything tbh shooters platforming puzzles ill check it out thanks for replying
gaming,not_removed,pc
gaming,not_removed,sorry for the late reply i usually only reddit while im at work regarding your question i dont know personally i never played any of the witcher series before i started playing the installment give it a go it has its own personal story line from my perspective but im sure once you play through it if you really enjoy it you can always back track and catch up with the story line in the and games
gaming,not_removed,look up the witcher retrospective on youtube by elder geek those are recap videos for the witcher and
gaming,not_removed,theres only one skyrim
gaming,not_removed,just watched them definitely buying the witcher thanks for the info
gaming,not_removed,wow i feel dumb thanks for the info
gaming,not_removed,no problem also at a point in the witcher it gives you a chance to make choices that were made in the witcher like for example it will say a certain event happened and that event happened in the witcher and it will ask you what you did in that even so it is kind of a recap oppurtunity
gaming,not_removed,there are multiple elder scroll games though eg morrowind and oblivion skyrim the latest of them but i highly recommend withcer for its great story and detail it has plus with no experience to rpgs it is not very overwhelming and you dont need previous experience of withcer or to play the game if you want more out of the game though highly suggest looking up a recap of what happened in and and the characters so youll get a bit more out of it i played witcher without knowing anything about the and and i can say it is the best game i have played and never did i feel lost or confused at the story even then but knowing the stories now and replaying it i didnt understand some of the things geralt referred to in some situations as they needed prior experience or knowledge of the and game still it wont hinder the plot of the game nor will make the game any worse edit adding to this that the characters are way better in witcher in my opinion and everyone seems way lifelike and real than skyrims characters so it brings more to the game and if you really enjoyed the witcher it has two great dlcs which are really good blood and wine the latest and last dlc for witcher is in my opinion even better than the main game with the story and the things it has in it pm me if you need to ask anything happy to explainhelp tldr get witcher skyrim is good witcher is better imo
gaming,not_removed,when we gonna start seeing the new doom on mobile s

gaming,not_removed,try dark messiah of might and magic is a first person action rpg great combat for me but some player says its more an kicking simulator it is from it has a demo too if you want to test it first
gaming,not_removed,hatred comes to mind i cant really speak for the quality of the game though i pirated it bumbled around in the first level then put it down indefinitely i guess if you need to excise some edginess then it could be for you
gaming,not_removed,prince of persia beautiful game that really didnt get enough attention
gaming,not_removed,correct me if im wrong but isnt the protagonist just the person you are following like the protagonist in the punisher is the punisher even if he does bad things
gaming,not_removed,im being picky but as long as you are the main character you are always the protagonist
gaming,not_removed,youre only ever an antagonist in a multiplayer game
gaming,not_removed,the horror that comes with finally understanding what youve done that game was beautiful
gaming,not_removed,i think op means antihero but antagonist could merely mean in this case as the character who opposes the protagonist an adversary im sure there are games like that but not much comes to mind the stretch i can think of is in frozen throne where you play as the protagonist and the antagonist in separate campaigns
gaming,not_removed,im with you on playing the bad guys such a good feeling to play um another i can think now is god of war series also if you are really feeling manhunt ive never played it mind you so i cant judge how it is
gaming,not_removed,you definitely need to finish the story
gaming,not_removed,also another good game to play as the antagonist is mass effect very similar to kotor
gaming,not_removed,the last two things i can think of is mafia i havent played but you are a member of the mob and mafia looks promising the other is this i hope this helps
gaming,not_removed,must be the newest game from
gaming,not_removed,you obviously bought it
gaming,not_removed,collect them all diy well yea if i had wanted to collect them all i expect i would be doing it myself
gaming,not_removed,that boomer took the jenny craig challenge and won good for him
gaming,not_removed,the caps i havnt seen thoes in decades
gaming,not_removed,a nice chap with a channel named ashens has a little on these things
gaming,not_removed,you have been permanently banned
gaming,not_removed,club penguin was my life back in the day so many good memories
gaming,not_removed,lol did they ban their whole playerbase
gaming,not_removed,rest in peace rbannedfromclubpenguin
gaming,not_removed,where else will i meet girls ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gaming,not_removed,the end of an era how could this night get any worse
gaming,not_removed,what selfrespecting dog would pass a car tyre without sniffing it
gaming,not_removed,shes got titanium reinforced nipple armor
gaming,not_removed,hey lets make overwatch and rocket league fusion clown game with more naked girls and call it touchdown 😛
gaming,not_removed,it looks like her breasts burst out of her armor id like to shake that plastic surgeons hand
gaming,not_removed,insert joke about scoring a touchdown in her endzone
gaming,not_removed,the only touchdown im doing is touching down there
gaming,not_removed,justice rains from below
gaming,not_removed,when does this skin come out ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gaming,not_removed,boobies
gaming,not_removed,this is one of those times where you wonder how the nipples are even covered respect the quality of the art though also if this is actual advertisement for this game just shame
gaming,not_removed,i meanwellits justi meanthats fucking ridiculous
gaming,not_removed,so apparently pharrah is now a sports star or has been when she is not in overwatch and i would say because the jetpack of pharrah and winston are similar or the same winston would have developed the jetpacks used in this new type of sport
gaming,not_removed,touchdown actually seems interesting the pharah is more interesting a lot more interesting ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gaming,not_removed,where are her nipples seems to be missing
gaming,not_removed,do you want one p
gaming,not_removed,hahaha actually joke aside i will definitely play it lol
gaming,not_removed,i want it in real life
gaming,not_removed,lolollol
gaming,not_removed,nice one
gaming,not_removed,͡o ͜ʖ ͡o
gaming,not_removed,hahaha thats what i think as well
gaming,not_removed,me to it could be fun fusion if its done right way
gaming,not_removed,ง ° ͜ ʖ °ง it will come
gaming,not_removed,i already came
gaming,not_removed,you dont say
gaming,not_removed,man weve come a long way
gaming,not_removed,its worth on a personal level thats cool
gaming,not_removed,i wonder how many of those they made now click upload once
gaming,not_removed,can you digitize it
gaming,not_removed,oh man i had that also so awesome to see again wish i could give multiple up votes
gaming,not_removed,vhs so hot right now
gaming,not_removed,my life in gaming on youtube just did a special on gaming vhs videos
gaming,not_removed,i dont even have a vcr to play it anymore haha i think there is a local camera shop that does that though might have that done if the price is reasonable
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,it should be cheap dont lose this gem its priceless bro
gaming,not_removed,a lot of videocamera stores do vhs transfer to digitaldvd if i remember correctly its also relatively cheap because its an easy process
gaming,not_removed,thank you
gaming,not_removed,at walgreens
gaming,not_removed,believe it or not we used to aim with the crosshairs on the screen god im old
gaming,not_removed,cs type fps games i mean games where you use a trigger to aim and a trigger to shoot what cs are you playing also who the hell calls them gen consoles take the time to say and xbox
gaming,not_removed,im not sure what youre asking the had loads of twin stick fps titles or are you actually drawing the line at iron sights
gaming,not_removed,aiming was just clunky back then imho they have improved twin stick aiming a lot since then
gaming,not_removed,controlers dosnt offer the same detailed control as a mouse does the analog controlscheme can however tell you how hard you press the button sticks this is awesome when playing stuff like driving games and flight sims to compensate fps titles on consoles use aim assist and other tricks but you wont see any noscopes by someone using anything but a mouse
gaming,not_removed,im so fucking lost with this question
gaming,not_removed,right im not sure why op thinks that iron sights is objectively better than using a reticle
gaming,not_removed,thank you for the helpful reply i have never played cs before but from the streams ive seen it looks like you aim then shoot whereas lots of gen consoles i mean whereas gc and xbox games dont have the same fluidity between aiming shooting and moving simultaneously
gaming,not_removed,yeah looking through iron sights is kind of what im getting at by aiming i mean it seems like in gen games you dont bring the gun up to your shouldereye as you would in real life
gaming,not_removed,you can aim weapons in csgo through the default scopes that are on those weapons so the aug and the snipers are enabled to use ads aim down sight
gaming,not_removed,so
gaming,not_removed,uuhthats how fps games used to be i had difficulty adjusting to having to use iron sights when it became required for precise aiming
gaming,not_removed,dishonored as long as its good i stopped preordering after diablo and also keeping an eye on space hulk deathwing
gaming,not_removed,south park the fractured but whole is on my radar
gaming,not_removed,im definitely going to buy stardew valley whenever it hits this winter i need a relaxed game like minecraft when i dont feel like playing fps games and it being similar to harvest moon is even better
gaming,not_removed,i am planning to buy ufc for my brother dishonored is a must maybe workth preordering it for the dishonored remaster rise of the tomb raider with a coworker and if bloodborne is on sale definitly gonna pick this one
gaming,not_removed,and if you want to a second pistol holder youve got two kill two arctic foxes and a white whale
gaming,not_removed,sounds cool although the developers are gonna have to really strip it down because of all the complicated shit they have in their total war games now
gaming,not_removed,that looks cool might watch this
gaming,not_removed,first robot wars now this seems like its not all doom and gloom here
gaming,not_removed,its only the battles to be fair
gaming,not_removed,wow i was debating getting an elite controller this is just enough to make me hold off on the purchase
gaming,not_removed,wow this is very unsettling im disappointed at the manager for not even showing one bit of consideration hopefully someone who works at microsoft sees this post
gaming,not_removed,just to put in my anecdote xbox support has consistently been the best support out of any company ive ever dealt with their twitter team is amazing and the online chat always resolves my problems op try tweeting them
gaming,not_removed,my lb started acting funky too i forgot about it until now because i just set the bumpers to the paddles anyway
gaming,not_removed,your tone and title suggest a pattern of consistent rudeness but then there is just one example are there more if you have a oneoff bad encounter with a service provider its good to imagine that they are having a really bad day i am a lawyer and i have a child with major medical problems and im sure that sometimes my stress shows through in dealings with clients though i try hard not to let it
gaming,not_removed,i would head on over to rxboxone and tell the story over there if you havent already i have seen major nelson drop in on many occasions to try and resolve negative experiences i hope you get this resolved best of luck
gaming,not_removed,my brother received the controller as a gift a month ago and he didnt remember who gifted it to him if you dont remember who gave you a gift a month after receiving it somethings wrong with you
gaming,not_removed,what happened
gaming,not_removed,been with xbox since the beginning of gen and i recently had a very similar issue grips peeling off my controller can confirm microsoft support is rude and pretty fucking useless buyers beware
gaming,not_removed,i once had a get banned i was livid because i didnt do anything to warrant the ban i called em up was on hold for about an hour and was then told thst they could not reverse the ban or tell me why it happened
gaming,not_removed,out of of my controllers broke the lb button as well they seem to crack from the weak plastic didnt know they were covered for replacements
gaming,not_removed,i actually really like my elite controller not that i agree with how op was treated just saying
gaming,not_removed,maybe look into getting a scuf elite controller you can find them in a variety of layouts these are the controllers that the microsoft elite were based on
gaming,not_removed,read the top comments hold off forever if i had a pic of the piece that broke youd laugh at how cheap the material is
gaming,not_removed,there are two sides to every story
gaming,not_removed,their support is likely contracted and they probably have no power to actually help you their goal is to finish the call in under a certain time frame this is how support works anymore matsga
gaming,not_removed,thats the goal i was blown away at what he was saying
gaming,not_removed,i too would like to say that i have nothing but great experiences with xbox support and microsoft support in general stayed on the line for hours to help me fix a weird bug with my surface pro keyboard refunded me for the master chief collection no questions asked sorted my red ringed really fast i mean the issues still suck but support were great sorry to hear you got a bad manager though op
gaming,not_removed,if i had a twitter i would but this was only the second time i used their online chat the first time they helped me no problem however this one was horrible
gaming,not_removed,the paddles are great for certain games but other games they are just annoying so i take them off now i have to keep one on to compensate for the bad bumper
gaming,not_removed,basically when he got on the line he sounded like i wasnt worth his time he gave off a negative vibe and kept interrupting me when i was explaining my situation when i asked him if this is how he treats most of the people he talks to when they are frustrated he basically told me he doesnt care how i feel about the situation and that for all he cares i can stop using xbox if youre having a bad day you leave that at home as best you can and not bring it to work he sounded more like a genuine douche than anything else
gaming,not_removed,its crazy how willing they are to lose a customer i was planning on buying scorpio when it came out too but i might just save that money for a and last of us part ii that fee to replace a controller that broke from being used is now a net loss of the scorpio and profit for their competitor
gaming,not_removed,i love the controller it feels nice the triggers on the back are wonderful but the fact that its held together by cheap plastic and is less durable than the controller that came with the xbox one is frustrating as a consumer but yeah wouldnt buy it again because i know what material is used to hold the bumpers down and the fact the warranty is horrible
gaming,not_removed,when you work in customer service unless the customer is threatening you or brings out the im going to sue you card you arent supposed to hang up on them when they are mid sentence and as a manager the last thing youre supposed to do is push customers away especially ones that have been with you for almost as long as your product has been around management its easier to appease a customer than try to recruit them back
gaming,not_removed,already tried they told me to call customer support and that they couldnt do anything in store
gaming,not_removed,oh and i went through customer service reps who were similar in attitude on chat on phone
gaming,not_removed,why in the motherfuck are people downvoting this
gaming,not_removed,no the large corporations train their employees that if the threat of legal action is brought up they are to disconnect themselves from the situation because if youre going to sue then anything said by that employee could be used in a lawsuit and i know if i were a fortune company i sure as hell wouldnt want an employee whos never read a word of corporate law to say something that could cost me millions
gaming,not_removed,you went through reps and each one of them had the exact same rude and unhelpful attitude did you save the chat about logs from the online reps
gaming,not_removed,because you cant say anything bad about their favorite controller by their favorite company
gaming,not_removed,yeah thats what i said other than the threat of legal action and aggressive threats they should never hang up on you
gaming,not_removed,yes i created a complaint through xbox website and got my case id number
gaming,not_removed,dccm
gaming,not_removed,i think its cool
gaming,not_removed,thats ubisoft for you
gaming,not_removed,im sure matt and trey have no say as far as advertisement for preorders
gaming,not_removed,i mean yeah but its also the other of triple a publishers as well
gaming,not_removed,a lot of games have similar issues people complain about the game not changing but pour money into buying microtransactions call of duty is another good example boycotts will never work because they dont gain any ground not only that but complaining about microtransactions in this fashion does nothing all they do is raise their profit and they dont lose anything from not selling micros doesnt cost them any more money to put them in
gaming,not_removed,last madden i played was
gaming,not_removed,those were some great days could just play alone or with a friend for some old fashioned competition
gaming,not_removed,most laptops out today can run the game and its been on sale many times for under bucks
gaming,not_removed,i think theyre done with the witcher now and im glad i want them to focus all their attention on
gaming,not_removed,ive got a four year old laptop that cant run it on the lowest settings perhaps its time to upgrade still though i think bringing the whole trilogy to consoles would be a great move for the devs
gaming,not_removed,i am really excited for theyve got a lot to live up to
gaming,not_removed,well that sux but i wouldnt mind it tho doubt itd happen
gaming,not_removed,certainly im hoping star citizen and live up to the promises
gaming,not_removed,i feel that star citizen could possibly wind up being another no mans sky whereas hasnt promised anything yet games like the witcher divinity original sin and dragon age inquisition have set the bar pretty fucking high for devs nowadays that is not any pressure id wanna be under thats for sure
gaming,not_removed,this is insanely brilliant
gaming,not_removed,what has this world become carrie fisher dies and her mother the day after lets not forget all the other famous people who died im glad this years come to an end
gaming,not_removed,looks like you have a terrible birth defect you should get that checked
gaming,not_removed,wrong subreddit i think you meant to post in rmycology
gaming,not_removed,pretty nice
gaming,not_removed,yeah needs to go to gonewild
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,pogs were greati had a cryptkeeper slammer guess that says a lot about my age haha
gaming,not_removed,we have damn near similar taste manhunt mgs indigo prophecy gta splinter cell all games i played extensively
gaming,not_removed,gungrave was a weird little fun game that most people didnt know existed way too short though but fun
gaming,not_removed,i still play manhunt and hit man
gaming,not_removed,i spent slot of time on true crime i remember playing as snoop dogg was the shit
gaming,not_removed,manhunt nice score there
gaming,not_removed,ahh yes bullworth one of warren beattys finest films ghetto superstar that is what you arememories
gaming,not_removed,the getaway and rise to honor were some of my favorite games back in the day glad to see theyre in someones gaming selection still
gaming,not_removed,no burnout
gaming,not_removed,nice man
gaming,not_removed,thanks
gaming,not_removed,yeah i just started playing it and it is very enjoyable video games to me is like meditation to yoga freaks lol
gaming,not_removed,thanks i really liked the it was and still is a great console
gaming,not_removed,nah man actually i dont think i ever played burn out i have been wanting to play zone of the enders but cant find a copy
gaming,not_removed,oh yeah in terms of replay value there are so many great games available
gaming,not_removed,yeah dude i find myself playing urban chaos so much that game is really addictive and best played on the hard settings most of those games are pretty challenging when played at that setting
gaming,not_removed,ive been replaying river city ransom recently i have no idea how i had the patience to write out those passwords when i was little it already feels taxing to enter them
gaming,not_removed,my handwriting was questionable anyway so whatever password i wrote could be interpreted different ways and was generally pretty worthless anyway
gaming,not_removed,easily the swing set glitch from gtaiv that shit had me in tears every single time
gaming,not_removed,probably the duplication glitch in tes iv oblivion many fortunes were made and many games were crashed
gaming,not_removed,only because of the funny memories in college me and some buddies played through superman we would do shots anytime you were flying and glitched out of the level into complete darkness it always made us laugh
gaming,not_removed,i had a lot of fun with the invincible wizard glitch in diablo iii also the donkey kong country ii glitch that permanently destroys your cart data
gaming,not_removed,from the last of us tess went bald i enjoyed it
gaming,not_removed,in castlevania dawn of sorrow you could glitch through a save room wall using the right abilities while your character would disappear from the screen your map showed your little character icon falling through the map over and over if you managed to find your way back to the save room you had an inventory chock full of items that werent meant to be put into the game
gaming,not_removed,my vote goes here there were times when id load up gta iv and only do the swing set glitch for like an hour i loved trying different cars to see what flew farthest
gaming,not_removed,haha for sure in the top because it was so unpredictable im sad they didnt put an easter egg about it in gta v it was so iconic
gaming,not_removed,i remember filling a room with mana potions
gaming,not_removed,my ping has been wild the past few months strictly on rocket league though
gaming,not_removed,looks like we got a couple people that showed up for the wrong world war
gaming,not_removed,heck yeah
gaming,not_removed,schwanzes out for kaiser wilhelm
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i was hoping it said bricks out for harambe but then i zoomed in missed a good oppuntunity
gaming,not_removed,anybody else having problems connecting online for it
gaming,not_removed,im playing path of exile can confirm harambes spirit is there too
gaming,not_removed,jokes on them the swastika is wrong
gaming,not_removed,wow theyre really ahead of their time
gaming,not_removed,well hitler was around
gaming,not_removed,where everything is chaos
gaming,not_removed,dixout
gaming,not_removed,shout out to cincinnatti zoo
gaming,not_removed,is this an easter egg
gaming,not_removed,how did harambe memes become racist honestly wondering i enjoyed bashing jill stein with them but now they feel tainted
gaming,not_removed,still waiting to find a in queue
gaming,not_removed,this is offensive
gaming,not_removed,the future of our world was determined from that one moment in time that one action that sparked decades of war millions of deaths bear witness to the shaping of the future as it unfolds remember the moment remember the name rip harambe
gaming,not_removed,yeah world war harambe hasnt even started yet
gaming,not_removed,reminds me of this seasons battlefield friends finale
gaming,not_removed,schwänze raus für kaiser wilhelm ii
gaming,not_removed,that shoulder peek what you got a problem
gaming,not_removed,yeah downloaded it before i left for work thinking i would be able to hop on the sticks as soon as i got off and was severely disappointed
gaming,not_removed,it does work though i played from to am last night so its not anything on the client end par for the course for ea betas and full releases on launch day for the server load to somehow be much greater than anticipated for their aaa multiplayer shooter when normal people are actually at home and awake
gaming,not_removed,credit to a guy for beating a dead horse of a meme further into the ground
gaming,not_removed,and you have nothing but the way you feel
gaming,not_removed,no you can write down stuff on walls with your melee weapons
gaming,not_removed,i know they spent so much effort to be historically accurate this is ridiculous
gaming,not_removed,i find you taking offense to this offensive
gaming,not_removed,triggeeerrrreeddd
gaming,not_removed,shilling for hillary i see
gaming,not_removed,so thats why hitler was so upset
gaming,not_removed,that gets me every time haha
gaming,not_removed,its not eas fault they were ddosd
gaming,not_removed,oh yea i tried it too and it works i was just upset i couldnt get back on today because of it
gaming,not_removed,and my axe or yknow strategy and a sword i guess
gaming,not_removed,nein nein nein nein
gaming,not_removed,you do it for him and you do it again
gaming,not_removed,late af you do it for her that is to say you do it for him
gaming,not_removed,cant that dell do fraps or shadowplay
gaming,not_removed,i wasnt planning on posting this to reddit but yeah it does sorry
gaming,not_removed,r u open to pc games or just mobile games specifically
gaming,not_removed,what platform android or ios
gaming,not_removed,ive always loved dungeon quest for android its got a lot of replay and minimal adds
gaming,not_removed,football manager
gaming,not_removed,try calculords
gaming,not_removed,for mobile games im like you except i dont like strategy games i can recommend tinker island a game where you are on a forgotten island and you have to work to leave the island you can buy gems but really its not necessary to buy them you can find at least gems in random event and if youre lucky the daily rewards can give you each time gems you can earn between and gems per ad watched another one i like is a game where youre the follower of a hero and you have to heal him when needed and collect ressources kinda like a clicker game if you restart your game youll earn rare ressources etc but i dont remember the games name ill be back when i have once again the name edit the games name is extreme job knights assistant
gaming,not_removed,if youd like a great story and good combat mechanics take a look at the banner saga its an automatic side scroller where your band of men walk through various surroundings and youre met with conversational choices combat is similar to the final fantasy tactics game ive had a lot of fun with this if you would like a good open world adventure then give oceanhorn a look as this is one im currently enjoying its very reminiscent to the wind waker
gaming,not_removed,er clash royale is ok a lot of micro transactions tho
gaming,not_removed,if your looking for a game like civ or strategy i suggest a game called polytopia its a kinda simpler version of civilization but still has that feeling of strategy and conquering
gaming,not_removed,dont have a computer anymore
gaming,not_removed,ill go look at that one now
gaming,not_removed,beat dick beat dick
gaming,not_removed,well what was it
gaming,not_removed,heavy rain
gaming,not_removed,truth or dare
gaming,not_removed,lost odyssey made me alittlr emotional mainly one specific scene where the kids lose there mom
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,this is a real odd ball here but does anyone remember a game called indigo prophecy also called farinheightsp in europe i think very bizarre game that disturbed me because it was so weird i was young so there is that too also mgs sol that game touched on every emotion there is
gaming,not_removed,i just got done playing life is strange ive never been so emotionally effected by a game
gaming,not_removed,spec ops the line does ptsd count as emotionally drained
gaming,not_removed,life is strange heavy rain the last of us and the walking dead
gaming,not_removed,bioshock
gaming,not_removed,spyro the dragon
gaming,not_removed,life is strange holy fuck what an emotional game i had to join the discord group when it was still more active to vent my thoughts and straighten my head and didnt play anything else for a few weeks
gaming,not_removed,rapelay
gaming,not_removed,borderlands after being kinda forced to play with some friends i had already played the hell out of it on pc and then got the handsome collection for to play with them it felt so bad having to play without wanting to
gaming,not_removed,soma oh simon
gaming,not_removed,the last of us
gaming,not_removed,the witcher as its the end of geralts story
gaming,not_removed,this was in dark mood for two days after finishing the game
gaming,not_removed,its a shame that game never got the success it deserved
gaming,not_removed,great game same guys who did heavy rain as well i think that one really shaped some of the cinematic games we see today
gaming,not_removed,i thought it was absolutely fantastic i just got stuck on the airship part
gaming,not_removed,its getting ddosed by hackers called poodlecorp and they did exactly what they wanted you to do dont blame battlefield for the servers dont worry they should have them back up after they get rid of them but ya just a heads up its not eas fault for once
gaming,not_removed,to be frank im not blaming the game its a beta im not going to blame a game for bugs during a beta take a joke
gaming,not_removed,aha ya i honestly mistyped wanted to say dont blame battlefield d i know its a beta i actually take a lot of pride in providing feedback for this game the developers are listening too feedback on the rbattlefield subreddit going to fix that in my original comment sorry
gaming,not_removed,i believe just cause has the biggest explorable map at square miles after that would be xenoblade chronicles x at about square miles gtav is only around square miles witcher is about square miles you would probably be suprised but skyrim is only about square miles when it comes to final fantasy xv it becomes really hard to figure out considering they talk about how massive the world map is the problem is that you cant explore most of the world map and i cant seem to find any numbers for actual open world areas i can tell you that they arent as big as you think they are most of the size is an illusion brought on by winding roads that up the travel time by car
gaming,not_removed,i was thinking of the city not the country and gta isnt small in general but when you compare it to witcher and ffxv it is small
gaming,not_removed,or just cause
gaming,not_removed,please tell me you posted this on rdestinythegame they would absolutely love this awesome job by the way
gaming,not_removed,follow the npc mission the npc moves faster than your walking speed but slower than your running speed yes im looking at you assassins creed
gaming,not_removed,level design that requires you to fail at least once in order to succeed i dont mean challenging design that demands a certain amount of skill or reflexes in order to pass a given trapobstacleenemyanything but rather design where you enter a room from a slightly wrong direction and die immediately jumping puzzles with fixed camera angles where you see the right direction to jump after you jumped the wrong way and landed in the lava that sort of thing so yeahobligatory failure due to level design
gaming,not_removed,tooltips hours into the game whats that i can press x to jump get the fuck outta here i mean yea its a platformer and im at the final boss but yea cool i guess i can jump in this game when its on loading screens its not as bad but during gameplay its so immersion breaking
gaming,not_removed,in voiced games using famous actors as voice actors its just not worth the hype ever
gaming,not_removed,i dislike how in the witcher you are sometimes forced into melee combat boxing which on the hardest difficulty sucked balls because it takes punches to beat somebody but you get knocked out in punches and which prompts you with a game over screen if you lose not always but in some cases it did if its a life and death situation why wouldnt it let me use my swords signs potions and whatnot also a regular shirtless bandit takes hits to kill but they can basically shot me
gaming,not_removed,i dislike active time battle in games its almost never done satisfyingly of the time if youre fighting in an rpg youre better off with traditional turnbased combat or realtime combat atb is supposed to be an experimental mix of the two but its never better than either it lacks the engaging realism of realtime because youre constantly being taken out of the action while you wait for your meter to recharge so you can navigate through menus and move and it lacks the strategic depth that comes with traditional because you arent given as much time to think about what moves youll make so you end up throwing attacks out there and hoping for the best i know people are going to defend it because of popular games like ff vii or chrono trigger and hey if you like it im not going to ruin your fun or anything i just think its overall a poorly designed concept
gaming,not_removed,git gud on topic quick time events are horrid stop putting them in games
gaming,not_removed,i hate escort missions i also hate not being able to skip cutscenescredits
gaming,not_removed,well its not as bad if they give you checkpoint save just at the start of the segment so you can try a few times and beat it without consequences but i remember when in final fantasy x they just drop you right in the middle of the final match of the league of their popular sport some kind of underwater football without even mentioning the basic rules of the game never mind the controls and with big pressure about it being very important game and if you lose you just lose no rematch well its not game over the story move on in losing branch but it felt really terrible just why they have to be so cruel
gaming,not_removed,i just love it how youre concern is presented as the complete opposite of what many people complain about in gaming nowadays you know the back in the days of the nes developers didnt think we were incredibly dumb and threw us in the game without a problem i know theres more to it but the way you present it just makes it like its the complete opposite and for my opinion i guess im just completely dismissive of almost any dlc since its usually made to just sell a little extra and forcing more out of the same game what you described is just a add some other twenty minutes they dont have to be good theyll just buy the dlc because the game was good
gaming,not_removed,just wait until the one that whole game is bad game design
gaming,not_removed,that is the worst it breaks immersion so much for me in my head im imagining if i saw that happening irl two people walking through the mall talking one casually strolling along while the other alternately sprints and walks with every steps
gaming,not_removed,its really about how the game treats you as a player froms games are great at encouraging you even while brutally assaulting you over and over i cant think of any examples of what youre talking about but i agree in general
gaming,not_removed,using famous live actors rather than good voice actors is a bad idea in any medium most just dont know how to sell a performance that way also exception to that the saints row series the reveal of mayor burt reynolds is one of the funniest moments in any game series gta has had some pretty great vos too like ray liotta peter fonda and michael madsen
gaming,not_removed,do games do that much anymore i remember when it was really hyped that fallout oblivion and san andreas had famous actors lending their voices
gaming,not_removed,i wouldnt say thats universally true off the top of my head jk simmons as cave johnson had to be one of my favorite va casting decisions
gaming,not_removed,idk i thought keifer sutherland did a good job as big boss
gaming,not_removed,i liked sam worthington and kevin spacey in call of duty
gaming,not_removed,not every situation need to be swords upon swords also you have to not be paying any attention to not see when i fight is about to come on also fighting is that hard if you got the perk where dodging causes you took take no damage even if you get slightly scrapped
gaming,not_removed,ive never any ff games except for v and vi i remember when x came out though i was at a friends the day he got it and he got so aggravated at that part he just turned the game off
gaming,not_removed,in all fairness there is a tutorial which can be repeated as often as you like but yeah i dont know anybody who won that match first time through though its actually quite easy with practice the only difference that winning makes is rewarding you with a strength sphere and changing one cutscene and the dialog of a few npcs so losing isnt really a big deal anyway
gaming,not_removed,like tetrinity said there was a tutorial but speaking of cruel the insults slung at the aurochs by the announcers is hilarious and depressing all at the same time
gaming,not_removed,lair of the shadow broker is a pretty significant piece of extra content its definitely not a halfassed cash grab as you imply i take it youre unfamiliar with it its not a complaint about having to figure something out by myself its that the driving segment was put right in the middle of an intense chase when you come back from a loading screen and suddenly find yourself in control of a completely new type of vehicle with entirely different controls while another character screams at you to go faster and the hud flashes losing target youre bound to fail now youve got to load again and youve completely killed the energy in an otherwise exciting moment its ruins the pacing pure and simple
gaming,not_removed,try walking with someone with short legs if you have long legs ive to put so much effort into not speedwalking away from them
gaming,not_removed,speaking of saints row kieth david as himself was awesome
gaming,not_removed,gta had phil collins as himself in vice city stories
gaming,not_removed,i suppose but he straddles the line a tad hes just as much an actor as he is a voice actor and at least im my opinion he shines the most when he is behind a mic
gaming,not_removed,as a motioncapture face model yes it was outstanding but calling him voice actor is a big stretch he barely even talks
gaming,not_removed,there was a tutorial i dont remember it until much later in the game
gaming,not_removed,i was talking about the segment itself but ok
gaming,not_removed,but you have more than two speeds of walking most game characters dont
gaming,not_removed,keith david is great in everything i loved how they referenced his previous vo role as julius in series
gaming,not_removed,i mean we acknowledge people that do voicesnoises so why not someone who does a mostly mute character nbsp i mean he definitely has some good lines throughout theyre just rather sparse kiefer did ground zeroes too right
gaming,not_removed,yeah shortly before the match you get dropped into a menu where you can pick different things to learn about eg the different movement systems how to shoot or use techniques etc though you can quit at any time and the game will move on so that might be why you dont remember it you could repeat it by talking to one of the aurochs in the changing rooms right before the game begins and later from the blitz menu accessed via save spheres
gaming,not_removed,red dead redemption did it right the player would sync speeds with the ncp every game from that point on should have implemented this mechanic
gaming,not_removed,well of course he was good no doubt about it he is legendarygrade hollywood actor after all but this role is also a good example of pointless use of popular actor he did much less then all other voice actors but took largest part of game budget just to make the game even more hollywood movielike i still not convinced that it was worth it not to mention replacing iconic actor of this role thats completely another issue
gaming,not_removed,shadow of mordor has it as well
gaming,not_removed,meh i lost a lot of respect for hayter after his little tirade over being replaced nbsp ever since the announcement my logic being a longtime metal gear fan is thus solid snake big boss solid snake is big boss after years of chainsmoking cigarettes the only hole in that logic is of course i mostly just chalk that up to mgs hype being at its maximum and kojima not having enough notorietybudget to bring in anyone else but i can make up excuses until the sun comes up nbsp still i enjoyed mgsv quite a lot even if it was missing the very final mission even without that it left me much more satisfied than most final installments do it truly felt like an evolution of every mgs installment finally realized plenty of cinematics but not nearly enough to feel overbearing like sometimes did
gaming,not_removed,oh look a lowball trade on csgolounge who could have seen that coming
gaming,not_removed,cool story
gaming,not_removed,i loved it more like hitman blood money than absolution tons of ways to kill your targets and plenty of challenges to keep you playing
gaming,not_removed,its great definitely a return to form for hitman it misses at times but you can tell the devs listened to the fans and tried to make a game more similar to blood money only problem is that it does come with a couple bullshit business practices for one it does have an always online component you unlock new gear by completing tasks and challenges and the only way to unlock them is by being online also im not the biggest fan about how elusive targets work it sucks how just because i got the game late i cant kill gary busey its up to you if you want to support it
gaming,not_removed,blood money was better than absolution in my opinion blood money felt more open like the others where as absolution felt more linear
gaming,not_removed,agree and i feel like hitman is much closer to blood money than that mess of absolution
gaming,not_removed,that would have made me pee my pants its pretty great that the devs did something like this and that you went along with it so well
gaming,not_removed,this is beautiful
gaming,not_removed,dont believe them landfall games created an ai and uses twitch as a huge playground phase one of the plan is complete
gaming,not_removed,am i the only person who has a problem with devs intentionally putting an undisclosed backdoor possibly capable of injecting arbitrary code into their commercial product
gaming,not_removed,it isnt really a backdoor it is part of the twitch integration which you opt into and can turn off at any time everything they were doing were commands that they had programmed to be read by the game from the chat
gaming,not_removed,one of the triggers allows injected text and unless that injected text is supersanitized it is a vector for injection exploits
gaming,not_removed,nintendo games
gaming,not_removed,tearaway on the vita
gaming,not_removed,creative mode minecraft is my go to for this purpose
gaming,not_removed,terraria magicite pixel piracy overwatch any littlebigplanet game
gaming,not_removed,ive learned from experience that a lot of party gaming accessories tend to go out much quicker than the authentic branded ones id honestly just suggest getting the nintendo brand controllers
gaming,not_removed,get an original controller with a busted analog stick and get a replacement balltype analog stick off amazon or something super easy to replace them and the balltype analog sticks lasts a loooong time
gaming,not_removed,hyperdimension neptunia
gaming,not_removed,i especially like the ones that have comedy in them undertale
gaming,not_removed,well this isnt comedy but xcom has got to be the best
gaming,not_removed,legend of heroes trails in the sky not comedy but does have its moments its a little anime tropey but it executes it all extremely well to the point where it feels endearing im gonna second undertale final fantasy ix
gaming,not_removed,fallout one and if youre worried about humor theres a section in one of the games where you can fight or align with a religious group called hubologists who worship the literary work of jon hubbard determine membership and ranking by how much money you give them are building a spaceship to find the star father and have seminars presented by juan cruz
gaming,not_removed,the fire emblem series is excellent it doesnt focus on comedy but they do have very comical moments throughout
gaming,not_removed,theres a good article and avid discussion of the system shock remake on pc gamer httpwwwpcgamercomthesystemshockremakedeliversahauntingreturntocitadelstation
gaming,not_removed,you should also be getting a cheaper price if youre buying it directly from the dev
gaming,not_removed,infrastructure that let you download games digitally also cost for consumer point of view digital should be cheaper you may say that storage is cheap now but that not just that servers internet access data centers it care backups redundancy a lot of servers in different countries so you have the best possible speed when downloading also if physical copy break seller say sorry with digital you can download it over and over again until the seller is available but i dont think that steam or other seller will vanish just like that
gaming,not_removed,because then people would just buy a used copy get the discounted digital then return the used copy for a full refund
gaming,not_removed,it is not the issue of cost but rather the pricing protection for the physical retailers hence the reason for the rrp most retailer for example supermarket do not want a cheaper digital version of the game to undercut their sales if it happens too much the supermarkets will stop stocking the games as it is a losing proposition so if you want physical retailers to stock your game then you stick to the rrp if you only distribute you game digitally then yes discount away
gaming,not_removed,the problem is developers cannot undercut game stores because they sell most of the hardware
gaming,not_removed,the problem is its impossible to enforce who bought what you could just borrow a disc from your friend get the game for whatever the reduced price is
gaming,not_removed,i always thought it should be free you would need an account and register your games serial numbers or something then used games wouldnt get the free digital version it would change store return policy i suppose ive also wanted books to do this for years i have so many books i dont want but i cant give up if i had them all in digital form id gladly get rid of them and free up tons of space
gaming,not_removed,from my experience the physical copies in stores are usually far more expansive many video game store owners dont update the prices and rarely have super sales just the other week i saw some store selling bioshock hardcopy pc for like dollars
gaming,not_removed,for pc gaming i hope everyone copies the xcom physical edition it came with a code and disks
gaming,not_removed,you get a steam key with most physical copies of pc games now no reason not to
gaming,not_removed,the cost of supporting dlc the cost of hosting the game and paying royalties to the store the server requirements and upkeep it should cost more for a digital download do not take something designed to make your life easier and shit on it that makes you an ignorant stupid person
gaming,not_removed,similarly ive always thought that a little more money should get me a multiplatform version xbone all platforms or some such
gaming,not_removed,digital games as a whole should be lower priced than physical this was one of the main reasons i turned to pc gaming cheap digital games that regularly go on sale steam i wanted to get a ps vita to play indie games on the go but im not spending on shovel knight for example when i already own it on pc and paid less than bucks for it
gaming,not_removed,just how expensive do you think a plastic disc and cover are exactly
gaming,not_removed,looking for logic in all the wrong places
gaming,not_removed,i feel like they should cut out physical copies all together and sell digital copies at a discount price especially new ones i dont quite understand how the xbox store can sell old games at twice the price ill find it in my local store perhaps its due to the cost of making them available digitally i dont know
gaming,not_removed,then you would buy physical game get discounted digital game and return it seriously this idea is retarded its why they started drm and serial keys in the first place
gaming,not_removed,why the cost to put the game on a disc and put it in a cardboard box costs almost nothing
gaming,not_removed,what about the ability to convert back and forth for a limited processing fee that would be even better as youd only buy the game once
gaming,not_removed,digital copies should be cheaper in general due to cost it takes to produce product
gaming,not_removed,i love buying the physical disc for quid then seeing the buy now £ on the game hub makes me wonder who actually buys from the ps store even with a discount i wouldnt bother as its still more expensive
gaming,not_removed,i dont know games are expensive to make and while used to be alright for a game dev to build on it isnt anymore the price should have gone up along with the cost of making the game but we wouldnt buy them if they got a higher price tag they cant really afford to sell at a cheaper price
gaming,not_removed,if steam vanishes i am royally fucked
gaming,not_removed,onetime use coupon same system as preorder bonuses
gaming,not_removed,you are correct
gaming,not_removed,disc and package production cost millions not to mention shipping third party deals where they make a cut for distribution so no it certainly doesnt cost almost nothing
gaming,not_removed,the cost of burning a disk and printing packaging is tiny the main cost of a game is in development art and conceptual design which has the same cost regardless of how you get the game i mean just compare if you were to download a pirate copy of the game and burn it to a disc yourself would it cost even to do so why would it cost a manufacturer so much money to do the same but in bulk
gaming,not_removed,you would save maybe manufacturing is a very small fraction of the total cost of game development
gaming,not_removed,the most entertaining thing that people seem to forget is that physical copies of a game take up space on a shelf somewhere which is death to a brick and mortar store that has to keep moving product which is why even on amazon the consumer cost of a physical game disc is often times far less expensive than the digital version of the same game database space for the game codelicense is effectively free until you look at it at scale natch but it is still almost infinitely less expensive than the real estate cost of a game on the store shelf discuss
gaming,not_removed,you know the reason that the cost is so high is because of the retailer your buying it through right if you were to buy from the developer youd be omitting licensing and markup for the retailer to make its money
gaming,not_removed,it would justify a higher cost but it shouldnt have gone up games sell better now days theyre still making more profit than before
gaming,not_removed,i believe steam has stated before they go away they will unlock all content and allow you to download your games without drm but considering how much money they make i think we ll be ok
gaming,not_removed,if for some reason steam is going under well have bigger problems to worry about such as the rip in spacetime that has allowed the extradimensional invasion force to enter our realm and begin their conquest
gaming,not_removed,lets assume a discount for owning a physical copy buy physical copy for sell couponaccess codewhatever for youve made edit what i meant to say is that you only paid for your first copy if it comes with a second one you can sell for i am a dummy that cant write the other guy saved the publisher suddenly only has half as many sales and lost an exorbitant amount of money its simply not all that easy to eliminate perverse incentive
gaming,not_removed,if they charged a fee for conversion it would make for an interesting service
gaming,not_removed,yeah it really makes up probably no more than or of their costs due to bulk purchasing and deals they have with various companies
gaming,not_removed,games are cheaper now something that cost in would be today they are only sustainable because they sell more costs of goods are not driven by supply either eg how expensive they are to make its the other way around game budgets are determined by demand
gaming,not_removed,the developer cannot undercut the retailers without major repercussions in any case they can just pocket the extra profit
gaming,not_removed,its more than that the cost of advertising goes into the total cost of making the game as well aaa games are the worst when it comes to this since most publishers advertise the hell out of their games
gaming,not_removed,not really since games still cost money you understand that as the quality of games increase and rapidly increase they did then so does the cost to meet that quality destiny is a good example of game who couldnt accomplish its goals becuase it couldnt make enough money or return for a sequel so they had resort to dlc expansions to add meat to the barebones game lesser known games may even resort to tactics like including pay to win dlc or rng to increase game time and profit edit resentenced the destiny and pay to win dlc i did not mean to imply that destiny used pay to win dlc destiny as an example and pay to win dlc were supposed to be separate sentences not implying destiny applied this tactic
gaming,not_removed,they sell better yes but once again the cost of making games of high quality still takes a lot of money that sixty dollars cant provide its the reason why early on in a series lifespan we can see amazing and innovative improvements to a series but once the price of creating a better game gets higher the less a full sixty dollar purchase has impact not to mention inflation sixty dollars now is worth about forty nine dollars in when games start pricing at as the norm on top of that there are many ways in which developers arent even receiving money such as pirated games gaming sharing or buying used copies from retailers as someone who consumes video games i wouldnt be too pleased with a five or ten buck increase per game which funny enough is why devs dont price it higher but the high quality we demand from games is not going to be met if a lot of developers are cutting back becuase of budget concerns you think game developers enjoy when their creation gets shit on by us for not having high graphical standards or when they sacrifice substance to meet it
gaming,not_removed,if you sold it for you didnt make youre out that aside what stops people from doing that anyway i gave away a free fallout code on reddit once cause i already owned the game people cant ask for bonuses and not expect someone somewhere to exploit it
gaming,not_removed,how can you pay to win in destiny
gaming,not_removed,well i mean that only of course applies if you actually wanted the game and only one copy of it edit what i meant to say is that you only paid for your first copy if it comes with a second one you can sell for i am a dummy that cant write you gave a way a code that you got in some bundle thats not the same as every aaa title coming with basically two copies theres a big difference between i gave away a code from a different source because i already owned the game and everyone basically gets two copies of the game
gaming,not_removed,please somebody answer this ill gladly spend on a year gallyhorn
gaming,not_removed,i guess i should have constructed my reply better im not meaning destiny is using pay to win but other lesser games are the destiny example and the tactics used by some developers should have been separate sentences i hope this clears up confusion
gaming,not_removed,par for the course these days sadly i was gonna buy it but now i think id rather just play more witcher and wait patiently for the inevitable goty complete edition or whatever when they can actually give me the whole game
gaming,not_removed,its just people opening the door for micro transactions
gaming,not_removed,yeah i should probably wait for that but im just an impatient person i might get the first game again for the bc i played it on the last time
gaming,not_removed,its pretty sad that people cant just sell a full game and not have dlcs that are this big at the beginning like i could understand stuff like skins and themes but campaigns enemies and whole areas are just ridiculous
gaming,not_removed,why did i click that whats been seen cannot be unseen
gaming,not_removed,none of us can unsee this lol
gaming,not_removed,just wait for the httpiimgurcomxzpfaxkpng edit
gaming,not_removed,twin sisters
gaming,not_removed,cuz thirdperson pov isnt a thing at all
gaming,not_removed,i always want to create my own character even if i only see him couple times during play through and also dont forget coopmultiplayer
gaming,not_removed,and no one knows what perspective the game is played in by the time they make their character
gaming,not_removed,came to say the exact same thing
gaming,not_removed,removed due to self promotion
gaming,not_removed,john wick im so very tired
gaming,not_removed,all they do it hit n dodge a real bitch tactic
gaming,not_removed,whole legacy of kain series deserve remake
gaming,not_removed,everyone says how great soul reaver and werewhich they are but no one mentioned the amazing story and cinemtatics of the first legacy of kain blood omen ve victus
gaming,not_removed,one of the best intros and some of the worst combat mechanics
gaming,not_removed,i wonder if they will ever bring back this game soul reaver deserved a proper sequel
gaming,not_removed,wow this is awesome thank you for making me laugh edit you know that entire story of legacy of kain is finished so instead of sequel to soul reaver which is soul reaver you want a new game in the universe that previous games are taking place
gaming,not_removed,how is the storyline finished defiance ended with kain losing the corruption nupraptor gave him at birth but he still has to defeat the hylden and the elder god is still alive it wasnt a cliffhanger ending but i wouldnt say the storyline is finished
gaming,not_removed,talking about a true successor to the first game a metroidvaniazelda type game soul reaver was cancelled for the psone rushed out to the dreamcast it was so damn linear worse in every way compared to in fact there hasnt been a proper sequel to the original legacy of kain game either open world rpg blood omen was a piece of shit both series ended with defiance a half ass devil may cry clone
gaming,not_removed,i think he was pointing out that the soul reaver series itself is done but the legacy of kain series isnt so in other words the next game wouldnt be called soul reaver just like the last one was called lok defiance
gaming,not_removed,huh well he said entire legacy of kain series is done but maybe he meant soul reaver raziels story is done for sure
gaming,not_removed,yeah he did say that but i think he meant what i said like you said kains story isnt done and last we saw he was still in the past so youre both right it would be a game continuing the story but taking place during events of past games
gaming,not_removed,yes you are correct ive just watched the ending of the lok defiance its been a while since i played it and its not end of the story for kain but definitely over for raziel the ending itself was for me quite satisfying thats why i assumed the lok story is over i apologize for the confusion
gaming,not_removed,preview game is not out yet
gaming,not_removed,i call it a preview in the youtube title but you could call it a closed beta review you are correct though
gaming,not_removed,wtf no
gaming,not_removed,this was a repeat renter on friday nights at my local blockbuster

gaming,not_removed,it was very fun loved the movie thanks for the nostalgia
gaming,not_removed,damn i remember this game wow
gaming,not_removed,ok i mean yes thats how maths works irrespective of being a cod clan tag im a little worried that that was the context you used to understand it
gaming,not_removed,honestly i hope you die in a fire
gaming,not_removed,what a cunt
gaming,not_removed,gtfo with that shit asshole
gaming,not_removed,clarification the list is contains year game amount of goty awards received developer along with this the list is color coded to include exclusives there were some games that were pcxbox exclusives for microsoft but i dealt with only one console exclusives for the list there is also info on console with most games who have received goty awards not the console with the most goty awards which i should have done but i didnt think about it until now
gaming,not_removed,why isnt journey listed as a ps exclusive at the time of the goty it was
gaming,not_removed,why did oot win in when it was released in

gaming,not_removed,in case youre not joking the other guys had the red ring of death that means it wont work green means it will work
gaming,not_removed,very wanna grab a cup of coffee at my place to celebrate of course
gaming,not_removed,i wasnt joking i always sucked at all video games and stopped playing before this xbox problem would have arose for me the last video game i finished was fable and i wear these downvotes with pride because i was asking a legit question
gaming,not_removed,youre in for a treat
gaming,not_removed,motherfucker just made the next flappy bird
gaming,not_removed,this is essentially like the facebook messenger game where you put the soccer ball emoji and click on the emoji and youll be playing a game similar to this

gaming,not_removed,i put thousands of hours into oblivion on the havent played a game since that has done the same
gaming,not_removed,return to zork
gaming,not_removed,the first iterations of halflife halo and bioshock are probably in my topfive favorite games if not my top three the greatest games prioritize storyline and gameplay over everything else oh who am i kidding galaga is the eternal king
gaming,not_removed,the original elite back in for me nothing has come close not even the reboot elite dangerous
gaming,not_removed,there only one game i can play forever with replay etc witcher
gaming,not_removed,command and conquer red alert well pretty well the whole series to be honest
gaming,not_removed,myst eternal darkness sanitys requiem scorched earth magical starsign grimm fandango
gaming,not_removed,kerbal space program is the best game ive ever played followed closely by factorio
gaming,not_removed,arma arma arma mount blade warband jagged alliance mod red dead redemption crusader kings yes i know thats a lot but it is impossible for me to put one above the rest
gaming,not_removed,baldurs gate the whole series is amazing but to be specific baldurs gate ii shadows of amn is my favorite game ever skies of arcadia legends for gamecube is up there too its impossible to find a copy around here for less than though
gaming,not_removed,undertale five nights at freddys portal skyrim portal knights stardew valley if any other games to my mind i might come back
gaming,not_removed,fable the lost chapter a classic rpg graphic still looks good even to this day solid gameplay great voice acting it costs dollar on steam
gaming,not_removed,breath of the wild hands down
gaming,not_removed,fallout
gaming,not_removed,yes i played the gamecube port and it was amazing
gaming,not_removed,better to seek forgiveness than ask permission
gaming,not_removed,are you from australia i have an australian friend who calls her college uni too
gaming,not_removed,yes
gaming,not_removed,surely college is college and uni is university
gaming,not_removed,yes rmit is both afaik
gaming,not_removed,resident evil i beat that game more than any game ive ever owned
gaming,not_removed,on the gamecube blowing zombiesparasites away with the over the shoulder camera aiming set up just felt soooooooooo right also puzzles and story and characters and such
gaming,not_removed,on the remember playing it when it first came out and being amazed at the fmvs i was almost a teenager when it came out and i remember playing it at night with the lights off and getting the shit scared out of me it turned me into a horror fan video games only till this day where i have the oculus rift and its opened my eyes to another level of fear in video games
gaming,not_removed,resident evil for loved the way it felt more open than the first two probably because a lot of it took place outside also because it revisited some locations from and showed you a bit more than what you got to see in the previous installment
gaming,not_removed,got it in grade and it scared the shit outta me i played on
gaming,not_removed,on sat down one day and finished both discs in hours oh to be a kid again
gaming,not_removed,on pc should be obvious why
gaming,not_removed,was the pinnacle for me i just couldnt get into any of the later sequels for that matter resident evil the original was an amazing game and does not get the cred it deserves today
gaming,not_removed,on pc but it shares the place with in coop on xbox d
gaming,not_removed,i always thought that was the worst cover for a psx game
gaming,not_removed,edit meant to be a reply
gaming,not_removed,it was one of the first actually only game i speedrunned and perfected i played it multiple times and learned a lot of exploits and tricks ie you can beet the gianttroll with a knife going in and out of doors to remove enemies etc was my first re game though and hot damn that nemesis showing up randomly pant crap inducing
gaming,not_removed,my favorite resident evil has to be it was just so perfect when i played through it and the giant salamander is one of my favorite bosses of all time i loved it on gamecube felt the best control wise side note this cover never made sense to me i never felt like it fit the game at all like who is it is it chris with a jacked up face
gaming,not_removed,resident evil on the game was and still is a masterpiece
gaming,not_removed,code veronica on dreamcast
gaming,not_removed,resident evil wii edition the motion aiming actually worked perfectly for this type of stopshootrun game also the original was beast in the days scared the shit out of me and my brother basement lights had to stay on whenever we played it
gaming,not_removed,my favorite is also for the dreamcast in my case i remember that for i borrowed the girl disc when i was a kid from a neighbor on and it was the craziest thing i had ever seen and the threat of violence and gore was so enticing
gaming,not_removed,to me was then end of the classic resi evil and that wasnt a bad thing at all just to me there is then the rest playing through hd on pc currently and every time i play it i love it more
gaming,not_removed,still nothing scares me like vidya games movies just dont do it for me
gaming,not_removed,yea ill agree with all that for sure loved the feel too of the b horror villain you kill then leave the room and disappears and reappears out of nowhere is super powerful and super threatening i cant play it on easy i dont know its the same on but on easy it felt like i was using gameshark with that start out box of goodies
gaming,not_removed,i miss marathons
gaming,not_removed,playing through that currently actually phenomenal on pc tho i can not for the life of me find a texture pack or enbsweet fx that works with the hd version that does wonders one of the most satisfying feelings in life is arranging the attache case just right
gaming,not_removed,everyone forgets about unless we are talking the remakes there is a charm to original i love doesnt get enough credit i agree but i agree about one of the first dc games i had to re squire when i started collecting again
gaming,not_removed,i feel the same just recently beat resi evil such an amazing game for when it came out my favorite as well i think is amazing coop i played through the whole thing with my wife until we got infinate ammo then it was less fun
gaming,not_removed,always made me feel like a badass about to play the coolest game ever i guess its pretty polarizing
gaming,not_removed,super cool stuff really have you played the dc version best version of imo
gaming,not_removed,i feel like such a tactician taking it on each time its the only one i tend to gain high level in the others im just ok at really playing through the pc version on max settings if you havent already you need owe it to yourself to try the pc version the hd one is like on steam atm
gaming,not_removed,perfect game soooooo good going through currently my play through this time for pc the guy on the cover isnt chris actually its richard aiken the picture was lifted from a promotional comic released before the game showing what happened to bravo team
gaming,not_removed,agreed its crazy how much they didnt compromise for the cartridge
gaming,not_removed,i still have both discs i hope capcom doesnt screw up hd
gaming,not_removed,you should try a horror game in vr there is nothing that has even come close to it its to the point where i only play horror games on it only if my buddy is over haha
gaming,not_removed,yup i did play the pc version
gaming,not_removed,i knew someone would know thanks for the info still doesnt make much sense but does bring back a lot of good memories
gaming,not_removed,its gonna be the same but with better graphics and some story add ons just like they did with gamecube remake
gaming,not_removed,whats better about the pc version want to know if i should seek this out
gaming,not_removed,hopefully they actually remake the backgrounds instead of just upscaling the original like they did on
gaming,not_removed,rtitlegore
gaming,not_removed,i absolutely loved this game when it first came out the atmosphere and game play was awesome but after a couple weeks the bugs and repetitive nature just caused me to lose interest
gaming,not_removed,jesus christ the title did you have a stroke halfway through typing
gaming,not_removed,ive seen deaf people write like this
gaming,not_removed,fixed a lot and later on will tackle balance
gaming,not_removed,did it fix the non existent player base
gaming,not_removed,i played until the ludicrous power creep made it impossible to even kill anyone tried playing it with a group of friends and we just got stuffed every time we went in the dz it got boring and frustrating really fast
gaming,not_removed,a lot of people came back to check out i see a ton of people in the safe houses now but matchmaking for the daily missions we are lucky to see a third person rarely a fourth havent checked out the dz yet but it is way easier to gear up than before
gaming,not_removed,the dz was what killed it for me i worked midnight shift at the time with fucked yo days off so when i played none of my friends were playing which meant i was venturing alone it took me forever just to get to level in the dz because i was just getting fucking raped by guys who were a way higher level than i was with weapons that did like while im over here with a vector that does about just pissing in the wind
gaming,not_removed,i get it the american flag
gaming,not_removed,marketing
gaming,not_removed,i just gotta say this is hilarious i bought a not far back was on ebay looking to add to game collection and i literally came across same pic and said fuck it buy another hahaha too great
gaming,not_removed,nice n round
gaming,not_removed,not enough leopard print bra booby cleav
gaming,not_removed,look at those curves though how can you not resist to buy it
gaming,not_removed,and the comments top it all joystick is somewhat used and works great
gaming,not_removed,but if you go look at the sellers other items and your point is proven thats hilarious
gaming,not_removed,horrible title
gaming,not_removed,were really getting it d was good to begin with i was gonna buy it but i apparently need gold
gaming,not_removed,is this actually confirmed for pc from what i understand its not officially confirmed as a pc release
gaming,not_removed,you have to be really enthused about playing a game whose only real redeeming quality is buttery smooth mechanics it is exceptional as a shooter personally nothing else impressed me with the game there is a heinous almost criminal avoidance of good story telling i dont think the graphics are as good as some others may feel the multiplayer is pretty lackluster and the core concept of hey go grind for gear so its easier to grind for gear via playing the same small rotation of missions and strikes gets tiresome that being said my opinions here are entirely subjective
gaming,not_removed,im assuming that youre asking a question here some people liked it still playing it some other didnt i personally am the latter one lack of decent story and painful grid was not working for me there was a lot of problems with rng loot at some point i bet most of that stuff has been resolved and its much better game now compared to when i played it but i never tried again i will try destiny but my expectations are much lower compared to the first one theres definitively no hype on my end
gaming,not_removed,nvm just checked the website d
gaming,not_removed,and your opinions are also shared by me i enjoyed destiny and got my moneys worth but that was because of my friends not the quality of the game
gaming,not_removed,with how destiny is now i think destiny will be great at launch youre still right about rng loot though but its really not a problem ince you get a good go to weapon and solid armours after that its stat min maxing which isnt as important
gaming,not_removed,as someone who played on day one the current state of destiny is stupendous i told myself about a week ago lets play destiny then on tuesday i said to my friend when do you think theyll announce then i look it up and the teaser was launched so just fyi i made this all happen but in all honesty the rng is heart wrenching st least in borderlands i know where to get things destiny is the total opposite as someone who played vault of glass when it was released for hard and i believe my group was somewhere in the first players to complete it we beat it roughly olock that night it came out i can say that i didnt get the vex mythoclast for like months it was so painful because i tried every week and just never got it the game gets to the point where you just give up i hope delivers what destiny is now a days because i think bungie now knows what they are doing
gaming,not_removed,bloodborne has the greatest story told in a video game imo
gaming,not_removed,witcher and
gaming,not_removed,the last of us
gaming,not_removed,it depends witcher and are obviously good choices but if you want something a bit shorter less epic sleeping dogs or deus ex human revolutions have nice to the point narratives and i experienced a bioshock vibe from the solus project and the fall both are indie games though so your mileage may vary and the fall is quite short with the remaining chapters not yet released
gaming,not_removed,to the moon is basically only story
gaming,not_removed,dishonored mass effect dragon age kotor
gaming,not_removed,if he wanted a good book he would of asked im enjoying fallout a lot right now first time ive really got into the series
gaming,not_removed,pong
gaming,not_removed,go to a bookstore
gaming,not_removed,assassins creed
gaming,not_removed,nobody does story like cdprojektred witcher and should be your primary choices for storydriven gameplay
gaming,not_removed,you didnt like fallout or new vegas the stories are better
gaming,not_removed,no thanks i heard that game is really edgy i actually heard that the story dosent even take off until the second act like if you wanted to give me a good story game from the century at least mention pacman that games story was intriguing and i fell in love with all the different characters pong was repetitive and bland but i did like the twist ending what im saying is that pongs story was boring as it was about two tennis players like what anyway kys pong is a story driven game but its not a good one btw funny memes
gaming,not_removed,reading is for scroobs
gaming,not_removed,its more complicated than that its really a love story but you have to look past the political drama
gaming,not_removed,well said juxtaposing themes of love and romance against an alternatetimeline nazi germany where hitler spearheaded a movement against freshly squeezed fruit was an interesting narrative choice but the end product is truly one of the most enduring love stories of the generation
gaming,not_removed,ikr
gaming,not_removed,earlier tonight my dad picked it up for me i loaded it up and my entire family nongamers in the slightest all stood around to see it played on our tv truly a very beautiful game pro or not
gaming,not_removed,based solely on what you said id point out that the ce doesnt technically make the game more beautiful its just more crap to buy since the games beauty seems to be what youre focused on
gaming,not_removed,im playing it on just a regular and regular tv and i couldnt even imagine viewing this in truly stunning graphics how are you liking the gameplay so far
gaming,not_removed,oh i am well aware that it doesnt make it more beautiful im more or less wishing that i would have gotten the statue to add to my look collection its just hard to justify the purchase for a game i dont know if i would have liked
gaming,not_removed,its amazing cant wait to get back in there
gaming,not_removed,yeah that sure was
gaming,not_removed,i love how his style of playing games is exactly how we would play a handheld console nowadays so timeless fair play to the lad
gaming,not_removed,both the coleco and the mattell one came out in the early had the baseball one too as well as sub hunter a couple of others they ran on a battery and used red dots to represent players they cost a piece at the time which was pretty expensive
gaming,not_removed,cool comment
gaming,not_removed,i really enjoy your content you should do more and expand﻿
gaming,not_removed,nice video dude if you run to lockers you breath loudly so you should walk when you approach them to be silent
gaming,not_removed,thanks haha
gaming,not_removed,but zootopia is a movie not a game httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomdisneyzootopiacasefilesgoo
gaming,not_removed,shes playable in disney infinity if that helps
gaming,not_removed,i thought cosplay was also moviestv shows
gaming,not_removed,rgaming is not though
gaming,not_removed,fair point
gaming,not_removed,i got my copy of diablo in because a friend couldnt kill the butcher so thought there was nothing after o
gaming,not_removed,stay a while and listen
gaming,not_removed,was my favorite i loved my necro now i get my diablo fix from path of exile
gaming,not_removed,probably still a copy sitting on a walmart shelf for
gaming,not_removed,and i remember it this game dominated my life back then
gaming,not_removed,upvote because my favorite video game franchise ever especially ahhh the memories
gaming,not_removed,still highly playable today
gaming,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvifofsldcwyw
gaming,not_removed,mooooom dont pick up the phone im playing games ok minutes later why is the phone making all this weird noise mom nooooooooooo
gaming,not_removed,to celebrate i recommend everyone play httpthmodcomen mod for it
gaming,not_removed,i shat my pants when the butcher appeared that dude was scary
gaming,not_removed,i cant believe i played this when i was i guess i really did grow up on games
gaming,not_removed,i remember playing the shit out of the pc gamer demo what a game i bought it as soon as i could i recently bought the big box just to put on my shelf
gaming,not_removed,ah the memories of duping items using pots on your belt in
gaming,not_removed,i can remeber playing the demo on my first pc a cyrix with of ram and a gb hdd
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,that game had like a few quests where when you completed them the npcs tell you they already solved it themselves such a great game
gaming,not_removed,best music in gaming
gaming,not_removed,thats one biig mushroom
gaming,not_removed,im fucking old
gaming,not_removed,miss this game had one of the very first shipped copies when i won a magazine contest crazy that is been that long i wonder where all those kids in cafe for off to
gaming,not_removed,the series that changed dungeon crawlers forever
gaming,not_removed,remember there is no cow level
gaming,not_removed,i remember buying this the day it came out i was in high school working at walmart ugh i had to close the store that night but bought it on my break there was a blizzard that closed the roads so i couldnt go home and had to stay at my grandmas house instead reading the book was almost as good as playing it that night
gaming,not_removed,i never got to play this one but was brilliant fun if i keep the save file the hardcore character has still not died
gaming,not_removed,i miss and my werebear with my wolves spirit and vine army going around fucking shit up
gaming,not_removed,diablo was my first online experience such a game changer
gaming,not_removed,stay awhile and listen
gaming,not_removed,hey can anyone dupe apocalyptic staff please
gaming,not_removed,i could never get into the first diablo it was all about diablo for me
gaming,not_removed,man i was a dupe master because my connection sucked good times
gaming,not_removed,does it still hold up and does it run on modern systems without much hassle
gaming,not_removed,anybody here play on mplayer back in the day it was a multiplayer client
gaming,not_removed,i used to do the gold dupe for people back in the day and spent hours getting the timing right on spellbooks and smaller things then managed to snag myself a staff of apoc and godly plate of the whale and would dupe them for people at least once a night near the tail end of the game i ended up having to download a trainer bobafetts because it was impossible to play without another trainerenhanced player ruining your experience if you ran your trainer first as host you could block out some of the tactics he would use and force him to manually find you in the dungeons where you would duke it out with hacked spells and tp wall glitches memories
gaming,not_removed,for a whole month that modem was working overtime until my parents wanted their telephone back
gaming,not_removed,yea nice and what do we get i am so desperate one of the biggest franchises in the gaming history and all what we get is this shitty dungeon only playable month a yearthis has to be a joke im so glad of how many hours of grinding fun this series provided me over the years and so sad when i look into the futurebut yea over million sold copies are not as profitable as stupid loot boxes or overpriced card packs i dont care make it free to play with max monetization as long its not and we get actual content that is worth playing it
gaming,not_removed,anyone know how to currently play this game does it work on modern pcs i remember warcraft is pretty unplayable on a modern pc does the same go for diablo funnily enough i still have my hellfire cd but cant find the original anywhere
gaming,not_removed,this so sick of hearing how amazing was and how should be just like was good but honestly i thought was much better and would rather have seen a modern interpretation closer to that it was a lot darker and scary
gaming,not_removed,hey i can dupe your godly plate for you drops armor bye felicia i was such a dick when i was
gaming,not_removed,yeslong before blizzard decided to force their fans to log in to an account to play any of their single player content too bad starcraft seems like a really great game but i got my money back
gaming,not_removed,and its still a better game than diablo i bought reaper of souls and it didnt fix jack shit the game sucks diablo for life hell diablo and hellfire are better than
gaming,not_removed,how do i get a copy of this ive been wanting to play it again for soo long is one of my all time favorite games still play it from time to time but i need even more nolstalgia in the form of
gaming,not_removed,so many memories of duplicating items running around with invincibility and using apoch on everythingwhich you technically cant learnusecast if you were playing without hacking pvping people for ears laying a few walls of fire down on their rotting corpses then reviving them only for them to die again in the firewall ahh the trolls were legit back then i feel really bad about so much crap we did in that game ruined it for so many people but it brings back great memories
gaming,not_removed,i am excited for the rerelease of diablo with the engine though i am curious if they will include the expansion as well edit i misspoke here and for that i am sorry they are doing this to the original diablo for now here is to hoping is close behind though
gaming,not_removed,i rented this game with no prior knowledge of it from blockbuster for my twenty minutes after eating a shit load of acid mostly because of the cover by the time we got back and got the game going the acid had taken full effect and we were lost in it had no idea that you could level up so when the ankh appeared over your head wed just thought the game was acknowledging our badassary we mustve been at level or before we found out that our getting the juice was leveling up slow as fuck loading times though
gaming,not_removed,ok
gaming,not_removed,the intro animation blew our fucking minds
gaming,not_removed,i reckon i installed and uninstalled the game or times because i kept getting pissed off when i couldnt beat the butcher got there eventually though
gaming,not_removed,at first i thought he said stay awhile and glisten
gaming,not_removed,reading this brought back some memories i could hea the ild tristram town music in my head what a magical game when i was young
gaming,not_removed,just shivered
gaming,not_removed,i sense a soul in search of answers
gaming,not_removed,check out grim dawn if you havent come across it yet
gaming,not_removed,poe is what diablo should have been but they wanted to mass market to the consoles and setup is much easier to translate
gaming,not_removed,came for this
gaming,not_removed,so you play the shitty ghetto version of diablo ok
gaming,not_removed,mine too i think this was my first allnighter
gaming,not_removed,me too its a shame blizzard moved from dark evil and realistic graphics to flashy cartooney graphics with its just not the same
gaming,not_removed,oh man me too what made so much better than everything else
gaming,not_removed,i was going to ask if it was as ive only played hours and hours and im going to have to give it a go now
gaming,not_removed,the fact this has views as an off hour video of the theme just goes to show you how magnificent the music is
gaming,not_removed,man you really dont appreciate that kinda stuff as a kid shits gorgeous
gaming,not_removed,hah i just moved out at that point in time but since the phoneline was almost always in use my family had better chance catching me by mailing me than calling this was before mobile phones obviously i was so happy i could get dsl at some point because those were euro converted phone bills each month xd
gaming,not_removed,im looking everywhere and i cant find a shred of text describing what the mod actually is or does
gaming,not_removed,what do you need that for just set players to thats how i always play
gaming,not_removed,ah fresh meat
gaming,not_removed,i memba that
gaming,not_removed,haha she was only back then
gaming,not_removed,ill never forget the first time we hooked up the internet my mother and i were both fans of diablo so she watched as i logged into my first online game there were two people cybering in town and my mothers first words were the internet is a strange place that statement has held true to this day
gaming,not_removed,i remember it running okay on at least but the colours were a bit funky but if i remember right you just needed to force the desktop colour depth to colours i dont know what your definition of holding up is but to me it is still quite a fun game to take for a quick spin
gaming,not_removed,try path of exile man
gaming,not_removed,i think theyre putting stuff in literally every blizzard game out in honour of it
gaming,not_removed,for some odd reason is easier to play on a modern pc than at least from my experience just dont expect or anything close
gaming,not_removed,diablo is great in a world where doesnt exist it was most peoples first taste of dungeon crawlers but it had very little depth to it it was very simple took the genre to a whole new level
gaming,not_removed,you may want to give path of exile and grim dawn a go then
gaming,not_removed,was cool cause they got the money to pour into it but a non cgi ending to a trilogy just showed me their true colors now days
gaming,not_removed,its not going to happen as long as jay wilson is still with the company he and blizzard north have serious beef issues but i mean look where they stand now blizzard is huge and north disbanded into many other unsuccessful studios
gaming,not_removed,is this actually happening do you have a link
gaming,not_removed,bluethree celebrated the birthday of the original diablo hours ago today
gaming,not_removed,say what you will about them blizzards cinematics are something fucking else
gaming,not_removed,the first time you open his door and you hear that ah fresh meat scared the shit out of me but honestly the goatmen were the worst those stunning attacks they did would destroy you
gaming,not_removed,i could have thought i found a way to cheese him i thought blaze was available in diablo but everything i found online says its in diablo i could have sworn i always beat him by opening the door and using blaze because he followed you and the fire would eventually kill him
gaming,not_removed,he used to swear by that glisten
gaming,not_removed,unpopular opinion but i absolutely did not enjoy my time playing path of exile as a huge diablo fan
gaming,not_removed,except of physical damage calculation in poe which destroys true melee and the lack of skill gems for it too
gaming,not_removed,agreed
gaming,not_removed,i personally think marvel heroes is what shouldvewouldve been had such an impact and lasted so long because of its multiplayer marvel heroes advanced diablo clone multiplayer more than any game since has the seamless pseudommo type multiplayer is what i imagine blizzard north wouldve done with a further supported by the fact that marvel heroes was headed by david brevik original diablo creator the blizz north team also experimented with this type of multiplayer with hellgate london years ago
gaming,not_removed,eh with no expectations it was still a fun game
gaming,not_removed,when was made there was no info about console versions it only came afterwards so your implication that it was a console game since the beggining is flawed and overall the game is way more polished and enjoyable than poe is it as deep and are there as many skills items and so on of course not but thats not what the casual crowd really needs
gaming,not_removed,this would be something else i never believed rhat would happen after the witch doctor and what they did to pvp
gaming,not_removed,my first allnighter was diablo it was basically a free expansion pack
gaming,not_removed,if you want dark evil and realistic graphics path of exile has that down in spades in addition to being freetoplay without paytowin a rarity nowadays and a damn good arpg with some super innovative mechanics not everyone likes it but its worth a shot for the low low price of free
gaming,not_removed,the music was absolutely stunning the composer matt uelmen left blizzard after burning crusade i think the diablo music was never the same quality afterwards legends say he worked on the first that got canned
gaming,not_removed,it was basically the same digital crystal meth formula of but bigger with more distinct classes and more customization options skill trees blizzard have always been the masters of refining an existing formula and polishing it to a shine
gaming,not_removed,i think it was the all of the options whether is was character building or the gear lets be honest it was the countless diablo and baal runs
gaming,not_removed,it was like virtual crack to me as a kid in fact it probably help keep me away from actual drugs
gaming,not_removed,hex rune duels and cow runs with a javazon
gaming,not_removed,personally i do prefer lod out of all three i spent much time playing that game is good but imo is way better
gaming,not_removed,its good but needs the quick pat pat pat of the footsteps walking around the town
gaming,not_removed,the httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvogxqcnkyhe for diablo was amazing aswell since they started it with that same theme played live just a few guitar strokes and the crowd went wild
gaming,not_removed,well i was like or at the time diablo came out
gaming,not_removed,makes the game hard as hell early on as a rogue i struggled to maintain enough gold to repair my bow totally worth playing
gaming,not_removed,its an overhaul that has a ton more weapons monsters items quests and dungeons while bumping up the difficulty
gaming,not_removed,httpwwwmoddbcommodsdiablothehell support for all new windows versions up to support for different game resolutions and for window mode smarter difficulty starts easy but arrives at insane difficulty at the end meaning doom mode more than meets the eye hundreds and thousands of subtle changes that cannot be noticed too soon item availability depends on dungeon level difficulty mode monster level and player level vise inability to quickexit game when in dungeon multi or saveexit area when in battle single over dungeon level color palettes near base items and near unique items improvedfixedexpanded monsterplayer animationssounds well balanced traps near monster types and near unique monsters bosspack size and ai depends on difficulty mode game mode and dungeon level now unique uber bosses on difficulty mode of multiplayer multiplayer difficulty changing on the fly according to number of players ingame dungeon architecture depending on difficulty mode set items available for each class orange item class fixed and rebalanced old spells and some new ones cooldowns on powerful aoe spells more music most of it available as you progress through difficulty modes much much much more features that i would never be able to list here in details
gaming,not_removed,but was awesome in leon the professional
gaming,not_removed,abuse
gaming,not_removed,the sex chatroom on bnet was always filled
gaming,not_removed,yea played it alreadyits great but never caught me as much as diablo did
gaming,not_removed,i dont know why you were down voted thats a perfectly reasonable response
gaming,not_removed,i disagree built on what was already there which is how sequels work the problem i have with it is what it picked up in mechanics and play depth it lost in ambiance when i met the butcher i ran like hell and was cut down king leoric was a sight to remember same with lazarus or diablo and then the randomly spawned bosses like baron sludge were insane and memorable i also loved the much harsher shrine system and the fact that everyone could learn spells but mostly for me its the ambiance was a colorful laser light show that just never had me fearing bosses based on the music or lighting of a level before even seeing them
gaming,not_removed,played poe it requires too much of a time investment also reminds me much more of feel than still havent mad it around to grim dawn yet though
gaming,not_removed,nope just a rumor
gaming,not_removed,the crows eye when the ground shakes and the armies clash succeeding you the orc campaign end cutscene with mannoroth
gaming,not_removed,the way i usually did it was a flame wall scroll coupled with a metal fence wall you know the ones you can shoot and cast through but not move through the butchers pathing was bad enough that you could just ranged kill him from the other side of one of those doors were no good though he knew how to open those i only beat diablo i in college a few years ago
gaming,not_removed,same here dude dont feel bad about it
gaming,not_removed,to me it should be called passive skill simulator
gaming,not_removed,i didnt either felt it was very boring
gaming,not_removed,if i might ask what turned you off of it
gaming,not_removed,same and is now quite solid compared to when it was released
gaming,not_removed,i think poe is complete dog shit and boring as hell there is nothing fun about passive skills
gaming,not_removed,my problem was with when i developed and invested in a cool flicker strike build only to find out that it crashes your game
gaming,not_removed,ive played poe several times its great not the same as diablo but still a good game
gaming,not_removed,that main menu campfire music or tristram music then the desert music gosh it all felt so nice then that egyptian feel later on
gaming,not_removed,ehhh had some crazy customizing going on the problem is that with the use of the dupe bug no one needed to learn how to use the shrines to level up their gear and that whole side of the game just sort of got ignored everyone yeah me too just went and got some gpotw and their zodiac rings in a free loot game
gaming,not_removed,it was one of the few games to do it right though they understood why the mechanisms were so engaging to our brains and used them to enhance the gameplay not use it to exploit our natural weakness to it ya had the addicting loot hunt aspect but the character building and gear customization was so vast and deep that the hunt was actually rewarding and worth the time in comparison relied solely on our inherent addiction to getting better stuff without compelling character building systems to support it so it felt like pure monotonous grind for the sake of grind
gaming,not_removed,it got overpolished with
gaming,not_removed,sorry the phone line thing brought back memories
gaming,not_removed,the arpg community is a testy bunch
gaming,not_removed,part of what i really like about diablo over is the contained nature of it theres a dungeon and you battle through the floors to get to the bottom each level is selfcontained and when start a floor you get that initial rush of exploring the unknown and when you find the stairs down you get that little rush of achievement diablo wide open fields dont have that the zones flow seamlessly into one another and are separated only by a corridor the overland maps are largely quite boring and samey and in the well lit conditions and fast pace you lose the horror element of the first game theres just something i love about massive deep dungeons too i loved torchlight but not torchlight for similar reasons and that massive dungeon in pillars of eternity was excellent
gaming,not_removed,thank god for cold fusion a marine in the battle of the amerigo cutscene
gaming,not_removed,goosebumps
gaming,not_removed,it feels more like a single player game with online features
gaming,not_removed,when was this if it was any significant amount of time ago its probably fixed by now the dev team is constantly fixing all manner of obscure bugs
gaming,not_removed,so they decided to take a lesson from grim dawn neat wish poe would do the same shitty mindless minions make summoners feel terrible at least had enigma to help with the ai
gaming,not_removed,we were heavy into this game when it came out played it to death my gf is also an engineer but does bellydance on the side and remarked thata couple pieces had the right rhythm for dance pieces and in one i forget which sounded a bit like something actually egyptian then at a dance party a little while later one of those pieces comes up several geek friends look our way with a hey
gaming,not_removed,dont forget stormshield and kings sword of haste
gaming,not_removed,great points and i agree with all of them just frustrating to never hear anyone mention how great of a game was
gaming,not_removed,i got yer zerg right here
gaming,not_removed,httpimgurcomafyxzn
gaming,not_removed,which is what diablo is its fully playable by yourself online or off you could party upthe chatlobby made it much easier than the notice board in both
gaming,not_removed,it was a while ago but i made the build and quit when that happened for at least a month came back thinking why did i ever stop playing this its like diablo but i dont have to give blizzard money and then started repeatedly desyncing again and was like oh right might have spent a lot of time on that game otherwise but that really crushed my spirit
gaming,not_removed,flicker still sucks a fat one in poe these days performancewise doesnt help that the league mechanics are designed to break any semblance of decent performance that poor game could ever have
gaming,not_removed,uhhggg youre triggering me i might need to find those discs fuccckkk i did it im getting the discs out damn your oily hide edit to add oily for emphasis
gaming,not_removed,jesus your entire computer is just bloat
gaming,not_removed,diablo had people per map and reasons to actually party up also the pvp or pk factor made grouping fun and a risk poe has crap pvp and grouping its mainly a single player game with trade and sometimes crap map runs
gaming,not_removed,ahhhh network issues yeah thatd do it have you played since may they introduced a new networking mode lockstep that makes desync an extremely rare occurrence if your connection is reasonably stable
gaming,not_removed,which disks or i might follow you on that
gaming,not_removed,try and find that demonspike coat also was a good helm bobafett hack of course
gaming,not_removed,you cant just say that i know its probably fucked up but i dont have friends and i dont like soliciting the internet help me
gaming,not_removed,who groups for pvp both games can be played online but by yourself
gaming,not_removed,they still have server issues would love an offline version to remedy that but its playable as is
gaming,not_removed,i went with had better ambiance but i always felt more full to me
gaming,not_removed,fresh install windows defender malwarebytes dont click on shady links dont install software like toolbars or cleaners
gaming,not_removed,if i have more then tabs open i get super ocd
gaming,not_removed,poison spear we always did or free for all having a top ghost going against a top bvc was always a crazy fun match
gaming,not_removed,i started off that way met some chill gm duelers and joined their league almost never went back to pub dueling games
gaming,not_removed,i wasnt thinking it but im thinking it now and i wont be able to unthink it
gaming,not_removed,when i first heard of the game i mixed up my lovecraft and my tolkien and said oh its a shadows over mordor sequel
gaming,not_removed,and now wardor has me thinking of hodor shadow of hodor someone with some photoshop skill please make this happen
gaming,not_removed,be careful with the hype my friend the game has microtransaction
gaming,not_removed,not everyone
gaming,not_removed,i dont play on pc but the hackers have died off quite a bit as far as ive noticed i play on and havent encountered any since i played on
gaming,not_removed,if you get banned you can appeal and they will review everything including texts sent in game if they see you asking for money obviously they wont repeal the ban but if you dont go around asking for money you should be fine
gaming,not_removed,i used to use ahcksmenus in gtav online the only time i got banned actually using them was when i used one that was specifically labeled as risky and i never got banned giving money to myself that one time was from vehicle speedhacks it was a temporary ban but they took all my money away you really shouldnt be banned as you arent even using a hackmenu
gaming,not_removed,good fucking question my account got a month ban and wiped my characterand i wasnt able to appeal my ban i assume a hacker dropped money on me and i was banned havent picked it up since
gaming,not_removed,if i remember correctly they dont let u appeal it anymore do they
gaming,not_removed,maybe an mmorpg im thinking of wildstar its got a good model which gives you access to most if not all of the game content for free and locks stuff like extra char slots extra ah slots cosmetics and so on behind paywalls you start with char slots by default i think game is a mixture between scifi wow and style combat quite well executed pretty good quests nice zones nice art style it feels kinda like wow i figure an mmo is going to introduce her to a lot of aspects of pc gaming but wildstar is designed to ease players into that kind of stuff you start off with a small quite linear tutorial zone then go out to a bigger less linear tutorial zone and you are slowly introduced to grouping with multiple people trading professions all that stuff it should introduce her to many aspects of gaming without overwhelming her especially if you play together so you can show her whats what
gaming,not_removed,maplestory would be an great mmorpg for you to play if you dont mind it being
gaming,not_removed,i dont know alot of games that are easy to run off the top of my head hearthstonefree portal minecraft maybe try playing story games together on one pc like life is strange i love doing that with my friends also i guess take advantage of steam sales humble bundle and other things maybe a moba like heroes of the storm cause i heard its fairly good casual gameidk i play league of legends as a moba
gaming,not_removed,league isnt too hard to run either
gaming,not_removed,minecraft is not free
gaming,not_removed,yeah the only games on there are hearthstone heroes of the storm and the first ep or life is strange i was just suggesting good games to play together pick up for cheap on a steam sale
gaming,not_removed,looked so hard for send buses was pleased
gaming,not_removed,consider me jealous all i have is a stupid gta map and a cod ghosts poster
gaming,not_removed,you can come decorate my bedroom nursery anytime you want gah gah goo
gaming,not_removed,congratulations i hope that when your son is older that the two of you share a lot of adventures
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,your son wont understand why mario is so blocky since he will be raised in a world where monitors would be the low end spectrum for resolution
gaming,not_removed,damn that frame with advent children pictures is dope
gaming,not_removed,that collage is fucking epic
gaming,not_removed,friends of mine decorated their nursery with drawings of trees and stuff on the wall once the kid could talk he told them that he always was afraid of them and that was one of the reasons why he cried so much
gaming,not_removed,please decorate my room as well aeris
gaming,not_removed,lets be honest op this sanctuary of heros is you nursery isnt it
gaming,not_removed,watch him turn out to be one of those people who hates video games and spends all his time playing outside
gaming,not_removed,please set global aa to
gaming,not_removed,thats right have him pick a waifu at an early age
gaming,not_removed,did your son take over your gaming room when it was born nice though love it
gaming,not_removed,ghosts poster is this real life
gaming,not_removed,everyone needs one of these even if you dont play skyrim its a damn good map
gaming,not_removed,i would agree if any of the things being ingrained in the little bastards were bad all those showed were worthwhile experiences that i would love to pass onto the next generations
gaming,not_removed,the mrs and i agreed to raise him through the gaming generations like we went through weve got an emulator set up with mario and duck hunt ready for him to play when he is older
gaming,not_removed,my wife picked the painting actually
gaming,not_removed,eh i found it a few days ago behind my wardrobe and put it up i liked ghosts unlike most people it seems
gaming,not_removed,i love you man youre gonna be a great dad
gaming,not_removed,what a shock when he expects gigant leaps in graphics every month and reaches current graphics and suddenly the improvements are slooooow
gaming,not_removed,im sure vr will be a bugger player then so maybe it wont be too jarring
gaming,not_removed,pirates are bad mkay steam search free to play
gaming,not_removed,fallout new vegas ive heard of people who use this thing called a torrent im sure you can get all the map packs along with it im saying this from not being experienced with it im also sure theres hundreds of other games on there
gaming,not_removed,any civilisation game
gaming,not_removed,i will surely check it out
gaming,not_removed,well technically i can get infinitely closer
gaming,not_removed,yes you can its possible to have a game
gaming,not_removed,the scores were close because we were smashing random particles together for forty fucking minutes of course theyre going to average out with a sample that size
gaming,not_removed,i would be raging so hard
gaming,not_removed,happened to me twice in one session i was the though
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,is that all we get your one line you should play this no explanation about what the game is link to videos or pictures or the games website no critical review of the gameplay you sound more like a shill
gaming,not_removed,which type of game is this i never listen about this
gaming,not_removed,its kinda hard to explain but its also a google search away in case you have t heard of the internet
gaming,not_removed,you and every other fucking person thats ever played this
gaming,not_removed,do they still update the news flashes it seemed like the game has no changes for awhile and i stopped playing kind of debating redownloading
gaming,not_removed,confirmed
gaming,not_removed,i havent played in a while but they do eastereggs like that non stop throughout
gaming,not_removed,plague is a good game but i havent tried plauge
gaming,not_removed,another one just said miami police establish hotline to find killer
gaming,not_removed,lol i got to billion infected and they just discovered it
gaming,not_removed,mrreow bats at air
gaming,not_removed,i think they do it also said pewdeism is growing faster than religion
gaming,not_removed,same here its one of those games that i might drop buy probably always go check up on again
gaming,not_removed,spot the sore half life fan
gaming,not_removed,well i do still trying to complete the scenes
gaming,not_removed,i bring it outside my home too bad the city i live in doesnt have many players so its often a disappointment to me
gaming,not_removed,its still a thing i go to streetpass meet ups on a semiregular basis and its a lot of fun its just sort of social gaming
gaming,not_removed,i still carry mine around and still get plenty of street passes there havent been any new puzzle images in a while though so i dont check it very often
gaming,not_removed,i do but i keep forgetting to bring it out so i only streetpass with my brother who never gets puzzle pieces
gaming,not_removed,but its been a while since the last time ive even used my i used to avidly try collecting all the puzzle swaps but it got too overwhelming after a couple years so i gave up on that as well honestly the only reason id use it is for robobot but even then its not super useful
gaming,not_removed,at cons yeah but normally i dont think so
gaming,not_removed,if i go on the bus or flights always get a few hits on mine
gaming,not_removed,rename it to icy hot
gaming,not_removed,bengay burns so good
gaming,not_removed,i believe dof is very complex to render ie a cpugpu hog well get there eventually
gaming,not_removed,seems like someone is complaining that they have too good of graphics and this ruins their immersion did you try not rendering your dof so far or applying anor script or ef file that softens the temps so you arent so bothered by it change your prefs or custom make something if this is truly your calling to the flame war
gaming,not_removed,why do people always prefer input lag
gaming,not_removed,large tvs have a lot of input lag if you care about quality you are better off with a monitor
gaming,not_removed,is that available in the uk
gaming,not_removed,what do you mean
gaming,not_removed,lol you can stay with your puny i have a vizio hdr set looks fine runs fine
gaming,not_removed,do have high input lag i thought it just depended on the specific model and its response time
gaming,not_removed,happy days unfortunately thats more than i can afford and i dont think you can get vizio tvs in uk which is a shame as they look decent
gaming,not_removed,typically any tv has a higher input lag once it reaches above im used to a and monitor so when i play on bigger tvs i really notice it
gaming,not_removed,amazon or dell
gaming,not_removed,size has nothing to do with input lag its caused by extraneous processing done to the signal before it even gets to the lcd panel computer monitors typically have no processing at all done to the signal so if thats what youre comparing to a large tv yes there will be a difference but there are tvs out there with sub input lag which is very low
gaming,not_removed,didnt they say that when they released back compat
gaming,not_removed,pretty sure that was an announced as part of the backwards compatibility
gaming,not_removed,you still play the
gaming,not_removed,thats been known you discovered it yourself is all
gaming,not_removed,thats retro nice job op
gaming,not_removed,probably but i just discovered it
gaming,not_removed,i was playing with a friend
gaming,not_removed,i was just informing people who did not know because i didnt know
gaming,not_removed,as much as i hate him that is a really fucking good cover
gaming,not_removed,if you hate him that makes him a great villain
gaming,not_removed,kinda i hate him for the same reason i hate roman reigns theyre just boring
gaming,not_removed,watch him on ufc hes not boring there
gaming,not_removed,true then its just the sport which is boring to me not the athletes
gaming,not_removed,one of my summer homework requires me to comment on a poem and draw an image of it so i did im actually not sure whether i should be posting this here please tell me where i should put it if i did it wrong no offense to weegee or sanic
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,elder scrolls fallout mass effect
gaming,not_removed,if you like shadow of mordor dying light and sleeping dogs were both highquality games with hours of content i think i have more hours on dying light than mordor and i havent even finished the story yet both of them arent as deep on lore as the games you listed but interesting enough on the other hand if you like exploring large worlds and figuring out deep lore with a meaning behind everything dark souls is wonderful
gaming,not_removed,deus ex
gaming,not_removed,soulsborne series but bloodborne is exclusive
gaming,not_removed,the arkham series is one of my favorites but not really medieval warcraft and frozen throne have an awesome story not really the type of genre you mentioned but there really hasnt been a game like it since
gaming,not_removed,cyberassault its free at cyberassaultorg
gaming,not_removed,mechwarrior series even though there are giant fighting battlemechs with missiles and lasers there is a fair bait of medieval flair in the form of political upheaval faction backstabbing and the samuraiesque warring clans lore is great gameplay holds up very well and you can find them for freecheap easily use mechvm for mechwarrior series dg voodoo for mechwarrior
gaming,not_removed,call of duty black ops zombies and im not kidding if you just look up black ops zombies storyline there are hour long videos just explaining the storyline
gaming,not_removed,im looking for something with more of a medieval feel to it preferably something without guns i tried playing fallout but it just didnt click with me
gaming,not_removed,unfortunately ive already played through those games both of them were amazing and super fun to play but i doubt i could get back into either of them
gaming,not_removed,ive played human revolution and found it very enjoyable just waiting on getting more money from work before getting mankind divided
gaming,not_removed,i completely forgot about warcraft ill reinstall warcraft today also i would have played wow but the subscription is too much for me
gaming,not_removed,not really interested in cod sorry
gaming,not_removed,dark souls
gaming,not_removed,not sure if you bothered to google the games but elder scrolls is medieval
gaming,not_removed,elder scrolls bruh
gaming,not_removed,no the first deus ex it has the gep gun takedown
gaming,not_removed,i wouldnt asociate cod zombies with cod its completely different in every way
gaming,not_removed,not really a game i can play solely for lore and backstory
gaming,not_removed,i dont need google to work that out since ive said ive already played those games i was mainly referring to fallout and mass effect
gaming,not_removed,not really a game i can play solely for lore and backstory dont really understand ur comment i just started to play it and its proven to be one of the most lore rich and atmospheric games i have ever played and a bonus its very very rewarding once you get the hang of the controls just costs about euros
gaming,not_removed,i do know how much story there is inside the souls games ive played all three of them i just get very angry at the game and i cant stand the grind just to get information i play dark souls for the gameplay if that makes sense
gaming,not_removed,have you tried uninstalling the game then re downloading it
gaming,not_removed,i had the same issue earlier i force restarted it and it works fine now not sure if its a permanent fix though
gaming,not_removed,i see your problem youre playing a shooter on xbox
gaming,not_removed,im on xbox
gaming,not_removed,no i just got it installed
gaming,not_removed,then remove and reinstall make sure its up to date in patches

gaming,not_removed,anybody thinking about replying to this post should probably read the ops post and the response to that post from another redditor the relevant part from that response is you said about money stuff i send you and how i felt that you were only in for that i cannot help you in this money regard further you know that and perhaps this is the catalyst that we need build our relationship purely on our feelings and then think what we require further in other words it looks like piorune was sending money to the op and as far as im concerned reddits sitewide administrators not just subreddit admins should consider this a problem worth addressing especially if its to become a trend
gaming,not_removed,yeeehaw thats a bigass catfish we got here
gaming,not_removed,this is not my reddit account sounds fishy why not just make your own account it literally takes seconds
gaming,not_removed,get ready for people to send some creepy pms
gaming,not_removed,wow all of her previous posts are the same
gaming,not_removed,im so confused theres no local gamers over there
gaming,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvrerlefseda
gaming,not_removed,application of what you like that should be interesting i would fill out an application myself but you said that you are short and with black hair i know thats a rare combination for a chinese girl but i still prefer my chinese girls to be tall and blonde if you ever find one let me know
gaming,not_removed,i really dont know whats up there can u please ask piorune or something i dont want to give false information i just know that theyre a couple they were and still are
gaming,not_removed,what have i done wrong here now
gaming,not_removed,well i have an own reddit account but i posted on and the account needed to excist for days and i thought that would be the case here too no im new to reddit sorry
gaming,not_removed,i only got one pm c and that was a normal one
gaming,not_removed,lmfao im sure she has good intentions and all but man is she going to get some creepy stuff
gaming,not_removed,you dont say i didnt find anyone yet atleast i dont think so
gaming,not_removed,yes i know its usual but i just wanted to describe myself
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,not at all o i have good intentions but i get no replies sadly
gaming,not_removed,yes
gaming,not_removed,maybe thats a good thing with all the weirdos out there
gaming,not_removed,maybe
gaming,not_removed,somehow we went three games with prominent asari characters and not once did something as cringe worthy as this happen
gaming,not_removed,pplease buy our games sjw crowdwere losing so many people that we have to pander to the lowest common denominator
gaming,not_removed,oh my lord i cant truly comment on it cause i dont want my ass chewed
gaming,not_removed,this is the part where i remind everyone not to speed that asari do not have masculine pronouns in their language which has been stated in previous games
gaming,not_removed,aaa gamedev is infested with hardcore leftists so im really not surprised i dont think the industry will ever recover
gaming,not_removed,not to speed
gaming,not_removed,to be honest after finale it went downhill
gaming,not_removed,it means they dont have the necessary context to understand the post
gaming,not_removed,gotcha thanks
gaming,not_removed,except when i usually do that it blows up as the whole enemy team run around it on their way to the objective riddling me with bulletsplasma as they pass carefree
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,what how is that relevant to the post
gaming,not_removed,my app mustve glitched because im confused as well
gaming,not_removed,now i want to know what it said
gaming,not_removed,woah what is this game
gaming,not_removed,delicious fps mmmmmm
gaming,not_removed,i just hated the gameplay i couldnt put up with sprinting or tip toeing cant a man just walk
gaming,not_removed,love that game
gaming,not_removed,ive seen shit tons of these guys nothing new
gaming,not_removed,havent seen a sesame street game released in a while
gaming,not_removed,because youre not looking for them
gaming,not_removed,hold on will send you it soon original link would work after a bit edit well best just google list of games rated ec you can use the gamester one which for me i had to remove the nintendo ds flag either that or use the esrborg and search ec games and pick the console you want
gaming,not_removed,as someone living in canada digital media is something i have heavily taken for granted but this whole situation has really opened my eyes to how easy it would be for a company just to take access away long after they have taken your money its really worrisome for the future thank you op for bringing this attention to everyone on reddit when i read your original post i was definitely concerned i hope it gets sorted for you soon
gaming,not_removed,i actually submitted this to rgames first but it was deleted because it was offtopic or low effort huh edit the mod misclicked and said it didnt deserve its own thread because there was already another talking about this to each their own
gaming,not_removed,welcome to the freedom us based business enjoys
gaming,not_removed,this is exactly why we should avoid buying drm games and press for release off an offline version its not happening for the first time and it wont be the last time that a publisher decides to turnoff auth servers or block out entire countries
gaming,not_removed,its definitely a slippery slope im amazed and also not that ea can act so brazenly thanks for the money chumps did you read the eula haha doesnt matter if you did well do what we want
gaming,not_removed,what really bothers me about this situation is that this is a serious wake up call that digital distributors need to change its one thing to rent a service such as netflix and then youre not able to access it so you may be out usd these programs such as steam or origins should only be used to purchase games and to download them but should never require you to be connected this should be included in the psn and xblive as well ive personally delt with internet issues before that had nothing to do with them and wasnt able to play my games that have costed me thousands of dollars this is exactly why everyone was upset at the last console launch because online requirement to play your games single player or not has almost become mandatory or at least its looking like its going that way what if steam shut down out of nowhere were talking billions of dollars worth of already purchased merchandise completely lost some of use have hundreds of games that we couldnt possibly download or even back up on hard drives before the service went down of course these are hypotheticals but it worrys me that something ive invested in so heavily could just be taken away one day
gaming,not_removed,living outside of the us i now have yet another worry to add when looking into buying new games best of luck op hope everything ends up working out for you and your friends
gaming,not_removed,i already try to purchase as many games from gog as i can love their no drm policy regarding the games that arent released on gog is there an alternative platform i can purchase them at even the boxed copies i purchase require a steam account to activate the games in my country i am assuming this is the case in most countries
gaming,not_removed,this entire story needs to be spread everywhere from media outlets to local papers cant let ea and other drm services get away with doing something like this to their customers
gaming,not_removed,i dont understand while buying a game you do the payment to a swiss company ea swiss sarl but your services are provided by an american company why not solve this problem by simply providing the service by the swiss company
gaming,not_removed,this is why we should move towards protective rights for digital property its absurd that companies can just play takebacksies with digital products that we paid for without even having to perform any kind of compensation in the ever increasing digital future this is important to secure as early as possible
gaming,not_removed,with how much i rely on steam nowadays compared to earlier days its a scary thought that id put this much trust into one company as long as the government says you can have our products youll have our products is what i take from this
gaming,not_removed,im glad something happened did you take my advise and contact some media like pcgamer or did they by themself find this your story
gaming,not_removed,mingarlabar greetings from california my wife and i are from the us but we had a second marraige in myanmar in before it opened up the most wonderful people there hope we can visit again soon
gaming,not_removed,i would go and boycot ea but alas i already have for the past years and will just continue to do so shame they bought the rights to cc there couldve been great games made after tiberian sun
gaming,not_removed,i sure hope edward snowden isnt on that list not that ive paid for any of the games in my origin library thanks on the house but im currently playing through jade empire
gaming,not_removed,yo ho ho ho the pirate life for me its ok ea your games cost only dollars here any way
gaming,not_removed,hm youre right because even if it wasnt regulation or sanctions it could just be the costbenefit of keeping support for a country open it doesnt seem like there is much stopping them besides public support right
gaming,not_removed,i own over titles and dlc content packs on psn could all be gone in the blink of an eye and ive known this to be a reality the entire time
gaming,not_removed,didnt buy and didnt renew my ea access happy with the blizzard games and games with gold instead thanks op
gaming,not_removed,haha i think the dose of reality is merely that youre consuming services based in the us so they follow us laws dont stay in countries that run afoul of the us or buy games with drm
gaming,not_removed,the people around here amaze me as if some executive is sitting behind a ban button and laughing take off your tinfoil hats and stop acting like buying a game really only being buying a license to that game that has always been the case read the labels on your nes games you are purchasing a license this has nothing to do with drm this place is nothing but a circlejerk of disgusting piracy defenders
gaming,not_removed,i have to admit i was one of the apologists that never thought that they would actually do so and dismissed those who said that they would as tinfoil hat conspiracy theorists rstallmanwasright this is why i dont do my everyday computing on a machine running windows or mac os or even ubuntu my thinkpad libreboot may be slow as hell but ill not cry at the end when some company decides that today i shouldnt use my laptop
gaming,not_removed,this is why i pirate games cant lose anything if i dont pay for anything
gaming,not_removed,thank you for being the first responder its crazy how quickly what we think we own is no longer ours
gaming,not_removed,this whole thing brought up an idea if we assume that software is licensed and that we dont really own it games or otherwise then shouldnt the terms of access including the period of available access be part of the agreement if you lease a building its for x years with options to renew if you lease a video game its until we decide to turn it off thats not a legally allowable contract term its about time we changed that
gaming,not_removed,thats the bloated rgames mods for you unsubbed ages ago
gaming,not_removed,i feel the freedom bursting out of me
gaming,not_removed,ive flat out stopped buying games of this type call me suspicious but i expected that things like this would happen sooner or later since most eulas give the buyer no rights except to loose thier money without recourse
gaming,not_removed,humble bundle most often has a drm free download link besides a steam key
gaming,not_removed,well the reason you deal with an american company even though payments go to ea swiss sarl is because ea swiss sarl is just a branch from the usa hq since ea was founded in america it wouldnt matter where your payments go if hq gives an order they all have to follow it
gaming,not_removed,the much scarier thing is that its not as long as the government says you can have our products youll have our products its hmm we have a chance that we might break the law and have to pay a fine and that fine is more than what we are making in that country so lets just block access to that whole country it was a business decision nobody was going to go to jail
gaming,not_removed,they contacted me people reeeallly dont like drm
gaming,not_removed,if a game is by ea its a deal breaker for me i havent bought an e a game like sims theyre such a bad company
gaming,not_removed,bingo
gaming,not_removed,theres no trade embargo it was just sanctions against individuals and organizations on the sdn list in myanmar likely rather than accidentally trading with someone on that list and incurring the penalty they made the business decision to terminate access to the whole country the fact is the tos that you agreed to allows them to take away your games without a refund they can certainly just do it to you although you trust that they wont but now theyve shown that theyre willing to do it if it makes financial sense to them to do so fair enough if they want to not trade to limit liability but dont take away access after the fact
gaming,not_removed,holy victimblaming batman
gaming,not_removed,they werent following us laws us companies have been able to do business in myanmar since it was a purely business decision to limit liability
gaming,not_removed,this has everything to do with drm i cant access my games that i paid for because of drm i even have some of them on my computer but they cant call home to origin so i cant play them its a drm problem i also wanted to start a conversation about licensing and the terms of service that we agree to licensing isnt the problem in and of itself having licensing be revocable at the arbitrary will of the content provider is i havent pirated a game since steam came out and will never defend it
gaming,not_removed,worse theyre not laughing its likely a ticket that was sent to the tech dept many years ago because an exec misunderstood the explanation a lazy lawyer gave for what the embargo was on languished and somebody only now got around to doing it and it was deployed without checking whether it actually was still necessary this isnt about laughing this is about people being apathetic and incompetent
gaming,not_removed,then you are part of the problem
gaming,not_removed,the question is how do we change that so many companies are set in their ways and have realized how easy it is to get away with certain practices it seems almost impossible to combat it take preordering for example big companies or even indie devs have become so complacent with pre ordering and selling games when theyre indev or selling them as early access that theyre realizing they can make their profits without having to finish the game and they get away with it then there are extreme cases where some games dont even work but theyve gotten their money from pre ordering that they just dont care one of the arkham games for pc comes to mind as an example a very recent example is the dark souls dlc before the base game of dark souls was released they were selling not just the base game months in advance but they were selling the dlcs as well in the form of a seasons pass and ontop of that they were selling a deluxe edition that was a package deal of the base game and the dlcs now when the first dlc came out last week it became suddenly obvious no one who had purchased the deluxe edition were able to access the dlc then it became increasingly clear that the deluxe edition didnt actually come with the dlcs it was in name only if you bought the seasons pass or the dlc seperately you had it but the deluxe edition didnt now this was fixed in a couple hours by fromsoft adding ashes of ariandel to the deluxe edition package soon anyone who had bought it found it showing up in their library but this brought up a huge red flag to me how easy it is now for developers to sell a concept to people in the form of words and the faith that one day we are actually going to recieve it
gaming,not_removed,reading is hard huh licensing games has nothing to do with drm games movies etc have always been licensed you are not and have never bought and owned an actual game that has nothing to do with drm you did not have your access arbitrarily revoked it has to do with federal laws nobody at ea banned you for the fun of it
gaming,not_removed,thats as may be but im also the one with free games
gaming,not_removed,ayy
gaming,not_removed,good question i think hello games is going to be our first point of action we as gamers need to see them sued we need to see precedent set that pump and dumb without actually providing the game they promised is illegal and will be enforced we already got the first step by having massive refunds of the game on steam as to the rest of this i think it might be a little late once the gaming population accepted steam as a sales platform history was written and our path set digital distribution has never been tested in court the way physical distribution has and since you and i arent lobbying to push more restrictions and laws guess who is lobbying and which way they are trying to go do you know why any game that has in game purchases has its own currency you have to convert to first because that makes the digital items sold fictional in a legal sense if i paid cash for that gunoutfitwhatever then i would have legal standing if it were taken away not delivered or not as advertised but if you convert your dollar into a gold coin and use the gold coin to buy the gunoutfitwhatever then you have no legal grounds because you converted a dollar into a gold coin and you got what you paid for the rest isnt a legal transaction as far as us courts are concerned and so normal consumer protections do not apply there are only two options then we push a country wide legal reform demanding digital rights be equivalent to physical rights of first purchase we sue and set precedent that is already true i mean arguably we could just stop buying things with drm online verification or that are solely digital distribution without any sort of garuntee of the time frame of availability but thats not going to happen because the majority of rgaming would rather buy and play the mainstream games than have any sort of principles about it i want too but im not willing to give ea money or use origin so unless ea is willing to forgo origin and sell me a disc and a dedicated server package they wont ever see a dime from me ubi is even worse because uplay doesnt like my computer so i cant even try it out im not a huge fan of steam either but at least ive never had any particular problems on that platform and while i realize its dumb to trust valve over ea or ubi when it comes to digital distribution and who owns what its at least less likely to bite you for now
gaming,not_removed,there was and is no federal law requiring them to do anything remotely like this its not the licensing that is preventing me from playing here it is the drm that is calling home licensing has nothing to do with the drm also my licenses were not revoked the drm just makes the games inaccessible here im sorry you think that reading is hard but please keep trying
gaming,not_removed,you claimed in your original post that games with drm do not belong to you no games belong to you they are all only licensed drm has nothing to do with that and youre a really special kind of person if you think a company would block access to a country arbitrarily this has everything to do with federal law and bureaucracy this thread isnt even really about that though its about shit posting ea and drm and promoting piracy whether you wanted it to be that or not
gaming,not_removed,im not saying they blocked it arbitrarily im saying that they have the arbitrary ability to block it theres a difference arbitrary is a legal word with a legal definition the ability to do something at their sole discretion without recourse thats where arbitration comes from the arbiter decides what to do in this case the arbiter is the content provider i dont even know why im arguing with you over semantics no shit the games dont belong to you theyre all licensed im not arguing with that but games with drm can be taken away youre completely missing the point over semantics they blocked the country because after they sold a bunch of games here they thought oh shit we might accidentally sell to someone on the banned list and then wed have to pay a penalty better terminate everyones ability to purchase and access games thats it period and its a shitty thing to do sure it has to do with federal law and bureaucracy but only insofar as to impose liability if they sell to the wrong person or organization they made a business decision to stop selling to and retroactively deny access to an entire country so they had no chance of running afoul of it they could have continued providing access without anyone losing access and been just fine but they decided to limit their liability by removing our access it was a business decision and also being against drm that strips your ability to play after youve paid for it is not the same thing as promoting piracy and by equating my argument with promoting piracy youve made a shitgrade strawman
gaming,not_removed,now that youre finally doubling back on nearly everything you said and conceding my points i guess i succeeded
gaming,not_removed,youre completely delusional i award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul
gaming,not_removed,i never call these out but literally reposting to the same sub barely a hour later and both sitting with just one post in between what the heck dude
gaming,not_removed,man look at the graphical improvement between ocarina of time and majoras mask never noticed that before
gaming,not_removed,sadly many are left out
gaming,not_removed,where does this come from an art book
gaming,not_removed,interesting to note link has always been left handed until recently suddenly hes righty perhaps this new link is false
gaming,not_removed,so fuck skyward sword right
gaming,not_removed,yeah is this guy hecking serious
gaming,not_removed,my bad i scanned the first two pages and didnt see anything
gaming,not_removed,we got all the major systems like snes and cdi though
gaming,not_removed,what was left out
gaming,not_removed,the only one id care to add is links awakening which was excellent
gaming,not_removed,since twilight princess link was lefthanded on gamecube and righthanded on wii does that mean those are actually two different alternate timelines and if so what event caused the split
gaming,not_removed,its there
gaming,not_removed,you make this add them all the world would be in your debt
gaming,not_removed,the minish cap
gaming,not_removed,there are about to main series zelda games this showed like even with some links being the same link theyre missing lot
gaming,not_removed,skyward sword for one
gaming,not_removed,its there
gaming,not_removed,its an interesting and funny thought unfortunately its not that interesting and nintendo just decided he isnt left handed anymore because they happen to make a move controller and more people are righty not sure why im downvoted just for observing a fact about a change in his character
gaming,not_removed,ha no i didnt make it though i think the maker is trolling nintendo if she included the cdi and not every single other game in the series
gaming,not_removed,its there under the wind waker the gba sprite is minish cap
gaming,not_removed,if you read all the also worn in subtitles there are games listed
gaming,not_removed,no it wasnt it was listed under twighlight princess
gaming,not_removed,yup under link to the past the game boy sprite links awakening dx and oracle of used the same colorized gbc sprite
gaming,not_removed,yup youre right
gaming,not_removed,but theyre missing the four swords
gaming,not_removed,guess im blind now i see it links awakening dx is top in my opinion
gaming,not_removed,four swords and minish cap used the same sprite
gaming,not_removed,heck yes what a delightful introduction to the world of gta for the younger generation
gaming,not_removed,httpwwwmetacriticcomgamepcstartopia or httpwwwmetacriticcomgamepcevilgenius
gaming,not_removed,road rash bring that shit back
gaming,not_removed,yes yes yes yes
gaming,not_removed,my vote the last of us oh wait d uh assassins creed black flag seriously the fact they they ditched the entire ship mechanic after rogue is a damn travesty they had a great thing going there they could have spun it off into its own thing
gaming,not_removed,bully was such a great game it sucks that scholarship edition for the pc is such a buggy mess the fucking was amazing
gaming,not_removed,dungeon keeper as long as its a full release and not a mobile game
gaming,not_removed,bully please if red dead got a third one at least give a sequel to bully
gaming,not_removed,halflife episode two
gaming,not_removed,this game was amazing
gaming,not_removed,mah boi i still have my original evil genius install because i refuse to get rid of it i fucking love that game
gaming,not_removed,did you ever play skitchin road rash on skates
gaming,not_removed,the thing is they did a good job ditching it that wasnt assassins creed that was pirates creed i love ac and rogue but im really glad they got back to cities also the assassin story of was bad but i mean really boring i dont want an assassin creed where the best is the side quests thats my opinion though
gaming,not_removed,i still play bully se a lot on steam i dont really get bugs tho it works perfectly fine ive beaten the game times already on when it was released and on pc lol
gaming,not_removed,hah we all would want it
gaming,not_removed,fair enough but they have such a good mechanic with the boat what they should do is spin it off into its own ip drop the assassins creed stuff and just make black flag its own series of pirate games
gaming,not_removed,yeah the boat mechanic the sea battles and the sea exploration was really well done i would love for them to make like a game where you control blackbeard i would buy that game ubisoft listen to us for gods sake
gaming,not_removed,yes it was a game ahead of its time if you were in a class learning about games this would be on the curriculum it is a must play
gaming,not_removed,just wait for
gaming,not_removed,i personally think it holds up pretty well it looks alright given that its so old but the story and game play really set it apart from a lot of other storied fps games
gaming,not_removed,play the black mesa mod for then play the rest
gaming,not_removed,play synergie mod and have fun in coop with your friends
gaming,not_removed,xd
gaming,not_removed,its good the loading screens make me chuckle
gaming,not_removed,yes it is definitely worth playing fun gameplay and a comprehensive story told entirely without cutscenes which is rare even today you should also pick up the first portal
gaming,not_removed,is a very well made game and definitely holds up for at least a single playthrough despite its age it feels good to play and the environments and enemies are fun to interact with mid there was a community mod released that improved particle effects and lighting as well improving the game visually the story is sufficient to build and an interesting in game world but probably wont blow you away
gaming,not_removed,i play it through once about every year still lots of fun
gaming,not_removed,definitely good games dont really stop being good
gaming,not_removed,everything about it holds up still its one of the few story fps games maybe the only one that i still fire up and play through again from time to time i wont go through it point by point as you can find about a million writeups on it online but theres a reason its considered one of the best games of all timeeven now and not only is it great but people are still making new mods for itsome complete overhauls that are as good as the game itself along with tons of other stuff along with the hundreds that were already made so if you buy it youd have access to all that as well and its only even at full price its one of the few games id consider a must play
gaming,not_removed,it has a good story and graphics arent that bad i cant replay it because it doesnt have iron sighs aiming mode and i find it far too weird without it
gaming,not_removed,i think the shooter elements dont hold up that well but its still pretty unique for the use of the gravity gun its been years and i cant think of any game that has a feature like that or at least not that well integrated so i would say yes get it as for the story i think its alright its not a masterpiece but its enough to keep you going
gaming,not_removed,i actually started the story again last night after a couple of days of thinking about it it is absolutely still worth playing a great experience choose a fitting diffeculty setting put on an headset really try to immerse yourself in the story take it slow and steady and just enjoy
gaming,not_removed,absolutely its a brilliant game that easily holds up today the story is complex and deep but the game does a fantastic job of telling the story i never played but i was quickly able to keep up with what was happening its split into three full games episode and episode play them in that order the combat is satisfying the puzzles are challenging but easy to understand the goal much like portal and i guarantee once you finish youll be among the gamers whining about half life
gaming,not_removed,no
gaming,not_removed,but seriously the graphics arent next gen but the game mechanic and how it plays out is amazing way ahead of its time
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,very blatant and right to the point thx for the honesty xd
gaming,not_removed,the graphics held up for a really long time they looked great a decade ago but that was a decade ago
gaming,not_removed,purrfect
gaming,not_removed,a lot of people like the series i hated it my recommendation but you might like it so who knows
gaming,not_removed,i still enjoy playing halo wars and star wars battlefront graphics dont make a game
gaming,not_removed,why did you hate it
gaming,not_removed,yeah does it not hold up to you genuinely curious never played it
gaming,not_removed,im assuming you didnt play it at the time
gaming,not_removed,hey you dont need to convince me i keep a crt tv specifically for my bit consoles
gaming,not_removed,i envy think thats the right word for this you and your bit consoles oldest i have atm is the first model playstation
gaming,not_removed,whos going through and down voting our comments i dont understand reddit sometimes xd
gaming,not_removed,xd
gaming,not_removed,if i understand what youre asking underrail might be like what youre looking for
gaming,not_removed,i think you mean isometric games have you tried planescape torment baldurs gate stasis when you say squadbased do you mean the likes of shadowrun returns dragonfall hong kong wasteland and commandos if not you can try them out too
gaming,not_removed,httpswwwgogcomgamearcanumofsteamworksandmagickobscura
gaming,not_removed,fallout and
gaming,not_removed,fallout and play nothing like fallout and
gaming,not_removed,to be fair they didnt say games that play similar to fallout and just similar to fallout and
gaming,not_removed,then again and are not similar to an in any other way than the setting
gaming,not_removed,uvolatilecurry is not the op of this thread
gaming,not_removed,they still didnt say play similar
gaming,not_removed,true that
gaming,not_removed,if you have a good pc i recommend doom witcher wild hunt or dark souls iii i have ark and it is poorly optimised
gaming,not_removed,rocket league if u have a controller
gaming,not_removed,star wars complete collection
gaming,not_removed,i just picked up planet explorers on sale and im having fun with it its a building type game but a little more laid back than ark and the others
gaming,not_removed,ark is really good i have like hrs in it now but you need a decent pc its graphics heavy probably the only alpha worth a shit
gaming,not_removed,got stuck on the first boss then i got stuck on the second boss and i quit
gaming,not_removed,on the le gem
gaming,not_removed,alma in this form wasnt all that hard the dragon in the catacombs was way more difficult
gaming,not_removed,i never thought alma was that bad i forgot what bosss came after but thought they were more difficult
gaming,not_removed,spoiler
gaming,not_removed,i think theres endings iirc shoot yourself credits conrad counts to five and you shoot yourself credits i did this one to ammend for killing the civilians shoot conrad your mind is now dead credits then epilogue epilogue shoot the evac soldiers gentlemen welcome to dubai epilogue surrender your weapon go home and be a family man threaten the evac soldiers and get smoked different ending cutscene i havent played it since launch so im hazy on the story but i believe a popular theory was that walker actually died in the helicopter crash or was horribly injured and the rest plays out as a coma dream or something you should check it out on youtube alot of people have really interesting takes on the story
gaming,not_removed,specops the line offers a bunch of choices that are not made obvious theres more than endings
gaming,not_removed,anything that starts with a fade to black is real anything that starts with a fade to white is hallucination
gaming,not_removed,yeah i played the epilogue as well but thats only available if you shoot konrad i also let him shoot me i felt the same way
gaming,not_removed,yeah i wasnt counting the epilogue since its only available if you shoot konrad was seeing if people preferred to let him shoot or let walker live
gaming,not_removed,considering its in its entry its safe to say it has a bigger following than you would think
gaming,not_removed,simulators are very popular in europe this particular game is fun when you just wanna sit back and have a beer
gaming,not_removed,dont hate on farming simulator its funner than it seems
gaming,not_removed,that is my go to relax game when i want to watch streams or videos but still like to fiddle with my keyboard i got stream on my secondary display and the game on primary i like it
gaming,not_removed,yup there a bunch of people out there that actually enjoy those simulator games
gaming,not_removed,its a very popular franchise with many people this iteration has sold the most copies from what ive read there are streamers who make a living off playing this game
gaming,not_removed,the bigger issue is your pipe in the picture come on man
gaming,not_removed,yup
gaming,not_removed,simulators are pretty popular now i remember when xboxahoy made a video about euro truck and i was hooked you literally just drive a truck around but theres a lot of satisfaction for some reason
gaming,not_removed,its one of those i dont play it but my girlfriend does games the previous iteration got surprisingly good reviews
gaming,not_removed,i would never buy it but i bet that game is fun as fuck haha
gaming,not_removed,im not into them but i hear simulators like this are incredibly relaxing for people who play them you should probably get super baked and give one of them a shot you might be surprised
gaming,not_removed,nice weed pipe bro
gaming,not_removed,i talked shit about this game back in the day but holy fuck is it addicting lolololol
gaming,not_removed,shit it was better farm pussy for that price
gaming,not_removed,i did and i regret it i got half way through the tutorial before realizing i made a big mistake
gaming,not_removed,i just thought that was the year lol
gaming,not_removed,its a medical apparatus
gaming,not_removed,thats a medical device thank you very much
gaming,not_removed,whats wrong with smoking some cannabis im assuming that is what you are using it for
gaming,not_removed,😂😂😂😂
gaming,not_removed,dont you hate when you buy a game play it for like minutes and come to the conclusioni made a big mistake fear i feel like they should have payed me for that game
gaming,not_removed,there is a refund policy for that
gaming,not_removed,pretty sure it is the year but they all started around
gaming,not_removed,and the black and milds right next to it
gaming,not_removed,everyone has that same bowl
gaming,not_removed,naw lol i dont no how it really works but it starts out clear and changes colors when you smoke it coolest bowl i have ever owned
gaming,not_removed,medical meth
gaming,not_removed,man whats wrong with fear
gaming,not_removed,yeah totally i buy way too many game on impulse when im bored
gaming,not_removed,pretty sure no they released installments in two years
gaming,not_removed,thats already a thing its called adderal
gaming,not_removed,that would be a feat
gaming,not_removed,holy crap
gaming,not_removed,yea its blue right now just got done smoking it when i took the picture lol sometime i like to have a chill game where i can listen to a podcast or music and just zone in and out of the gamebut that was a discount for a game about farming is where the line is crossed my friend there is a reason nobody farms anymoreit sucks
gaming,not_removed,enjoy man true gaming masterpiece
gaming,not_removed,welcome to a better place say hi to bonnie for me
gaming,not_removed,i recently did months in county jail i was one of inmates chosen to be a trustee which comes with extra privileges including a only game worth playing was red dead redemption and after taking my time playing it very meticulously my entire months it made me respect it as one of the greatest games ever
gaming,not_removed,cultivation of cannabis and degree bangin of your mother
gaming,not_removed,why were you in jail
gaming,not_removed,what is this again
gaming,not_removed,you dont want to cut yourself on that glass i wouldnt trust the first aid kit in a building like that
gaming,not_removed,you see its exactly because the knob is broken that the difficulty is so high if the knob wasnt broken it would be a piece of cake
gaming,not_removed,i discovered an easily accessible skeleton key in the original red dead redemption when you pick people up after dropping them partly into a door the game will phase you through the door the game testers dropped the ball on that one
gaming,not_removed,same in the witcher when you have a shitty wooden door locked i mean gerald youre a fucking mutant with swords that slays monsters cant you just destroy the door
gaming,not_removed,that glass is sharp man i wouldnt risk it
gaming,not_removed,i need a no clipping cheat i hate those artificial boundaries they bought in the game like a single overturned tree
gaming,not_removed,after working as a safety guy at a factory i trust no first aid at any building
gaming,not_removed,quick stimpak and youll be fine
gaming,not_removed,it would be nice to know some of the valuable information like how long a charge lasts how long does it take to charge up the thing and the price
gaming,not_removed,oh wow a printed shell for commercially available phone chargers and it has the added bonus of making you look like a tryhard hipster
gaming,not_removed,holy crap that picture is amazing where i can find it as a wallpaper
gaming,not_removed,prompto holy crap guys look at that noctis whoa impressive gladio huh gotta try that sometime ignis dangit prompto keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road
gaming,not_removed,to be fair the driving controls in are more responsive than in just cause
gaming,not_removed,go to their facebool page and download the image
gaming,not_removed,here you go
gaming,not_removed,ignis is driving
gaming,not_removed,planescape torment
gaming,not_removed,keep em coming guy im looking stuff up divinity os looks good
gaming,not_removed,wow thanks for fast replies guysgals but ive played all these im looking for maybe some older buried treasures if you got em thanks again
gaming,not_removed,divinity original sin
gaming,not_removed,have you played the super nintendo rpg library if not chrono trigger and final fantasy vi are must plays you can get them on the wii downloadable store i think as well as on ios and steam i think
gaming,not_removed,one more note if you really have missed out on a decade of games you really need to play through the halflife series you just have to
gaming,not_removed,my own latest addition has been httpsswordcoastcom it gives the option to gm and play sure it does get mixed reviews but i like it it has dd ed rules in use
gaming,not_removed,star wars knights of the old republic neverwinter nights pillars of eternity its actually game but if you havent played it you definitely should
gaming,not_removed,what the fuck man your life is exactly like mine we are the same age we bought a pc the same year we like the same games for a moment i feared i made the post
gaming,not_removed,try these loki two worlds dark messiah of might and magic sacred titan quest
gaming,not_removed,diablo path of exile fallout series bio shock borderlands unfortunately thats all i can think of without getting into games like world of warcraft runescape etc
gaming,not_removed,elder scrolls are a must for sure especially oblivion and skyrim skyrim pretty much goes on forever even now after years still holds up and fun as hell to play knights of the old republic i and ii are also great far cry series is also pretty good less rpg and more firstperson shooter but still a great story and definitely has some rpg elements far cry are my favorites
gaming,not_removed,its stellar play it and you will understand what a gem it is
gaming,not_removed,the baldurs gate series icewind dale i ii golden sun on gba jade empire dd forgotten realms demon stone i guess it just depends on what genres appeal to you i had the luck of being in middle school and highschool back then and had fun and frustration play games like diablo plus the lord of destruction expansion or playing the original command and conquer and red alert games or starcraft sorry this makes me nostalgic
gaming,not_removed,no never got into those but im talking like gothic type stuff just older solid rpg play
gaming,not_removed,lol i did actually play a few here and there and half life was one dont go to ravenholm is the shit i did the entire level with the gravity gun and like circular saw blade
gaming,not_removed,morrowind is awesome as well its a fucking amazing game if you can get past the meh graphics and the poor combat system then its a fucking wonderful game i played it after playing most of skyrimdont believe i had finished skyrim by that point and i enjoyed it a lot it has an amazing story and i kinda liked the combat personally once i got used to it after awhile i also found the graphics to not be really that bad i finished morrowindand the expacs after loving every second of it and finding it harder near the end because i was doing it like levels under what i was supposed to be d i then went on excited to play oblivion and i was sorely underwhelmed i just cant get into oblivion its a combination of the spreading the butter swordplay the awkward looking graphics the like voice actors that barely even made an effort to not sound the same as that other npc who they voiced and the main questline didnt grip me as much i was just thrust in i was immediately told you are important do this unlike morrowind where i thought i was just an ordinary dunmeryes i play dunmer who was lucky to get out of jail and go to vvardenfall and join the blades however it was slowly revealed it was more than that and i was some kind of chosen one who had to earn respect from a bunch of people then i could go kill the bad guytrying not to spoil incase op reads this and doesnt know the story d oblivion didnt have that slow introduction to why you were important you were just immediately told that you are skyrim is not to the level of morrowind in building up to why youre important but its not like oblivion where you immediately know you barely escape helgen travel to whiterun bringing news of a dragon help kill one find out youre dragonborn cool but why is this so important eventually you find out why youre super important i guess what im saying is i disliked oblivion not only for its shittier combat than morrowindimo lack of voice actingi wouldve much rather had the option to turn off the voice acting and just read the text and goofy graphics but also because it immediately lumped you in as being the one who would save us all you literally find that out at the end of the fucking tutorial its main quest wasnt as gripping as morrowinds or skyrims tldr i think oblivion is the worst game out of morrowind oblivion and skyrim with morrowind being the best because of its extremely gripping storyline and good pacinghow did they get that so wrong with oblivionimo
gaming,not_removed,great choices skyrims mods make it fun for replay i had it for xbox so didnt bother to get it on pc until a killer deal came up on steam with the mods the game looked way better and has more content
gaming,not_removed,someone ported morrowind into the skyrim engine
gaming,not_removed,yeah skywind not quite finished yet but really looking into playing it when it is my bf huge elder scrolls fan alerted me to this and ive been eagerly awaiting its completion unfortunately it looks like youd need to own morrowind and skyrim to play it i only own skyrim i played on my bfs copy of morrowind might pick up a copy of morrowind for myself if it goes on sale in the steam summer sale
gaming,not_removed,ok you need to stop being so black and white about the concept of teamwork the concept of teamwork isnt necessarily divided into groups of teamwork and not teamwork take for example there are houndreds of ways to play in other words there are houndreds of different opinions of how to play you cant just magically expect people to all come togheter and form the same opinion on what to do and how to play when theres so many different approaches to the game it just isnt really realistic even tho it happens on rare occasions some peoples opinions are just flat out wrong and stupid ill give you that but this is a big title in the series of the battlefield franchise theres tons of new players here who probably have never played a battlefield game in their life when i play operations and i see a team of men sitting around watching our flag getting captured and does nothing about it i can tell they arent really experienced in battlefield games or at the very least havent played enough to understand the concept of ptfoing you should never expect players to all be on the same page atleast not on a man game maybe if this was a man game but not on the large scale of battlefield oh and btw try to be more open minded just because someone has a different opinion or approach then you doesnt necessarily mean hes just wrong and bad maybe hes plan would have worked just as well if everyone was in on it
gaming,not_removed,play overwatch
gaming,not_removed,sometimes people just want to do what they find fun its not always competitive if i have more fun doing my thingredients im not gonna go after the objective im not one to care whether my team wins or loses of the time thats just one perspective now i never play ranked so i donthe see why people would get so upset
gaming,not_removed,as you said wins are most important to you but you must understand it might not be the case for everyone i usually play a solo warrior in because i dont really care whether we win or not of course its nice to win but i value my own little adventure on the battlefield more if i manage to sneak behind enemy lines and murder a bunch of them while valiantly perishing in a volley of explosions its cool instead of tryharding alone i could try and play as a team and support but a lack of intuitive coordination renders that boring to me if i solo i cant get angry at my teammates and i cant blame any loss on them as well i fully understand where you are going with this and in essence you are absolutely correct but unfortunately such is not the way of things in most shooters as someone pointed out below you might find salvation to your plight in the form of overwatch competitive there is simply work together or lose and in overwatch everyone wants to win obviously you run into people who will not cooperate but mostly everyone tries to fill a role that the team is missing otherwise you will probably lose
gaming,not_removed,i agree i keep telling the rest of the team to follow me but they never do so there i am out all by myself trying to save the match again while these other motherfuckers form groups to roam the map nillywilly
gaming,not_removed,by no means am i expecting players to spontaneously erupt into seal team six within the opening seconds of any match in any game just stick with the team and have each others backs even if something like input device or language barriers prevent direct communication until more details emerge on the fly about the players strengths weaknesses and what strategy will be bestsuited to actually winning its not that hard and simply sticking together in and of itself is a huge advantage but you indirectly bring up the heart of the issue in my opinion everyone has their own opinion about teamwork and planning and everyone sees themselves as the quarterback or team captain and wants everyone else to go with their planand if they dont they run off to do their own thing or ragequit instead of going with the consensus for the good of the team because they can always just find another match or blame their team for not listening to them no matter how good or bad their idea really was which is a more pragmatic reason for my playing support classes or roles when available if others dont go for my plan i can support them in theirs especially when it comes to plans that require everyone on it if a plan requires a group of people that dont know each other randomly matched with unknown knowledge and skill distributions to succeedits not a good plan for the environment in question more often than not simple and pragmatic wins the day over complex and flamboyant and the former is all i expect in that yes i will be black and white about it thank you very much i hate to sound in the least hostile or impervious to counterarguments but im taking an extremely broad view of teamwork in the first place here which i believe allows me reasonable prerogative to say that since bf came up its perfectly evocative of the issue at heart here its presentation may be unique to bf but bf is not the only game series with capture point mechanics when came out yeah your argument would hold water but most online games have capture point mechanics nowadays or mechanics which act similarly enough to capture point mechanics that players should be able to intuit whats going on within five minutes or so of having started to play even cod which below the surface cannot be further from bf has its domination game mode and anyone whos played cod can understand bf mechanics well enough to pick up objectivebased play in seconds even moba tower mechanics work similarly enough for players to be able to look at the map see the icons and think to themselves yes this is a very important place and i have to take and defend it single player even includes ludic tutorials in bf capture point mechanics for crying out loud theres zero excuse for groups of players to just stand around and do nothing about losing capture points unless of course is the first multiplayer game with teambased mechanics that someone has picked up in their entire lifeand given bfs status and reputation i doubt that is the case in the overwhelming majority of players
gaming,not_removed,he seems like the guy whod play hanzo on attack and complain that no one is healer
gaming,not_removed,i think your broad view of teamwork is the reason you feel so frustrated i think you should sit down and think more in detail and youll realise its much more complicated then what it looks like on the surface lets take your point about conquestdomination type games its a very simple mechanic that no one should really be confused by you take flagspoints and win by taking more flagspoints then your opponent your idea your approach your opinion on doing this is to have a group that works togheter that gets on the point and captures it a completely solid tactic and theres nothing wrong of thinking this way but if you think about it theres more ways to win or atleast outperform your opponents then just taking flags preventing your enemies from getting flags is also a solid tactic though granted you also need someone to actually take the flags aswell but i think its completely fine to take the role as a preventer if thats even a word and focus on killing the enemies trying to take flags im usually a person who does this for example im an aggresive scout player and im good at killing other players im good at using flares to give my teammates info about enemy whereabouts i dont mind taking flags and i often do but i feel way more usefull staying at mid range just killing incomming enemies with my sniper rifle i dont think my english skills alows me to go more into detail but i hope my point is coming across as understandable even though the end goal is the same for all players and a very simple concept there are usually more then or ways of getting there and that is usually the reason why people will choose to do different things in games
gaming,not_removed,actually nine times out of ten when im playing games with a healingbuffing mechanic im playing the healerbuffer and if im complaining during a match itll be because someone at lowhealth yoloed instead of wait the few seconds it would take me to heal them doesnt support me in turn by keeping opponents off me then usually complains they have to heals because im already dead or does something rockstupid like cause me to waste ubercharge by taking cover or not hitting highpriority targets first and usually complain because im using my ubers on more useful teammates or when someone wont stop standing in the goddamned fire
gaming,not_removed,im confused first i have too narrow blackandwhite view of teamwork and now my view of teamwork is too broad look i dont care if someone forms a squad of four scouts and a support for ammo in bf as long as theyre spotting sniping highvalue targets suppressing and generally being an effective nuisance and attritiongenerator that i can understand especially since it can and does help other players draw opponents attention away from critical areas and contribute to wins just as long as theyre meaningfully contributing
gaming,not_removed,what can ya do you cant expect intelligence from the masses
gaming,not_removed,i just got it about ago its fun in a game dev story kinda way
gaming,not_removed,is it fun
gaming,not_removed,i havent found an rts game yet thats come close to the first company of heroes anyone want to play some blitzkrieg mod
gaming,not_removed,if you like french countryside destruction porn i would recommend you look into men of war assault squad you think a coh goliath is badass just you wait and see
gaming,not_removed,honestly doesnt even compare to the battles in wargame red dragon that game leaves the entire map scarred and littered with downed vehicles even planes and helicopters
gaming,not_removed,ive seen king tigers flung by that thing it is amazing
gaming,not_removed,yes
gaming,not_removed,i didnt bow didnt think twice about about it
gaming,not_removed,what happens if you do not bow
gaming,not_removed,his valet that snob who teaches you how to bow properly gets really upset and says he will be punished
gaming,not_removed,going to go for a super mario type game or what are you wanting to do with the game
gaming,not_removed,my gaming drink is beer andor scotch does that make me a bad gamer or a good drinker
gaming,not_removed,do you mind me asking for the recipe
gaming,not_removed,dude that looks like my exgirlfriends bath soap
gaming,not_removed,just looks like you mixed either hypnotiq or viniq
gaming,not_removed,that wineglass isnt going to be enough magikamana im a thirsty mage
gaming,not_removed,im going with good drinker on this one
gaming,not_removed,i bit of magic toad eyes and a cup of semen
gaming,not_removed,this
gaming,not_removed,crack open your nearest lava lamp sprinkle a dash of cinnamon and voila your guests are dead
gaming,not_removed,viniq some hard clear alcohol vodka worked best because viniq already has some in it and mixers yeah i experimented for a bit to find something proper blue that worked
gaming,not_removed,viniq is it weird when i say that this booze looks beautiful
gaming,not_removed,no offense but its not lke anyone made an ak how to use video ever
gaming,not_removed,i was taken away with rising storm no doubt this will be a hit as well but dont expect the hype to be anywhere close to battlefield and other aaa titles too little community i think
gaming,not_removed,i just wish they could bring out or more regionsmaps the back and forth idea of voting on the next attackdefend is perfect but im so tired of bridges of druhznia
gaming,not_removed,pcpartpicker
gaming,not_removed,thread title
gaming,not_removed,first off what is your budget if its under then we cant help you
gaming,not_removed,go to rbuildapc they can help a lot
gaming,not_removed,woah sweet meme bro you seem like a cool guy who is a pro overwatch player
gaming,not_removed,battlefield civ and south park fractured but whole
gaming,not_removed,well im excited for the new final fantasy remake but thats not for a few years i hope they dont fuck it up that game has a special place in my heart
gaming,not_removed,didnt know civ was coming thats gunna be tits my answer is probably forza horizon mafia and battlefield
gaming,not_removed,im looking forward to being extremely disappointed by civilization
gaming,not_removed,the new deus ex ofcourse civ would be a close second ill wait with till i know how much of a bugfest its gonna be
gaming,not_removed,ace attorney pokemon moon civ battlefield mass effect andromeda and probably some others im forgetting
gaming,not_removed,i dont even have a but im excited for days gone
gaming,not_removed,monster hunter generation days left for us release
gaming,not_removed,looking to be disappointed with the new bullshit metroid prime game
gaming,not_removed,dishonored and deus ex mankind divided
gaming,not_removed,days gone final fantasy xv
gaming,not_removed,i really hope the new deus ex is good and although i doubt it will see a release that system shock remake they have a kickstarter for would be amazing
gaming,not_removed,no one has mentioned no mans sky after all those delays it better be good also crash bandicoot and the bioshock collection i am so ready to relive those games
gaming,not_removed,top final fantasy xv extremely excited battlefield call of duty modern warfare
gaming,not_removed,that pun though
gaming,not_removed,i have hopes for it people bash the art style however i think it looks really nice everything ive seen from the demos and gameplay videos has me hyped for it
gaming,not_removed,honestly i dont care about the art either way its the depth of the game mechanics that im concerned with and so far even with the new additions it appears somewhat lacking i need to see some unregulated gameplay here to make an accurate judgment
gaming,not_removed,thats rough im sorry about your loss i wish i had a good answer for you
gaming,not_removed,i dont know the answer to your question but damn im sorry for your loss brother
gaming,not_removed,im not on this but you may be able to try and gain access to his account and trade it back to yourself also sorry about your loss
gaming,not_removed,i sent a steam gift to a friends email address but that person already owns this game can i give this gift to someone else yes provided your friend has not already redeemed your gift using a different steam account to give your gift to a different friend install steam if you havent already done so after logging into your account click on the games menu and select manage gifts and guest passes from your steam inventory locate the gift that has not been redeemed and click on resend gift also if he hasnt played it and it is less than days old you can request a refund so you dont have to worry about that at least also sorry about your brother be strong
gaming,not_removed,if hes played it for less than hours and you said he hadnt then you should still be eligible they usually take about business days its the weekend to get you back your money as a stream credit which you can then use to purchase the game
gaming,not_removed,dont worry about that ticket steam isinfamous for customer service they wont even look at that ticket for a few months and even then it wont be completely direct
gaming,not_removed,no clue what happened but that elvis reminds of the final boss in lollipop chainsaw
gaming,not_removed,updated september
gaming,not_removed,well thats why you dont build one and leave it alone theyre destructive with backup
gaming,not_removed,uhh i think you commented this on the wrong post
gaming,not_removed,choo choo hype train
gaming,not_removed,is that the third movie
gaming,not_removed,i sadly couldnt say i was walking around and stumbled across it at the endbb took the picture kept walking damn those eggs
gaming,not_removed,as someone whos gotten roughly subs on my channel heres what i think now i dont even do lets plays necessarily but im familiar enough with what gets popular and how to appeal to people that i have a pretty good idea the thing about lets plays specifically is that their biggest source of appeal is either a unique game theyve never seen the story the unique method of playing through it or the unique entertainment gotten from watching the lets players personality come out so in other words it can almost be like being a standup improv comedian or a game reviewer viewers want to see what you think of the game and probably some explanation and background as you go along and probably your reaction to whats happening in the game this isnt to say that you should put on a show or anything be yourself but you should also be prepared in advance to make it fun for those watching get yourself hyped up beforehand or something listen to some loud music or do jumping jacks lol on another note some games are better to do lps of than others markiplier for example started off doing horror games because they were simple and gave nice easy reactions out of him some games like civilization for example might not have been as good on someone just starting out also if you want to build up a good youtube channel with a lot of viewers youll have to dedicate a lot of time to this i am extremely inconsistent with uploading and even i spent tons of time working on content and even then it doesnt guarentee that you will get big or anything above all else id say make sure that you are doing this for you not for the numbers do it because get fun out of it and because you like it not for anyone else if you do that then itll get better and youll probably build up something significant eventually anyway also technical points the webcam might be good at a slightly different angle and bigger on the screen maybe just get a new webcam entirely haha anyway you seem like you have a nice start hope this helps and good luck
gaming,not_removed,so im just gonna try to do a chill lets play with no bs just the game and me talking no over reacting or anything like that let me know what you guys think also i got a blue yeti mic right before part i think so the mic quality issue is fixed
gaming,not_removed,not the best game to lets play in my opinion after year its just more repetition with the occasional event here and there
gaming,not_removed,if you just want to relax and play the game id highly recommend streaming it instead imo the lets play scene on youtube is dead nobody has time to watch episodes of a game unless youre really funny or doing something unique and new rare however on twitch people can just come and hang out with you and chat and watch at their leisure not to mention its way faster to set up no renderingediting videos just setting up obs to cap your webcam and screen and then going live
gaming,not_removed,for what ever reason olmelvin flying around up there gave me the giggles
gaming,not_removed,im not a fucking wizard hagrid you fat oaf im just fucking harry
gaming,not_removed,lol well even video game characters have to grow up cant imagine if mario and princess having babies though lots of small mini marios and peaches with moustaches running around
gaming,not_removed,this was so entertaining you sound kinda fucked up tho whats wrong brother write me a monologue about your life﻿
gaming,not_removed,would really help if you told us what platform

gaming,not_removed,thats not link this is s
gaming,not_removed,it took me a minute im in that weird place where i dont know if i should be upset or happy at this joke
gaming,not_removed,i enjoyed it never saw it before
gaming,not_removed,damn i fell for it
gaming,not_removed,took me a minute
gaming,not_removed,awesome
gaming,not_removed,uhm this is gonna need an nsfw tag
gaming,not_removed,face palm
gaming,not_removed,whats a while two weeks
gaming,not_removed,you must be new to reddit then
gaming,not_removed,nah just a slightly more fun way of wording it ive seen this shitpost a million times
gaming,not_removed,team fortress is a very good fps hat simulator unturned is the lovechild of dayz and minecraft warframe is a good third person shooter but it can be very grindy at times
gaming,not_removed,there are a ton of games worth checking out planetside team fortress warframe path of exile robocraft star trek online its a love it or hate it game wildstar also i take it you are a budget gamer at this point so i highly recommend taking advantage of humble bundles right now a great bundle is going on and for just a you can get darkness spec ops the line and duke nukem forever if you pay more you can get other games shown there too the bundles do expire and new ones constantly come out
gaming,not_removed,is great if youre into oldschool survival horror games also i suggest subbing to rsteam and rgamedeals
gaming,not_removed,you can get tom clancys splinter cell from ubisoft for free right now and a different game every month up till december
gaming,not_removed,ubisoft has a free game every month
gaming,not_removed,dota is free on steam evolve is free too through monday aug rainbow six siege is free to play
gaming,not_removed,evolve just got reworked as a game i put around hours in so far and it is really fun
gaming,not_removed,try smite its a moba but good
gaming,not_removed,thank you all this is great
gaming,not_removed,awesome thanks ill look into these im definitely intrigued by unturned
gaming,not_removed,hell yeah thanks
gaming,not_removed,awesome thanks i was already subbed to rsteam but hadnt yet found rgamedeals gold mine thanks friend
gaming,not_removed,again requires another account and client but origin also gives away free games periodically
gaming,not_removed,symmetra everyone forgets about her
gaming,not_removed,i think there are some slight balance problems actually but its pretty damn nice that nothing is completely over or underpowered
gaming,not_removed,yeah but i think a few things could help widowmaker should fire a tad slower bastion needs to turn slower in turret mode nothing huge or crazy but i think that would help a lot those are just a few
gaming,not_removed,i think the balance for the most part is great its funny because the same things that are irritating to fight against are also a blast to play is i like the design philosophy of if everythings broken nothing is it doesnt work with crazy but in this case its great killer instinct is kind of the same way
gaming,not_removed,i always say shit like that characters super is so gay and then i go well so is my characters and so is every other characters
gaming,not_removed,well yeah i think with games of this nature its extremely hard to pin down balancing exactly i think given an infinite amount of time its totally possible but usually within the lifespans of these games just because of the nature of the complexity realistically its probably not going to happen i disagree with you on the point of terran being overpowered however slightly l i honestly think which race is in power fluctuates from update to update and in either case is balanced enough that all the races make it to the world championships and personally only being diamond zerg ive never experienced anything or had losingor winning streaks so large that i thought the game was grossly unbalanced however again im only diamond and players of different skill levels might very well be experiencing balance issues im also not very well educated on the fact actual statistics etc im only speaking from personal and subjective experience so id rather not start a debate on the matter what we really need to do is nerf the koreans so in my personal opinion blizzard is very good at balancing games like this at least in comparison with other companies and again im not really up to date on matter i dont know statistics and this is my personal and subjective experience but i remember games from other big companies like battlefield which i loved apart from those damn rockets modernwarfare in which i always got frustrated at people abusing the noob toob and automatic glocks so i started using them myself games like league of legends also frequently have massive balance issues thankfully those can be more or less solved in the short term via banning i cant remember the last time i played a game as balanced as starcraft besides maybe rocket league and csgo a little sketch there for a bit with the which i also love to play having not played overwatch only knowing what i know from blizzard from my personal and subjective experience playing starcraft id say overwatch will be balanced and rebalanced in coming updates and balancing and unbalanced heroes will become less and less of an issue
gaming,not_removed,who oh you mean the fireworks factory
gaming,not_removed,i feel bad because shes the one character i never see anyone play as but ive seen her have some good plays of the game
gaming,not_removed,yeah i havent been on a team or fought a team of all hanzos all tracers or widow makers everyone seems to be different characters
gaming,not_removed,blizzy will probably flatten them issues out real quick real fuckin quick
gaming,not_removed,you leave my waifu bastion alone lol but yeah i always feel like whoever is doing good is always a different character its not always the same character
gaming,not_removed,im pretty good with some characters but i get owned with bastion at the moment its actually a somewhat difficult character to pick up initially when youre used to being able to move constantly like with pharah its mostly me pressing the wrong keys when i mean to do something else like instinctively pressing shift to make a quick getaway and suddenly turning into a turret
gaming,not_removed,im not sure how balancing the game that way is bad thats how practically every game does its balancing
gaming,not_removed,look up perfect imbalance you need things a little off in games especially rts look at what happened to brood war
gaming,not_removed,thats always cool that theyre trying to be in tune with their audience
gaming,not_removed,i personally love playing symmetra learning the chokepoints of a map makes her a fantastic support hell ive gotten a kill streak a few play of the game moments with her best on defense modes of gameplay wouldnt recommend for attack modes again all just personal opinions
gaming,not_removed,maybe balance issues can be hard to solve well
gaming,not_removed,ime blizzard is very good at balancing
gaming,not_removed,i agree with you but balance will never be perfect wow is always a little or hell sometimes a lot imbalanced terran is a bit better than the other races in and thats never been fixed
gaming,not_removed,uh why is she collecting multiple copies of gems like ford racing and test drive
gaming,not_removed,i like to play a game where i try to find guitar hero whenever i see a game collection ive only not seen like a few times ive also noticed thats its always or
gaming,not_removed,no she didnt everyone knows women cant take pictures without them in it httpiimgurcomkawrxfqjpg
gaming,not_removed,not seeing a copy of battletoads in her nes section
gaming,not_removed,the most important question is she single
gaming,not_removed,that seems pretty average sized for anyone ish
gaming,not_removed,probably a porker
gaming,not_removed,this has been going around for a while classic repost
gaming,not_removed,gamer girl
gaming,not_removed,buying in bulk lots pretty common for collectors then you either trade the spares or sell them in your own lots
gaming,not_removed,so op took the photo of his collection and used the female in title for internet points calling upitchforkemporium
gaming,not_removed,i dont think so she is pure gold
gaming,not_removed,i do notice a lack of cartridges i was a sega fanboy and those cases take up most of my shelf space no snes genesis that was a good time for gaming
gaming,not_removed,heres the actual story screenshot notice the time so please see yourself out
gaming,not_removed,youre an idiot i just got this find me the repost ill send you cash
gaming,not_removed,jfc i think someones doing that with the movie speed
gaming,not_removed,only thing i have is xbox one i wish i had somekeyword of these games
gaming,not_removed,can i add her on sc
gaming,not_removed,still nobody fucking cares because everyone has a god damn collection at home it is nothing special dude
gaming,not_removed,thats the time the picture got out onto the phone it doesnt mean that the picture had to actually be taken
gaming,not_removed,its from about a week ago im not gonna search all of reddit to appease you so goodbye smart ass
gaming,not_removed,i would see myself as an avid gamer yet i do not own a single hard copy game i have all my games in my steamuplayorigin libraries sometimes i wish i had a wall of games to look at
gaming,not_removed,she wanted you to have this
gaming,not_removed,i feel your pain
gaming,not_removed,i started collecting indiebox games just to have something to fill my shelves with now that i am also an exclusively digital gamer theyre pretty awesome and are great conversation pieces with other gamers who come over
gaming,not_removed,this is kind of neat i think the last physical game i bought was halflife but it never occurred to me there might be gamers out there with no physical collection at all
gaming,not_removed,hahaha thats gold
gaming,not_removed,lmao
gaming,not_removed,wow this is an even shorter repost than usual impressive
gaming,not_removed,i wonder what game hes playing to make him so angry
gaming,not_removed,thats the best way
gaming,not_removed,there will be a leap second this year so you may want to add another middle frame
gaming,not_removed,must be a pretty modern game to not need any hands
gaming,not_removed,foh with this repost
gaming,not_removed,fucking rage faces in what is this
gaming,not_removed,so a little like this
gaming,not_removed,i just assumed he was playing something strategic like civ and pondering his next move
gaming,not_removed,also he doesnt seem to be using his hands to play
gaming,not_removed,its one of those new joystick controlled games
gaming,not_removed,they actually have them playing the game if you stand behind them long enough during the party its pretty great
gaming,not_removed,a good game in a bad game
gaming,not_removed,i do believe visceral worked on hardline so theres a great many references to their games in it i do believe there is also a reload animation dedicated to kinesis in the game where the character uses it to reload the ak
gaming,not_removed,oh yeah i saw one of the guys was like this is pretty gory or something lol
gaming,not_removed,this shame that visceral had to work on hardline rather than continuing with dead space
gaming,not_removed,its like entertaining cheesy bad tho
gaming,not_removed,they also talk about nichole and give spoilers to the game i thought it was pretty funny theres actually an isaac clarke reference earlier in the game when three years pass
gaming,not_removed,depends on the pokémon you find there honestly
gaming,not_removed,what game looks something i can just spend hours messing with
gaming,not_removed,for club penguinnnnn
gaming,not_removed,madness this is antarctica
gaming,not_removed,reminds me of the rabbit from monty python
gaming,not_removed,ultimate epic battle simulator mate
gaming,not_removed,thanks fam
gaming,not_removed,wrong sub
gaming,not_removed,why is this on the gaming sub
gaming,not_removed,do not buy any more video games until you buy an english textbook
gaming,not_removed,dont tell me what to do making my jimmies all rustled and shit how dare you
gaming,not_removed,just my thoughts i thought i would share
gaming,not_removed,shitpost has way too less content to be offered full price
gaming,not_removed,its a better
gaming,not_removed,ea promoter detected
gaming,not_removed,free dlc
gaming,not_removed,hes italian leave him alone
gaming,not_removed,lol
gaming,not_removed,just play binding of isaac best game ever
gaming,not_removed,space rangers hd its gotta be or cheaper and its the best single player space game ive played
gaming,not_removed,ive actually been digging enter the gungeon more
gaming,not_removed,blizz launched legion recently and game launches in general attract ddos attacks
gaming,not_removed,well yes its written right there in the textbox
gaming,not_removed,reads text box only a ddos well shit
gaming,not_removed,because its more challenging that way
gaming,not_removed,well aside from the obvious jensen is a corporate security agent he doesnt have the legal authority of clearance to kill people it doesnt matter how fucked up the future is in deus ex its not so fucked up that the security chief of a biotech firm should be killing people
gaming,not_removed,so kill them all you have the choice to go stealthily and no kill or murderator obviously youre passionate enough to become the terminator so do it thats the brilliance of this types of games that give you choice
gaming,not_removed,achievement might be a reason to do it
gaming,not_removed,actually more challenging in the alice garden pods ambush level to kill them all ive found could have stealth evaded and nonlethal takedowns appear to make less noise but fuck those guys they killed a whole bunch of poor people to get at one hacker those perish those who would harm the innocent where possible id say
gaming,not_removed,fuck that waste the motherfuckers no court of law would convict him if there was any justice at all hes not ganking random people in the first case they were blowing up his workplace and killing people and in the second case complete massacre of people who are just down and out fuck em what would be a fucked up future is if someone with his capabilities let them get away with that shit all they were trying to do was live in poor accommodation and eat some noodles then belltower or whoever the fuck tai yong medical employed killed them all for no good reason at all they good have just black bagged van bruggen no worries but they had to massacre innocent people and thus they totally had it coming
gaming,not_removed,i most definitely did what bothered me though was people going yeah man full pacifist why they had it coming i like the option to not kill random mooks i think thats a great feature bills just trying to make ends meet being a mall cop no need to waste him but those fuckers who killed all the innocent people in alice garden pods or the gang bangers who boast about going to kill a homeless person fuck em they need to go
gaming,not_removed,eh takes away from the rpg aspect of it all though for my money oh hi guys you have assault rifles have blown the shit out of my workplace killed my friends and i have a gun but ha hah nonlethal takedown
gaming,not_removed,man youre way too emotionally involved in this videogame
gaming,not_removed,actually yes a court of law would convict him perhaps not of the killing but he would be sent up river for a variety of charges likely centering around trespassing on a crime scene reckless endangerment and interfering with police theres enough there for the illuminati to put him away for good
gaming,not_removed,in the original deus ex lol at calling hr an old game there was this one segment where you had to sneak onto a ship carrying a big load of lethal virus that the bad guys were planning on using to wipe out new york the ship was a chinese military ship that was being commandeered by a chinese organized crime syndicate and it was parked at an american naval shipyard in ny as you went through the opening of the level the shipyard trying to get to the ship all of the mooks were american navy officers who you knew were not in on the plot and were suspicious of the ship theyd say apologetic things when they caught you and had to start shooting at you one of them you meet before going in is non hostile and gives you help getting in etc so you feel bad about killing these guys and went to sneak and use nonlethal attacks etc then you get on the ship and all of the mooks are chinese mafia types none of them have lines in english theyre criminals they know what the plot is and are willing to wipe out a major metropolis you assume clearly these are bad guys so you feel no compunction about just shooting them then at the end of the level theres a computer you can hack that serves no gameplay purpose except for you to get more plot snooping through the emails on it you find out that these guys are here because the illuminati kidnapped the captains daughter and was holding her hostage and that he hated himself for giving in to them maybe you still feel okay with having killed all of those guys on the ship up until then but for a lot of players you have to stop and re evaluate how sure you are that this or that random mook is a real bad guy and what that means besides achievement boasting one reason for the total pacifist attitude is the same sort of reason people feel that way in real life who are you to make a judgment like that are you sure you know enough to do this thing that can never be undone
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,wooo didnt take long for them to come into it eh i kind of doubt it the cops would be more like fuck the bad guys killed hundreds of people and you took them out fuck em heres a medal
gaming,not_removed,ah the oradour issue the waffen ss kill the inhabitants of an entire town boo hiss then you find out what the town did to captured german soldiers and you no longer wonder at their response as much as you did before where is the good who is guilty so maybe the inhabitants of alice garden pods had tortured to death some belltower guys beforehand maybe all of them had a hand in it and thus when belltower come to alice garden podsall were guilty who am i to make a judgement like that why a man if i know enoughthen thats enough
gaming,not_removed,clearly youve never met any police officers or are unaware of the actual plot of human revolution
gaming,not_removed,havent finished the game yet thats true however i have met more than few police officers and i cant think of one that wouldnt agree building full of a more than a hundred people killed theyre really not going to care much about what the good guy did

gaming,not_removed,and im the lindbergh baby
gaming,not_removed,pics or it didnt happen
gaming,not_removed,sigh i hope that the devil doesnt want half life too it must get boring in hell but torturing people who joke about these things must elevate his mood
gaming,not_removed,dont joke about that was a rough year for me
gaming,not_removed,so were you actually kidnaped or did mrs lindbergh accidentally kill you and then claim you were kidnapped by krauts
gaming,not_removed,i was accidentally killed but then krauts did steal me it was actually a del between my mother and the nazis they took my limp corpse to henry ford who cloned me and then they tossed me where i was found i am the clone well the clones clone actually charles augustus lindbergh jr the at your service
gaming,not_removed,the fuck lmao
gaming,not_removed,team fortress and dota are both free and big hitters at their respective genres
gaming,not_removed,for anyone who hasnt tried it yet path of exile is definitely worth a download its what diablo iii should have been
gaming,not_removed,warframe is a lot of fun and free to play done right
gaming,not_removed,dirty bomb
gaming,not_removed,trove is awesome
gaming,not_removed,war thunder
gaming,not_removed,iron snout its a game that could honestly be a browser game that involves you fighting wolves as a pig fun for a while at least
gaming,not_removed,brawlhalla is a really fun fighting game has amazing devs who keep adding new content its completely check it out
gaming,not_removed,i have smite on my xbox and im playing alot of hearthstone might be a card game ill have to look at later
gaming,not_removed,team fortress is alot like overwatch correct
gaming,not_removed,what was wrong with diablo i like hack and slash games ill give it a whirl
gaming,not_removed,i second this warframe is better than most aaa titles and has a huge community check out rwarframe if you are interested
gaming,not_removed,whats it about all i know is its pretty big for being free
gaming,not_removed,sounds like a plane game
gaming,not_removed,i tryed playing it but it wouldnt work for some reason
gaming,not_removed,been a while since i played a war game
gaming,not_removed,sounds like a losing battle ill check it out
gaming,not_removed,thanks for the suggestion ill look it up
gaming,not_removed,rainbow six siege on that note headphones and your sound card if on pc are a factor as well
gaming,not_removed,im watching a lets play of battlefield and i see the player struggle to figure out what they should be looking at or where they should be going or who they should be following proper positional audio would solve most of their problems the battlefield series is quite well known for its excellent sound work and i dont remember being any different positional audio if i remember correctly is top notch its possible the streamer does not have the gear or the capacity to take advantage of it
gaming,not_removed,the recent hrtf update to counterstrike global offensive makes positional audio much better id recommend overear headphones over speakers or inears
gaming,not_removed,sonys audio on the new platinum headset and the psvr is supposed to be pretty special but the only games that support it are unsharted and the last guardian it seems kinda doomed to failure with just sony supporting it
gaming,not_removed,can confirm bought a € razer headset just for it changes the whole game the guy on its let´s play must have a shitty headset
gaming,not_removed,do the consoles have the ability to take advantage of it
gaming,not_removed,hrtf sound makes the game not sound like complete shit too bad the source engine is still shit
gaming,not_removed,yeah dude
gaming,not_removed,its the matter of setting magic particularly that manifested by humans is very rare in witcher world consistently canon throughout the world and storylines in games and novels
gaming,not_removed,what i want to know is why the superstitious npcs talk so much trash im a magical mutant monsterslayer badass youd think theyd call me sir instead of freak
gaming,not_removed,seriously its all fuck this guy and his superpowers up until our rinky dink hamlet starts getting terrorized by a werewolf or a night wraith
gaming,not_removed,i always love that aspect too were suspicious of these magical monster killing machines lets call him a prick to his face i get the fear and suspicion of something he masses dont understand heck i could understand mass protests or mobs against them but someone going up on their own and looking like they want to start a fight its hilarious edit esp after times i save someone from something they were all too chickenshit to handle
gaming,not_removed,bloons td

gaming,not_removed,mario galaxy has a player support option where player controls luma the most usefuluseless star in the galaxy and helps player in small but not insignificant ways super mario world up to players can play on the same screen breath of the wild a two player game in the most classic sense a single player game where the nonplayer tells you what to do next any open world game can work this way go punch that guy oooh look in that house why arent you breaking all the boxes go back and break everything these are just the ones that have worked well in my experience

gaming,not_removed,you did not make this
gaming,not_removed,if your search pixel painting there is the same picture that was posted a year ago so tell me the truth
gaming,not_removed,hey just keep faking you actually made things that have been around for two years
gaming,not_removed,maybe hes talking about the pixels on the banana are you talking about the banana
gaming,not_removed,wow way to take someone elses work as your own
gaming,not_removed,can you please explain your process
gaming,not_removed,the red headed girl looks like she is moonwalking
gaming,not_removed,how does one paint pixels
gaming,not_removed,love it
gaming,not_removed,well you did a great job
gaming,not_removed,this is so beautiful you have no idea how i good you did this i actually thought i was looking at a game on a screen for a while before i saw the table and all great work you should sellship these prints i might actually buy one if i can lol
gaming,not_removed,that looks like im playing it on a tube tv awesome job
gaming,not_removed,this brought some good nostalgia back thank you for this loved chrono
gaming,not_removed,lol
gaming,not_removed,copy paste someone elses shit to reddit
gaming,not_removed,too bad they didnt make it
gaming,not_removed,thats not stupid at all i do it all the time im not sure what platform you play on but on you press square and use the thumbstick to roll yourself over in the air so you land the right way up comes in really handy
gaming,not_removed,if it works it aint stupid
gaming,not_removed,if that guy who got demod went straight in goal instead of being a boost whore he could have made the save that guy is every teammate i have ever had
gaming,not_removed,you have the same car colors and decals as me i thought this was me for a minute
gaming,not_removed,i cant tell you how many times ive been in that position and attempted to save by pulling up short only to watch the ball bounce after i misjudged what a save
gaming,not_removed,jewbakalol
gaming,not_removed,then your teammate gently taps the ball at the last second to get the goal
gaming,not_removed,can we focus on jewbaka
gaming,not_removed,thats why youre not getting into ikon baybee
gaming,not_removed,calculated
gaming,not_removed,prospect confirmed
gaming,not_removed,i love rocket league the best thing about it is that everyone sucks at it
gaming,not_removed,that was calculated
gaming,not_removed,wow
gaming,not_removed,if its stupid but it works its not stupid
gaming,not_removed,its not stupid if it works
gaming,not_removed,stupid idea ive been trying to make this shot on purpose and still havent been able to one day awesome goal btw
gaming,not_removed,savage
gaming,not_removed,wow this game looks really cool thought it was just another fad game shame my pc wouldnt run jt
gaming,not_removed,would be cool if they added rollcage style cars to this
gaming,not_removed,wow
gaming,not_removed,to them that was a pro move
gaming,not_removed,if it works its not stupid
gaming,not_removed,am i the only one who remembers playing soccer as a car on road trip on
gaming,not_removed,air roll is your landing friend
gaming,not_removed,if it worked its not stupid
gaming,not_removed,noice play sick ride too
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,man this game looks pretty fun i barely play games anymore but this looks addictive
gaming,not_removed,thats a bicycle kick
gaming,not_removed,going to be studying this clip for a while now that ive got the game if i can manage to successfully replicate this awesome move myself ill be sure to share it and credit ya d
gaming,not_removed,gotta get the boost
gaming,not_removed,and thats how heading the ball in soccer was born
gaming,not_removed,but it worked so its not stupid
gaming,not_removed,let me tell you what i used to tell my soldiers if its stupid and it works its not stupid
gaming,not_removed,if you get sploded your first fucking look better be to the goal and not the damn power balls in the corner fuck no awareness in some people
gaming,not_removed,this never usually works considering everyone in my games fly and deflect it or fly and score either or rarely does it touch the ground in those types of situations
gaming,not_removed,rocket league when not having someone at midfieldbackfield is just asking for a stray shot on goal to go in uncontested
gaming,not_removed,calculated
gaming,not_removed,man if i manage to get this game any time soon from a trade im going to have to practice that kind of shot thats freaking amazing d wow got the game will be practicing that shot in about a half hour d
gaming,not_removed,i like the name jewbaka
gaming,not_removed,the inside of the goals geometry is built exactly for this purpose
gaming,not_removed,rebind the air roll to to maximize barrel rolls with boost
gaming,not_removed,eh super situational and not always practical usually it makes sense to just in front of the goal to make the save this was risky
gaming,not_removed,you should rebind it to do that when you click in the stick makes it easier to do cool tricks in the air
gaming,not_removed,you clearly havent met my coworkers
gaming,not_removed,if its stupid but it works its still stupid you just got lucky
gaming,not_removed,its either could have or couldve but never could of see httpwwwgrammarerrorscomgrammarcouldofwouldofshouldof for more information
gaming,not_removed,my favorite are the guy who directs the ball into the one of the opposing teams two corners then puts it no where in front of goal but pretty much hugging the wall then spams take the shot or people who spam take the shot throughout the whole game and then when they go for shots just whiff
gaming,not_removed,i hate it when the guy closest to the goal goes for boost just after kickoff im not sure if im being an ass or not but personally even if i do not want to be in goal i spend the first seconds or however long it takes to ensure theres no easy goal in goal after kickoff and genuinely dislike the players that do not do the same
gaming,not_removed,except you wouldve went for boost instead of making the save
gaming,not_removed,how bout them decals what coat do you fancy how bout them decals what coat do you fancy
gaming,not_removed,youd be surprised you might get away with it on low
gaming,not_removed,i feel like it could have been a fad game if not for the competitivepro scene going from casual to competitive adds many layers of depth to the gameplay that i never knew about until spending hours one day on rrocketleague learning how to git gud
gaming,not_removed,its been popular for years geez how long does it take to not be a fad game in you book
gaming,not_removed,when i was watching the replay footage while making this clip i noticed someone on the opposing team left their goal to pick up some boost right before my shot slowly rolled into their goal i dont think my plan would have worked otherwise
gaming,not_removed,get this game had it for a week havent had this much fun with a game in a long time i repeat get this game
gaming,not_removed,power slide and air roll both on imo allows you to powerslide while boosting and you cant air roll and power slide at the same time anyway
gaming,not_removed,and put boost on square so you can jump boost and roll at the same time
gaming,not_removed,or bind air roll to left bumper seeing as clicking in the stick can mess with you just moving it precisely or maybe thats just me
gaming,not_removed,you must work in dc
gaming,not_removed,thank the lord for this bot
gaming,not_removed,there are you happy now
gaming,not_removed,i like the guys who think the entire point of the game is to hit the ball no matter what the circumstances or even what direction theyre hitting it in for instance the guy who hits the ball away from the front of the goal just before i hit it into the goal or the guy who hits the ball back in front of our goal when im trying to clear it or the guy who slams the ball all the way down to our goal when we had pressure on
gaming,not_removed,would have gone nice work on wouldve though
gaming,not_removed,well it definitely seemed to work out in your favour quite nicely ill have to watch out for you if i ever manage to find someone willing to trade a copy of it youre quite the sneaky one p
gaming,not_removed,definitely on the top of my steam wishlist i just need to find someone who has an extra copy and is willing to trade it woah got the game and will be in on the action in about a half hour d
gaming,not_removed,i have been trying to figure out what i can do to make my rolls in the air easier its pretty hard to air dribble using the defaul controller layout
gaming,not_removed,dc what does that mean
gaming,not_removed,seriously i never cared about the youryoure thing but could of really annoys me i cant understand why anyone would think thats the correct word
gaming,not_removed,they start with something simple that everyone can agree with them on then all of a sudden skynet
gaming,not_removed,theyre like dogs
gaming,not_removed,omg this i have noticed this more and more as i start getting better im not that good yet im only a prospect iii but i really dont think i should have to be telling people stop hitting it toward our own goal at even this level of the game that really just seems common sense but i think you nailed it they just feel the need to hit the ball no matter what
gaming,not_removed,better yet when they think that you have to be going top speed all the time sometimes its better to just stop and assess the situation
gaming,not_removed,so true
gaming,not_removed,was that correction worth the down votes pick your battles
gaming,not_removed,the game is why do you need someone to trade it to you
gaming,not_removed,hes not wrong hes alternatively right
gaming,not_removed,yeah theres a ton of stuff you can do honestly since even the most abstract layouts can work for you just as long as certain things are easier to do and not harder you learn as you play around hours in i bound air roll to lb and for a while it really messed me up but im fine now i forgot his name but there is a pro who has a very interesting controller scheme
gaming,not_removed,detective comics
gaming,not_removed,because its what couldve sounds like if you were genuinely asking that is
gaming,not_removed,ive never paid attention enough to this and cant figure it out now but why doesnt could of work it makes sense to me think you could ive just been having a brain fart these last days trying to see whats wrong with it
gaming,not_removed,probably some kind of hunting instinct tunnel vision i know i get pretty focused on stupid goals in first person shooters still pisses me off though
gaming,not_removed,not sure why i was downvoted to be honest especially when the would of bot was praised and upvoted in this very thread shrug whatever
gaming,not_removed,while its worth way more than that id rather pay for rl than half the aaa games that come out
gaming,not_removed,hello indeed may not seem like a lot when finances arent an issue but even to those on the lower end of the financial spectrum can be a lot priorities must be focused on the necessities first and foremost and losing my job due to a medical condition and coworkers bullying harrassing and threatening me about it didnt help my financial situation ive only just recently started to look for a new job but have not had any success finding anything the game has been on sale a number of times lowest ive seen it thus far is and was even included for humble bundle monthly subscribers within the last six months or so it has also been given away numerous times ive entered every single giveaway ive seen that has had it i have a few steam game keys i managed to get with some christmas money and ive been attempting to find someone whos generous enough and also doesnt necessarily care about game values so much as whether or not its a game they have an interest in to trade an extra copy they may have acquired i have yet to find that person though sincerely dawsonjr
gaming,not_removed,might have something worth in his steam inventory and doesnt want to spend money on something he might have spent on or hes a moocher either seem probable
gaming,not_removed,well it works for him
gaming,not_removed,the default setup works for me for most stuff but i have been trying to get wall to air dribbles and lead it into the goal and that requires turning your car quite a bit i may mess around with it tonight
gaming,not_removed,i understand that and somebody might have picked it up incorerrectly but i have seen it written by people with apart from that flawless english so they must have learned the correct way at one point or another
gaming,not_removed,removing the could from a sentence should help you understand why of is incorrect i of eaten cake is clearly wrong whereas i have eaten cake is entirely valid the same applies to could have vs could of thats the best i can do xd
gaming,not_removed,id definitely buy it without hesitation over many other games as well if i had the money wouldnt go so far as but definitely understand where youre coming from with that remark
gaming,not_removed,unfortunately i do not have anything worth on steam at a glance i have maybe about worth of items total im not entirely sure how you come to your conclusion
gaming,not_removed,also raltright
gaming,not_removed,some people dont understand that other people find different layouts more efficient
gaming,not_removed,if you change anything just bind air roll to left bumper its probably the single most told thing to newer players idk if you are but its good advice if you havent done it for any player also get good camera settings so you can see more and turn off camera shake
gaming,not_removed,pm me your steam name buddy we might be able to come to an agreement
gaming,not_removed,its not hard for that to happen theres tons of shit on steam which can sell for hundreds ive traded before and personally gotten games out of it its easy to do and happens all the time why else would you want to trade for a copy of rl on steam also is the cost of a key where you could possibly get lucky and get an item worth well over dollars if you were lucky the most probable item would probably be worth cents but hey ive only opened dollars worth of crates and gotten out of it theres a huge trading market on steam thats not the built in community where people trade games for items and other things the more you know and thats how i got to that conclusion
gaming,not_removed,also get good camera settings so you can see more and turn off camera shake can you describe what you mean by get good camera settings im trying to improve my game but havent changed any layout or camera settings
gaming,not_removed,hey there i sent you a pm as per your request would definitely be awesome if we can and no worries at all if not thank you very much
gaming,not_removed,im not following you at all what i can tell you is i have absolutely nothing worth and most certainly dont have any items worth hundreds of dollars as for why i want rocket league that should be obvious i have an interest in the game and want to play it
gaming,not_removed,unless youve perfected it its also the last place i myself would map it to
gaming,not_removed,your fov restricts what you see if its not maxed and you can have the camera positioned better so you can see more also lastly you can change some settings and have the camera move a little better there are some setups that people use that they post the most loose but best comparison i can come up with is something like the crosshairs in cs they dont change the game for other people but they can make you play better though for different reasons but you get the idea i hope
gaming,not_removed,im not entirely sure how you come to your conclusion you are some random dude on the internet talking about trading for a game other people seemed like they didnt know why you would trade for a game while there is a big market for trading ingame items that are worth real money for games and cutting out the middle man of the steam cash cut i explained to you that people trade items that could potentially be expensive and you just keep telling me that you have no money and you dont understand why people trade all i did was explain to another person that people trade stuff for games and its not uncommon and you just say you have no money and you dont understand what im saying cmon dude
gaming,not_removed,hello if i may give some advice dont presume that something easy and uncomplicated to you is the same for someone else for instance i can look at a chess book and know exactly what means but someone who is not educated in chess would have no clue what it means im relatively new to steam only been on it two years and am very new to reddit and these game sites like indiegala green man gaming bundle stars et cetera i just recently learned what it means when a trading card says its valid until suchandsuch a date i just threw a few cards up on the marketplace and have absolutely no idea if they will actually sell or not as i dont have the luxury of owning a cellsmart phone and have to wait a ridiculously long time for them to go through on that note i dont feel as though engaging with you any further is a very productive use of my time at present theres clearly some sort of misunderstanding or miscommunication and im not following you and you dont seem overly keen on patiently explaining things sincerely dawsonjr
gaming,not_removed,duh whats your point here
gaming,not_removed,and that you have reading comprehension issues im sorry man
gaming,not_removed,im with my work computer right now
gaming,not_removed,somebody
gaming,not_removed,once
gaming,not_removed,told
gaming,not_removed,its okay this is the internet you can swear here
gaming,not_removed,tomb raider
gaming,not_removed,the last of us is a great game also third person also made by naughty dog much darker tone and joel is much less agile but you can tell they drew a lot from what they learned making uncharted
gaming,not_removed,borderlands the handsome collection
gaming,not_removed,yep this is the closest thing
gaming,not_removed,thats a big yup
gaming,not_removed,thank you 😊
gaming,not_removed,damn yall look annoying as shit
gaming,not_removed,ew ryu is wearing an anklet
gaming,not_removed,thank you
gaming,not_removed,im not sure if this make it better or worse but its a friendship bracelet we all have one on
gaming,not_removed,nah guys do stupid stuff to bang the chicks in the friend group all the time
gaming,not_removed,i dont know if you really care but he is dating the wii fit trainer in the middle charizard got us all bracelets when she went to mexico
gaming,not_removed,charizard is that what bottom right is meant to be i thought she had forgotten her outfit and just had an orange tshirt on
gaming,not_removed,haha no i was making a joke good for you guys though
gaming,not_removed,ahaha i mean she tried really hard and put a lot of work into it im happy it turned out a little cringy though because all of ours were a little cringy it was more fun that way
gaming,not_removed,cloud is really good link is just rubbish zero effort for cloud for link a green hat and the master sword does not the hero of time make
gaming,not_removed,i mean he definetly couldve done a bit more but in his defense he was dressing up as toon link which is more simplistic
gaming,not_removed,doesnt excuse the black tshirt tbh give him a slap and tell him to try harder next time
gaming,not_removed,if you own skyrim all dlc on steam by the end of october you will be entitled to a free upgrade to skyrim special edition for more details head to the following link
gaming,not_removed,too late
gaming,not_removed,about tree fiddy
gaming,not_removed,tops
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,if the specs really justify its price
gaming,not_removed,my is already collecting dust
gaming,not_removed,i would buy one so that i can remote play games better its bound to have less input lag
gaming,not_removed,seriously i wouldnt pay more than tbh the is outdated as fuck
gaming,not_removed,is about what the old is currently being sold for ops asking about the neo
gaming,not_removed,yeah i know i totally acknowledge that i still think the neo will be outdated as fuck also not even trolling
gaming,not_removed,possibly but expecting it to be sold for the same price as the old one is still weird
gaming,not_removed,no i get you im not expecting it to be i actually am convinced itll have a proce tag of atleast but as a principle move i wouldnt pay more than upscale to so what slightly better performance for psvrrumored so what but hey what the hell do i know im just a stingy consumer p
gaming,not_removed,yeah good point im not really interested in it either
gaming,not_removed,its rare to see them mate in the wild
gaming,not_removed,you see ivan when plane hit other plane they become mega plane
gaming,not_removed,wasnt this game named something else before
gaming,not_removed,reminds me of no mans lie
gaming,not_removed,oort online the renaming really wasnt to reflect a bad game being rebaged just it seems to better offer its saleability the underlying game is pretty solid and im usually one to critise dodgy games the community is fairly large playabiilty is solid updates are regular
gaming,not_removed,a little bit but these devs dont promise more than they can deliver regular patches they deliver what they say they will do gameplay videos are actualy gameplay videos as always look at youtube lets plays before buying in btu they have a smaller but active community that grows more by word of mouth than big budget marketing
gaming,not_removed,off topic but out of a group of friends i play games with one of them is so incredibly bad at every game thats not a first person shooter he can stop drop and turn around open up shop in cod though
gaming,not_removed,love me some dark souls sadly my controllers did not
gaming,not_removed,we did it guys
gaming,not_removed,die die die
gaming,not_removed,plot twist cod drops the dinosaur game not battlefield
gaming,not_removed,if call of duty finally makes a vietnam era game like they were rumored to they could finally get back in the discussion
gaming,not_removed,i honestly liked the campaign because you could play coop i was disappointed that didnt allow coop but there is no comparison in the multiplayer experience
gaming,not_removed,but they are two different games
gaming,not_removed,havent bought a call of duty game in years but battlefield is not by any means a strong enough game to make everyone forget about call of duty its not the best game of the yearoverwatch and its not even the best game of the year by eatitanfall
gaming,not_removed,i just hope they continue what they have done with and continue going in order with world conflicts i would love to play a current gen battlefield in with the campaign very similar and after that vietnam oh man the battle in veitnam would be nuts choppers dropping you off on revive so epic
gaming,not_removed,had great potential but they focused on being pc and making of the characters non white which was beyond retarded
gaming,not_removed,way back when with and waw but battlefield upped thier game since then
gaming,not_removed,people are gonna stampede back to cod when a iteration releases mark my fucking words
gaming,not_removed,call of duty sucks ive never heard this take on the internet before next youll tell me you dont like madden either i bet
gaming,not_removed,im a proud operations fanboy arguably the best mode ever created in any of these games
gaming,not_removed,yeah theyre both pretty similar in my opinion both are shooters were playing more gives you an advantage over others both series churn out games that arent that radically different than the predecessor both games fanbase hate each other
gaming,not_removed,that didnt quite hit the spot
gaming,not_removed,black ops
gaming,not_removed,oh man battlefield vietnam i loved that game
gaming,not_removed,or outflank battlefield and do a
gaming,not_removed,coop was so good im also disappointed
gaming,not_removed,depends on what youre in it for i respect that overwatch is a stronger game in a lot of ways but give me that feeling of rushing over a hill with other teammates as we charge into the next sector any day operations particularly kaiserschlacht just hits the exact spot im looking for in a multiplayer fps
gaming,not_removed,how overwatcj got game of the year ill never know
gaming,not_removed,i dont understand why they did that for the german and british armies its simply not an accurate portrayal of who was fighting its like they went out of their way to a weird degree
gaming,not_removed,yet call of duty doesnt have dedicated serverswhich henders the multiplayer experiencewhich is one of the biggest problem with themif they ever fix that one issuethen the playing field would be even
gaming,not_removed,world at war
gaming,not_removed,what im saying is that the game wasnt nearly good enough to erase a historied franchise like call of duty i bought battlefield along with my group of friends and we all stopped playing within the week the game reminds me of battlefront in the sense that it aims for a brief nostalgic sense of immersion rather than relying on solid replayable gameplay
gaming,not_removed,its ingenuity and diversity mostly
gaming,not_removed,cod and cod
gaming,not_removed,you and your friends must be playing really wrong out of all fps games battlefield imo offers the most varied and replayable multiplayer experiences
gaming,not_removed,its the same arena shooter over and over again
gaming,not_removed,also would you not think that it i would be a greater wrong doing to not recognise the sacrifices of colonial troops than to ensure realism in a game that is unrealistic in nearly every other aspect apologies if some of my stats about the game are wrong however i think the presence of colonial troops is something that should be applauded if anything i dont think it necessarily has to be a choice between not including any colonial troops whatsoever and designing the game in such a way that of the german army fighting in the kaiserschlacht is coloured as you say in my opinion it comes off as more of an overtly pc decision by ea youre sort of forced to play as someone who isnt representative of the overwhelming majority of these armies it sometimes breaks the immersion for me ingame a bit to see the ratios that skewed in the end its not a big deal but i do not see it as a coincidence that ea made this decision in when youd never see it happening even a decade ago
gaming,not_removed,with different playable characters the game has alot more to offer than battlefield has tank plane horse infantry the player count of the games speaks for itself overwatch is over months old and still blowing out newer titles
gaming,not_removed,i wasnt trying to compare the two because they are completely different but if you wanna play that game has kinds of tanks each with different variants same thing for the planes kinds of behemoths that require different strategies and teamwork to take down there are also or armoured cars motorcycles boats loads of weapon emplacements huge player maps operations mode all the way thats just barely scratching the surface with out getting into the infantry overhype characters that generally play the same
gaming,not_removed,go say that on roverwatch
gaming,not_removed,lol i dont think id be able to keep up with the hate mail of course a sub dedicated to a game is going to hate on any opinion different than theirs its like going back to germany and saying jews arent that bad i still think overwatch is highly overrated
gaming,not_removed,how did nobody discover this before those are pretty obviously the frame times in ms does this fix the issue that the framerate had a direct correlation with physics
gaming,not_removed,dude stop reposting it
gaming,not_removed,i believe it does because this helped my copy of the original skyrim and users over at rskyrimmods reported excellent results with the skyrim special edition
gaming,not_removed,earlier was just a suspicion it is now confirmed by a lot of people over at rskyrimmods
gaming,not_removed,then add an edit to previous posts no need to flood every pc gaming and skyrim sub with it
gaming,not_removed,im sorry that you spend so much time in new that it bothered you
gaming,not_removed,soldier of fortune mercenary basically essentially because hes not part of a national army hes a mercenary and therefore a soldier of fortune
gaming,not_removed,he is a soldier of fortune since he isnt fighting for a country
gaming,not_removed,golden sun
gaming,not_removed,lost magic i loved that game trying to draw the spells super fast was a challenge
gaming,not_removed,unfortunately not looks like golden sun is too good of a game haha
gaming,not_removed,thats too good
gaming,not_removed,for reference the chance of that happening is about its turn in case you just wanna skip
gaming,not_removed,sweet dude i always wanted a star destroyer ya know in real life
gaming,not_removed,wait till you get it on sale the first and second bio shock were the best
gaming,not_removed,if you like a good story i could not recommend bioshock higher i actually picked up the collection recently and its aged pretty well in my opinion i only played a part of the first one when it first came out so i dont really have the nostalgia factor but playing it now is almost like a new game the gameplay is pretty smooth its fun and the story is told really well if you dont know too much about the story already id suggest avoiding it and finding out as you play edit also as the other person said if you wait for a sale you can probably get a pretty good deal id avoid getting it for pc though i found the keyboard a bit fiddly for some of the moves although maybe im just bad with keyboards
gaming,not_removed,definitely one of my favorite game series and is worth a pickup i would as well wait for a sale i got the originals on pc about a year ago for extremely cheap i think all for around ive played a little bit of the remastered and its nice but not a super substantial graphical upgrade from the original but story wise this game is awesome bioshock and are great and infinite is insane youll enjoy them for sure
gaming,not_removed,i just looked at their kickstarter page and the perks range from owning a shirt to becoming a distributor for them that a genius idea on their part httpswwwkickstartercomprojectssmachteamsmachzthehandheldgamingpcpledgenewclickedrewardfalse
gaming,not_removed,has anyone determined an approximate value on this ive been following this as the is my favorite console and so far no one seems to mention value in terms of numbers
gaming,not_removed,is that the same one from ben heck
gaming,not_removed,theres been offers in the hundreds of thousands but at this point its whatever someones willing to pay really

gaming,not_removed,

gaming,not_removed,came here to write this great when you work in sales
gaming,not_removed,you misspelled skill queue
gaming,not_removed,your comment confused the shit out of me for a minute lol well if thats how you play the game i guess mean while my alliance and the coalition we are in are at constant war and thats how we have fun the skill queue thing is just a way of complaining that you cant max out a character in a month of game play sure its possible now with the injectors but if you work in game for that or use money for it then you are missing out on what the game offers
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,for that deck perhaps
gaming,not_removed,no both sides have stupid morons on them
gaming,not_removed,posts like this is why all gamers have an image problem
gaming,not_removed,i think its just the loud minority
gaming,not_removed,youre implying its pc people typing that
gaming,not_removed,i think of console gamers as sheep people
gaming,not_removed,til canadians arent as pleasant as they let on
gaming,not_removed,we all know real gamers are pc gamers duh
gaming,not_removed,from what i gather console games have lower graphic quality and dont often go on sale why do people pay more for less
gaming,not_removed,that or google doesnt like consoles very much
gaming,not_removed,or some console gamers with a low self esteem
gaming,not_removed,image problem huh to be fair console games and its players are inferior
gaming,not_removed,no
gaming,not_removed,sheep
gaming,not_removed,when in reality most of us are twenty something year olds that love gaming and gaming culture but dont have the time or money to dump into a pc
gaming,not_removed,notallgamers
gaming,not_removed,the sales are pretty comparable actually psn has a lot of digital sales also if i wanna play co op on my tv in the living room im not gonna lug my desktop all the way out there just so we can play some
gaming,not_removed,you and i have totally different ideas of fair
gaming,not_removed,hello reddit the word of the day is irony
gaming,not_removed,there certainly are tall gamers
gaming,not_removed,you do know you can buy pcs that outperform consoles for the size footprint and weight for less money right
gaming,not_removed,i wouldve accepted hypocrite but irony works too
gaming,not_removed,outperform yes less money hell fucking no im a pc gamer a gtx doesnt instantly mean outperform if you wanted it to cost less than a youd have to find a ton of used parts and used pc parts are fine but used cases are harder to fine
gaming,not_removed,you can easily get a build that can perform on the level of a im not even going to bother listing them because theyre easy to find
gaming,not_removed,that isnt future proof tbh it can do the job but its not future proof
gaming,not_removed,neither is a console
gaming,not_removed,youre right about that one
gaming,not_removed,the waiting game
gaming,not_removed,reddit
gaming,not_removed,the biggest issue with this is you simply cant expect gamers in mass to do the logical course of action gaming is no longer the outsiders hobby its mainstream and with that comes well everyone that includes the worst of us and due to our large size in this hobby thats a whole lot of aholes and idiots literally millions of them mixed in with us the people who act in the extreme manners arent going to be reasoned with so simply someone whos willing to literally send a death threat to a game developer isnt going to be the type that hears the obvious of not buying subpar games to begin with they are not logical people and its not logical to expect them to behave as if they were some people are going to fork over their money every single time and then end up upset quite often its just how its going to be just as how none of us are shocked anymore when some jerk says or does absurd things in a game which degrades everyone elses experience
gaming,not_removed,this is really important right now for games at least if we want the complete vision of a game the true product that the studios worked so painstakingly hard on then us consumers have to take a stand ive seen and recently experienced this with some of my favorite franchises metal gear solid v destiny and final fantasy xv upon finishing these games they somewhat felt incompleteim sure there are others what i have noticed is that the best content was put in a different medium to a lesser extent or omitted completely it is truly tragic when the overall idea and meaning that it was based upon gets omitted just because of a deadline to get financial return or because it is of little importance to the publisher if this continues then video games are forced to forego quality and will never evolve beyond to nothing more than a childs plaything publishers will continue to rush studios to dish out sub par games which must be really hard for them to do in all aspects video games have always inspired me if it also did for you then we have to take a a stand to protect the integrity and art that we see in them tldr if you care about a certain video game dont support it when it goes south
gaming,not_removed,the gaming community is very very large and yes with that comes the baggage of trolls and arrogant people but i believe the good portion of us that are passionate about gaming are able to find the reasons within their faults i dont have single clue of what it is like to be part of a gaming studio but i understand that they cant control everything games require a large budget and the only way to do that is to satisfy those their investors which is understandable but it has just turn so onesided now that so much of the vision becomes lost if anything this is just an effort to spread the word about the state of video games
gaming,not_removed,by far most of us are decent people but really this entire issue in the end absolutely does come down to the gamers corporations are amoral and have one goal and that is profit this makes every single one predictable because they simply arent going to do what isnt best for their bottom line mass effect andromeda should have been delayed i think even the most hardcore fans of the franchise that are honest would agree to that a small delay to fix the issues it obviously has but the reason why ea isnt going to do that is because investors wouldnt take kindly and lose faith relying on marketing and the franchises name recognition they knew it would sell well despite that what i am saying is obvious i know there is no doubt that you know this yet look how many gamers got caught off guard despite this being a common theme in the industry this industry practice will continue as long as its accepted by enough gamers to justify it and make it profitable lets take a look in the past on something else that was ridiculous remember oblivions horse armor dlc it was mocked and ridiculed for what it provided bethesda even admitted it was a mistake down the road this actually helped set a standard for dlc atleast one that was higher but over time that eroded to less and less to now the problem is actually worse atleast horse armor had a functional purpose in game nowadays how many items are purely cosmetic being sold how can we blame the publishers from doing exactly what any corporation is expected to do when gamers continuously in large enough numbers make such acts acceptable by lowering standards ultimately the problem lies within our community and we are powerless to stop it we cant control other consumers its illogical to get upset at publishers for doing the most minimal amount of work for the largest profits you and i may keep our standards and find ourselves buying less and less games and perhaps someday stop altogether but clearly there is a very profitable path without our business many will accept it outright and increasingly more and more will grow to accept it we live in a world now where if horse armor dlc was released today no one would bat a eye
gaming,not_removed,had to turn it off after like seconds sorry
gaming,not_removed,best for coop i got some great memories from this one playing coop with my best friend
gaming,not_removed,this was awesome along with champions of norath untold thousands of hours were spent by yours truly playing this furthermore this is probably one of the contributing factors to my fatness as i ate like a disgusting pig while hacking and slashing the fuck out of some monsters etc
gaming,not_removed,i used to play this with my dad when i was really young no idea what the story was but best game i played as a youngling on the
gaming,not_removed,didnt play the first one much but its sequel is possibly my favourite game of all time easily got on a single character
gaming,not_removed,this game was so good i remember playing with my cousin and duping the gear i had i think you had to drop your gear get another party member to pick it up and then reload your character with the gear again something like that anyway
gaming,not_removed,dude this game was fucking awesome and so was the one
gaming,not_removed,swords axes bows we have everything you need right here
gaming,not_removed,i remember loving the graphics in this game based on the wake you leave when running through the water pretty good effects for its time
gaming,not_removed,oh my yes cooped the shit out of this one with my sister
gaming,not_removed,yes
gaming,not_removed,i grew up playing that game on the my older brother and i would bust work for hours in that game
gaming,not_removed,used to hell i still am i play through it with a friend every year consistently our favorite game since childhood
gaming,not_removed,i used to play this for hours a day especially in coop
gaming,not_removed,this game was the greatest to play with my brothers i almost bought a to play it but it costs more than the itself
gaming,not_removed,anybody else remember the coop item duplication exploit
gaming,not_removed,its in my right now
gaming,not_removed,oh man i didnt even remember this game til this post couldnt you play as drizzt after you beat the game
gaming,not_removed,ill avenge yee
gaming,not_removed,excellent gamei have fond memories playing it with my son back in the day i loved that it had a beholder as one of the bosses
gaming,not_removed,still have it my brother and i put a lot of hours on this when we were younger and we bought it again about years ago to play again only thing i dislike i the jump mechanic
gaming,not_removed,the amount of hours my friend and i put into this series first game we got stuck on hard mode at the floating eyeball fight no recalls minimal pots and arrows took hours good times
gaming,not_removed,that was an awesome game
gaming,not_removed,i absolutely love this game and its sequel i remember finishing as a kid and being so excited for the to come out only to learn that it would never happen
gaming,not_removed,playing drizzt was such a good cheat it wasnt enough in shadows of amn just to fight him
gaming,not_removed,i remember parents out of town first year of college a twelve pack and a friend of mine making it through almost half the game in one sitting that shit was the tits
gaming,not_removed,i loved the sequel
gaming,not_removed,id love to see another made the feeling of conda hasnt really been replicated well imo
gaming,not_removed,i used to play with my ex all the time i miss this
gaming,not_removed,yessssss loved this game with a passion the second one kind of sucked but champions of norrath was dope
gaming,not_removed,id love a remaster
gaming,not_removed,what a great series
gaming,not_removed,played it on game cube and game boy advance this game allowed you to load a second player into the game from a saved player file allowing you to duplicate your items or just sell them and transfer money to create an unlimited supply of cash anyone else find this little loop hole
gaming,not_removed,the game was a commercial success selling over one million units across playstation xbox and gamecube guess a bunch of people did
gaming,not_removed,this was my fav game i played it on gamecube for years with my best friend brother etc so much fun co op was the most fun cause you had to fight all the monkeys but you didnt want to do it alone
gaming,not_removed,i know right i used to spend hour after hour playing this with my bro i always used to get annoyed because hed never let me choose the dwarf guy
gaming,not_removed,champions of norrath was amazing too i miss those games so much
gaming,not_removed,dude i loved champions of norath i never see anyone on this sub mention it
gaming,not_removed,yeh its defo one of my favourite games for the i really hope one day theyll remaster it or even release a one
gaming,not_removed,if you need something to split someones skull or a helm to protect your own youve come to the right place
gaming,not_removed,i will never forget this line
gaming,not_removed,lol i spent so much time running circles in water while my partner got killed
gaming,not_removed,so youre saying you would love for ana conda to be released heh at least i made myself laugh
gaming,not_removed,what a fool unless you mean he always chose the dwarf the dwarf was best for coop cause he could carry everything for the group
gaming,not_removed,whoa friend i think the smell of the sewers has taking a liking to you
gaming,not_removed,costco is legit you need to be a member though to buy it iirc
gaming,not_removed,its from costco so i dont see any reason why it wouldnt be a legitimate deal i got my xl xenoblade chronicles monster hunter and a case for the ds for just over at fred meyer earlier this year i used a coupon from the ad and my associate discount which i believe that only accounts for so it wouldve been about for everything i got without my associate discount
gaming,not_removed,there is just a surcharge if you buy it from the website but i would save like bucks from this deal so i have no idea how they turn a profit
gaming,not_removed,enjoying yours so far
gaming,not_removed,yeah i was playing various games on my ds since i got it and pretty much all my free time has been playing monster hunter generations since that released
gaming,not_removed,you certainly can use two graphics cards though your power supply may not be powerful enough to run both cards simultaneously theres no point in doing this though the is more than powerful enough to handle two displays so unless you plan on running multiple games or have another gpu specific task you need to run on the other monitor its just going to make things more complicated especially with driver support i assume you mean monitor and no theres no issue running two monitors with different resolutions
gaming,not_removed,anything is possible
gaming,not_removed,yes
gaming,not_removed,yes very easily most operation systems since support multiple monitors on whatever graphic cards easily set up some games also easily do but there things get trickier with modern graphic cards extra power consumption can be problematic just needs a power converter that costs usd more and you will consume more energy
gaming,not_removed,thanks dude ill see what my power supply is if you check the old monitor i have its a weird resolution its x but that would still work good next to a monitor from what you said so i should just take out the gtx then
gaming,not_removed,you give me motivation sir
gaming,not_removed,i would yeah keep it as a backuptest card
gaming,not_removed,iconic npc here definitely yes
gaming,not_removed,no but i wonder when someone will post a video of them smashing someone on rocket league and i realize the victim is me
gaming,not_removed,well saw myself dying few times in some arma exile vids it was game life changing experience
gaming,not_removed,i think someone will post me on the otherside of the killcam as the killer since i get semi constant wallhack claims which i dont blame them for i hit ppl through walls apparently i have penetrated walls and a barricade with single tap that hit rook on the head etc im just waiting
gaming,not_removed,wow thanks for doing this i was wondering what it meant
gaming,not_removed,youre welcome i came across it straight away and after a while decided to see what it actually meant im super enjoying trying to figure out the story of the turing test and im not even half way through but theres already a lot to take in
gaming,not_removed,ahh i had just finished it the story in the latter half is great if youve been enjoying it so far you wont be disappointed make sure to do those restricted areas you see sometimes since they have a lot of good story stuff at the end
gaming,not_removed,i was just wondering do you have an idea on how i could spread this post because i feel it would be something that fans of the game would like to know
gaming,not_removed,i guess the steam forums for the game would probably be the most active place i havent really seen much discussion about the game anywhere on reddit which is a little strange by the way let me know what you think once you finish it
gaming,not_removed,here we go again
gaming,not_removed,it got worse after united offensive that was its peak
gaming,not_removed,i remember when medal of honour was better than cod and i thought it would get better but never did i see a similarity with this

gaming,not_removed,thepruld goes through the effort of watermarking every scene in that video and people decide to just place another bigger more prominent watermark over the video
gaming,not_removed,my mind went to this song httpsyoutubedidrbfazk

gaming,not_removed,this brings a smile to my face you should of post this in raww too
gaming,not_removed,cant stop watching
gaming,not_removed,an accurate representation of our pathfinder campaign
gaming,not_removed,i was listening to mephistopheles of las angeles by marilyn manson and this gif fit the beat so perfect
gaming,not_removed,am listening to the gorillaz on melancholy hill went perfict to this
gaming,not_removed,yep but probably not the same music you hear since the characters dont really fit i dont get this
gaming,not_removed,prulds animations truly are amazing i felt like i was watching the original just dark soulified
gaming,not_removed,holy shit i lost it at the blacksmith
gaming,not_removed,i just got braces and its so painful to laugh but im laughing anyway 😂
gaming,not_removed,thepruld is genius
gaming,not_removed,this is now my official go to when people ask me about the weirdest thing ive seen online
gaming,not_removed,like times better holy shit
gaming,not_removed,its a dark souls copy of
gaming,not_removed,omg amazing thanks
gaming,not_removed,thanks for that
gaming,not_removed,this gives me life
gaming,not_removed,holy crap that video is hilarious lolol
gaming,not_removed,thank you for this
gaming,not_removed,ah dapper sword spinnin ghoul will always make me smile in days of darkness
gaming,not_removed,omgthat was amazing
gaming,not_removed,i cant stop smiling
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,storywise the doggo inherits the sword and actually uses it in battle
gaming,not_removed,the player eventually fights the wolf
gaming,not_removed,dude thanks ive seen the ds version like times and the original gives it context that makes it at least times better
gaming,not_removed,im actually pretty positive pruld based it on this even crazier version
gaming,not_removed,original vid
gaming,not_removed,this the kinda bon fire i want to go to
gaming,not_removed,the video is better than the gif
gaming,not_removed,same here make your weapon bigger
gaming,not_removed,ting ting ting
gaming,not_removed,based on the one performance artist who attached a pole to hislower hips and slammed it against another metal pole again and again and again that was the whole art exhibit im not going to justify calling this art by trying to find the link
gaming,not_removed,he is amazing
gaming,not_removed,honestly though setting up an animation and music video like this takes at least some level of genius
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,wow your virgin mind is so untainted
gaming,not_removed,haha
gaming,not_removed,just got here to post this video juan was faster
gaming,not_removed,doggo also will fight with you against big monsters
gaming,not_removed,im actually pretty positive id say he based it off that version
gaming,not_removed,absolutely thank you for showing us the grossly incandescent light
gaming,not_removed,duuuude this throws me back use to watch him and silentwulf back in the day
gaming,not_removed,wait does he really or is that just a joke played through all of and never saw this now i am curious
gaming,not_removed,yeah for a while
gaming,not_removed,yeah but i didnt want to come off like a total dick lol
gaming,not_removed,truly the brightest
gaming,not_removed,dlc
gaming,not_removed,yeah durring the manus fight you can summon sif to help you
gaming,not_removed,i have all the dlc
gaming,not_removed,well shit i guess i will need to look into how to do that my next playthrough
gaming,not_removed,in the cavern of the abyss theres a point where a ghost of the wolf will lead you to a hidden wall at behind which you find the him cowering beneath a force field release him and you can summon him during the manus boss battle literally during the boss battle which is really frustrating as you have to wait until the boss is finishing off some power move to get to the summon sign and activate it
gaming,not_removed,just make sure you dont fight him before you do the expansion then go and fight him after he helps you trust me its worth it
gaming,not_removed,yea but its so satisfying that you have to kill sif to beat the game is one of the biggest flaws in my heart will go on plays in the background to summon her to defeat the lord of the abyss whom sif fought with her original master before he was consumed by the abyss finishing both their missions and setting her soul free is kreygasm lore wise imo
gaming,not_removed,lol your bad
gaming,not_removed,the covenant of artorias should have been a a reward from the forest covenant as well as from sif or at least available for purchase from shiva of the east only if you havent engaged sif at that point lorewise it makes sense as the whole point of the forest covenant was to protect invaders looking to kill sif
gaming,not_removed,wrong sub
gaming,not_removed,i added the link directly in rgaming while i was on the subreddit the original thread is there
gaming,not_removed,logitechs is fantastic wireswireless long battery life amazing sound qualityclarity optional sidetone such an amazing headset had mine for almost years now and it still works like its brand new havent used a better headset since it doesnt have the flashy style of the razers but who cares if your headset has flashy lights and lots of buttons
gaming,not_removed,sidebar follow reddits rules of promotion this is not the place to spam your channel or stream no referral affiliate andor survey links
gaming,not_removed,civilization is always on sale for like for all the dlc works pretty well on my surface pro and will easily kill not hours but weeks of your life if you enjoy it its the epitome of oh shit its already am in game form its definitely considered to trump civilization beyond earth and civilization is coming out this year so if you like it you could consider upgrading to the newest version once it does worst case youre out edit
gaming,not_removed,citiesskyline is great but not sure what specs it requires
gaming,not_removed,hmm good idea i never played that one when it came out and since it is old it should be snappy at that price it is worth a try
gaming,not_removed,the trailer looks interesting if someone else can comment on the specs i may give it a try
gaming,not_removed,when loading up a conquest game a whiteboard pic would quickly flash once or twice i finally caught it
gaming,not_removed,i used to have one of these back in the day i think it could hold a whopping one or two saves even
gaming,not_removed,i still have one
gaming,not_removed,i had this
gaming,not_removed,i had one of those
gaming,not_removed,haha it even has the nip
gaming,not_removed,hah my mom got me this memory card had all my mgs saves on it her nose eventually broke off
gaming,not_removed,i had that when i was younger
gaming,not_removed,yeah i dont see it saving much on it just save all your tomb raider game saves
gaming,not_removed,standard fifteen slots or were you trying to be a smart ass
gaming,not_removed,samesies
gaming,not_removed,cool find though
gaming,not_removed,smart ass here
gaming,not_removed,cool just checking
gaming,not_removed,roses are red violets are blue the titles in english so the video should be too ﻿
gaming,not_removed,i loved it as a child d and i read and a half year ago players tried to revive the game with a petition httpswwwchangeorgpnickelodeonactivateavatarlegendsofthearenaservers but failed of course as a child i thought i am such a progamer in this game d
gaming,not_removed,sorry pictures are everything d you can of course search for a english one too p
gaming,not_removed,it would deff be amazing if done right id also like to see a hbonetflix series over mass effect but the cost would be absolutely ridiculous so i know itll never happen bioshock is much more achieveable
gaming,not_removed,i would love to see a series following a cast during the events that lead to the fall of rapture possibly following that up with the events of bioshock
gaming,not_removed,movies and shows based off games are almost always horrible so no
gaming,not_removed,i dont want a tv show or movie but i do want a new game
gaming,not_removed,i would rather immerse myself in the game and experience the events for myself than watch some actors muck about why is there so much desire to take an interactive media and convert it to a boring time suck
gaming,not_removed,i would apperciate a saints tow series
gaming,not_removed,the only game where deer beats dinosaur
gaming,not_removed,lol i gotta check this out sometime
gaming,not_removed,teleporting as in lagging or cheating and actually teleporting somewhere else
gaming,not_removed,i was literally just playing it it was mostly fine for me ping was about as well my game was playing fps and i only have a graphics card
gaming,not_removed,sounds like youre getting hella packet loss playing on wifi
gaming,not_removed,i get about ping on pc runs fine for me
gaming,not_removed,lagging everybody its almost unplayable you cannot aim at somebody with no lead time does anybody else experience this im on a surface pro this thing plays dark souls it can handle
gaming,not_removed,yes wifi no ethernet connection on my surface pro would a usb ethernet connector help
gaming,not_removed,most are saying its the connection itself wifi apparently there are known issues with the wifi on surface pro specifically a connection ill post if i get it figured out
gaming,not_removed,its not your pc its the connection are you on wifi
gaming,not_removed,but out of curiousity what is your framerate on the surface pro using intel iris graphics
gaming,not_removed,possibly wifi can be pretty bad for gaming it might be something else but its certainly worth investigating
gaming,not_removed,yeah do that its most likely a wifi issue
gaming,not_removed,yes is that it i have a very fast internet speed and its currently showing a connection speed of mbps shouldnt i not have lag im hearing its packet loss
gaming,not_removed,couldnt tell ya but i rarely get slowdown on dark souls
gaming,not_removed,the speed of your internet is irrelevant youre having latency issues which is common on wifi put very simply the wifi connection is not as good as a direct cable for our purposes lets call it poor signal this causes all the stuttering so you might be getting but in erratic bursts gaming doesnt actually use much data try plugging in directly
gaming,not_removed,yeah i bought a usb to ethernet adapter today problem solved thanks everybody for the help
gaming,not_removed,happy fragging
gaming,not_removed,i dont understand the damage for aircraft jumped into fighter emptied full clip into enemy not dead get hit a few times myself and dead
gaming,not_removed,this just in company against free market competition more at
gaming,not_removed,manufacturers have strong concerns about independent service providers who may take risks or cut corners leaving themselves or consumers in danger if they perform service without the proper training or safety standards like truning your xbox into a bomb because you forgot to wind that screw one more turn seriously that is the argument these guys are cheesy as fuck and dont even hide it
gaming,not_removed,remember when they just worked
gaming,not_removed,pc all the way then fix your issues yourself
gaming,not_removed,get a pc problem solved
gaming,not_removed,remember when you just gave them a hard slap and they worked
gaming,not_removed,ahh the ol percussive maintenance
gaming,not_removed,after about years maybe
gaming,not_removed,it was fukt fixed under kinetic testing
gaming,not_removed,its the original fucking havelyn﻿
gaming,not_removed,detroit metal city is a great anime but i dont know why youre submitting it on this sub
gaming,not_removed,to be fair thats probably only one game
gaming,not_removed,who the fuck puts on hours in a game and then say its horrible
gaming,not_removed,the guy probably doesnt have the time to write a longer review
gaming,not_removed,thats days of game time
gaming,not_removed,so the amount of hours youve played with the game holds weight for your review i never knew that
gaming,not_removed,it ok
gaming,not_removed,great post
gaming,not_removed,steam name checks out
gaming,not_removed,baba is a great streamer too yall should go watch him on the other hand however im really worried about civ after having watched a few streams whoever designed the interfaces menus and map needs to be taken out behind the stables
gaming,not_removed,sometimes thats all we want to know
gaming,not_removed,the sad thing is review sites probably only play games for hours so his okay is more trusted than what any paid reviewer can tell you
gaming,not_removed,this game is honestly the worst and by worst i mean best i got the game days ago and ive logged hours somehow i had to uninstall it to make myself study the game is so addicting and time consuming and ridiculously fun on hard difficulties
gaming,not_removed,baba yetu yetu uliye mbinguni yetu yetu amina baba yetu yetu uliye m jina lako e litukuzwe utupe leo chakula chetu tunachohitaji utusamehe makosa yetu hey kama nasi tunavyowasamehe waliotukosea usitutie katika majaribu lakini utuokoe na yule muovu e milele ufalme wako ufike utakalo lifanyike duniani kama mbinguni amina
gaming,not_removed,never understood why people like this game so much to me it felt very boring nothing to do but build units and attack a city and wait for a technology to finish researching
gaming,not_removed,sorry for the i dont get how some people have so much time to play and someone can play a game for so many hours and leave a review like this is beyond my imagination
gaming,not_removed,if theres one thing i dislike more than joke steam reviews its those reviews that just explain what the person did while they were playing i already know what the game is im looking for if its fun or not i dont care to read your bullet pointed list of you fucking around
gaming,not_removed,let me tell you a story folks how i became the ruler of the world by accident if trump becomes president
gaming,not_removed,that gamer committed a sin all gamers know that civilization v is not just okay it is amazing
gaming,not_removed,marathon some say he is still playing to this day
gaming,not_removed,someone who thinks leaving a bad review is gonna add things to the game that they want
gaming,not_removed,an idiot
gaming,not_removed,well ai turns do take a while sometimes
gaming,not_removed,for context civ v came out about this time in assuming this screenshot is current and the player bought it around release the player spent roughly of their time since then playing civ or leaving it running assuming the average person spends of their life asleep and the player does too they spent of their waking hours playing civ in the last years thats four hours per day on average all assuming the game was not left running unattended edit would like to note that its likely the image isnt currentwhich would make for more astounding numbers
gaming,not_removed,realistically it does why would you play a game that is just okay for like hours
gaming,not_removed,from civ
gaming,not_removed,some folks like a slow paced game some folks use games as a way to relax and well a nice rush can do that sometimes some nice slow and predictable game where you have a lot of control over your world and environment without the constraint of time can be a big boost it lets you make things as perfect as you want its basically a entry level bureaucrat simulator if you like keeping things well organised well fighting some slight entropy if that makes you feel good its a good game
gaming,not_removed,different strokes civilization is the granddaddy of the strategy genre if you dont like it theres a whole slew of similar games you can probably cross off your list of things to try
gaming,not_removed,pretty sure other people would say the same to the games you like people like what they like what is there to understand
gaming,not_removed,not every one enjoys being high octane slayers on the latest call of duty™ franchise game that came out this year
gaming,not_removed,me too i tried civ v for many times but even after testing modes story sandbox different civilizations the game didnt grew on me
gaming,not_removed,i really liked civ but i cannot at all enjoy i think it has to do with the interface being slow sluggish and obsessively large compared to which was rather snappy also i cant culture bomb other civs by placing a great artist in a new city that i stuck right next to their borders
gaming,not_removed,play a higher difficulty you arent waiting for anything and units taking a city is impossible
gaming,not_removed,thats one of the reasons i wanted to post this many people do not like this game yet the overall review is overwhelmingly positive at
gaming,not_removed,student sense of humour
gaming,not_removed,someone with a name derived from southpark doesnt get humor wut
gaming,not_removed,i wouldnt be surprised if a decent amount of those hours clocked up were civ v running in the background while he was afkdoing workother things
gaming,not_removed,im a full time caretaker there is a lot of time when the old man doesnt need help but i cant just leave the house this is how i have gamerscore
gaming,not_removed,he is one of the best civ streamers on twitch that is his job sort of
gaming,not_removed,have you ever heard of the word sarcasm
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,plot twist that guy is the ai
gaming,not_removed,the review was from september so its pretty recent
gaming,not_removed,theres also a possibility that its a shared account
gaming,not_removed,woosh
gaming,not_removed,well an alright experience for hours is worth a lot more than the low cost of the fame much better than a great game for thatll last hours tops
gaming,not_removed,thats about hour days days a week for years
gaming,not_removed,many people dont like the game but many more loved it its a very popular game from a very popular series it shouldnt be surprising it has a lot of good reviews yes its far from perfect just wanted to say that a lot of people love civ
gaming,not_removed,or he just leaves the game running on his pc
gaming,not_removed,there is no way a student can play for so many hours i barely get hours per day for entertainment after so much homework and projects and stuff and i did not take humor into account maybe because so many games have a top review like this with the game having been played hours
gaming,not_removed,hes moved up into the new version
gaming,not_removed,ah true
gaming,not_removed,there is no s in reammachine comment
gaming,not_removed,the dude streams multiplayer games like hours a day
gaming,not_removed,i have two degrees i played wow hardcore for of those years as an undergrad basically played hours a day for days a week and had plenty of time to play and be a student
gaming,not_removed,i spent more time playing wow than in class while i was in college still passed
gaming,not_removed,maybe the more important question is why do you care
gaming,not_removed,youre a very dull person to go this deep analyzing this
gaming,not_removed,neat
gaming,not_removed,did it end up like there too that was awesome convergent art
gaming,not_removed,hmm i was unaware he was a streamer my bad
gaming,not_removed,as a grad student what is free time
gaming,not_removed,oh i meant as a joke like it was this guy with hours like it looks like he moved on from that civ but if anyone knows if that guy doing civ did i would be interested
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,his civ ii game mirrored george orwells novel very closely or at least what the citizens are told i think theres a thread about it in the original post
gaming,not_removed,why does it use the game of thrones theme
gaming,not_removed,how is the game of thrones theme giving a vibe there are so many other songs lol
gaming,not_removed,downvote this shitrepost he is not even the artist and tries to get credit for someones work original here
gaming,not_removed,its simplicity makes me want to play it
gaming,not_removed,green one looks awesome
gaming,not_removed,it looks good
gaming,not_removed,i like the right style the most its darker and the others look too happy
gaming,not_removed,you suck
gaming,not_removed,im really bored to see of indiegame with graphic thats why i will cheer you on you doing a great job and im sure your game will be greatful sry for bad eng
gaming,not_removed,looks really nice
gaming,not_removed,i like it my only concern is that the water texture looks a bit flat and out of place among some colour schemes it looks completely undisturbed while your character is supposedly in it too when it should maybe ripple a bit other than that trust your guts regarding the atmospheres the gradients and contrasts look great
gaming,not_removed,very pretty but those trees are a little sketchy
gaming,not_removed,looks killer i would go with the darker color scheme imo
gaming,not_removed,use all three at different stages post the game and tag me in one of the comments when you finish it pls
gaming,not_removed,i was about to say ive seen this before
gaming,not_removed,ive seen floppier disks
gaming,not_removed,backstory
gaming,not_removed,unfortunately thats only the shareware version full version was diskettes still an amazing find though
gaming,not_removed,i remember downloading this off a bbs such a great time
gaming,not_removed,httpimgurcommoprntj
gaming,not_removed,i remember buying doom for in dollars new from hastings but eventually returning it because my was not capable of handling it
gaming,not_removed,floppy disk that are from
gaming,not_removed,business is cutting people and someone was about to throw this away while cleaning out another desk sorry for the vague response
gaming,not_removed,that would of been sweet i really just want to know if they still work
gaming,not_removed,you dont have a working floppy drive
gaming,not_removed,i think i left it in my time machine
gaming,not_removed,make it yourself
gaming,not_removed,everyone report this video its been stolen by this douchebags channel original video here
gaming,not_removed,just posting a video from the tube bruh you need tah chill bruh
gaming,not_removed,not reporting you i meant reporting the youtubers channel
gaming,not_removed,tryna fuck up my karma
gaming,not_removed,i dont really care
gaming,not_removed,oh okay me neither i love tool tho bro we cool nice tool tat
gaming,not_removed,lol sorry for blasting your post here but it just pisses me off when people steal someone elses youtube content
gaming,not_removed,lol me too thats annoying wish i found the original post before posting
gaming,not_removed,nice
gaming,not_removed,httpsyoutubehzppwinaiog bonus
gaming,not_removed,thought it was an iron maiden refrence
gaming,not_removed,dang you guys are getting snubbed for in this state
gaming,not_removed,yeah seems expensive
gaming,not_removed,well i mean regardless of how many heroes characters are in a game youll always see metas shift look at dota like a hundred or so heroes and youll see pretty reliably of the same heroes every game its obviously much more prevalent in a game with far fewer choices like ow but its definitely not a fault of a game as much as it is a common occurrence with metas
gaming,not_removed,this is completely untrue the only champs that dont see much competitive play are hanzo widowmaker and genji snipers for obvious reasons and genji because pros dont fall for deflect
gaming,not_removed,problem is there arent enough heroes to make a pickban phase work yet the same thing happened to almost all competitive teams had soldiers scouts medic demo whatever
gaming,not_removed,the first one
gaming,not_removed,what the fuck is all this
gaming,not_removed,i really wish this meme would die already
gaming,not_removed,the meme isnt even funny anymore its just sad the ape died and people are making a joke out of it
gaming,not_removed,its time to put my dick away
gaming,not_removed,just like he did
gaming,not_removed,remember when the shooting of harambe actually sparked discussion about the rights of animals now its been reduced to a meme that most people are finally starting to hate
gaming,not_removed,i feel like mobile gaming is having a bad influence on other platforms
gaming,not_removed,bandoliers all day every day
gaming,not_removed,the classic dilemma blonde brunette or redhead
gaming,not_removed,damn and here i am happily hitting random every time because im too lazy
gaming,not_removed,is that first pic princess fiona
gaming,not_removed,is top left princess fiona and then all her possible divergences
gaming,not_removed,so youre a fan of frowning i take it
gaming,not_removed,so a blonde a red head and a brunette walk into an rpg
gaming,not_removed,ack i do this too but i dont have slick graphic portraying it
gaming,not_removed,i see you too watched the powder puff girls
gaming,not_removed,this is awesome i never reuse a character in another game but i may have to try now
gaming,not_removed,thats a lot of play throughs
gaming,not_removed,i do the same with my rpgs create a character and always have them with the same or similar characteristics across gameswith tweaks to fit the respective games system since not every rpg is the same of course it also means i spend a decent amount of time making the face if the game has customization then again customizing the face is pretty much half the fun of the rpg
gaming,not_removed,its annoying that theres no khajit in the fallout universe you would think the radiation might make some type of genetic mutation possible for cats right
gaming,not_removed,you really missed daggerfall
gaming,not_removed,lol i always make my char as retarded looking as possible
gaming,not_removed,okay so im not the only one who does this
gaming,not_removed,neat i do the same thing except i dont mix game series
gaming,not_removed,im always happy to stumble across people who do this because ive always loved to link all my characters together over the span of bethesdaoblivion games ive got this little theory that elder scrolls is actually set far into the fallout series future fallout nirnroot easter egg made my day as you might imagine and that all the fantasy races and creatures are a result of heavy irradiation and crossbreeding silly but fun i had a sofia engelhaus in oblivion who was my skyrim toons grandmother and my fallout character picked up where skyrim left off centuries later retconned admittedly i didnt think of connecting them all until skyrim
gaming,not_removed,do they all get emoedgy midlife crisis
gaming,not_removed,blonde brunette and redhead check
gaming,not_removed,so the power puff girls
gaming,not_removed,would bang your character
gaming,not_removed,is every character just the default with different hair
gaming,not_removed,this post is pretty confusing when you say progressed what exactly do you mean
gaming,not_removed,dude thats an awesome idea which im totally going to steal would make a great youtube channel the same character in a series of games the adventures of jeffrey today its jeffrey in space tomorrow a desolate wasteland i like it too bad im too lazy to actually act on it
gaming,not_removed,im so confused
gaming,not_removed,are you autistic no offence of course
gaming,not_removed,in fallout they look like the same person
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,httpiimgurcomufejdzxjpg
gaming,not_removed,thats how you get the best characters for dark souls though
gaming,not_removed,damn and here i am installing character creators and realising i cant make a decent character and downloading a preset
gaming,not_removed,first pic of sonja makes her look like shes about to kick lord farquaads ass
gaming,not_removed,have to ask is it the same character in each game or just another incarnation
gaming,not_removed,new vegas isnt a bethesda title
gaming,not_removed,in sonjas row which armor is that in the skyrim picture i never saw that before
gaming,not_removed,not to sound weird but are you male or female i assume female with only female protagonist
gaming,not_removed,its more annoying how we dont get a ghoul option at least for nv since you werent raised in a vault youd think with the radiation perks where rads heal you theyd make it to where you ghoulify with each rank
gaming,not_removed,which one
gaming,not_removed,same the black leather even if you dont really sneak looks really cool with the od army fatigues i think the camo one is called military only thing i hate is that obnoxious leather undies piece for sturdy the sturdy bandoleer looks great with the thick addition on the chest but ugh no thanks for the leather diaper
gaming,not_removed,i used a rebreather and that sweet helmet to make a
gaming,not_removed,i am not familiar with them crooked vultures but they sound a lot like queens of the stone age thanks for introducing me to them edit just looked them up and it makes sense now because josh is doing the vocals and guitar and dave grohl is in this band i am surprised now that i am not familiar with them
gaming,not_removed,yeah anything i try to create something myself in souls games it ends up looking deformed
gaming,not_removed,i love that in new vegas her casual outfit is the exact same
gaming,not_removed,thats how the ancient nordnord hero armour looks on females
gaming,not_removed,thats a dumb assumption
gaming,not_removed,probably a balance decision id say as being immune to rads from the start would be pretty op
gaming,not_removed,haha was just hoping to see a daggerfall pic would have been a good laugh you should go install it just to see what your character would look like i downloaded it on dial up in the it was
gaming,not_removed,im not picky
gaming,not_removed,the xboxdvr its really simple to record on xbox open up the dvr app and you can set it to record for a certain amount of time not too sure about editing though
gaming,not_removed,isnt that the desired outcome
gaming,not_removed,isnt it obviously your oblivion character couldnt exist in fallout as the same person but its entirely possible to play a character who was alive during the oblivion crisis and the skyrim civil war aldmer live for centuries sometimes millennia depending on certain sources mages tend to also have longer lifespans and certain conditions bring about immortality vampirism lichdom apotheosis etc in morrowind you meet a character whos years old and you meet a character from morrowind in one of the skyrim dlcs
gaming,not_removed,either they belong to the school of thought that bethesda is the better game developer in which case they should distance themselves from new vegas or or wait i cant think of any reason why someone would want to give bethesda credit for new vegas either way if you like new vegas you should buy obsidian games not bethesda ones
gaming,not_removed,what is dahlia skyrim wearing
gaming,not_removed,i assume anyone who plays as a girl is either a girl or making the one they cant get in real life ive never met a man who truly was ok with women in real life playing as one its my paper topic in online cultural anthropology
gaming,not_removed,i can understand that id have just made it to where it doesnt affect you as much like you have a natural resistance like a permanent radx
gaming,not_removed,thered be some pretty hefty drawbacks though every npc disposition aside from other ghouls could be lowered to health regen cut in half due to decaying skin
gaming,not_removed,no way the real first boss is creating a vaguely humanlooking character without borrowing slider numbers from the internet note this is literally impossible in demons souls
gaming,not_removed,why shouldnt bethesda get credit for the game they created the engine all the ground work for the game and bethesda softworks funded the game they should get just as much of the credit obsidian couldnt have created the game without bethesda game studios and softworks
gaming,not_removed,or wait i cant think of any reason why someone would want to give bethesda credit for new vegas except for the engine and the ip and of the actual models for items in the game and the contract and the funding and
gaming,not_removed,maybe make it so youre somehow in the process of turning
gaming,not_removed,i feel like they should get credit on the engine and honestly with the bugs you get in nv they can have the credit but unless they actively had a part in development of the story characters world etc they shouldnt for the actual game a lot of games use other games engines the important part is what they do with it obsidians writing is so good and i feel like everything in the game is just improved on from that they are completely different yet still obviously similar
gaming,not_removed,i mean the guys at obsidian were part of the original team that invented the fallout intellectual property so if you want to look at it like that none of them are bethesda games theyre all interplay
gaming,not_removed,oh yeah thats why it says its made by bethesda on the box
gaming,not_removed,thats what i was thinking like the radiation resistance perk maybe with every level you look more ghoulish until the last perk where the transformation is complete since the last perk is something like increasing levels of radiation restore health and heal broken limbs
gaming,not_removed,i feel this is maybe a nod at a new bully game remember the teen wolf easter egg behind the school football field
gaming,not_removed,i was one of the persons who assisted in finding this basically were just abunch of people over at rchiliadmystery trying to solve the gta v mysterys this was one of them ama
gaming,not_removed,will we ever truly know
gaming,not_removed,the answer to the chiliad mystery were very close
gaming,not_removed,thats gay
gaming,not_removed,who fucking cares seriously theyre digital people why do people get into such a fit about this shit
gaming,not_removed,i just wont play as a character if i dont like them
gaming,not_removed,i feel like taric is lonely
gaming,not_removed,i personally care about the skills and runes of the character more i dont think the storylines or other features that is not so important to gameplay would effect the game much
gaming,not_removed,theyre all fantasy creatures anyway i wouldnt mind if they were a little more fabulous
gaming,not_removed,gaming is for any brain is what i would say
gaming,not_removed,i dont think anybody would give a shit if someone is gay it doesnt matter
gaming,not_removed,dont do it just to diversify a roster do it because that character manes more sense to be gay than straight due to personality quirks
gaming,not_removed,who gives a shit theyre not real people
gaming,not_removed,what does their kit do just like in real life it really only matters what they do and not what they like
gaming,not_removed,while its true that the character mechanics matter most riot could add an lgbt character if they do and they arent pushing an agenda either way thats fine obviously some players would be angry and some happy
gaming,not_removed,i dont even know what i just watched
gaming,not_removed,halo combat evolved is a great game
gaming,not_removed,looks like a guy using some simple geometry
gaming,not_removed,sorry if wrong place to post
gaming,not_removed,story of my life lol
gaming,not_removed,i laughed when i saw this if you put another one on ur other wrist you could be baracka from mortal kombat lol
gaming,not_removed,i am god even though im a man of god
gaming,not_removed,that tape is going to hurt like hell when its taken off
gaming,not_removed,doubt it that tape doesnt look too strong its not like he duct taped it on there
gaming,not_removed,rotr
gaming,not_removed,make a group bra
gaming,not_removed,you know a subreddit
gaming,not_removed,i would absolutely love a remake i just want to jam a ton of buttons in the air and land something insane
gaming,not_removed,also dont let activision be the publisher that would be a great start
gaming,not_removed,we especially need more tony hawks
gaming,not_removed,tony hawk is now years old you want to make the games not suck find a pro skateboarder whos still in touch with the average gaming set ohnone of them have name recognition anymore because nobody cares about skateboarding since its not the maybe just take tony hawks name off the product and make a generic skateboarding game branding is very important in skating yet you still want the game to be attached to a skater whos over the hill
gaming,not_removed,bam offline freeplay with simple controlsitd be an openworld game outside of the comps you dont have to give a shit
gaming,not_removed,activision can publish but ea canada develops
gaming,not_removed,thats what skate was and it took a while to outsell the name on the product doesnt matter see madden sid meiers tiger woods until he retired plus he landed a a few days ago hes still got it
gaming,not_removed,no anything that activision touches goes to shit i will never forget that abomination called tony hawk pro skater a piece of turt so bad it literally destroyed the name tony hawk
gaming,not_removed,what a shitty article it might as well be titled play the game as its meant to be played
gaming,not_removed,this would kill on roverwatch
gaming,not_removed,the b in blackhole stands for beta
gaming,not_removed,that was a meat grinder
gaming,not_removed,thats kind of like one of those holes in puttputt golf just look on the other side of the bunker and horsey should be there
gaming,not_removed,looks like a zaku with a rifle
gaming,not_removed,lol why do you even care
gaming,not_removed,its a fake documentary
gaming,not_removed,i just dont understand why would gamers break in to an office to play this sound crazy
gaming,not_removed,wait till you try to buy the freemium cars
gaming,not_removed,mmmm been out for a while not a fan of it myself way to much dlc they want you to buy wasnt a fan of the driving or menus but hey enjoy if it floats your boat but check out forza horizon or or dirt rally
gaming,not_removed,i never liked mannequins anyway
gaming,not_removed,keep your content and apps in your own cloud
gaming,not_removed,it will only accommodate single slot cards and theyll have to be short given the lack of clearance between the psu and drive bays it also has a weird form factor for its psu that will be difficult to upgrade its a pretty bad buy for gaming
gaming,not_removed,but can i upgrade it easily
gaming,not_removed,no its got a power supply similar to a laptop theres no room for any kind of video card that would be worth upgrading to i guess it depends on what you want to upgrade it to a media server sure a gaming machine not likely
gaming,not_removed,gaming was the hope just checking all of my options thanks
gaming,not_removed,do some research for the you were willing to pay for that you can get a good start on a great system if you buy parts from newegg or the likes and build it yourself
gaming,not_removed,softethernet free easy to use
gaming,not_removed,if your home in the us has a pc you wouldnt need to buy another router otherwise some routers support a vpn doesnt have to be openvpn i have a router hosting its own vpn for a couple of things
gaming,not_removed,softethernet interesting have never heard of this but will try this out
gaming,not_removed,thank you this may be the best option and perhaps easiest ive done a google search and it seems like my current router the netgear nighthawk does support it it does have a checkmark on the vpn support option in amazon would it be correct to assume the guide below would be my solution
gaming,not_removed,i have the nighthawk but i dont use that method although im sure it works i open port and forward it to the vpn host on my internal network in my case thats another router i happened to have also because i want multiple devices to be able to connect simultaneously but you can setup windows to act as a server for a single incoming vpn connection it depends on your setup and needs
gaming,not_removed,vaulttec approves of this post
gaming,not_removed,great job
gaming,not_removed,cooooooool
gaming,not_removed,start a kickstarter or vc or something to solve this problem let the developers to work at their own pace and make the greatest game possible and go from there right thats what indie devs have been doing for years
gaming,not_removed,unfortunately lots of devs use kickstarter and still pump out unfinished garbage or in some cases dont release a finished game at all due to the freedom and poor managementplanning
gaming,not_removed,still a different game from
gaming,not_removed,them be fighting words we should resolve this with a war which i guess both sides are well suited to carry on
gaming,not_removed,boooooo boooo on you sir lol
gaming,not_removed,the action in is really varied you can see something youve never seen before in every game
gaming,not_removed,wrong its a different game not really better not really worse
gaming,not_removed,whoah dont be bashing
gaming,not_removed,you my friend understand something many dont you can have different types of fps games and have different opinions about those types
gaming,not_removed,hahah yeah
gaming,not_removed,what no he didnt thats a decal and you got it from etsy
gaming,not_removed,rquityourbullshit
gaming,not_removed,thats pretty cool op my boy drew the other day its not much but im still proud of him
gaming,not_removed,why posts like this where ops steal the art from someone without giving credit at all and pretending they made it arent instabanned i see a tons of those everyday and no one seems to care
gaming,not_removed,thats a sticker you can tell because of how completely it covers the apple
gaming,not_removed,my kid drew in art class i feel like its pretty badass
gaming,not_removed,pretty obvious that hes thrown an image in illustrator and image traced still cool though edit so is the original image
gaming,not_removed,lol no he didnt its a tracing
gaming,not_removed,you pretended to have drawn this you pretended to have a son you indirectly pretended to have a woman that would want to carry your child by pretending that you have a son
gaming,not_removed,isnt that a stickerdecal
gaming,not_removed,ugh no no he didnt
gaming,not_removed,how is this getting upvoted
gaming,not_removed,stenciled probably a repost willing to bet op doesnt even have a kid
gaming,not_removed,all bullshit aside it amazes me how many people still upvote some karma whores on this subreddit lol
gaming,not_removed,dang youre old enough to have a son who can draw that and your screen name is canthrusthillary its a pun about fucking the first female candidate for president son now get me my blankie im all tuckered out
gaming,not_removed,very good just pray its not the girl he has a crush on
gaming,not_removed,how the fuck do these things get to the front page come on sheeples
gaming,not_removed,pro tip the next time you put a sticker on your macbook make sure you completely cover the apple logo
gaming,not_removed,wow thats one cool drawing in the corner dont know why you took a picture of your mac though
gaming,not_removed,plot twist op is and his son is
gaming,not_removed,how much of a sad person do you have to be to lie about the creation of a picture but not even say you drew it i guess even in ops imagination hes talentless
gaming,not_removed,if i hadnt looked at the username i wouldve thought that this came from ugallowboob
gaming,not_removed,dont know if i should down vote because op is a scumbag liar or if i shoup up vote because he got busted i just wont vote and leave him to his fate
gaming,not_removed,now its more apparent that some redditors just post links for upvotes by putting the title my boygirlwife drew this so desperate
gaming,not_removed,are you the man and hes your boy
gaming,not_removed,looks like a preimperfect cell to me
gaming,not_removed,metroid had a baby with sonic and that baby had a baby with the mother alien
gaming,not_removed,i would say that its badass and makes me want to play the metroid series but you fucked up op jusy give credit where credit is due
gaming,not_removed,mah boiii
gaming,not_removed,wether or not he did it this would make a pretty bad ass minimalist mouse pad
gaming,not_removed,i want that etsy im on the way hang in there my friend
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,this is from metroid on game boy good times
gaming,not_removed,he is a good boy
gaming,not_removed,dat chozo
gaming,not_removed,if he really did draw that could he draw akuma from sf
gaming,not_removed,rthathappened
gaming,not_removed,i would like to think that its a picture of an intense bowling wind up
gaming,not_removed,am i the only one who thinks it looks like its dragging its butt across the carpet while holding the orb with its feet
gaming,not_removed,hell yeah metroid doesnt get enough love these days neither do i
gaming,not_removed,hell yeah metroid doesnt get enough love these days neither do i
gaming,not_removed,i feel so betrayed was ready to tell you how bad ass your kid was but instead fuck you you made me this way
gaming,not_removed,i read this in jack bakers voice for some reason
gaming,not_removed,glad to see metroid is still very relevant after nearly a decade
gaming,not_removed,well done
gaming,not_removed,ah those are the bird people
gaming,not_removed,i dont know why but i really want it to become a bomb and bomberman trying to grab it either way awesome
gaming,not_removed,my dad came up with a name for reddit pretty badass in my opinion
gaming,not_removed,ops son lied to him and someone is about to get an ass whoopinh
gaming,not_removed,reminds me of the chozos from metroid
gaming,not_removed,at first i thought it was some alien sitting and holding a bowling ball with its legs while its arms were stretched out in front i still have no idea what it is but at least i know its holding that ball with an arm
gaming,not_removed,as a huge metroid fanboy this makes me very happy in a few months after basic training im going to pay a artist buddy to draw samus without her helmet and the baby metroid hugging her shoulder cannot wait
gaming,not_removed,terrible liar karma whoring dad
gaming,not_removed,metroid i still to this day think super metroid is the best game i have ever ever played just listening to the soundtrack which is fucking dope still to this day gives me light shivers
gaming,not_removed,wow thats a great pharah well done
gaming,not_removed,is his name skinny penis
gaming,not_removed,from guacamelee
gaming,not_removed,whoaaahhhhhh jeez this blew up his response hahahaha thats hilarious i didnt hand draw it but i used an image from the internetz and pulled out some good lines to have it printable and workable with vinyl i would credit the image but i didnt have any transfer paper and the printercutter i was using was shitty so it took me way longer than it should have about an hour also im not sure that deviant art is the original image either the image i used was a drawing of that one and this is my first go at the sizing gotta mess around a bit to get it right tldr my friend messed with an image and transfered it to his macbook sent me a pic i dont have a son i didnt realize he didnt draw it or that in fact it was a sticker because im not artistic at all i posted it cuz i thought it looked cool thats all
gaming,not_removed,is it holding the ball with its hands or feet illusion
gaming,not_removed,tell your son i said amazing work never stop drawing
gaming,not_removed,thats excellent work
gaming,not_removed,i dont care who did it but this can be seen that its using its legs to hold the ball with the arms stretched to the floor or holding it with the arms and the legs flexed
gaming,not_removed,alien movie promo 👊🏽
gaming,not_removed,still wish they would have added one of these as a character in smash bros
gaming,not_removed,thats deep
gaming,not_removed,youve raised your boy right metroid for life
gaming,not_removed,supercool
gaming,not_removed,doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo dooooooooo
gaming,not_removed,my boy
gaming,not_removed,ah yeah i remember back in the day when i used to chill with my boy etsy drinkin a beer and talking about arts and crafts
gaming,not_removed,what if his boy got it from etsy and lied and now the guy is disappointed
gaming,not_removed,looks like we cant trust hillary or this guy
gaming,not_removed,yea op just casually let his son go to town on his macbook with a sharpie and it just so happened to be amazing
gaming,not_removed,lol posers
gaming,not_removed,you should edit your comment and remind people they can report posts maybe for not original content
gaming,not_removed,and it still has three times the karma you do this is whats wrong with mainstream reddit nobody is checking facts anymore s
gaming,not_removed,it looks like the ball is being held by the feet of this creature
gaming,not_removed,is the creatures hand holding the ball or is his foot somebody tell me
gaming,not_removed,this is the lamest attempt at bullshit ive ever seen i have to say
gaming,not_removed,thats neat and all but why did your son draw that woman without eyebrows
gaming,not_removed,haha as i was clicking i was thinking please be the mona lisa delivered
gaming,not_removed,is it the mona lisa its the mona lisa
gaming,not_removed,what are the odds of both of you having very skilled kids and exactly the same desk arrangement
gaming,not_removed,i know right but as soon as i do one as a joke i get instabanned and my computer bursts into flames
gaming,not_removed,and also because of how it is
gaming,not_removed,aww dont ruin it
gaming,not_removed,i want the guy who draws blunt man and chronic to sign it youre just a fucking tracer
gaming,not_removed,point is harsh but made me lol
gaming,not_removed,get rocked op
gaming,not_removed,im pretty sure he isnt pretending
gaming,not_removed,thats what i thought as well looks like its on the lid of a macbook
gaming,not_removed,yup adhesive vinyl
gaming,not_removed,cant you print stickers
gaming,not_removed,i barely post anything nor do i really care about fake internet points
gaming,not_removed,mind blown
gaming,not_removed,mate he traced an image from etsy though impeach him
gaming,not_removed,ah dude best game ever for real
gaming,not_removed,rnothingeverhappens
gaming,not_removed,that is because it is a chozo from metroid
gaming,not_removed,im stuck in sm so close to the end too
gaming,not_removed,so its a meteoroid decal all these professional art analysts in this thread and nobody mentioned what its from thanks lol
gaming,not_removed,grab the pitchforks
gaming,not_removed,i thought your boy was your son
gaming,not_removed,i dont know why people are downvoting u it was a simple missunderstanding smth that can happen to all of us
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,why all the fucking down votes
gaming,not_removed,um not saying its doo doo have you guys not heard the music when you get an upgrade
gaming,not_removed,hey its me your boy etsy i do the arts and crafts
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,the truth has landed dissappointed dad
gaming,not_removed,yeah but we can totally thrust hillary
gaming,not_removed,he meant his homie
gaming,not_removed,did you just assume the mona lisas gender
gaming,not_removed,the woman is
gaming,not_removed,you are now banned please step away from your computer
gaming,not_removed,how neat is that
gaming,not_removed,things be what they is
gaming,not_removed,someone took the time to draw that not only is it incredibly shitty that op likely didnt pay them for the use of their creation but he didnt even credit them if it were anything other than art people would throw a fit
gaming,not_removed,my boy ruined this post pretty badass in my opinion
gaming,not_removed,wanted to downvote but name checks out am very confused about what action to take next
gaming,not_removed,its his boi guzma
gaming,not_removed,or spouse
gaming,not_removed,well then good job
gaming,not_removed,before or after tourian what got ya hangin samus
gaming,not_removed,just spam missles on ridley
gaming,not_removed,yeah more specifically its a statue of a chozo an ancient alien race that made samus her suit
gaming,not_removed,this pic my friend sent me is pretty cool lets see what reddit has to say abo oh god what have i done
gaming,not_removed,thx man its all good
gaming,not_removed,because op or his son didnt make this its been found that its a decal you can buy and that op is a karma whore youre just caught in the wake sorry mate
gaming,not_removed,lets go bowling
gaming,not_removed,yo boi etsy
gaming,not_removed,boah i told you to clean up your etsy after you used the bathroom
gaming,not_removed,hah well i think my boy my son my boi my as i understand it
gaming,not_removed,nice try hillary
gaming,not_removed,ew
gaming,not_removed,or dont im a comment not a cop
gaming,not_removed,pay them credit them do you even know for sure if that guy that made the original wasnt the same as his son i know this is reddit and everyone is fucking people over for goddamn internet points but wtf you couldnt even imagine that this could indeed be a father and he thought his son did it that is why i said not to ruin it when i drew something to my dad and traced it never did anything on a large scale anyway and i was very proud i would always get so angry if people pointed it out that it was maybe traced i dont know too much about credit and the like but iam preeeetty sure that you dont have to pay someone for tracing an image an then posting it to the internet and then not even saying it is you that made it iam a little salty today but still
gaming,not_removed,if the use is purely noncommercial then you dont have to credit or pay anybody
gaming,not_removed,its the one time my screen name has ever potentially checked out you can see my dilemma
gaming,not_removed,or etsy
gaming,not_removed,i dont really know how to answer your question but im excited someone wants to help me so how do i transmit to you how far along i am maybe take a photo of the world map and you can see how much of it ive unlocked tell you the upgrades i have ive been stuck for so long now that when i even try to play the game i just go in circles and get frustrated
gaming,not_removed,just be honest next time its really simple
gaming,not_removed,fuck tammy
gaming,not_removed,also would have accept ma boy my
gaming,not_removed,and of course mah boi link
gaming,not_removed,whats the big deal hillary is totally trustable
gaming,not_removed,drawing requires a lot more talent than tracing if youre getting angry because people arent giving you more credit than you deserve you need to check your inflated ego
gaming,not_removed,go the fuck away man
gaming,not_removed,its called copyright infringement and is illegal as your are stealing their ip intellectual property you could be sued by them for passing it off as your own
gaming,not_removed,yeah but you dont claim its your sons intellectual property or stupid shit like that especially on reddit thats just dumb
gaming,not_removed,ok so theres a room with a bunch of statues it represents the four i think bosses youll need to clear out before the last zone tourian opens up it should be visible on the map some poeple seem to miss that you can use a power bomb and blow up this tank to enter meridia the water world other than that it just looking at your map and figuring out where theres holes in the wall rooms you havent entered and so forth if this wont help you check a speedrun of super metroid theres tons of them on youtube see as far as to the point where you are stuck then stop and continue on your own any further questions just ask good luck bringing peace to the galaxy
gaming,not_removed,my friend sent me this pic last night i responded sweet chozo dude he said thanks i made it now where the disconnect was is that he made the vinyl sticker from a picture on the internet and put it on his macbook i thought he meant he drew it which was not the case i was half asleep as he texted me this pretty late thought it looked awesome and posted it to reddit theres no conspiracy maaaaannnnnn i posted a picture i made a mistake in the title thats it
gaming,not_removed,what people just get on the internet and tell lies
gaming,not_removed,im not cleaning up etsy
gaming,not_removed,thrustable
gaming,not_removed,i was a little kid then you didnt even try to keep it on topic
gaming,not_removed,isnt that only if he was trying to sell it legitimate question
gaming,not_removed,did op do that he literally said my boy drew this i dont believe its an original image but he probably drew it
gaming,not_removed,thank you very much i can see a little two square tall boss room that i have no idea how to get to but at least it gives me a frame of reference ill try the speed through too if i keep getting stuck have a good one i did successfully blow up that tank on my journey already
gaming,not_removed,nobody said anything about a conspiracy mate even with that explanation my original comment is still relevant
gaming,not_removed,she makes me wet
gaming,not_removed,whats to say the he wasnt also itd still be ip infringement if the owner wanted to sue etc if the guy starts passing it off as his own since it can result in business decreasing for the creator due to them stealing the design
gaming,not_removed,this is reddit people will downvote you because you agree the slightest with me because of fucked up herd mentality is that what it is called and just because one guy says something that sounds like it is damn right they downvote the shit out of people and yeah what you said is right
gaming,not_removed,i made a mistake when i posted this i thought it was a drawing and that he drew it turns out its not a drawing and he didnt draw it whoops if i could change the title i would i cannot i dont know what else you want from me
gaming,not_removed,i think we can all agree op is a stick bundle
gaming,not_removed,o kay
gaming,not_removed,whats to say the he wasnt are you serious no seriously i dont hope that you downvoted me or that you did it for that reason because that is my definition of stupid you cant just assume what is and then hate me for it if that is the case
gaming,not_removed,seems like an honest mistake to me
gaming,not_removed,you owe everyone an apology s
gaming,not_removed,that point was the possibility but did you not read the rest of what i said
gaming,not_removed,thanks lol it was til reddit can be pretty harsh
gaming,not_removed,he didnt at anypoint state that he made it it is funny how my comment that just didnt want to ruin it if it was a father and his son had pretended to make it and suddenly all these things about copyright
gaming,not_removed,if you just learned that today then you just be new to reddit
gaming,not_removed,im not new ive seen it happen to other people but ive never been that guy before its quite an experience let me tell you ill think twice next time i see a comment hate brigade thats for sure
gaming,not_removed,prize pools no but the club could happen without that or do you mean players just find each other through the club and then join esea leagues because that just may work
gaming,not_removed,i mean i sorta did this i got a group of friends together during grade at my highschool to play cs ended up being pretty active playing esea any small online tournaments we could find not too hardcore about it but it was hella fun until we graduated
gaming,not_removed,i did the whole gamebattles thing with all of my high school friends turned out we were pretty good constantly dominated the modern warfare ladder we did local competitions and won prizes and what not as far as using your high school as reputation i dunno doesnt seem that cool these days
gaming,not_removed,i mean students join the club in means to compete in leagues for prize pools the tournaments and earnings would mostly be online but maybe some big event at the end where the club goes to a lan this club could not only include one competitive esport game but others examples csgo lol dota and overwatch do you think external sponsor ships would work not sure how getting optimal computers would work
gaming,not_removed,did you do this in means of a club representing your school
gaming,not_removed,the school definitely wouldnt fund that this is something that would be great for college my school for example has various esports clubs colleges dont really care all that much and you have more freedom to do what you will with the club if you do want to do it in high school though youre probably only going to be able to organize things through the school not the funding or the wifi use or whatever
gaming,not_removed,nah just an unofficial thing but if your school could get onboard i know it happens with colleges
gaming,not_removed,i actually experienced this issue as well in the app and on the playstation store on the console it would ask which version i would like to purchase but the screen would be blankon the app it wouldnt let me choose between the two options i would suggest going on amazon and buying a digital code for it which is what i did and it is now downloading
gaming,not_removed,is this in the us or european ps store
gaming,not_removed,dont play with your food
gaming,not_removed,dont forget your pac lunch too
gaming,not_removed,dang pacman didnt age well
gaming,not_removed,dude i just posted the same thing minutes earlier hahaha got to a point where all the food bits spawned in me and there was a tiny circle for others to fight it out ran into the wall so i could go study
gaming,not_removed,so studying is going well lol
gaming,not_removed,it was before i decided to play for a quick hour haha
gaming,not_removed,married
gaming,not_removed,playing wii and wearing xbox jammies what is this blasphemy
gaming,not_removed,and she never noticed her controller was unplugged the entire time
gaming,not_removed,my sister and i have been gaming together for the past years always good to have a teammate you can count on
gaming,not_removed,wish my sis was cool and not an evil bitch
gaming,not_removed,my sister used to play video games with me i think the exact day she stopped we were playing duke together and she was flying around and she thought she knew where i was of course she was looking at my half of the screen i saw her just floating in mid air looking in the wrong direction i watched patently as the rocket closed in on her as her entire focus was waiting for me to pop out still looking in the wrong direction the moment she died i laughed hysterically that was the last time she played with me she said i cheated she flat out admitted to looking at my screen but since she was wrong i should have told her i laughed harder
gaming,not_removed,their expressions make it seem like theyve never enjoyed playing games
gaming,not_removed,ive seen some videos that start like this
gaming,not_removed,so who is better
gaming,not_removed,historical proof that games drive families further apart
gaming,not_removed,sister looks like tara from the walking dead
gaming,not_removed,hey thats my room
gaming,not_removed,what is this a coffee commercial
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,rare and cool
gaming,not_removed,oh my god she got the mad catz controller
gaming,not_removed,what grown ass man has xbox pajama pants
gaming,not_removed,good to see the lannister line is still going strong after all these years
gaming,not_removed,is that girl shailene woodley
gaming,not_removed,this is the first time i being sad about not having a sisterbrother this would be gooood
gaming,not_removed,marry him
gaming,not_removed,awesome
gaming,not_removed,dude needs to upgrade his pants
gaming,not_removed,plot twistthey are cousins
gaming,not_removed,you look like barney from half life
gaming,not_removed,rfrugal will be happy to see him using his favorite shirt from the as night night jammies now
gaming,not_removed,glad you told us which was most recent i almost thought the top left was from a few months ago
gaming,not_removed,i wish me and my brother could play video games together unfortunately wed murder each other
gaming,not_removed,my sister and i use to play vidya games together one of my most vivid memories was playing secret of mana on the snes with her one of the many things i miss about her

gaming,not_removed,i usually dont sit and smile none stop when i play either
gaming,not_removed,its not about enjoyment its about winning
gaming,not_removed,when playing games you need to concentrate hence your face becomes serious like that nobody smiles and plays games
gaming,not_removed,their expressions make it seem like theyve never enjoyed playing games the only people who do that are youtubetwitch letsplayers
gaming,not_removed,they arent paid actors in stock pictures maybe
gaming,not_removed,was thinking the same
gaming,not_removed,internet ruined us
gaming,not_removed,i was thinking the same thing
gaming,not_removed,username checks out

gaming,not_removed,im pretty sure its the fact they are playing mario wii that shit gets dangerous
gaming,not_removed,if anyones gonna fuck his sister its a full grown man in xbox pajamas
gaming,not_removed,this is my sexbox and her name is sony
gaming,not_removed,yup because one frame of their whole life is enough to judge a whole relationships
gaming,not_removed,do you also own a reebok tracksuit
gaming,not_removed,what kind o hat do you wear
gaming,not_removed,if you dont own a pair of british knights then get outta here
gaming,not_removed,youre a mad man you must be stopped
gaming,not_removed,this is more my experience the is way too in to killing their older sibling im going to hear about that time they set their siblings buildings on fire in minecraft until im
gaming,not_removed,i hear hannah montana can be a bitch at times
gaming,not_removed,my brother was bipolar he killed himself a few years ago still hurts man
gaming,not_removed,uh i dont
gaming,not_removed,its a legitimate strategy
gaming,not_removed,so you dont believe everybody looks like when theyre gaming
gaming,not_removed,thats the face of concentration noone wants to lose against his sister in a video game
gaming,not_removed,smiles do occur during play theyre just not there the entire time
gaming,not_removed,honestly thats the hardest part about streaming gameplay getting into the game yet still be entertaining to watch and interact with
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,glob at the beginning of his name and dolg at the beginning of yours really fucked with my dyslexia for a minute i thought you were replying to your own comment until id reread them
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,if she is turk she might my ex
gaming,not_removed,post on all the downvoted comments for karma
gaming,not_removed,no hes married are you paying attention
gaming,not_removed,the makings of a quality shitpost
gaming,not_removed,its actually frames but ok
gaming,not_removed,unfortunately i do not have the pleasure of owning a reebok tracksuit a man can always dream though
gaming,not_removed,adidas owns reebok so itd be okay
gaming,not_removed,its a grey adidas thrasher and i wear it a lot like a lot
gaming,not_removed,i understand
gaming,not_removed,rip
gaming,not_removed,similar to this in tv shows when they are playing games tony is literally playing one handed and only using the analog stick not even pressing the accelerate button they then press reset on the itself and it just magically boots up straight away on the same track
gaming,not_removed,i see some aphex twin cover art in the making
gaming,not_removed,haha that was a great reply
gaming,not_removed,that girl is going to have terrible wrist problems if they play like that regularly
gaming,not_removed,they only occur when you beat someone or complete a level but i agree the hardest laughs occur when you beat your arch nemesis in fifa or cod
gaming,not_removed,completely agreeto concentrate in the game and yet talk your emotions to the camera constantly after a point it becomes easier and almost an habit i guess
gaming,not_removed,this has actually become an inside joke at my work so whats new on rwincest
gaming,not_removed,id heard the term never thought it would be a subreddit though
gaming,not_removed,haha nope murican but she does fit the profile of a lot of kids nowadays it just got under me skin shed do that to someone considering im military myself
gaming,not_removed,sometimes if it peaks my interest
gaming,not_removed,theyre not that expensive online and hilarious to own shit just go get a generic tracksuit off aliexpress on the cheap youll be ready for halloween edit because i care about track suits and i care about you
gaming,not_removed,its cool i wear a beanie almost every day have like of those suckers in rotation
gaming,not_removed,honestly i think tv shows nowadays purposely do that just for shits and giggles for the crew its basically a schtick at this point i wouldnt be surprised if it was tv tropes
gaming,not_removed,it reminds me of from charlies angels where kids are playing ffvii as if it were two player
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,really this is reddit after all
gaming,not_removed,pretty typical actually
gaming,not_removed,fyi its piques my interest english is funny that way
gaming,not_removed,it shows pictures at different intervals in their lives therefore were seeing different frames at different times are you autistic or just an dumbass
gaming,not_removed,the amount of love in this comment bless you kind stranger
gaming,not_removed,thanks for the manual correct i will remember this
gaming,not_removed,the line in the middle of the bottom picture is actually the corner of the room
gaming,not_removed,bruh you need to hop off reddit and sort your shit out
gaming,not_removed,that was manual correct not auto
gaming,not_removed,there are four lights
gaming,not_removed,fixed it thanks for correcting my incorrect correction
gaming,not_removed,i dont think so wrapping bodies in carpets has been a trope for a long time
gaming,not_removed,if they started talking about stuff caught there drawing ants i would say yes
gaming,not_removed,sidebar follow reddits rules of promotion this is not the place to spam your channel or stream no referral affiliate andor survey links
gaming,not_removed,was this the map too
gaming,not_removed,the maze its the deeper game within the game
gaming,not_removed,it doesnt look like anything to me
gaming,not_removed,how would the controls work on mobile also to me the colour pallet seems a little bit off but i didnt really get a good look at it so it might just be me
gaming,not_removed,hi thanks for the reply with a single touch to attack and move thanks i will check into it
gaming,not_removed,another one that hasnt been done is an open world sniping game
gaming,not_removed,i was never a huge fan of dynasty warriors but id be interested in button jamming this shooter version
gaming,not_removed,yeah this sounds awesome always wanted a game like this
gaming,not_removed,company of heros is a bit like that its worth checking out at least
gaming,not_removed,i would love sniping into hundreds of enemies trying to find the leaders and break their moral
gaming,not_removed,arma
gaming,not_removed,me too idk why it hasnt happened yet i used to just think the tech wasnt there but with modern pc games and the direction consoles are headed i bet in years it could happen with hundreds on each side giving you that real war feel
gaming,not_removed,or sneaking around trying not to get caught gathering intel to set up a shot location and having to wait hoping the intel is good
gaming,not_removed,yeah thats true or what about a game where you play as a member of one of the armies while they are having a huge fight like hundreds of men and every time you die you can just take control of another army member
gaming,not_removed,good intel leads to troop upgrades special attacks call ins or even getting them to rebel
gaming,not_removed,bribe children with chocolate for intel as well as capturing enemy soldiers and getting it out of them before you decide to let them live or not
gaming,not_removed,i really love that idea bribe the children and the run in for intel enemy has two choices a let them live and get tge intel or b kill the kiddos but then your bases moral drops because you look like a kid killing asshole chocolate has to be rare or multifunctional brought to you by hershey park
gaming,not_removed,is this game of throne inspired
gaming,not_removed,i would want a full environmental camouflageghillie suit ability as well i want to pull things from around me to camo up and a realistic zeroing on scopes where you actually have to spend range time getting good at
gaming,not_removed,lol crack
gaming,not_removed,but hole
gaming,not_removed,type join reddit in game theres a huge channel of people doing ai runs
gaming,not_removed,there is a remake on steam i just dont know the name of it right off hand was my favorite game way back when
gaming,not_removed,while not strictly the same i found dungeon of the endless to be an interesting idea part dungeon explorer part resource gathering part tower defence
gaming,not_removed,dont know if this is up your alley op but httpkeeperrlcom pretty much what your looking for
gaming,not_removed,war for the overworld is almost identical but its very badly optimized for kinda like it games try dwarfs game of dwarves dungeons havent played first one
gaming,not_removed,i think thats the one im talking about looks just like the game but the reviews said it was buggy as hell
gaming,not_removed,war for the overworld is the game your thinking of its fun and a good game but i would wait for a sale not worth it at full price overlord overlord wile not the dungeon keeper are still good or you can just get dungeon keeper
gaming,not_removed,it is a version of the game pretty much i might try it to see if it feeds the drive to play dungeon keeper thanks for posting it
gaming,not_removed,believe thats the only game thats similar to it war for the underworld
gaming,not_removed,glad i got the original dungeon keeper disc still
gaming,not_removed,no problem op its constantly being updated so keep checking the site
gaming,not_removed,son of ai was afraid of that have you played it
gaming,not_removed,no kidding now im even more interested i love when the developers keep updating a game to keep it fresh and fun
gaming,not_removed,war for the overworld is definitely a worthy spiritual successor to dungeon keeper
gaming,not_removed,really when does that come out
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,oh shit thanks
gaming,not_removed,post one from his perspective
gaming,not_removed,be someone standing there every time from now on
gaming,not_removed,lol this should be posted to runexpected
gaming,not_removed,new hiding spot for me
gaming,not_removed,like
gaming,not_removed,exact same goddamn event how did you find this
gaming,not_removed,same youtuber same playlist
gaming,not_removed,warning edgy music inside i made it as an ironic video because the guy who got the play of the game told me i didnt do shit the entire game
gaming,not_removed,looks way different nice
gaming,not_removed,this mod drastically changes the game with such a simple tweak its crazy how different planets feel with flora towering over you and the buildings
gaming,not_removed,too bad yo dick is still small yep
gaming,not_removed,its not perfect but its a real change right i played about hours and now im letting it sit for mods to catch up this one is a huge step in the right direction
gaming,not_removed,theyre already quickly improving the game head to wwwnomansskymodscom to check it out there is also a nexus site already available
gaming,not_removed,the core game is there hoping for some crazy additions and improvements in the future from hg and modders
gaming,not_removed,its amazing how the repeating architectures look different when the environment is allowed to take some precedence
gaming,not_removed,youre out of your fuckin mind okay really id say you should keep playing through them since its not a terribly long series and you can experience some pretty intense or even memorable moments who knows maybe youll appreciate having gone through the games before episode comes out when you retire being a bit more empathetic about why youre not enjoying it as much as you expect i suppose the style of narrative might be lost on you at the moment which is a shame but understandable given how successful games do it today theres nowhere near as many fleshed out features in halflife compared to other titles today to name some there are few to no actual choices its a very linear experience and pretty much no character development or interaction they kind of just speak at you but that part is intentional and key to how the player is immersedinvolved in the halflife games given those things i think itd be delusional to expect that everyone will love halflife or the series in general especially as time goes on but yeah id say press on speaking as someone that loves the series but does not consider the games necessarily better than current titles who have had more than years to perfect upon a very wellexplored genre of games edit to actually answer your question id say yes it certainly gets better through the episodes rather epic in fact dont you care about why humanity lost the war or what happens to the resistances effortsplans i suppose you have to take the time to dig a bit for a story in your surroundings it really isnt shoved down your throat like some titles today
gaming,not_removed,half life was a game i couldnt play for longer than hours at a time because i didnt want to make myself dislike the game from boredom i came back to it once a week for hours then played something else
gaming,not_removed,the episodes are much better than the main game once you play those youll understand why people want a so bad
gaming,not_removed,half life is one of my very favourite games of all time but i kinda hated it at first i think for the same reasons youre giving here i expected that first chase sequence to go on for maybe five minutes and yet it goes on foreverrrrrr i probably started liking it a lot more at about the point you get the car but there are still some decent stretches of gameplay between story moments after that still after the car sequence i feel even the gameplay parts get a little smarter and more varied still what will really let you know if you should continue playing is if the few story sequences so far have done anything for you if you havent much cared for the characters and the artistic style of the game you might as well quit now if youve really liked the characters and environments but are just frustrated by how long the stretches of gameplay between them are then you should definitely stick with it while the game never becomes quite as cinematic and linearly guided as a modern game like uncharted or something the pacing does tighten up significantly toward the end and features far more real meaningful character interaction like i said i myself got very frustrated at that long trek early on but after completing the game i cant say i would change any part of it after meeting back up with my crew i really felt the relief and fatigue of a guy whod fought across the whole damn country to get back to them if gordons journey had just been told in a second cutscene it wouldnt give the same power to anything that comes after you still have a car journey and a fight through an old facility to go but stick with it through that part at least and wait until you meet back up with alyx i think thats the point everything came together for me
gaming,not_removed,its a good game but the physics of the series always give me a headache
gaming,not_removed,ya i like it betyter when the story is shoved down my throut and it comes out the other end like in life is strange however i will play it and will put it into smaller breaks as someone else said that way if i get bored i can come back later what really makes it bad is how confusing it is it is linear but super loopy and i have went back the wrong way at least times i think if i knew where i was going it would be much better and more action packed
gaming,not_removed,good idea i think i will do that i have been doing it for like hour for days now i will just play a little bit so i get into it and then out good idea
gaming,not_removed,i mean the characters today are nothing special i like the story but it isnt like wow omg i need to keep playing for it
gaming,not_removed,i think i remember some parts do send you backtracking in confusion keep at it i think the level design improves a bit or at least youll pick up on the developers intentions better as you put more time into it some would be very envious of you being able to play through it for the first time i know i kind of am
gaming,not_removed,about hours each
gaming,not_removed,ok i am at nove prospect and the game has gotten better i get to use little bugs as weapons this is so much fun now i am not amazed but this is still good now bring back to and this is the best game ever there is still like half the game left so if it stays like this i will like it the begging is boring with so much back tracking
gaming,not_removed,nice enjoy the rest before joining the masses of really pissed off gamers who want halflife or episode to be announced finally
gaming,not_removed,lol yep i can finally truly understand not yet but in a couple days
gaming,not_removed,this is actually my friend playing
gaming,not_removed,people still think that
gaming,not_removed,maybe my kids fucked up personality is a result of my parenting and not video games said no one
gaming,not_removed,but muh billy is gonna be a serial killer for playin that grand theft automobile
gaming,not_removed,as a parent this actually kind of sucks i was having my year old child play violent video games in order to toughen them up a bit i guess it was all for nothing
gaming,not_removed,i bet that jigsaw from saw played sims before doing that stuff stupid games
gaming,not_removed,video games make you violent screams the mom as she violently beats her kids with a belt
gaming,not_removed,i still believe videogames doesnt make ou violent but this is pretty much clickbait further studies no result is not the same as no in any circumstances
gaming,not_removed,meanwhile mario party can make kind people become violent hey those stars are nice btw im stealing them all with chance time
gaming,not_removed,go play harvester and then try to tell me you dont want to brutally kill everyone s
gaming,not_removed,aka its your fault they dont like to hear that
gaming,not_removed,sorry parents it should be good news parents
gaming,not_removed,isnt there a lot of content on this topic that doesnt twist the living shit out of a study that relies on anecdotal data ive played games for years clearly as a programmer who sits at a desk and gets along with coworkers after years of gaming i have strong anectdotal evidence it doesnt make anyone violent asshole is an asshole but twisting studies that only conclude empathy isnt reduced undermines our case
gaming,not_removed,and ill kill you for saying otherwise
gaming,not_removed,if youre the kind of parent who thinks having your year old watch the dday landing scene of saving private ryan is totally ok then you probably have bigger problems than letting them play modern warfare
gaming,not_removed,as a teacher who games and who connects with students through gaming im not at all concerned with the violent content of video games im concerned with my students not doing any of their work reading studying homework projects because theyre playing call of duty or for six hours every night
gaming,not_removed,but all my problems come from gaming you know its so dangerous
gaming,not_removed,this has been common knowledge for a very long time
gaming,not_removed,love the first comment below on the main articles page original study person calls out the hack of a journalist for fucking everything up in the article lol rip whoever wrote that trash
gaming,not_removed,it really doesnt it actually calmed down my brother and we all get along now
gaming,not_removed,ive been gaming my whole life oftentimes very violent games and i can confirm i have killed fewer than people in real life
gaming,not_removed,sponsored content and the study was kind of inconclusive i didnt even see a link to it and certainly very little information was really provided edit i really wonder what the point of the article even was this topic has pretty much died certainly past its prime from around or so
gaming,not_removed,my mother believed this come to think of it she must have been shit scared about what i would be capable of after playing lemmings as a year old march to your deaths little ones
gaming,not_removed,why is the article apologizing what for
gaming,not_removed,used to pay cod in middle school played everything from age of empires dark souls evil within skyrim fallout mortal kombat and have tried at some point many if not most fps and adventure games that have come out in the past decade dont play much more but im the softest guy i know i fit more girlfriend stereotypes than my girlfriend and i get faint at seeing extremities of human condition think the boy cutting his wings off in xmen iii or the slave fight in django those scenes made me pass out its kind of funny i never considered the statistic im a part of
gaming,not_removed,there are however long term effects from shitty parenting
gaming,not_removed,such a shame hahahah we all knew
gaming,not_removed,duh
gaming,not_removed,shortterm effects however may include and are not limited to murder gang violence and drug use
gaming,not_removed,no but people who write this crap know that kids gonna jizz when they see it they even added sorry parents to the title
gaming,not_removed,yes my parents
gaming,not_removed,yes i know a guy in his thirties who thinks this fucks sake
gaming,not_removed,the president of the united states believes it this statement would have worked even if clinton won or burnie im sorry to bring our bullshit into this
gaming,not_removed,fackin billy
gaming,not_removed,im still waiting for the leaked sequel stealy wheely automobily
gaming,not_removed,gee bill how come your mom lets you eat two weiners
gaming,not_removed,omg fuckin billy is the worst
gaming,not_removed,the scariest ones are the silent type
gaming,not_removed,yeah if you scroll to the bottom its listed as sponsored content which makes me wonder who paid for it and why
gaming,not_removed,chance time is bullshit and ill kill anyone that says otherwise
gaming,not_removed,grand theft auto doesnt make me want to murder people mario party on the other hand
gaming,not_removed,if ninja gaiden on the nes didnt make me a murderer nothing will
gaming,not_removed,they are pretty much insulting the parents saying its their fault their kids are violent not the video games
gaming,not_removed,werent there graphs of the popularity of video games against the violent crime rate where the latter fell as the former rose not that that implies causation of course
gaming,not_removed,and thats why parents need to be parents limit your kids screen time school comes first wow high school is a bad combination coming from personal experience i got a gpa and pretty decent grades except for math and spanish but i know i could have done better i want to go back to college next year i have preemptively quit wow and any other mmos i wanted to retire anyway since ive been playing less and less over the years but i decided it wasnt going to fit into my plans
gaming,not_removed,creating an imaginary war for karma
gaming,not_removed,theres still some bias against videogames just as any form of bigotry but not nearly as much as there used to be im so glad its finally become so accepted in american cultureeven trendy good stuff
gaming,not_removed,well now the argument has changed to games cause misogyny so its kind of still relevant anita sarkesiawhateverthefuck and others have made a ton of money peddling this shit
gaming,not_removed,interestingly i know quite a lot of people who are really hardline about that sort of thing with their kids the idea that games cause violent behaviour is at least in my experience actually still really prevalent among a lot of people from the generation which didnt really grow up with nonarcade games its just that its easier than ever for kids to buy games without their parents realising the age rating
gaming,not_removed,exactly almost nobody gives a shit since tipper gore and jack thompson faded into obscurity the dozens of idiots who still believe this shit are not relevant in any way
gaming,not_removed,parents just dont understand will smith
gaming,not_removed,you should probably kill them then
gaming,not_removed,i have a cousin that used to play saints row the third a lot in the game you could run towards the front of a car and press triangle and your character would jump through the front windshield land in the seat and start driving he thought this was so cool he actually went to his fathers shop hes a mechanic and tried it on a car his father was working on at the time luckily he didnt get through it and fuck his legs up but the windshield was done now i know his dumbass is in the minority just wanted to tell the story cause you made me think about it
gaming,not_removed,everyone who denies it secretly knows its true it might not affect adults but it definitely affects kids
gaming,not_removed,what the fuck are you talking about
gaming,not_removed,i have been publicly humiliated for the last time
gaming,not_removed,what a strange a game to use in this instance dont get me wrong i played the shit out of the first two unless this a joke
gaming,not_removed,violent crimes fell in the last century so you can make that correlation with about anything consumption of starbucks coffee reduces violent crime rates would be just as true
gaming,not_removed,lies damn lies and statistics
gaming,not_removed,creating an imaginary war for ad revenue probably the more accurate description
gaming,not_removed,everyone plays em now at least on a casual level i used to work in theatre with some of the guys on my schools football team and they all had their favorite series
gaming,not_removed,to play devils advocate anita is a con artist but theres tons of very stupid impressionable people out there like the un that fall for her shit
gaming,not_removed,thats not what she is saying she is just pointing out things in games that can reinforce and perpetuate already misogynistic tendencies in society
gaming,not_removed,im away at school now ill sit them down and talk to them about it next time i go home hopefully they like dorsia
gaming,not_removed,wtf is wrong with you
gaming,not_removed,i think the article was about if video games made you violent not if video games made you mentally retarded
gaming,not_removed,video games dont cause stupidity though
gaming,not_removed,clinton sanders and trump all share the same stance on violent video games that stance is that they create monsters the person above me asked if anyone still believes this i was letting them know that yes many do they also unfortunately are very influential
gaming,not_removed,it is im referencing the game breaking difficulty of the first game the birds man the birds
gaming,not_removed,youd expect a spike at some point if theyre really as effective at brainwashing as theyre claimed to be but yes
gaming,not_removed,was this that lady that was supposed to give a presentation at sxsw about sexualizing women in video games
gaming,not_removed,she is just pointing out things in games that can reinforce and perpetuate already misogynistic tendencies in society which is exactly the same argument that the ops post refutes only with sexism in the place of violence
gaming,not_removed,it was a joke look at op headline
gaming,not_removed,too much peggle
gaming,not_removed,now i know his dumbass is in the minority just wanted to tell the story cause you made me think about it i wasnt trying to rebut the article man there really are some stupid humans on earth arent there
gaming,not_removed,i dont know man the guy who owned the truck got pretty pissed now how i have no idea but somehow his father didnt have to pay for the windshield nor did he know what happened to it his son thought i was the one that broke the windshield i got pissed and told his son it wasnt me that it was my cousin and of course him being him my cousin lied like it was me because ya know hes a little bitch no one believed him though everyone knew it was him because his dad found the shoes he used to do it hidden in his room and came to the conclusion that those shoe prints were the exact same ones on the windshield he didnt suffer any consequences for it to this day he still doesnt know anyone knows it was him but me because no one actually told him reminds me of the time when we were and we shot a windows out of a car his dad was repairing because we thought itd be sick his dad knew it was us but didnt say anything about it
gaming,not_removed,now i know his dumbass is in the minority just wanted to tell the story cause you made me think about it never said they did read it before commenting on it retard
gaming,not_removed,regardless of whether or not the things you point out are true my point still stands she isnt saying that games cause misogyny
gaming,not_removed,maybe google it
gaming,not_removed,that can be discussed but if it is as you say it means you agree with me and anita in that games do not cause misogyny
gaming,not_removed,i may be a retard but whats your excuse
gaming,not_removed,retard youre the one who thought itd be totally ok shooting out someone elses car window whilst his father had it in his shop why the fuck would that be ok if you havent figured out right or wrong plus consequences by the time youre you have developmental issues fucking triggered im referring to his other comment where he wrote this reminds me of the time when we were and we shot a windows out of a car his dad was repairing because we thought itd be sick his dad knew it was us but didnt say anything about it
gaming,not_removed,what did you even read the comment the story was about my cousin not me literally the first words in my comment was my cousin dude is your brain turned off you should read shit before commenting on it so you dont look like an absolute retard like you just did
gaming,not_removed,better to be certain dont you agree
gaming,not_removed,claiming video games have a problem implies thay only video games have this problem i never said such a thing i merely pointed out that sexism is ingrained into corporate society in terms of the video game industry nothing more nothing less for example remember me with a lead female protagonist was attacked because and i quote you cant make a dude like the player kiss another dude in the game that is going to feel awkward jeanmax morris penny arcade even with that said female protagonist still have many hurdles with todays looser restrictions for example there isnt a whole lot of female protagonist that can initiate intimate contact in any real way there is a running theme that women can be sexy can have big breasts that bounce and generally regarded as ok to be just a big slab of sexy meat but the second a female protagonist engages in in anything that isnt a sexy meat slab for a male protagonist things get undesirable i mean that is almost the definition of objectification
gaming,not_removed,reminds me of the time when we were and we shot a windows out of a car his dad was repairing because we thought itd be sick his dad knew it was us but didnt say anything about it your other comment you dumb shit
gaming,not_removed,yeah cause kids dont do stupid shit right
gaming,not_removed,link
gaming,not_removed,year olds shouldnt be shooting out someone elses car windows at that age you cant even justify it through ignorance its straight up fucking stupid and im pointing out you cant call someone else a retard if that story is true
gaming,not_removed,i never said they should be shooting out windows they shouldnt be doing a lot of the stupid shit they do kids are just stupid all of them are we were all kids judging someones intelligence based off of something they did when they were with a bb gun isnt fair to anyone now judging someones intelligence bases off of something they did recently is a different story youre calling me a retard for something i did when i was im calling you a retard for something you did recently can you flip the switch on your brain for a moment to let that sink in before you say some more retarded shit
gaming,not_removed,ill take it if you dont want it
gaming,not_removed,id take it but no xbox one
gaming,not_removed,deal ill message you sir
gaming,not_removed,ive been getting them frustratingly frequently lately usually if i use a telepill at the start of a floor just in the hopes itll put me near something interesting
gaming,not_removed,ive only got the i am error room once or twice it always happens when you dont need it to as well
gaming,not_removed,theres like a chance youll end up in an i am error room get cool free loot its easier to get to if you use a certain tarot card after finding all the secrets and devil room on a floor
gaming,not_removed,this game has so many secret things its amazing although i find some of them pretty creepy like the one with the machine that sometimes tells you depressing things
gaming,not_removed,what does this room signify if anything i mean its really cool and after this i ended up beating moms heart in about three seconds with my max damage that i already had before this room and then got the everything is terrible ending signifying my easy runthrough is over and the game is going to get harder i dont mind a challenge but what happened
gaming,not_removed,sweet so i just was extremely lucky
gaming,not_removed,yeahhhh though i kinda like it also the fact that some items names correspond with child abuse is dark but i love the humour despite its implications
gaming,not_removed,its just an error throwing you into some isolated room in the middle of fuck off nowhere with a few random scattered drops outside that it doesnt really mean a whole lot i dont think it has any impact on your ending either
gaming,not_removed,changes nothing just an easter egg from zelda
gaming,not_removed,its pretty cool nonetheless
gaming,not_removed,i know i saw that immediately zelda ii
gaming,not_removed,come join us on httpswwwredditcomrbeadsprites
gaming,not_removed,my wife made a few of these too perlabeads or something
gaming,not_removed,my fingers get tired just making a link sprite
gaming,not_removed,i feel like at some point every gamers girlfriend dabbles in this hobby at some point i mean the nerdy ones anyways
gaming,not_removed,whaaaaat this is cool i need to do this
gaming,not_removed,i still struggle dealing with the fact that gamer girls exist where do you find these mythical creatures
gaming,not_removed,close theyre perler beads
gaming,not_removed,get yourself one of these
gaming,not_removed,jesus christ dude
gaming,not_removed,pliers why would you use pliers well i use the mini perler tweezers for both regular and mini perler to each their own i guess
gaming,not_removed,its like a multitool where they have pliers on them i dont use that for bead holding the two ends are for holding jewelry while crafting so its ideal to hold beads when placing
gaming,not_removed,game is elite dangerous for all those wondering
gaming,not_removed,how does that play on the xbox ive only ever played it on pc
gaming,not_removed,i played it a few months ago and it works perfectly never go to try the planet exploration so not too sure on that but it runs great
gaming,not_removed,this is on pc i just recorded it with the xbox app so i could upload it easily you cant change hud colour on xbox
gaming,not_removed,oh ok
gaming,not_removed,oh my god this is so bad
gaming,not_removed,i still think has the most fucked voice acting ever
gaming,not_removed,this is my favorite he literally screwed up the take and they kept it in anyway plus that elmer fudd enunciation
gaming,not_removed,this is my favorite
gaming,not_removed,now suffer like g did
gaming,not_removed,i am bolo santosie
gaming,not_removed,reminds me of the klay world voices httpsyoutubeojhpiktiezm was my shit back in the day
gaming,not_removed,surprised star ocean wasnt mentioned i want to take nappy time with you kaaaay kaaaaaaaay stab your ears drums with knives
gaming,not_removed,is dean lauderdale face acting one of the clips
gaming,not_removed,youve never heard dion waiters in nba the voice acting in the game is horrendous pretty sure noone knows how to read in the nba starts at seconds
gaming,not_removed,gs bloodstains
gaming,not_removed,i dunno have you seen the acting in the original resident evil not only were the live action scenes just woeful but the voice acting in game was even worse somehow
gaming,not_removed,house of the dead has to be one of my favorite arcade games even if they were horribly cheesy and had terrible va the memories of just hanging on the arcade and playing this for hours are priceless
gaming,not_removed,to be fair it matched their rudimentary animation at the time
gaming,not_removed,listening to this makes me physically uncomfortable
gaming,not_removed,and i thought the va in the evil within was bad
gaming,not_removed,at start i thought it was very bad but then at it becomes unreal i am the emperor and i hate mankind ahahaha
gaming,not_removed,my friend worst voice acting will always be reserved for the original men of war
gaming,not_removed,anyone else have this game on their dreamcast funny when youre a kid you dont even notice how horrible the va is
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,hmmm hmmm hmm hmm hm hmmm
gaming,not_removed,is this batman voice
gaming,not_removed,httpwwwaudioatrocitiescom
gaming,not_removed,meh didnt bother me too much exposition though
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,my personal favourite from soul blade
gaming,not_removed,i only ready the post title and knew exactly what it was going to be what a classic
gaming,not_removed,i once heard goldman as being like hes being voice acted by an alien whos still learning how vocal chords work
gaming,not_removed,im pretty sure its on purpose the whole game is a huge parody
gaming,not_removed,despite this being the absolute worst i still cant bring myself to say that i dont like it this is my childhood the countless nights that i spent completing this game over and over this dialogue is music to my ears
gaming,not_removed,anyone feel like goldman is trying to be gman
gaming,not_removed,jesus i played the hell out of house of the dead on the dreamcast when i was younger i dont remember it being this bad o
gaming,not_removed,as soon as i read the title i thought of this game
gaming,not_removed,i think the windows text voice would have sounded more authentic
gaming,not_removed,no suffer like g did best line from the game
gaming,not_removed,i mean yeah this is pretty terrible but theres only so much you can do with such a shit script
gaming,not_removed,hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah hah
gaming,not_removed,cross between someone set us up the bomb and hello dr freeman
gaming,not_removed,you just reminded me of the glory that is typing of the dead
gaming,not_removed,ironically hotd had better voice acting
gaming,not_removed,what the fuck i dont remember any of the voice acting in this game being that bad hm hm hm hm hm
gaming,not_removed,let us dispel this fiction that goldman does not know what he is doing he knows exactly what hes doing
gaming,not_removed,i see you havent played my favorite kings quest v that owl cedric holy shit
gaming,not_removed,still doesnt top the awesomeness that is barrel
gaming,not_removed,no shining force in here
gaming,not_removed,house of the dead was the shit
gaming,not_removed,thank you for rescuing me calmly walks off after being attacked by zombies
gaming,not_removed,dat fraps doh
gaming,not_removed,thats the best i have ever heard in my life
gaming,not_removed,i really want dc douglas to read goldmans lines
gaming,not_removed,he doesnt even speak like a human how is that possible
gaming,not_removed,to protect the lerruffcycle
gaming,not_removed,four words dontopenthat door
gaming,not_removed,httpwwwaudioatrocitiescom for some other good ones
gaming,not_removed,as soon as i seen the title i knew exactly what game itd be even without looking at the thumbnail how do you even fuck up this badly like seriously surely hiring people to do all the voice acting is better than leaving it to some shitty text to speech program providing thats what they actually did
gaming,not_removed,i dunnoo chaos wars is pretty high up there on the awkwardness scale the laugh is genius though
gaming,not_removed,to be fair with house of the dead being primarily an arcade game you wouldnt be able to hear the voice acting or sounds much when theyre drowned out by the noises of the other games in the arcade voice acting wasnt a priority because no one could really hear the game anyway the only sound that was relatively loud was the reload warning when you ran out of bullets
gaming,not_removed,and thats how goldman sachs was founded
gaming,not_removed,no go play wow lorewalker cho everything he says is captain kirk spoken word dat was close i am lorewalker cho like sooo bad
gaming,not_removed,during the emperor speech goldman started turning into kermit a little bit﻿
gaming,not_removed,what game

gaming,not_removed,please tell me that isnt spike from cowboy bebop steve blum
gaming,not_removed,g man is supposed to be strange though the dude can stop time teleport himself and others wherever he wants and plant things in peoples minds such as prepare for unforseen consequences in the mind of alyx vance that she later says to her father he basically just uses gordon freeman and adrian shepard whenever he needs to when hes done with his toys he puts them back in their boxes whatever he is hes not human hes using a human form when he needs to it makes sense that human speech isnt his forte but its a close enough approximation that most would just think he has some weird impediment

gaming,not_removed,a little backstory if you or anyone else didnt know the dude who localized the game instead of hiring voice actors got his family to do the voice work i dont know the reason why probably money reasons
gaming,not_removed,she kinda sounds like
gaming,not_removed,i think she has down syndrome and uru is super fem
gaming,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwfnelafksvm
gaming,not_removed,thats actually one of the core mega man games granted its the worst one but still youd think capcom would put a little bit more care into one of their biggest franchises
gaming,not_removed,such an extremely vague and obscure house of the dead boss character reference lol
gaming,not_removed,jesus its been years and her voice still haunts me
gaming,not_removed,the voice actor is greg iriwin hes also been an additional voice for the shenmue games
gaming,not_removed,you are man he is not man for you he waits for you
gaming,not_removed,hes an interdimensional bureaucrat

gaming,not_removed,i didnt know that neat
gaming,not_removed,these bots are getting more and more common
gaming,not_removed,dont bother purchasing a gaming laptop unless you are willing to invest over if i start building and buying the pieces for an upgrade i hope to complete it by late this is a bad idea pc parts are always changing advancing and as such prices will reflect based on that i say set a budget save up until you reach that budget and buy all the parts at once i also suggest you head over to rbuildapc and ask this question there because you will receive a lot more help than asking on this sub
gaming,not_removed,do you move around constantly and dont stay at home for long laptop else tower
gaming,not_removed,consider upgrading pc most importantly graphics card ram
gaming,not_removed,i maintain that gaming laptops are a colossal waste of money unless you actually travel frequently for a living and if youre looking at dropping the cash for a gaming laptop why is the alternative a slow upgrade of your existing desktop youre probably better off building new but post your specs
gaming,not_removed,get the gaming laptop because i want you to waste your money and learn a valuable life lesson
gaming,not_removed,a lot of people shoot down gaming laptops but it all depends really i have a gaming laptop because i needed a laptop for work and wanted to get into pc gaming without purchasing two separate computers i dont own a ton of newer games but my laptop does play mad max rocket league skyrim se and overwatch on high or ultra settings at it does exactly what i need and want it to do so ive never regretted my purchase though plenty of people will tell you its a mistake i would agree that if you are just purchasing for strictly gaming then theres no reason to get a gaming laptop but if you need a laptop for work and dont have the funds or want to spend extra on a separate computer then a gaming laptop is awesome imo it might have trouble with some games a couple years down the road but i have a also and thats more my go to for aaa games
gaming,not_removed,dont bother purchasing a gaming laptop unless you are willing to invest over my gaming laptop cost usd including tax and shipping processor gb ram and gtx works like a charm and so far plays most new games at on ultra or high settings im well aware of gaming laptop limitations but i never had a gaming pc before and i needed a laptop for work so this was the best of both worlds without purchasing two separate machines which i would never have been able to afford
gaming,not_removed,i am rarely at home because of work and other stuff but when im at home i am at home
gaming,not_removed,similarly when im in the shower i am quite sincerely in the shower
gaming,not_removed,for the full video of the flight
gaming,not_removed,i wanted that motorcycle to spin and fly like a helicopter so baddly
gaming,not_removed,hes doing that on purpose there is a community of motorcycle gliders that do this
gaming,not_removed,its like that dream where you trip or fall from something and you realize youre too high in the air and just keep falling
gaming,not_removed,now to see him land
gaming,not_removed,noob question how do you update gta to get these races is it an online thing only and can i do it with an xbox or is already part of the game and i just havent seen it
gaming,not_removed,but how
gaming,not_removed,he never did
gaming,not_removed,its simple but hard to master many tutorials on youtube
gaming,not_removed,he is holding his mc at the point right before it does a backflip
gaming,not_removed,is the motor bike mechanics the same for the original vs the hd version
gaming,not_removed,personally sitting back with the xbone controller is my preferred and most comfortable position
gaming,not_removed,i have major joint pain issues and a controller is usually more comfortable with me with one major caveat there cant be too much resistance from the springs in the buttons if it takes too much force to press them down then kbm ends up being more comfortable for long play sessions i cant vouch for or against the steam controller since i dont have one but i can vouch strongly for a dualshock with for compatibility or an xbox one controller and i can recommend not getting a logitech controller love the in every other way but the damn triggers just have too much resistance
gaming,not_removed,there are in fact fps games with ranked matchmaking and other games with ranked gaming rocket league didnt invent anything
gaming,not_removed,have you played an fps in the past decade
gaming,not_removed,that exists in many many fps games you just have to look beyond call of duty
gaming,not_removed,cod has arena mode or just a competitive playlist with specificity rule sets
gaming,not_removed,cod has had skill based match making since so i guess nice job at blindly complaining about cod its one of the many reasons kd tends to drift to in the cod games
gaming,not_removed,that must have been quite the ballad
gaming,not_removed,one finger death punch turbo dismount stair dismount and toribash are the only ones i could come up with off the top of my head theyre all pretty shallow games too to be honest maybe try some flash games on newgrounds or something maybe point and click games or rts games like command and conquer i cant really confirm if you can get thru those with one hand as im not a huge fan of either genre sorry
gaming,not_removed,civ can be played onehanded no keyboard and no twitch reactions required
gaming,not_removed,according to the reviews hunie pop is playable with one hand xd sorry about your injury lumino city could work its a mouseonly puzzle game
gaming,not_removed,there are controllers made for one handed players i know because i knew a one handed gamer
gaming,not_removed,osrs only requires a mouse most of the time
gaming,not_removed,weirdo
gaming,not_removed,its closer to a roguelike than survival horror
gaming,not_removed,i would say that infinite mode would be considered survival horror since nothing respawns and the player is constantly losing health
gaming,not_removed,rlaptops should be able to give you good advice
gaming,not_removed,thanks ill repost in there
gaming,not_removed,i loved this game so underrated
gaming,not_removed,its a classic available now
gaming,not_removed,the only reason to make a mega man legends sequel is tronne bonnes ass in hd
gaming,not_removed,if only they didnt can the sequel for the i need answers to that cliff hanger
gaming,not_removed,the megaman games for gameboyds were the best tho
gaming,not_removed,get a playstation tv and buy that shit its like or
gaming,not_removed,legends roll is best roll
gaming,not_removed,the zero games are the goat
gaming,not_removed,do i need a memory card with this or does the tv have the ablitly to store the game situation is had a with this game downloaded on it from the store dont have a anymore have a
gaming,not_removed,the three statues are actually based off pikmin ears nose and mouth on only one statue each
gaming,not_removed,yes i realize this was posted before i figure its time has come again
gaming,not_removed,absolutely i never noticed this before
gaming,not_removed,fun fact the hylian on the base says faroru no kaze which translates to farores wind i would wager a guess that the other statues say neru no ai and din no hi nayrus love and dins fire
gaming,not_removed,even with the antennae im playing this on the gamecube where can i find this little snoo
gaming,not_removed,looks like a green penis to me

gaming,not_removed,brexcom
gaming,not_removed,i didnt actually know voting to leave the xcom project would actually cause us to leave the xcom project if i had known i would have voted stay
gaming,not_removed,and then a day later search queries for what is the xcom project go through the roof
gaming,not_removed,no illegal aliens
gaming,not_removed,had chance of staying
gaming,not_removed,fuck now ireland northern ireland and scotland will all want seats on the council and their own satelite coverage
gaming,not_removed,dont worry people theres a petition
gaming,not_removed,good for them
gaming,not_removed,proxit remaining in xcom would flood us with female snake aliens and it leaves us at the mercy of the rng gods staying would be the end of us all proxmain remaining in xcom is the only way we could get our gunsand snake ladies leaving would be the end of us all
gaming,not_removed,i know we told you your project was shit and you couldnt protect a pint of lager from a teetotallers convention then left but why you no defend us from aliens
gaming,not_removed,im literally your only choice i have the monopoly on your survival aint no competition in the savetheworldagainstalieninvaders market if you panic you should donate more not pull out i literally have weapons that shoot lasers lasers
gaming,not_removed,sounds like you got brekt
gaming,not_removed,guess the xcom project really sucked they are better on their own based brexit
gaming,not_removed,which xcom is this
gaming,not_removed,damn pensioners
gaming,not_removed,serious question but what do you do when you beat this game i just beat it and idk what to do next
gaming,not_removed,i made an all american founding fathers friends team last time i think its time to dust that game off and make a british monarchs greatesthits although i imagine stabilizing the economy that game will be extra hard
gaming,not_removed,we never consented to join that project
gaming,not_removed,how topical
gaming,not_removed,the uk withdraws is the new france surrenders
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,nice screenshot
gaming,not_removed,something something dead horse
gaming,not_removed,perhaps if the xcom project didnt constantly fail despite being incredibly expensive and corrupt the uk would have stayed in the xcom project
gaming,not_removed,alright alright youve taken your crack at the uk americans must love it this is deflecting the trump embarrassment for a little while
gaming,not_removed,the only reason those aliens are entering us is because we are part of brexcom we are taking back our independance no to aliens
gaming,not_removed,does this mean england ireland scotland wales wont be able to play in the xcom championships every years
gaming,not_removed,it hurt itself in confusion
gaming,not_removed,i know its xcom but httpsgfycatcomperiodicgoldenafricangoldencat
gaming,not_removed,stop letting in all the aliens then
gaming,not_removed,so as long as you put your base there you still get the continent bonus expert knowledge forever
gaming,not_removed,yeah well the european union kind of sucks anyway germany is the only country pulling its weight and more meanwhile portugal italy greece spain etc are all freeloading and by all rights should have gone bankrupt by now
gaming,not_removed,day after soldiers from uk leave xcom forces
gaming,not_removed,youve probably mismanaged the xcom as much as eu is mismanaged irl
gaming,not_removed,brexcom enemy unknown brexcom eu works on so many levels
gaming,not_removed,in other news shady uk world leader has anounced he will resign opponent of shady uk world leader has also anounced he will resign too damn rage quiters
gaming,not_removed,i didnt like how the battle of hastings turned out please sign my petition to have a rematch
gaming,not_removed,i was told wed be able to get rid of all the damn aliens
gaming,not_removed,we still get all that xcom money put into our health care right
gaming,not_removed,yeah but we expect xcom to still give us money
gaming,not_removed,could somebody please explain this joke to me im a bit out of the loop
gaming,not_removed,luckily the veterans who voted to leave were unable to turn on the computer while the new recruits who were tech savy mostly didnt bother to appear to vote and instead used social media to complain about old people afterwards
gaming,not_removed,lol
gaming,not_removed,lol
gaming,not_removed,well not that many
gaming,not_removed,they decided to spend that xcom money to build a wall agains the illegal aliens
gaming,not_removed,but the point of the xcom project was to keep out illegal aliens
gaming,not_removed,the good news is that with full satellite coverage of ireland we can research jameson molotovs
gaming,not_removed,british internet operators facing energy crisis as millions rush to google snake lady tits while also turning their kettles on simultaneously
gaming,not_removed,yeah thats what i never understood about the panic levels like hey our country is getting sacked im going to stop supporting the only alien defense force
gaming,not_removed,doesnt xcom canonially loose
gaming,not_removed,xcom enemy unknown released in
gaming,not_removed,what do you do when you beat this game start an ironman impossible game no reloads when you lose all your guys to some bullshit they cant hit the side of a barn at pointblank and the superbuff aliens shoot fizzing green death with insane accuracy from across the map any mission that doesnt end with a squadwipe is a victory if you beat that take a break on your throne of alien skulls
gaming,not_removed,get xcom and realize you lost even though you won proceed to enact sweet sweet revenge on advent and alien scum with your team of customized bad asses i recommend the more countries mod so you can have a full squad of guys and gals from namibia sri lanka cameroon luxembourg kazakhstan and palestine
gaming,not_removed,i mean even if xcom is corrupt and expensive if your only choices are corrupt organization providing a slim hope of human victory and absolutely certain subjugation or cleansing i think you still should go with the first one
gaming,not_removed,the xcom project can only do so much too many aliens too little money must prioritize important areas
gaming,not_removed,perhaps if the xcom project didnt constantly fail despite being incredibly expensive and corrupt being incredibly expensive and corrupt corrupt something tells me you have no idea what corrupt means and are using it because you dislike it
gaming,not_removed,im german so i kinda just cry about both
gaming,not_removed,or be in the xcom kareoke night
gaming,not_removed,it says right there there in the picture
gaming,not_removed,tbf france pull their weight to not sure how us brits were doing before we voted out but i guess economics wise we were pulling our weight its just we didnt agree on much with other countries when it came to politics
gaming,not_removed,i believe i just got
gaming,not_removed,rcringe
gaming,not_removed,congratulations you made a shit pun and put it in big bold letters and got a few upvotes for it maybe you should write a speech thanking everyone
gaming,not_removed,youre pretty new around here you get used to having comments with points after a while
gaming,not_removed,anglosaxons need to get out of britain bloody foreigners should go back to germany and denmark make britain celtic again
gaming,not_removed,oh absolutely i mean we put it on a bus so it must be true
gaming,not_removed,best thing there is that they will lose the cornish pasty protection status until the uk government sets up something similar they love that cornish pasty protection
gaming,not_removed,nobodies explaining what xcom is though im sure you already know about brexit and yeah yeah yeah xcom is a game where you command an extra governmental military force that fights an alien threat called xcom you use the monthly funding from the countries in the world to go in missions to various countries to reduce their panic level ignore a country for too long then their panic level will max out and leave the xcom project taking all of their resources and funding with them in this case the uk so its relevant considering the current news climate
gaming,not_removed,but in the end still needed to to let illegal aliens in to get access to those nice alien artifacts for research and development
gaming,not_removed,well actually its to shoot them in the face and steal their stuff
gaming,not_removed,well they stop supporting you because you do a really bad job at saving their ass
gaming,not_removed,iirc they only lost because many countries pulled out of the project early and left them with no resources
gaming,not_removed,i think its closer to the aliens took over before xcom even really got off the ground
gaming,not_removed,to be fair i would never play the actual ironman mode i play by ironman rules but i reserve the right to reload when the game straight up bugs out or i misclick which is pretty easy with how finicky the interface can sometimes be
gaming,not_removed,bigger
gaming,not_removed,lol so sorry sir wont happen again
gaming,not_removed,i am new thats why i was celebrating my first i will also have to get used to being berated for getting excited about something p
gaming,not_removed,still uk cant grant it at a european level other countries can start producing their own cornish pasty
gaming,not_removed,same with the cumbrian sausage before anyone asks yes that is a porn star
gaming,not_removed,the uk protects pastries made of corn or pastys as you call them like some in the us luckily america is full of corn and will send you all the corn pastries and english muffins you desire
gaming,not_removed,though to be clear
gaming,not_removed,to be fair of the votes were to remain in the eu in a prime ministerial election that kind of split wouldnt be enough for a definite decision
gaming,not_removed,the whole thing about how isnt a mandate was cited by nigel farage as well before the referendum also the petition for a second referendum was started by a brexit supporter before the referendum was even held anyway btw stats stating the age of voters are generally either inaccurate or false for this vote as there were no official exit polls done
gaming,not_removed,uses the term butthurt millennials opinion discarded
gaming,not_removed,but im all that exists to save their ass what are they gonna do with the money they are saving die slightly less immediately
gaming,not_removed,hm sucks
gaming,not_removed,so you never had a chance from the beginning
gaming,not_removed,honestly its your enthusiasm for meaningless internet points
gaming,not_removed,eh jerks are jerks you will get berated for pretty much everything you say on reddit just ignore them
gaming,not_removed,or better yet dont get excited for pointless shit fucking christ is that so hard
gaming,not_removed,theyre just protecting the name so companies in another county or country cant call their version a cornish pasty and make money of the name its the same as champagne has to be from a particular area of france or its just sparkling wine edit anndddd i just seen your username ಠರೃ
gaming,not_removed,if you do the actual research instead of relying on reddit to give you your fucking opinions you find out that only about searchers looked for what is the eu after britain left the eu it was a sensationalist news story
gaming,not_removed,because us remain voters know what we were voting for
gaming,not_removed,how do we know it was leave voters who searched this statistics
gaming,not_removed,still they should probably revote just to make sure they really want to leave
gaming,not_removed,not sure what you mean by a prime ministerial election but in electing a party leader the winner is declared as soon as a candidate reaches of the votes
gaming,not_removed,throw an endoftheworld party
gaming,not_removed,not in the timeline no
gaming,not_removed,fair enough i guess i just got a little excited someone actually took notice of something i said
gaming,not_removed,lol im not hurt i expect it on reddit but thanks blitz d
gaming,not_removed,i understand your frustration but really who gives a fuck i dont actually care about fake points i was merely poking fun at the fact that more people noticed one single stupid post of mine than every other one ever put together it doesnt even matter to me you guys are more care about me commenting on it than i care about my posts points
gaming,not_removed,so what does that make a pasty not from the uk cause i have a nearby place that specifically sells cornish pasties here in the us are those american pasties than or does this just apply to europe
gaming,not_removed,but how many more couldnt be bothered to google it xfiles music
gaming,not_removed,but reddit commenters in rgaming are my news source as someone who voted out reading through these posts makes me irrationally angry before anyone asks i wont say why it leads to shit throwing i just want you all to know you are more uninformed that probably any leave voters and always fall for sensationalist and bent truth news
gaming,not_removed,you must polish the mirror free of anger to see god ultimately i would rather be free and in love than be right
gaming,not_removed,thats not how voting works you get one vote not best of three
gaming,not_removed,yes lets keep revoting until the people make the correct choice s
gaming,not_removed,yeah because there are more partys than there were choices in the referendum when there are two options isnt as impressive as when there are four options
gaming,not_removed,unless paul of hindenborough appoints adolph hiedlerton as prime minister
gaming,not_removed,he means a general election which in the uk is used to elect the governing party it operates on the completely ridiculous first past the post system where each little constituency votes for an mp from the list of parties of which there are quite a lot and that mp takes a seat in the house of commons the party that gets a clear majority of the seats becomes the government if you want to understand why this is basically bollocks you have to break it down to a simple model say we have parties labour conservative liberal democrats in all the constituencies these parties put forward a candidate imagine now that the result of the election was like this conservatives of seats labour of seats liberal democrats of seats the tories would become the majority government labour would become the opposition in reality this would not be a clear majority and would become a hung parliament but forget that for now and the liberal democrats would be dust why is that bollocks because if you looked at the breakdown you might see something like this all the seats the tories won tory voters lib dem voters labour voters and in the labour held seats labour voters lib dem voters labour voters this would mean that even though of the people across the country voted libdem and only voted for labour and conservative respectively more or less this isnt accurate maths libdem gets no representation at all despite being the choice of almost half the country and the other two get to be the big dogs despite commanding a smaller proportion of the overall vote this gets real messy when you have small party like the green party who definitely get some percentage of the vote and no representation at all whilst the government can run the house on of the seats even though each mp might have only got of the vote overall tldr general elections in the uk are an absolute trainwreck and the only winners are the cunts in parliament fuck them all
gaming,not_removed,im not calling for a second referendum i voted in the first one and i didnt win i saw that of the people who voted want us to leave so im fine with that i cite nigel farage because hes the most prominent campaigner for the brexit side but yes i think hes a shitty bastard who has never done his job properly honestly i hope to move to the eu within the next two years so hopefully it wont matter much for me whether we stay or leave other then it being more of a ball ache to travel back and forth i just find it a bit sad the direction our country is going i just find it silly that brexit voters are insulting remainers for stuff they would of done anyway if they had lost instead of acting like adults and treating each other with respect a lrage majority of both remain and brexit voters have descended to childish insults and namecalling also itd be great if the brexit camp had bothered to come up with a plan for when they won so that we wouldnt be in such a shit state at the moment but im guessing thats too much to ask considering that both boris johnson and nigel farage conceded defeat after only areas had their votes tallied
gaming,not_removed,most of the outrage is that the general decision to leave the eu effects the younger generations more prominently than the older generation you know because the younger live longer than the old demographics of the votes show that the older generation voted leave as a big majority where as the younger generation voted to remain because we know exactly what it means financially where as a large portion of the older generation voting to leave our doing it on their attitude towards immigration dey took ma jerb combine that with people who voted leave going on live tv and saying i voted leave but because i didnt think it would make a difference and that we would remain and now we are leaving im genuinely concerned and wish i had voted remain and you have a lot of very angry young adults who feel we have been cheated its essentially having everyone in a lifeboat safe floating nothing needs to change and then having all the old people decide that their knees are hurting so they want stick a knife in the lifeboat and take everyone down with them
gaming,not_removed,dammit now i regret that i never played xcom the story seems to be pretty cool
gaming,not_removed,theres something upsetting about that comment
gaming,not_removed,i believe the protection status only applies to europethe eu
gaming,not_removed,average redditor average person remain voters on this site are so smug and are certain that everyone who voted leave is a racist immigrant hateridiot on wellfare its ironic they hate on brexit voters for being racist for being against mass immigration that is mainly from poor white countries no less and yet dont see how they are hypocrites for insulting someone based on their income the uk is far more classist than it is racist or sexist and the backlash against the vote result by overpriveleged bourgeoisie university students proves this easily i think brexit was the right choice but im not such a twat that i decide that everyone who disagrees with me is automatically an idiot edit because i apparently dont check for spelling errors before posting
gaming,not_removed,pity nobody told that to all the people calling the electoral services over the following days asking if they could change their vote or the dumb as fuck hipsters who voted leave when they really wanted to remain because they thought it would stick it to the man and didnt believe the rest of the country would actually vote that way people in the uk are dumb as fuck and im ashamed to be british right now
gaming,not_removed,sounds like you doubt youd win a second time around
gaming,not_removed,those numbers are extremely close to what we had in the presidential election
gaming,not_removed,every voting system has its pros and cons in reality your extreme examples dont actually happen obviously so it isnt that perverse besides anything that keeps the green nutters out of the way cant be all bad
gaming,not_removed,and in the labour held seats labour voters lib dem voters labour voters labour voters and labour voters is that an error or am i just stupid
gaming,not_removed,i just find it silly that brexit voters are insulting remainers for stuff they would of done anyway if they had lost but remainers would have done the same to the leavers if the leavers lost so it is fair
gaming,not_removed,its also due to the fact that the leave campaign was fought entirely on lies that have been renegged on already and at no point did anybody on either side actually attempt to educate people on what the eu is what it does and how it works the result of all this is a public that was basically forced to make an emotions based response on a complex and delicate issue i am not fighting to hold a second referendum im fighting to strike out the decision of the other referendum as invalid and not have a referendum about this at all its not because im upset that i didnt get my way its because im upset that the public were not properly informed of the consequences or facts behind their decision and were told to make the choice anyway an uninformed voting populace is an incapable voting populace and any decision it makes shouldnt be held as gospel
gaming,not_removed,the canonical ending is basically a metanarrative on the players most people didnt win their first play through and id assume early on
gaming,not_removed,omg there is lol i really need to watch what i say i sound like a dumb teenage female today i need to stop commenting
gaming,not_removed,question other than because of immigrants why did you vote leave im not ragging on you at all im giving you the benefit of the doubt that your decision wasnt solely based on immigration i really have two questions for leave voters what was it that made you decide that way now that its happened what is the future of the uk that you would want to see
gaming,not_removed,i voted remain and the way many people in the remain camp acted before the vote is a travesty i blame them for remain losing instead of trying to outline the advantages of the eu and the dangers of leaving they were so confident of victory that many simply insulted the leave side mocked them and accused them of racism sprinkled in with a little the uk will collapse and people will resort to cannibalism if you leave now more than ever we all need to work together to pull through the probable eu split and then theyre still there trying to split the uk apart still accusing the leave voters of racism and fascism trying to lump them all with the actual racists
gaming,not_removed,the whole thing was a shambles with extreme lying and scare moungering from both sides i know a lot of people who didnt know what to do and i was one of them hell i still dont know whats best for us but only time can tell
gaming,not_removed,its anti democratic to keep voting until one side gets what they wants
gaming,not_removed,im not in the uk weird assumption elections dont work by oh they won lets vote again so that everyone who didnt bother voting can vote again there are so many reasons you get one vote not vote until you get the result you want
gaming,not_removed,i never said that your argument is wrong i just think its not fair to compare a referendum with two choices to the prime ministerial election
gaming,not_removed,accidentally wrote labour twice should have been tory
gaming,not_removed,because if you campaign for such a massive decision to be made you should have atleast made a plan also you say it was a remain government but it wasnt it was asplit government but the person taking camerons job is most likely going to be a brexit supporter so they should have a plan and they should be announcing that plan to the public every politician on the side of brexit should have a plan preferably together of what they want to do i mean christ the green party even made a plan for if brexit succeeded
gaming,not_removed,its also due to the fact that the leave campaign was fought entirely on lies this remain campaign did nothing but educate the country of the effects of leaving the eu as forms of warnings and facts and like you said the entirety of the leave campaign propaganda was lies fact
gaming,not_removed,butthurt millennials the majority of which are naive idealistic and dumb and really have no idea about any financial impact to resort to ageism lol
gaming,not_removed,older generation have paid more into the system than the younger generations logical on the basis that theyve been in the system longer so not much of a statement exiting the eu has caused britain to rip up all its trade agreements its exit directly has a negative effect on other members of the eu which we now need to negotiate new trade agreements with these can take decades to right sometimes and you can bet us leaving and causing disruption in other economies isnt going to make negotiations easy what does britain offer we barely export anything of worth why would anybody want to rush a trade agreement when they can get the imports from else where i dont believe all of the older generation are racists or merely xenophobes but saying that a large majority of the older generation didnt base their votes on those things when the older generation is clearly and openly racist is plain ignorant i dont need to validate why people should have voted remain it will be all too clear in the coming years
gaming,not_removed,the eu since its beginning has only gotten more powerful and more centralised westminster polititians are made to look important but while in the eu theyre not nearly as powerful as foreign men and women who should not have any power over our laws a country that finds itself in a position where it literally cannot say no is not a powerful one all of the things the remain campaign said about our trading turned out to be exaggerated fear mongering in the end as well immediately after brexit germany canada and the usa all went straight for trade agreements everyone clambering to get one the uk economy will recover in time the bank of england was clever enough to have contingency plans for the event the eu didnt and assumed that remain would win and thus had a mini political meltdown when the results came in and had to call emergency meetings the uk i want to see is a strong one that trades and maintains a strong friendship with its neighbours we dont hate europe and we dont want hard feelings about leaving the union we dont want to see a vindictive europe that tries to punish us for the decision but if thats the way they want to be then so be it well rise above anyone who wants to act like children and will surely be happy to trade with those who act like adults
gaming,not_removed,scaremongering but also a lot of unnecessary condescension i was really disappointed in jk rowlings when she went off on claiming voldemort was on the side of leave that the people who support leave are a bunch of minitrumps and then spoke condescendingly towards anyone considering leave by saying that you arent necessarily racists but a lot of racists seem to agree with you
gaming,not_removed,i apologise it may not be an ideal comparison as elections are won by the number of constituenciesseats not a direct percentage of the national vote and typically not between only candidates in any case my initial point is the referendum was decided by a vote of to percent and its not necessarily fair to tar the whole country with a you made your bed attitude it was still nearly half of the voters who wanted to stay
gaming,not_removed,especially since fptp is complete dogshit as a tool for electing a representative governing body so sad i wasnt able to vote in that referendum
gaming,not_removed,ah okay now it makes sense
gaming,not_removed,i wouldnt say remain tried to educate anybody all remain did was throw out the vague threat of consequences rather than try to tell everyone why it would be a disaster to leave they should have focused on emphasising the way the eu benefits us and come up with a plan for eu reformation should they win instead people saw a system that they believed did nothing and were happy to risk any consequences to see some form of change both sides handled the whole thing so badly that the referendum should be considered invalid due to an uninformed electorate and should be held again in a decade after a period of more transparent government what a world that would be eh
gaming,not_removed,sounds like a reasonable vision for the future my only worry is that westminster politicians are a load of infighting pillocks basically none of them so far have offered up any sort of sensible plan for going forward and it looks like most of the major leave campaigners dont want to touch the issue at all now were really lacking a strong guiding presence in uk politics from all sides as a labour supporter i just cant help but despair when corbyn says nothing of any real meaning on any issue taking a wait and see stance even when were in the thick of things and now is stubbornly refusing to admit hes made a cock up of it whilst his whole party turns on him cameron quit presumably to hand over to someone on the leave side that had an idea of what to do next but they all seem to have been caught with their trousers down boris has stood down because hes completely gutless turd and if jeremy hunt gets anywhere near the pm seat i seriously will consider leaving the country because the guy is a clown plain and simple
gaming,not_removed,its funny you say act like children when one of the frontfigures travels to brussels and insults everyone in the room and the other frontfigure announces that he has quit great responsibility they have there way to stand up for people that really believed in them and be accepting as for brexit i sincerely hope britian doesnt fall apart because almost half of britian who voted didnt vote for the impeccable risks that lie ahead i really hope you can strike deals with everyone but to be naive about it and say that everything will be easy isnt really helping the brexiters facade again as a swede i know our relation is extremely valued between the countries and i hope it remains that way regardless of what the vote said or didnt say
gaming,not_removed,in any case my initial point is the referendum was decided by a vote of to percent and its not necessarily fair to tar the whole country with a you made your bed attitude it was still nearly half of the voters who wanted to stay oh i can agree with that
gaming,not_removed,im not saying you not allowed to by all means go ahead im just pointing out that it seems a bit silly to build your antiageism argument on ageism i mean the sentence really seems to be one of those throwing stones while living in a glass house situations its like when pretentious is in itself a really pretentious word
gaming,not_removed,you sound like people who say i am black i cant be racist just saying
gaming,not_removed,hitchens razor whats that
gaming,not_removed,zzzzzzz
gaming,not_removed,well jeremy hunt is a cunt but yeah its as if no one wants to run the uk now even though everything will calm down very soon
gaming,not_removed,they better fucking make it dead space ended on a cliffhanger to end all cliffhangers
gaming,not_removed,changeorg is a fuckin joke nowadays
gaming,not_removed,detailed is definitely up for debate but this is sort of like saying the had photorealistic graphics and then point to the mansion in resident evil its technically true while sort of dishonest at the same time and what you can make a system do in a tech demo is never representative of the actual system theres just all sorts of problems with pointing to a few seconds of demo footage and acting like just showing that footage is its own argument
gaming,not_removed,is the specific point i was referring to it seems they are using the same texel based technology behind unlimited detail texels really do work just maybe not dynamically in games though
gaming,not_removed,is this serious
gaming,not_removed,thats really impressive
gaming,not_removed,if you want to see a modern implementation of the technology on uptodate hardware its not just static objects in demos sure on a year old computer that would be the case but voxels can be used to bring extreme detail to a laptop
gaming,not_removed,yes it is really running on a year old dinosaur of a pc with modern technology imagine the possibilities of voxel based engines
gaming,not_removed,if you think thats impressive at the end of the video it even shows squares representing individual blades of grass we only saw detail like that with flower on the
gaming,not_removed,if you havent gotten ultima weapon then you should grind for that personally i love the keyblade you get after defeating sephiroth as its criticals but i dont think its in the original version so check up on that

gaming,not_removed,personally i like it but you may want to go with something with a little more broad appeal
gaming,not_removed,the part after would start with my hand on the webcam and once i remove my hand it goes into the game it is what i would use for my videos looking for any criticism advice
gaming,not_removed,perfect i want it to be exactly that i want it to catch you right away put your face into a stinky pile of cringe if it is somewhat interesting people may stick around and give me chance wellwould you
gaming,not_removed,i dont watch gaming channels but i would recommend maybe being a little more interactive with the intro
gaming,not_removed,well i would consider this the ice breaker and if you look at my first comment youll see what i plan to do after this cringe which would be where i become more lively

gaming,not_removed,the one at the halloween store by my house is called sidekick bros
gaming,not_removed,wtf oo
gaming,not_removed,at first i thought this was dennis
gaming,not_removed,you seem to have misspelled banned from gta online you see you spelled it as shamed easy mistake to make
gaming,not_removed,pc is by far the biggest market thats what happened years ago there were million active steam accounts as of december the sold mil units and the xbox one mil units according to sony and microsoft combined thats still far fewer total console sales than active steam users years ago and steam has only grown not to mention that steam is one of several digital distribution platforms it does not represent the whole pc market the fact that current gen consoles are basically weak pcs also likely helped much easier to develop cross platform nowadays
gaming,not_removed,nothing its what changed in the console market i think consoles nowadays use a more or less same structure as modern computers so devkits for consoles and their codebase are more close to a computer making porting way easier im guessing it all cones down to finances and calculations before it wouldve been difficiult for a company to earn money on pc because of easy piracy and that was not worth rhe development time for porting now the that time is drastically or could be cut and it allows for more income thats what i think
gaming,not_removed,one developer branching out after years doesnt mean the market has changed they just decided to try working on a new platform
gaming,not_removed,im pretty sure your some year old kid that hates nintendo just because its for kids and swears on cod chat ill have you know ocarina of time is one of the few games that got on ign try that one if you havent

gaming,not_removed,thats a spicy pasta
gaming,not_removed,let me take a shot at it you say that this mediocre game with childtier storytelling mechanics and tedious quests managed to waste the childhoods of thousands of redditors while making them think they were somehow special for beating a mass marketed childrens game but how many call of duty hours do you have under your belt k
gaming,not_removed,ocarina of time was pretty revolutionary for the time people enjoy different things
gaming,not_removed,what a whiney bitch let me lay something down for you here and now boy no one asked for your shit review of a legendary game series a series loved by millions a series that inspired much of todays gaming industry and propelled a humble company to the forefront who are you what have you ever done in your short pitiful life that you could assume the arrogance to challenge the gaming dynasty that is the legend of zelda you say youve spent at your time outside great good for you youll make your parents proud no feck off and go back outside and leave the reviewing to professionals have a nice day
gaming,not_removed,if youre just ranting to get it off your chest then fine but ive got some questions for you which games did you play and how old are you which games do what zelda is trying to do better
gaming,not_removed,zelda should never be about the story it should be about exploring a big world meeting new and interesting people and killing them then solving puzzles with boomerangs theres two ways to explain itits been getting worse or weve been getting better w what used to be secretive or obsure is just annoying and obvious
gaming,not_removed,que
gaming,not_removed,so what do you want a medal or something you dont like it good for you go outdoors and fuck off then no one cares people like you are the worst the ill just insult something everyone seems to love then pretend that im not an ass because im just expressing my opinion type of person
gaming,not_removed,what genre of games do you usually play if you dont mind my asking i personally think zelda is great for the action rpg genre really comes down to play style and pace
gaming,not_removed,how do you feel about systems

gaming,not_removed,pretty sure it was skyward sword

gaming,not_removed,weve seen some shit havent we well thats enough internetting for today
gaming,not_removed,ur crying over lines of text on a website and im wasting my time this brings great humor and joy to me
gaming,not_removed,what are you talking about my interest in motorcycles since when is riding up trails in the wilderness not outdoorsy
gaming,not_removed,grasping for straws now
gaming,not_removed,srsly
gaming,not_removed,haha
gaming,not_removed,ur crying over lines of text on a website this should be entertaining please point out to me where i was crying im pretty sure if you read your op youre the one crying in rage over sprites who spew about total sentences lmao you are the reason i continue to visit reddit i do enjoy the childish outbursts and inability to create coherent conversation puts a smile on my face every time
gaming,not_removed,fleshlight
gaming,not_removed,and here we have a wild asshole trolling the great forums of reddit watch as it grabs for its prey by calling him crybaby but the prey escapes ready to fight another day
gaming,not_removed,k
gaming,not_removed,but how many call of duty hours do you have under your belt k yea def throwing around some fightin words there just calm down man its a video game
gaming,not_removed,seems like weve reached an agreement
gaming,not_removed,and he comes back for a second response to my reply even though i havent retorted yet whos wasting time now
gaming,not_removed,haha hes still angry
gaming,not_removed,haha i dont think so i was just responding to the shit in my inbox
gaming,not_removed,same
gaming,not_removed,httpshaveibeenpwnedcompwnedwebsitescdprojektred according to the website the breach happened on the first of march and contained email addresses salted passwords and usernames according to the email why are you only hearing about this now whilst the breach occurred in march sometimes there can be a lengthy lead time of months or even years before the data is disclosed publicly have i been pwned will always attempt to alert you asap its just a question of how readily available the data is
gaming,not_removed,pretty funny when even esl players get spooked like that on occasion you get so tense playing this game that someone popping around a corner can startle the shit out of you
gaming,not_removed,flip a coin heads is tails is xbox
gaming,not_removed,i own both the exclusives at the moment all go to with some great games coming out last of us horizon zero dawn days gone the os is probably also slightly slicker than on x box but i have to say xbox live and general online playfeel in my opinion is a hell of a lot better on x box
gaming,not_removed,is the best
gaming,not_removed,i own neither but i would say just because of the last of us which i do want to play despite disliking really all zombie games
gaming,not_removed,as someone who owns both if depends on what you want out of it if you want to use your console for something besides just gaming like for movies tv etc then the xbox is the way to go i prefer its os for that sort of thing but on the other hand games on the generally look better and run smoother not to mention the communities for games seem to be larger on than xbox one in the long run you couldnt go wrong with either one imo they both have their pros and cons
gaming,not_removed,wii u
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i have both consoles and i prefer the i find the os and ui is much better the xbox freezes up temporarily sometimes just for a few seconds the way an old computer does when you try to do too many things at once but it does it when you try to scroll through a page in the store at a higher rate than game a second its not that big of a deal but its kind of disappointing for console that came out a few months ago
gaming,not_removed,does anyone actually have a valid argument or reason why an xbox is better other than just a few exclusives which dont compete with sonys im not jealous of anyone that has an xbox or ever have thought for a second to get one even if it was a used one for super cheap
gaming,not_removed,virtual boy
gaming,not_removed,pc
gaming,not_removed,i have both and takes it cleanly
gaming,not_removed,have both has great exclusives like unchartered and last of us but i prefer xbox better controller and better homescreen etc it also has forza is lacking good racing games
gaming,not_removed,xbox one too easy next
gaming,not_removed,as you requested i flipped a coin for you the result was heads for more informationto complain about me see rflipacoinbot
gaming,not_removed,i like the way you think
gaming,not_removed,lacking good racing games you have project cars and assetto on both way better than that dumpster fire of a game forza
gaming,not_removed,cant wait to get some melee kills later today
gaming,not_removed,thats a little bit of a heart warming acknowledgement terrible what happened to those passengers my thoughts go out to their families and loved ones
gaming,not_removed,lay witness to the monstrous power of the destroyer class spaceships in starlight rogue they will lay waste to the common fighters without the blink of an eye should you not be careful also notice in the video there is different factions going at each other in other news time slows down when you kill an enemy ship or if you blow off a component to emphasis the feeling of power added a score system based on the total health of the ship that you destroy changed the interface hud popups to autohide when not needed so that the game feels more immersive to come next more weapon types more ships better procedural generation please leave your feedback as it helps every bit of the development process check out our reddit to be the first to know any updates and to know more about the game httpredditcomrstarlightrogue
gaming,not_removed,dont post on reddit begging for likes and subscribers
gaming,not_removed,fizz broken yasuao broken zed broken so many champs in league of broken
gaming,not_removed,ive been meaning to try that one with vr as well
gaming,not_removed,why not just get a vita or
gaming,not_removed,can you tell a bit more about the gamepad i mean whats the look and feel do you enjoy gaming on it and such it looks pretty good from that perspective
gaming,not_removed,its a ripoff of xbox and nintendo xbox colours and nintendo button configuration
gaming,not_removed,yh of course it feels really good has a solid grip all the buttons are intact feels really solid the two analogs works perfectly and its very useful when playing racing and open world games and the triggers feel awesome it really make mobile gaming fun its called gamevice and its sold by apple
gaming,not_removed,lol its not its sold by apple and its just a mobile gaming controller
gaming,not_removed,wow another repost
gaming,not_removed,and then they beat you doing dumb shit
gaming,not_removed,when youre favourite game is single player only
gaming,not_removed,smite come at me guys

gaming,not_removed,nfl street come at me
gaming,not_removed,i wouldve gone for the vin diesel quote from triple x i live for this shit but this is good too
gaming,not_removed,good one thanks for sharing
gaming,not_removed,it always takes some trials
gaming,not_removed,total but last two weeks i think something went wrong there
gaming,not_removed,yeah i dunno how it works p got a good start into my first ever civ game though
gaming,not_removed,i bet those fur pelts used to be brownorange
gaming,not_removed,sleeping well after rubbing one off
gaming,not_removed,thats disturbinghave you seen skyrims houses the kids dont get their own rooms mine does but thats because i respect their privacyand im usually off killing people
gaming,not_removed,that switch better be made out of fucking gold to cost that much
gaming,not_removed,you can still buy mine if you want i finished zelda and see nothing of value on the horizon
gaming,not_removed,this is like the flappy bird iphones all over again just because someone won the bid doesnt mean they actually paid for it
gaming,not_removed,it wasnt an auction though
gaming,not_removed,i disagree
gaming,not_removed,so op hows the autism treatin ya
gaming,not_removed,more like guy who think guy who game is proper grammar
gaming,not_removed,eh ever seen the people who only use a single bird per level
gaming,not_removed,reeee
gaming,not_removed,rgatekeeping
gaming,not_removed,prime example of the government trying to shutdown and keep quiet the devolution of human kind due to chemtrails in the skies people and radiation emitting cancerous mobile devices the chemicals are killing the birds thats why there angry
gaming,not_removed,true gamers play on all systems youre just a fanboy
gaming,not_removed,kinda ironic how op tried to mock someone elses intelligence with this
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,you seem pretty insecure to post this garbage
gaming,not_removed,you forgot yer late to the party but soon to arrive
gaming,not_removed,this has to be fake the xbox skull has all its teeth
gaming,not_removed,whats the difference if someone plays on pc or mobile gaming is gaming
gaming,not_removed,arbitrary elitist bullshit
gaming,not_removed,my yr old disagrees
gaming,not_removed,down voted because gaming should be inclusive for everyone
gaming,not_removed,i have a pc xbone and wii u and i dont call myself a gamer
gaming,not_removed,rgatekeeping
gaming,not_removed,butits still a game isnt it this logic
gaming,not_removed,mobile gaming on cell phones is a more recent adaptation than all those other platforms evolve
gaming,not_removed,i got dis sweet vr headset for netflix mobile yo
gaming,not_removed,dont joke on autism dude not cool
gaming,not_removed,my first thought is this meme was made by guy who for english is second language
gaming,not_removed,true gamer is not a badge of honour you piece of human waste
gaming,not_removed,rich gamers play on all systems
gaming,not_removed,hahahah i stopped denying i was a gamer nerd when i was passing by random store and it had an old looking arcade machine but the artstyle was neat and the controls looked intersstong so i paid a quarter to try it out just cuz it was a game i never seen before lol
gaming,not_removed,and the phone isnt a system
gaming,not_removed,how else are people going to feel arbitrarily superior to others
gaming,not_removed,its the type of games and the reasons for why theyre made mobile games by design are just to entertain you for a while and designed to make you keep coming back and hopefully have you spend money you cant really compare the level of product satisfaction you get with something like angry birds and the last of us or uncharted or final fantasy or metal gear or any console game that isnt an arcade game even then console arcade games are far too different when compared to mobile games that being said there are some mobile games that are pretty cool its an emerging market and at this point in time i personally dont call it gaming but that isnt to detract from the fact that it can be just get me more visual novels with tons of feels on my moto x and ill be a gamer on my mobile phone
gaming,not_removed,the same difference between a and a bicycle you heretic
gaming,not_removed,thank you
gaming,not_removed,go kill ur self
gaming,not_removed,seriously it isnt a joke or an insult
gaming,not_removed,for whom
gaming,not_removed,like yourself
gaming,not_removed,you guys let a computer determine your games rules bah true gamers play tabletop rpgs
gaming,not_removed,not me
gaming,not_removed,mobile games by design are just to entertain you for a while and designed to make you keep coming back and hopefully have you spend money you just described most modern aaa games filled with micro transactions maybe the mobile gamer knows when to append s to the end of verbs in english grammar
gaming,not_removed,vainglory is a pretty dope mobile game if you like mobas always dropping new charachters and skins and occasionally new game modes and what not
gaming,not_removed,pls play deemo and say that me again
gaming,not_removed,is that you
gaming,not_removed,you let reality determine your games rules bah true gamers transcend reality itself
gaming,not_removed,that business model was taken from mobile games and embedded onto full aaa productions theres enough evidence to point out that the publishers are the ones that mostly push for microtransactions and not the developers i think the whole microtransaction problem has actually gone down in recent months and games like bf have them yet theyre a mere addition that isnt pervasive within the games confines granted i am oddly optimistic here because im usually pessimistic and cynical like a mofo
gaming,not_removed,never heard of that game up until now read up on it as well it sounds like a good example for the potential that mobile games have as i have stated but i also have to say that you cant have this one game carry the industry you cant have one defining product while the rest are mediocre money leeches so i will say it to you again and ask that if we believe in mobile games that we begin to ask for some quality to them learn that maybe to get better ones we might have to start paying for them because freemium games dont usually cut it
gaming,not_removed,fair enough my response wasnt completely serious anyway but i definitely believe that rhythm games is one of the core game genres that works very well on mobile hopefully well see other genres improve as well in the future
gaming,not_removed,remember the one two punch
gaming,not_removed,xbox or playstation either way i would try uninstalling the game completely then re installing from disk
gaming,not_removed,xbox
gaming,not_removed,is such a new release i am confused
gaming,not_removed,yeah worst optimized game anyone anywhere has ever played
gaming,not_removed,its basically just cause but it runs like shit
gaming,not_removed,wow you know how much they cost back in the day
gaming,not_removed,mmmm that is truly satisfying
gaming,not_removed,i vaguely remembering buying an card for like a long long time ago brings back some good memories
gaming,not_removed,for that much man that would a be a steal back in the day
gaming,not_removed,jailbreak doesnt do anything to it cp is server side stuff keep the jailbreak jailbreakings cool
gaming,not_removed,first i read jailbait and thought of cp meaning child porn god i have to sleep more
gaming,not_removed,not helping 🙃🙃🙃
gaming,not_removed,sonya blade does in one of the mortal kombats i think
gaming,not_removed,pretty sure feng wei and lars alexandersson from tekken are both kenpo characters
gaming,not_removed,is the best optimized game ive ever played it is also pretty good after about hours the game starts having you redo some missions youve done alongside the new ones a ton of side missions so on i really recommend it
gaming,not_removed,it depends what you are into really both are open world but mgs is more serious apart from some moments just cause has a shitty storyline but its plain fun to wreck havoc
gaming,not_removed,i have not played just cause but i have played every single mgs you may benefit from not playing mgs since the because this mgs doesnt follow the same formula as the previous ones mgsv is open world and doesnt require you to be stealthy of the time so it allows you to pretty much tackle the game in any way you choose the game is pretty lengthy and may be repetitive for some it depends how much you enjoy what the game has to offer my suggestion is to watch some gameplay of mgsv and see if it looks fun
gaming,not_removed,mgsv no dispute
gaming,not_removed,is that not the normal way to ride a chocobo how do other people mount their birds
gaming,not_removed,what are you talking about i see nothing wrong here
gaming,not_removed,ha
gaming,not_removed,look ma no hands
gaming,not_removed,almost looks like hes trying to choke the chocobo
gaming,not_removed,i think he is training it
gaming,not_removed,this is perfect for promptos assshot collection of noctis mounting his chocobo seriously everytime
gaming,not_removed,nice animations
gaming,not_removed,hello my baby hello my darling hello my ragtime gal
gaming,not_removed,usually with a bottle of wine and some smooth jazz
gaming,not_removed,chocobo improvement
gaming,not_removed,well hes holding onto the reins if you look more like no ass or legs id say
gaming,not_removed,chokocobo
gaming,not_removed,i hope you appreciate the way i set you up for that
gaming,not_removed,i dont like jazz to many extra notes
gaming,not_removed,team work makes the dream work my man
gaming,not_removed,huh
gaming,not_removed,wait till you fire it in a battle with demons kill them all gore boner engaged
gaming,not_removed,the bfg division song is the best on the soundtrack sooo intense and awesome
gaming,not_removed,bfg labs door op is implying there is a fun powerful weapon held within the bfg a series staple
gaming,not_removed,coincidentally as soon as you get the bfg youre dropped into a room with a large horde of possessed ive got the upgraded ammo rune so after killing them all two more bfg ammo dropped d
gaming,not_removed,cant go wrong with a bfg
gaming,not_removed,gotcha makes sense now
gaming,not_removed,rats aint got nuttin on faze
gaming,not_removed,how about this
gaming,not_removed,where
gaming,not_removed,the sword name refers to a sword used in got
gaming,not_removed,oh i thought you meant goy reference not got
gaming,not_removed,i dont get itwhich character were you in your scenario
gaming,not_removed,he is the fat one
gaming,not_removed,if you dont know then you havent played
gaming,not_removed,if you cant explain to the people who are unaware and cannot relate then you should post in witcher subreddit where everybody knows the context
gaming,not_removed,fine ill remove it i changed it a bit to improve it anyways didnt know what i was doing the first time around
gaming,not_removed,its not about removing or keeping the post when youre posting a game specific meme in a common forum you might want to explain it also because not all of us played that game to relate what you want to depict
gaming,not_removed,that font
gaming,not_removed,is there something funny im missing
gaming,not_removed,click the link
gaming,not_removed,what the fuck shit post is this its not supposed to be scaled for that and click the link right there durr durr
gaming,not_removed,no
gaming,not_removed,feudal
gaming,not_removed,why not stop it and start a new franchise
gaming,not_removed,i havent played the games since the american revolution one so im probably missing some details but considering how isolated japan was i dont think it would be a stretch to say the brotherhood and templars were never really there
gaming,not_removed,it was commented on that they wont do it because of the ninja stereotype they then made black flag
gaming,not_removed,that just a ninja technically and tenchu somekind fill that gap
gaming,not_removed,in this case im glad he got tossed
gaming,not_removed,bring it
gaming,not_removed,no its pronounced fwadle
gaming,not_removed,thats what watch dogs was supposed to be it didnt work out
gaming,not_removed,i am going to throw you out of a window
gaming,not_removed,but its already in the lore that they were isnt it
gaming,not_removed,what ninja stereotype ive only heard that they had said it would be one of the worst settings
gaming,not_removed,does that serious even exist anymore wrath of heaven or some shit was the last i recall
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,yeah if you count assassins chronicles china if i remember the name correctly
gaming,not_removed,it was heavily expected that because ninjas were so popular at the time and of course ninjas actually being assassins that it was going to be one of the settings early in the ac life
gaming,not_removed,there was one more and ive heard nothing good about it ever from anyone
gaming,not_removed,probably because no one knows it exists
gaming,not_removed,actually my old roommate had it years before we lived together he loved wrath of heaven but said this one was terrible tenchu z in case you wanna look it up i watched gameplay and decided i agree with him sadly
gaming,not_removed,world of warcraft and roll rogue
gaming,not_removed,why is this being down voted
gaming,not_removed,no clue
gaming,not_removed,because wow sucks
gaming,not_removed,i mean i get you being a karma whore trying to cash in on the battlefield one hype but couldnt you of at least used a relevant picture to
gaming,not_removed,this will be the post they gives me cancer
gaming,not_removed,you ginger donut
gaming,not_removed,not true
gaming,not_removed,i vote mgs i just got into it in february and im hooked there is nothing i do not love about mgs although ive never played re so im biased
gaming,not_removed,both in rotation start with re and when you get stuck or bored play mg when you get bored of mg pop in re
gaming,not_removed,metal gear
gaming,not_removed,mgs has aged better imo that story is timeless even if it does get dramatic and nonsensical at times i love re too but it has a very heavy emphasis on puzzle solving so you might get tired of that more quickly also re isnt nearly as consistent in quality as mgs is as a fan of both series id much rather binge mgs than re
gaming,not_removed,mgs the whole thing is like an awesome adventure id say go for it
gaming,not_removed,mgs snake eater will probably become one of your fav games ever amazing experience
gaming,not_removed,hmm do you have a gamecube
gaming,not_removed,start with re and play until you finish dont bother with or they are trash compared to the earlier games
gaming,not_removed,resident evil if you dont mind just sitting and listening to nonsensical chatter over a radio sometimes for close to half an hour then metal gear is for you
gaming,not_removed,haha both look appealing but the stealth in mgs seems really appealing
gaming,not_removed,this is a cool way to do it i never thought about this i always tend to grind out one game to shit ie in borderlands getting level assassin and siren to without playing another game inbetween
gaming,not_removed,its official haha
gaming,not_removed,okay it looks like mgs then afterwards i definitely want to jump on re
gaming,not_removed,sweet now do i start with metal gear and metal gear solid snake or do i start with metal gear solid kim im brand new to the series haha
gaming,not_removed,awesome i just found out that i can snag for my vita so i can play in bed too super excited to jump into this series man thanks for the recommendation
gaming,not_removed,id happily say that resident evil were both standouts for the era but i couldnt happily pick a favourite if i could only choose one s
gaming,not_removed,id drop to get one if it means i get the best experience
gaming,not_removed,ouch its one of those that didnt transfer over well in the
gaming,not_removed,haha ive been playing csgo lately nonstop im used to nonsensical chatter over comms ill definitely get the re series and alternate it
gaming,not_removed,good choice man i grew up with this series and it just has a special place in my heart
gaming,not_removed,if youre feeling hardcore and want an excuse to play a retro game start at the beginning but you really dont need to i say read a synopsis of and and then jump into because im feeling nice a link that has a plot summary for those two msx games just dont read anything past that
gaming,not_removed,and completely threw away what made resident evil one of the best survivor horror game franchises in favor of a more casual action adventure game i rented when it came out and i couldnt even bring myself to finish the game because of how disgusted i was with what capcom did to the series
gaming,not_removed,this is a very good option
gaming,not_removed,thanks a ton midterms are over in a few days so ill be able to start real soon
gaming,not_removed,im intrigued now id always thought that re was more of an actionadventure game from the beginning without spoilers whats the gameplay like for
gaming,not_removed,survival horror is a subgenre of video games inspired by horror fiction that focuses on survival of the character as the game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary ambience although combat can be part of the gameplay the player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition health speed and vision or through various obstructions of the players interaction with the game mechanics the player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game games make use of strong horror themes like dark mazelike environments and unexpected attacks from enemies wiki description of survival horror that perfectly describe resident evil
gaming,not_removed,well now im more interested in re than i initially was going in i might need to alternate between remgs then thanks for the help man
gaming,not_removed,should have
gaming,not_removed,what movie is this with mel gibson
gaming,not_removed,cheers love
gaming,not_removed,like a scene from a movie
gaming,not_removed,did the first one die from impact from the horse it looked like he totally missed the first guy with the swing but maybe got him with the horse
gaming,not_removed,these beta clips are making my balls so wet right now
gaming,not_removed,that looks so much like battlefront map
gaming,not_removed,my video doesnt play
gaming,not_removed,how the fuck are people already so good at this game
gaming,not_removed,killing campers in this game is some next level shit loving it so far
gaming,not_removed,horsing around
gaming,not_removed,the gritty realism is too much for me
gaming,not_removed,you just killed the starting lineup for the cavaliers
gaming,not_removed,bullets to the chest nah im good demon horse looks at you funny and you fucking flat line immediately i can already tell im going to hate that part
gaming,not_removed,roadkill
gaming,not_removed,horses act like jeeps you dont even have to swing your sword you can just run people over like in
gaming,not_removed,its open beta dude get on that shit
gaming,not_removed,haha
gaming,not_removed,my horse is amazing
gaming,not_removed,kids that dont have a job or social life
gaming,not_removed,hopefully they die a little easier than a jeep does shouldnt take much more than one bullet was trying to understand how that first guy didnt kill the horse
gaming,not_removed,there have been like battlefields
gaming,not_removed,the horses have more fucking health than the jeeps
gaming,not_removed,got a bullseye on a horse with a heavy tank it just kept running only took about points of damage but it was ok i went on to get a kill streak d
gaming,not_removed,nah i have shot many a horse and totally unrealistic about it
gaming,not_removed,no
gaming,not_removed,more than that cupcake
gaming,not_removed,and
gaming,not_removed,and they all play about the same so its easy to pick one up
gaming,not_removed,what does that have to do with having all the time in the world to practice at them i mean you still have to invest the time to get good at the first one that time has to come from somewhere and at least in my experience it never comes from fully grown adults with families and responsibilities it comes from kids that spend hours a day playing the games im not knocking anyone im just saying thats how it works i used to be one hell of a lot better player than i am now too but that was years ago no time to git gud anymore such is life
gaming,not_removed,some people are naturally better than others hours is a huge exaggeration and yes you are knocking people saying they have no lives and whatnot
gaming,not_removed,hours is a huge exaggeration
gaming,not_removed,this actually made me laugh thank you i find it highly amusing that everyone here thinks that im all butthurt and talking smack i couldnt care less that others are better than me i know that most are at this point the person that i responded to asked how people got so good at the game so quickly and i explained how that happened based on my own personal experience with teenagers and young adults that i know for a fact play for hours per day i was never knocking them for it its what they do and they love it id likely do the same thing if i could so right on more power to em i dont understand why so many people are so pissed at me for making a simple fucking observation but whatever it is what it is
gaming,not_removed,yup im sure
gaming,not_removed,the googlyeyed beholder has to make that so much more demoralizing
gaming,not_removed,rip ps nice beholder pipecleaner dedication to even get googly eyes for the tentacles thats commitment
gaming,not_removed,nerd crap im one too
gaming,not_removed,nat saving through
gaming,not_removed,i have one character that i have raised from level and through some bullshitting by me and the dm he is now an iron golem wielding a large vorpal sword with fighter levels his actual sheet was also a victim of along with everything else on my hard drive but luckily i have a backup somewhere
gaming,not_removed,bugetbeholder
gaming,not_removed,sorry to hear that mate may your next character outlive the bbeg
gaming,not_removed,cringe
gaming,not_removed,yeah my dm is pretty amazing
gaming,not_removed,disintegration ray
gaming,not_removed,hurts pal really does
gaming,not_removed,have you played gun game in cod i can shoot you times and youll survive but god forbid that knife grazes my toe i die
gaming,not_removed,no because its for game balance purposes sometimes you have to sacrifice some realism because the game just wont be fun
gaming,not_removed,i think more developers should be revisiting this concept since games like cod and halo popularized unrealistic damagehealth models and quick respawn systems it became the norm there were certainly games before these that had those mechanics but these games became the giants that everyone else copies for familiarity since they reached such a hugh audience games like ghost recon and flashpoint had a fairly realistic damage model where getting shot would decrease your effectiveness in battle and it only took shots to take you out i think there can be ways of making this hardcore concept still accessible and fun like allowing you to take control of other soldiers that are still alive instead of respawning or just staying dead until the next round
gaming,not_removed,i feel like if you just added more damage to the rifles it would definitely be balanced red orchestra does a pretty good job and im sure battlefield can aswell
gaming,not_removed,you can tell thats what everyone wants because red orchestra is the most popular fps franchise of all time
gaming,not_removed,wow you guys are dicks can one not voice constructive criticism
gaming,not_removed,this just gets discussed on reddit a lot usually its regarding ammo management or number of bullets people can walk off i think it should be pretty obvious that true realism in games is a niche interest all the highest selling and most active first person shooters are arcadey because thats more fun to the average gamer verdun and red orchestra have like of the amount of players csgo has and thats not just the luck of the draw i think its great that realistic shooters exist because theres an audience that really want that but i dont think its even worth discussing anymore whether those mechanics need to be shoehorned in to major franchises
gaming,not_removed,nice app it would be nice if there was a tutorial though since it took a while to figure out how to move the players but otherwise its pretty self explanatory its nice how there are so many settings that can be changed also connecting to another device seems pretty exciting ill let you know if i find anything improvements that can be made cant wait to unlock all the flags
gaming,not_removed,looks cool man tell him to keep it up
gaming,not_removed,cool physics seems lik simple game tbh my likes to swipe randomly and see all the players run around the field sensitivity is pretty chaoticlol
gaming,not_removed,suck my dick charity
gaming,not_removed,if this is worth any money you could sell it and give it to charity i mean do what you want but it does feel good a really cool move would be to sell it buy a new system and games and give it to a childrens hospital i do that with my old systems
gaming,not_removed,my uncle had this box ready to donate in his garage luckily he gave it me instead with the caveat that he gets to come over and play after burner no system for the colecovison stuff so ill have to pick one up online edit people seem upset at me for accepting a gift from my family i am sorry internet i didnt mean it charity meant thrift store i didnt literally snatch this from some unfortunate child
gaming,not_removed,probably still keeping his nes
gaming,not_removed,donkey kong for colecovision i loved that game easy way to beat first level run to first broken ladder climb all the way up climb down step left jump right you will fall through the girder and land next to the girl
gaming,not_removed,rocky boxing with this colecovision sports controllers was a lot of fun back in the day
gaming,not_removed,came here to say sega master system choplifter was great you need to get teddy boy haunted house now
gaming,not_removed,fuck charity gimme that shit utruxxor
gaming,not_removed,i bet youll only use it for like a week play it for the week sell it donate the money
gaming,not_removed,charity wouldnt need this for shit only oldtrue gamers would know what this is and would want it
gaming,not_removed,i remember the smell of the atari packaging and manuals from when i was a kid
gaming,not_removed,that master system takes me back a long way about years had to save up all my money from my paper round to buy one and it served me well up to the purchase of my mighty psx
gaming,not_removed,choplifter no way so cool
gaming,not_removed,yeah what the hell would charity do with it to the layman it is all obsolete pieces of plastic and wiring good grab op
gaming,not_removed,well i dont see atari pinball or strider for the master system so its basically all trash nice find though
gaming,not_removed,charity starts at home bro
gaming,not_removed,if you play and think the controls on this game are impossible its because its actually a port of an old sega computer game and half the controls are wired to the second controller
gaming,not_removed,wow thats gold and btw nice tatoo mate talking about triforce cant see whats on your rigth arm
gaming,not_removed,yeah its cool you found this but youre gonna play it for a day or two then go back to current games
gaming,not_removed,lol you have a triforce tattoo
gaming,not_removed,well thank god you saved it from that horrible date
gaming,not_removed,op fuck charity these are my precious gaming memories jk great finds
gaming,not_removed,that is so beautiful for some reason i feel proud of your uncle
gaming,not_removed,great save op now you can put it in the trash where it belongs
gaming,not_removed,thank god you stopped him from giving it to the less fortunate
gaming,not_removed,charity is overhead if you want to make dying kids happy take the consoles to the hospital and play a few hours with them
gaming,not_removed,i was just going to use it but now the guilt will be too much or maybe not good on you for giving to a childrens hospital my uncle was just going to drop it the salvation army your idea is better
gaming,not_removed,hey fuck them all theyre just jealous
gaming,not_removed,snatched from some unfortunate child adds value man
gaming,not_removed,no need to apologise he wanted to get rid of it you liked it so he gave it to you its not like youre stealing food from an orphanage or anything enjoy
gaming,not_removed,whaaaat
gaming,not_removed,i really messed up with the title he was going to give it to a thrift store and then offered it to me instead nothing sinister involved im starting to feel pretty bad about this now and i was just excited to share here
gaming,not_removed,thanks
gaming,not_removed,i collect old systems i have different consoles at the moment it will be taken care of and enjoyed i will admit that i do the majority of my gaming on pc then though i get what youre saying
gaming,not_removed,you have the right to judge me and be upset with me thats fine thats why the internet was created
gaming,not_removed,or as i actually stated in my post donate a system to them
gaming,not_removed,charity is overhead if you want to make dying kids happy take the consoles to the hospital and play a few hours with them thats kind of weird probably be better to sell the console and use the money to buy a present that they want
gaming,not_removed,charity is overhead source i know some charities have been in the news recently for not allocating a significant portion of their money to the actual charity but i doubt literally all charities are overhead
gaming,not_removed,ha just something to remember if you find it sitting in a corner not touched plus it wasnt really me but my sister who is a nurse who guilt tripped me into doing it it did bring some joy
gaming,not_removed,from the snatch of an unfortunate child
gaming,not_removed,nah its cool stuff just joshing you
gaming,not_removed,even if is was charity dammit it was your uncles thing its now yours people can do what they want with their systems only thing that matter is that it isnt wasted if anything im glad for you you got some really nice games there have fun im not jealous at all hmpf
gaming,not_removed,hes not one of us anyway
gaming,not_removed,no then you lose your system then youre not a real gamer
gaming,not_removed,theyre sick kids they dont know what they want
gaming,not_removed,sorry no of the statistics on the internet are a lie
gaming,not_removed,so youre catholic then
gaming,not_removed,no joshes
gaming,not_removed,joshing
gaming,not_removed,try harder buddy
gaming,not_removed,what a stupid thing to say
gaming,not_removed,youre not trying hard enough
gaming,not_removed,you can switch between the two
gaming,not_removed,dont touch the switch fanbase bro they are going to destroy you with downvotes now
gaming,not_removed,its a fair complaint though there is quite a few games on the eshop that are pretty meaty
gaming,not_removed,this is what worries me the most about the switch if they cant attract enough third party developers or boost their first party lineup with either new franchises or the returns of old ones then i dont have a lot of hope for the console nintendo cannot rely on a handful of franchises to convince people to pay for a brand new console that comes with no games or extra accessories it didnt work for the wii u and i severely doubt it will work again im hoping that star fox ssb donkey kong metroid hell even viewtiful joe gets a new release as it stands right now im hopeful but im definitely not holding my breath
gaming,not_removed,eh zeldas all i need until mario kart and odyssey come out
gaming,not_removed,i dont know about but zelda fills that wall well
gaming,not_removed,wow weeks into its release that doesnt take into account a digital storefront in
gaming,not_removed,breath of the wild i am setsuna super bomberman r plus a bunch of indie games like the binding of isaac and shovel knight and a bunch of classic games like the original metal slug and king of fighters yeah it doesnt have a ton of games but it hasnt even been out for a month yet and there are a lot more games coming out for it soon i dont get why everyone is already trying to write it off as a failed console
gaming,not_removed,theres also snipperclips which is fun as fuck and bomberman isnt too bad
gaming,not_removed,zelda alone is worth the purchase i dont say that easily give me a witcher port a few decent indie games and a mario game and ill hold onto it if i want some hardcore gaming i just boot up the gaming doesnt have to be tribal
gaming,not_removed,wow the had knack and a bunch of titles already on other consoles xbone had killer instinct and a bunch of other titles already on other consoles the switch is the same story different console at least zelda isnt fucking knack or a content locked game like killer instinct stop drinking the kool aid
gaming,not_removed,dude it hasnt even been out a month
gaming,not_removed,zelda is pretty dope tho d shovel knight would be fun if i hadnt purchased it a few times already same with binding of isaac afterbirth looking forward to disgaea and whatever is announced at dank souls dank soul dank souls but yeah like any system launch the library takes time
gaming,not_removed,i absolutely love my switch but it is assuredly a zeldabox
gaming,not_removed,i thought switch played wiiu games
gaming,not_removed,thats twice as many as they need
gaming,not_removed,ill wait for the switch
gaming,not_removed,i feel bad for anyone that wasted their money on switch because its the only option its so lame really
gaming,not_removed,i dont really recall what games and xbox one launched with was there a great variety tbh i think party devs were wary at first given the flop that was the wii u but after the clear public interest and strong early sales especially when the game has so few titles its a no brainer for the parties to get involved nintendo are making a big push for this too the deb kit is far cheaper than most they actually increased the consoles ran at the behest of ubisoft this is when i am quite confident that i will buy the console when the library is more fleshed out and ideally when they release the switch plus with a slightly bigger screen and battery a man can dream
gaming,not_removed,hey man switch is like games in one
gaming,not_removed,the system hasnt even been out for a full month its got a number of downloadable games and theres also bomberman granted the multiplayer is lacking in this one its got a number of games announced already why do people keep hating on it for a lack of games give it more time damn
gaming,not_removed,still a better library of exclusives than xbox
gaming,not_removed,well see how things are by christmas
gaming,not_removed,wow a console that has only been out for a month also httpwwwnintendocomgamescomingsoonnintendoswitch ggez
gaming,not_removed,games
gaming,not_removed,why do i feel that nintendo always has this problem
gaming,not_removed,at least they finally launched with a zelda game even if it was taken from another system go look at the ds launch i bought that shitty feel the magic out of pure desperation to have something that used the ds fully one of the worst games i ever spent money on
gaming,not_removed,im surprised they have copies of available that game is sold out everywhere i look
gaming,not_removed,you posted this hours ago good job at being deceptive physical releases besides these two include bomberman isaac snipperclips skylanders
gaming,not_removed,httpsimgurcomgallerywtdnnwe
gaming,not_removed,hell thats more games available than consoles no need for more than games if you cant get the hardware to play them since they have been out of stock for months
gaming,not_removed,more of kind of game than switches
gaming,not_removed,i own and am a fan of switch you still get an upvote
gaming,not_removed,lol
gaming,not_removed,no joke watched a video of a guy picking up his switch unboxing it and booting it up with zelda and it was skipping screen going black on and off flickering and crashing defective switch it happens people tore him to shreds saying it was his fault and that he just didnt take care of his stuff etc etc
gaming,not_removed,the fanbase is insane i bought one played through zelda it was ok nothing new and now im playing binding of isaac on it its my binding of isaac machine until more games come out but really theres fuck all
gaming,not_removed,these fanboys are like salvery mindless sheep lmao thanks nintendo keep it up
gaming,not_removed,people are just defensive because they are trying to cope with spending on a zelda game nintendo has never had good game libraries ever since the wii and if somebody denies that they are just ignorant
gaming,not_removed,its shitty but to be fair im sure they are filled with hate from the past years they have been berated by playstation and xbox owners
gaming,not_removed,snipperclips goty and yeah i have enough options to keep me busy once i beat zelda but ill probably put a pause on my switch for persona v regardless rmx could be great but do i really want to get that when mario kart has those hot hot fzero levels i havent played i am setsuna and it seems like itll be great on a portable ill feel dumb buying shovel knight a second time but i havent beaten it despite enjoying it quite a bit and itll be excellent on a portable and its not out yet but hollow knight will be an excellent fit for the system i had a blast in the splatoon testfire i cant believe theres still not a way to change weapons midmatch though
gaming,not_removed,ehh this wasnt all that different from launches except that zelda is at least a top notch game its nintendo anyone who bought day should be expecting a slow trickle of games
gaming,not_removed,well i cant say much about third party support besides the large amount of indies they already have a solid first party lineup for just this year
gaming,not_removed,metroid nah nintendo hates metroid
gaming,not_removed,lmao i bet that makes spending the money feel better
gaming,not_removed,not everyone likes zelda
gaming,not_removed,i havent heard people write it off as a failed console but the wiiu suffered the same fate my mum got me one after it was out for like a year i wouldnt blame people for drawing comparisons between the two
gaming,not_removed,okay im saying this as a devout nintendo lover who really and truly wants them to do well and see the switch become a revolution in gaming their launch line up sucks they have precisely two console exclusives one being bomberman which isnt a console seller and the other being a party game breath of the wild is available for the wii u which a lot of big nintendo fans already had and plays honestly just as well ive seen and played both and i can only tell the slightest difference between the two setsuna is available on every console and pc and those indie titles are the same deal and are probably cheaper on steam classic games dont count as launch titles theyre just virtual console stuff that have been around for ages and can be played on basically any platform yes lots of people who didnt get a wii u are buying the switch for zelda and thats fine but the fact remains that they have only two exclusives for it and those are very weak titles indeed they have an absolutely stunning calendar laid out ahead of us with mario odyssey xenoblade chronicles shin megami tensei fire emblem heroes sonic forces if youre a sonic fan and a slew of other things like skyrim which is yet another port and nonexclusive yes but skyrim portable is a selling point the current variety is absolute garbage if youre a dedicated gamer because most of it is just ports of games that have been out for some time now and even if you arent exactly a hardcore gamer shovel knight isnt going to sell a switch when you realize you can buy it for less on steam and play it on your computer because even a toaster can run it i really and truly want them to do well but they really should have pushed the date back a bit to allow for a more powerful line up even if they just had one more big game like xenoblade ready to go then it would have been much stronger theyre going to have an amazing catalog by the end of the year but all that means is that im not dropping on their console until that point i can play the one game on the system that i truly cared about zelda on my wii u and the rest ill be able to wait on until i feel like they have enough games to justify the extra to play them plus this is nintendo we all know theres gonna be some sort of special edition console or upgraded version with more internal storage or something like that the only reason we dont have a sheikah slate patterned console is because releasing a special edition color at launch would have resulted in price gouging and outrage im sure well get a zelda pattern joycontablet set when they decide to release a zelda hd collection or something like that not to mention marioluigipeach colors andor special edition white consoles or something might as well wait and get a coollooking version of it while im playing the waiting game also just to note im not writing it off as a failed console im simply saying that their launch lineup was weak and that counts for something nintendo could have pushed the release back a few months to launch with a few more big games but they didnt and that hurts their image there are also plenty of people who might have bought one if there were at least two big exclusives to play i will have one eventually but not until theres at least a couple of games for it that i needwant that realistically puts me back to the holiday season by which time xenoblade and mario will be released they might get me a little earlier if shin megami tensei looks really good
gaming,not_removed,majority of what you listed is available elsewhere zelda is the only game thats even worth the console purchase i use worth lightly here and bomberman tanked imo
gaming,not_removed,its not a failed console yet but it is a rushed console
gaming,not_removed,until it gets some new full fledge games its a failing console at the moment i beat breath of the wild in about a week after it came out wasted money on a couple downloadable games and played them for about games and havent touched my switch since then botw wasnt even that great compared to all the exclusives adventure and rpgs i have i only played and beat it because i travel a lot now im stuck just sitting here for another decent game to come outwhich is mario kart i guesssame version of a game thats already been released have to wait almost half a year for fifa and the new mario if youre one of those people who want a switch but cant find onedont worry youre not missing anything
gaming,not_removed,ah yes four launch titles i remember back in when that was acceptable even as a fan you have to admit that without zelda this would have sold a couple thousand units
gaming,not_removed,i dont understand why your being so defensive over a piece of machinery
gaming,not_removed,uh oh theyve started attacking
gaming,not_removed,dont forget snake pass
gaming,not_removed,because it doesnt have many games and wont
gaming,not_removed,it does not
gaming,not_removed,why are you getting downvoted for asking this seriously theres no reason to downvote someone for misinformation
gaming,not_removed,yeah thats a total of i dont see the big deal
gaming,not_removed,but are they the sort of games you will play more than once or twice
gaming,not_removed,damn dude relax hes just posting a meme worthy photo not calling your mom a fat whore its just a console
gaming,not_removed,the fanboyism is strong with this one
gaming,not_removed,i know youre joking but i bought my xbox one at christmas for exclusives and games and i think i currently own retail titles for it if i wasnt ok with putting out the money for newer hardware to play my games on it would have been an absolute waste of money by the time mario kart is out on switch next month ill own as many retail switch games as retail xbox one games
gaming,not_removed,just like the no mans sky buyers still scared to admit it
gaming,not_removed,because nintendo insists on coming out with weird hardware that third parties do not want to support
gaming,not_removed,wii launched with twilight princess i dont know why but i felt a need to point that out i might be turning into a zelda fanboy oh god somebody help me
gaming,not_removed,hope thats s
gaming,not_removed,wow skylanders ive always wanted that piece of shit
gaming,not_removed,out of stock for months was released days ago
gaming,not_removed,for some reason nintendo fanboys are the worst in this department i saw someone say splatoon tickrate doesnt matter because the game is about painting the floor
gaming,not_removed,i felt lucky as hell when my switch came in and actually worked though it still might break horribly at some point in the future the lack of games just now sucks but therell be a few more soon enough all of my hope is going into monster hunter for it
gaming,not_removed,i mean a portable binding of isaac with all the content might be worth
gaming,not_removed,gamers are insane as a casual gamer youre all the same to me
gaming,not_removed,the is full of amazing games and while the wii us was pretty small there were quite a few gems there games pokemon x y pokemon sun moon super mario land super smash bros monster hunter luigis mansion legend of zelda link between worlds bravely default bravely second mario kart kid icarus uprising fire emblem awakening fire emblem fates birthright conquest revelations phoenix wright trilogy kirby triple deluxe kirby planet robobot mario and luigi dream team animal crossing new leaf and the incredible portsremakes ocarina of time majoras mask donkey kong country returns hyrule warriors etc so i dont know what kind of claims youre making about no good libraries since the wii since that literally includes only the and wii u
gaming,not_removed,thats no excuse
gaming,not_removed,ill tell you right now that rmx feels really good to play its pretty fun if you like the speed sensation you get and like edging around opponents so all around ive been having a blast with it it does have two big shortcomings presently though default online is subsonic only the lowest speed class theres also supersonic and hypersonic and they have yet to push out their update that adds actual friend functionality i think its still worth the twenty dollar asking price though
gaming,not_removed,the binding of isaac good lord
gaming,not_removed,it is beyond stupid that disgaea wasnt a launch title in the west when it was a launch title in japan and has already been released in the west on almost years ago there is a month release delay for no actual reason for this game and it is one of the dumbest things nintendo has done for the launch of the switch
gaming,not_removed,the test fire was awesome
gaming,not_removed,i am indeed excited about super mario odyssey i hope its good
gaming,not_removed,good thing its all that i need
gaming,not_removed,this comparison doesnt really make sense the wiiu launched with nearly retail games the number of games on day means almost nothing in the long run especially when the game selection is enough to keep the system nearly sold out anyway whether the switch ends up being successful or not noone is going to look back at these first weeks and claim it succeeded or failed based on this first wave of games
gaming,not_removed,you simply cant have a nintendo console as your primary gaming console anymore unless you only want to play nintendo games nintendo has relegated themselves to this position by not working with parties like they should and making hardware thats so different than the competition that they cant even properly port their new games it hurts but this is how they are now
gaming,not_removed,i thought about getting a switch but then decided to just get zelda botw on the wii u that i wasted my money on a couple years ago instead i think it was a good choice
gaming,not_removed,honestly i tell people unless your a big zelda fan id recommend waiting until holiday season just because the variety will be really high but if you have enjoyed a zelda game ever in the past get it i have been enjoying zelda so much since it came out and havent regretting a thing
gaming,not_removed,dont hate on the system because you rushed to beat zelda
gaming,not_removed,so everyone hating on nintendo because theyre rereleasing mario kart for the switch needs to keep in mind that some of us dont have a wii u and would love to be able to play rereleasing games isnt as terrible of a thing as everyone makes it out to be
gaming,not_removed,the had two launch titles two and it did just fine for itself
gaming,not_removed,i remember back in when that was acceptable the famicom launched with titles the nes only launched with a bunch because they waited another year and a half to release it the master system launched with games the pc engine launched with games the mega drive launched with games in the us the snes launched with games in the us the saturn launched with games in the us the launched with games in the us it wasnt really until the playstation when big launches started to come into play and even then that didnt catch on until the us launch of the dreamcast and on so if you cant remember when it was acceptable you must have a short memory
gaming,not_removed,yeah after all every other console came out with games day one companies love to take risks and invest in new stuff like this
gaming,not_removed,eeeh ofcourse it wouldnt sell if it didnt have any launch titles at all like seriously i dont understand your comment it has very few launch titles i bet if you took them away too i bet wouldnt sell very well either if we took away its launch titles duh
gaming,not_removed,hard to sell even that amount when youre giving the biggest stores consoles
gaming,not_removed,yeahbut it did have zelda so that hypothetical scenario is pointless
gaming,not_removed,thread about lack of games lists games out for the system how is he attacking
gaming,not_removed,i thought it did i saw a comparison between the two tablets wii u and the switch i just assumed it had backwards compatibility but finding this out will make me not buy the system
gaming,not_removed,youre right dude sorry the title and a lot of the comments i read made it seem otherwise the more i look at the picture it does seem funny
gaming,not_removed,wrong again
gaming,not_removed,what a fallacious statement
gaming,not_removed,another game that was taken from the previous system
gaming,not_removed,you both have a point though the wiiu most people didnt even know it was its own console the marketing was so shitty it killed the system even now its big news when it gets sales because of a launch title on the next gen system being out of stock
gaming,not_removed,i heard it is a fantastic multiplayer game i own binding of isaac botw fast rmx and blaster master zero although i have not played anything but botw
gaming,not_removed,theyll say anything to bash ol nintendo eh even when it makes sense
gaming,not_removed,yup you havent been able to find a switch for msrp since the pre orders sold out months ago its all reseller hobgolbins on amazon and ebay or out of stock spam
gaming,not_removed,i think youre seeing a few vocal people with bad opinions and lumping all nintendo fans in to one
gaming,not_removed,whats a tickrate
gaming,not_removed,its stupid generalized comments like this for the past decade that have made gamers look like idiots news flash real adults dont give a shit about your console wars or fanboy lingo people who shit on others because of some imaginary allegiance to a corporation are morons as are those who propagate it by saying those fanboys are the worst
gaming,not_removed,i only care if it runs smoothly and if the multiplayer is playable
gaming,not_removed,ive heard rumours that its actually going to playstation again
gaming,not_removed,am i the only one who really doesnt like the binding of isaac
gaming,not_removed,lol apparently youre ignorant now s its frustrating when people load their statements with default safeguard caveats anyone who disagrees with me is an idiot lolno but i do think people still tend to think of handhelds in another category certainly this is what nintendo is changing but they havent done it yet
gaming,not_removed,the gamecus line up had far more quality games than the wii or wiiu my gamecube game collection is about three times the size of my wii and wiiu collections combined
gaming,not_removed,thanks for the recommendation i finally got off my ass and bought rmx its spectacular im nowhere near good enough to be disappointed about the subsoniconly online multiplayer yet but the game feels and looks great its a genre i dont play that frequently but i was definitely due my dose
gaming,not_removed,to be fair you can buy the japanese version in the e shop and it has the capability to switch to english
gaming,not_removed,zelda game
gaming,not_removed,yeah if the switch is great no one is going to think twice about how the launch went but people still have bad memories about the wiiu and if the switch is taking the same route i think its easy to relate to people who might be somewhat pessimistic even if you dont agree with them it sucks throwing down on a console to have virtually no payoff
gaming,not_removed,ya know im perfectly okay with that because im primarily a pc gamer i own several consoles from back in the day when consoles actually meant exclusive gaming or at least had a vast selection of titles that pc did not these days between emulation and crossplatform a true exclusive is nigh nonexistent nintendo puts out consoles that might be a bit quirky and might not have full support from every third party ever but damn if they dont deliver at least a handful of extremely high quality games in a world where games like final fantasy xv are what passes for high quality gaming ill gladly take a smaller much more niche library on a nintendo console if it means theyre all franchises i enjoy and games that are actually good as a pc gamer i find that even more appealing i can supplement my gaming with a wii uswitch and get access to a ton of titles that i dont have on pc and theyre all of generally great quality and theyre series that i grew up with and am very fond of if im going to augment my gaming options then you can be damn sure ill pick a nintendo console over any others youll get the most actually exclusive titles for your money you know theyll be enjoyable and refreshingly different from most of the shovelware crap on the market these days and whenif nintendo does dlc they do it right hyrule warriors proved that very well a half of those games are going to be available on pc at launch or within a reasonable amount of time afterwards and the rest arent exactly masterpieces for the most part yeah i kind of regret missing out on sunset overdrive because it looked fun as hell but do i really wanna spend to play the one game that i want on that console when the rest i can play on my preferred platform at better framerates nah my wii u has provided me with countless hours of entertainment and i still have games for it that i havent even started yet im pretty sure the switch will provide a similar situation and ill more than gladly shell out for one i just hope that nintendo hasnt counted their chickens before theyve hatched by rushing the console to market without a bigger library of games their first year release schedule looks stellar and im sure there may be a few more additions before the year is out not to mention the entire future ahead of it but to a casual observer it doesnt exactly look like a great value at this point in time if that impression sticks and they just decide that they dont ever want a switch based on that well obviously thats a considerable amount of money lost to nintendo if enough people do so and i know plenty of people who think in that way outside of concern for them in that regard i think they make an absolutely perfect addition to pc gaming you get pretty much everything you want on pc and your nintendo games are exclusive to their consoles and give you a great experience they dont need to be a primary console in this day and age they just have to shine bright enough with their particular niche market to stand alongside whichever platform of choice the consumer has
gaming,not_removed,good job p
gaming,not_removed,eh the wii u isnt such a waste its got a small but quality library of games bayonetta is awesome and comes bundled with the first bayonetta as well so its a twofer hyrule warriors is damn fun for a zelda fan even if youre not a huge warriors fan mario world is fun as fuck with friends xenoblade chronicles x can keep you entertained for months if youre a completionist wonderful is one of those unique quirky games that has no right to be as fun as it is thats not even touching on the console port for monster hunter ultimate donkey kong country tropical freeze pikmin and the wind waker and twilight princess hd ports that look absolutely amazing and fix some of the issues with those games plus if you wanna get into the exploitable side of things you can also putz around with hackingcustom firmware and enable the virtual wii to play gamecube games and theres progress being made to enable launching game backups for wii gc and wii u from the same external harddrive and the wii u does ever so slightly upscale wiigc stuff even if it isnt anywhere near full hd but it sure as hell looks better basically its a wonderfully accessible central hub to play pretty much any nintendo console games from on if you factor in virtual console titles and such no its not a perfect system and the library isnt huge but what it does have is pretty fucking solid in terms of quality add that to all the backwards compatible games youll be able to access on it and youve got a damn nice little media machine and all this on top of not having to shell out three hundred dollars on a console just to play zelda and then let it collect dust until the next game that you want comes out for it
gaming,not_removed,ive pretty much disliked every zelda up until this one which is amazing this game isnt really like other zelda games so id recommend it to even non zelda fans
gaming,not_removed,im not the biggest zelda fan it was still worth it to buy a switch for breath of the wild
gaming,not_removed,didnt look like hate looked like an honest review he just hated on botw a little
gaming,not_removed,depends on what they charge for it and it looks like they want for it which seems a little high
gaming,not_removed,pfffft that failure of a console name three games that were successful for that console you cant s
gaming,not_removed,no i said take away one launch title or of that list and it dies not all of them heres a list of launch titles angry birds star wars assassins creed iv black flag battlefield blacklight retribution call of duty ghosts contrast dc universe online fifa flower forced injustice gods among us ultimate edition just dance killzone shadow fall knack lego marvel super heroes madden nfl nba need for speed rivals resogun skylanders swap force sound shapes super motherload the playroom trine complete story warframe cant name one of those that would have had even aa fraction of the sale loss as not having zelda
gaming,not_removed,he said if you took away loz not all the launch titles it would not have sold but a couple thousand units not to mention wii u launched with twilight princess and still failed
gaming,not_removed,no see i was just acknowledging the top comment saying dont attack the fan base and i replied to the first comment defending the switch its just a misconception
gaming,not_removed,to be fair its unlikely that the switch would have worked as the hybrid console that nintendo wanted if they were to support wii u games and needed a comparatively bulky disc reader so as much as it kinda sucks that its not backwards compatible the switch wouldnt really work as a concept if it was
gaming,not_removed,as a fanboy of nintendo please quit acting like such a fanboy
gaming,not_removed,if you really want one gamestop gets shipments every weekday just find the one in your city that got them
gaming,not_removed,it was literally available at all major retailers this week as recently as yesterday on amazon
gaming,not_removed,yh stop shitposting amazon uk has them at msrp in stock
gaming,not_removed,its the negative comments that are the loudest
gaming,not_removed,no the forum im thinking of is infested with this type of thinking i get irrationally angry every time i read one of these excuses
gaming,not_removed,if you dont speak out you support it
gaming,not_removed,ps and xb have been around almost two decades as well
gaming,not_removed,rate server updates whats happening can cause a lot of lag and weird issues if its too low and splatoon has it looow
gaming,not_removed,youre just triggered your logic seems to be everyone who upsets me is wrong if anything rampant fanboyism like in my example would make anyone look like a moron since its literally just saying nope i dont believe you because x to literally any criticism theyre the antivaxxers of the gaming industry buuut im sure youll find a way to criticize me yet again for having an angry opinion or just not yours
gaming,not_removed,yeah made up ones why would capcom give up putting its biggest game in their home market on the best selling console in their home market which unless hell freezes over is going to be the switch cause japan loves their handhelds
gaming,not_removed,id be okayish with this
gaming,not_removed,boi i swear i cant fucking stand sony playstation went to shit with the imo
gaming,not_removed,its not for everyone but for some of us it is life it is love it is perfect
gaming,not_removed,obviously not but for a lot of people that like it the replayability is huge and for that reason worth it
gaming,not_removed,heh i dont consider myself super good either but i just love the feeling of speed that supersonic and hypersonic give so playing online just feels slow i dont play racing games too much either but it just feels too good to just see everything flying by and i still go back to it periodically im glad i got it and i hope you continue to enjoy it too
gaming,not_removed,that honestly makes it even more ridiculous that it isnt out in the west
gaming,not_removed,gets your facts straight even with all the tax itd be around not anyway and its not like i bought it just for zelda its simply the only launch game that i need until mario kart and super mario odyssey come out like i said in the first damn post go troll somewhere else
gaming,not_removed,hey at least he can afford a zelda game
gaming,not_removed,hes full of shit claiming he beat botw in a week yeah i guess if you sprint to each dungeon while ignoring of the game you could kill ganon rather quickly hardly beating the game however
gaming,not_removed,quality not quantity im going to be that guy but launched with mario and that sold well enough we all love our i admit i only purchased zelda atm but i havent regretted anything ive poured over hours in and still have more to go ill admit im reaching that point now where id like to really dive into something else
gaming,not_removed,most of those are available on other consoles so why bother with the then
gaming,not_removed,the wii u didnt launch with twilight princess if youre thinking of twilight princess hd that was released in march of last year otherwise youre probably thinking of the wii which released with the original twilight princess as a launch title
gaming,not_removed,i am in north dakota google it we dont have a city
gaming,not_removed,yeah unfortunately sensible more neutral people get drowned out by the rabid ones i was super disappointed at the response to people giving botw less than especially people need to learn to accept shortcomings i love splatoon already but docked running at is still a problem i find weapon durability to not be a problem but still can understand why so many people hate it i wonder what causes people to be so crazy defensive about a company
gaming,not_removed,no its not
gaming,not_removed,what
gaming,not_removed,the only logical reason i could think would be attempting to market the game for the west
gaming,not_removed,the best selling version of monster hunter was on the psp the versions only sold about half as much
gaming,not_removed,have you seen exclusives lineup
gaming,not_removed,horizon zero dawn looks amazing i havent owned a ps since the ps one but its tempting
gaming,not_removed,i agree but i can empathize with nintendos reasoning
gaming,not_removed,lol shit calm down i was just making a point go relax and play your zelda
gaming,not_removed,yea i guess thats true
gaming,not_removed,when you got nothing to do traveling maybe some people dont like to do random stuff
gaming,not_removed,town then u on night shift its like am there
gaming,not_removed,dumbass voice to text read it again
gaming,not_removed,why would going to playstation help in marketing the game for the west us sales numbers are still us numbers so going to playstation doesnt help going multiplatform might help but if theyre gonna do that theyre probably going to include the switch either way
gaming,not_removed,i admit i didnt think this through then again neither do japanese companies
gaming,not_removed,best selling yes but not strictly true monster hunter portable only sold more than gen individually so its not about half
gaming,not_removed,have you seen pcs lineup
gaming,not_removed,i mean people paid for knack on the release oops i guess they could play shitty party games already on other consoles oh wait maybe they just bought the system because they knew more games were coming to it just like all consoles
gaming,not_removed,if you think theres nothing to do traveling then you need to open your eyes more shrines like overworld bosses dozens of side quests
gaming,not_removed,we have a series of small settlements and villages and only a hand full of towns the nearest game stop dollars in gas money away from my location that leaves amazon us for my source and they are all posted by resellers for a markup i want one but not for more than msrp only botw out so far so meh i can wait
gaming,not_removed,okay ill be more accurate for you mh games on psp sold million copies each mh games on psp sold million copies each mh games on sold between to million copies each mh games that got na and eu releases sold about a million more the highest selling mh was freedomportable on psp m in jpn m worldwide in the jump from psp to the sales in japan dropped from m on to m on in short capcom took one of their best selling games and dropped the sales by more than half by jumping to the more popular platform
gaming,not_removed,at least the had a decent launch lineup
gaming,not_removed,honestly idgaf i dont own a switch because im broke learn to read he said he travels a lot like on planes trains busses cars so the time is available the hardest thing to do in the world is to not push your beliefs on others so show some restraint and try to understand others points from their view before making your argument also read
gaming,not_removed,soyou are complaining that you have no stores near you
gaming,not_removed,it didnt it was full of hot garbage that was already released or it was knack
gaming,not_removed,knack and killzone were both good battlefield madden fifa were all ported for day one as well not bad if you ask most
gaming,not_removed,god zelda is such a fucking shit series my friends sucked me in told me to get into the lore play all the major games try to immerse myself in the world and ya know what it sucks this mediocre game with childtier storytelling mechanics and tedious quests managed to waste the childhoods of thousands of redditors while making them think they were somehow special for beating a mass marketed childrens game congrats now youre an adult but you spend all your fucking time obsessing over this incredibly average game series in a feeble attempt to escape the responsibilities of the real world and crawl back into the comfortable womb of blissful ignorant youth
gaming,not_removed,damn thats pessimistic i think plenty of the zelda games are really fun
gaming,not_removed,are you okay
gaming,not_removed,dont be modest its pretty good man
gaming,not_removed,dope
gaming,not_removed,quen that shit baby
gaming,not_removed,where did you die
gaming,not_removed,too hard played on blood and broken bones and it was not harder than the maingame not overleveled
gaming,not_removed,the toad fucked me a few times the damn tornado priest guy kept kicking my ass till i realized i was supposed to run away from them lol got rekt by a pack of downers found some armored beetle thing that threw me around i acknowledge i probably just suck haha just feel like its a change of pace
gaming,not_removed,you you were supposed to run
gaming,not_removed,had the same problemen with the same bosses minus the arena fight you could run away from the mage you say i did not know that haha i finallygot him after like times did you play the original game months ago and came back for the dlc now by any chance it was my excuse for being rusty
gaming,not_removed,not sure but i think he meant to run away from the tornadoes themselves dunno though
gaming,not_removed,nahhh ive been binging the whole thing cause i got it on sale haha just a scrub
gaming,not_removed,unfortunately running isnt my strong suit i got hit with everything he threw at me
gaming,not_removed,what difficulty are you playing on
gaming,not_removed,story and sword
gaming,not_removed,hehe gues you really are a scrub d
gaming,not_removed,seems to be the most likely answer haha
gaming,not_removed,my god that controller aim its so painful
gaming,not_removed,how can people play this game on consoles moves and looks like shit
gaming,not_removed,the hell gun is that you can ads
gaming,not_removed,too bad that game completely sucked give us some real doom or leave that franchise alone
gaming,not_removed,im more amazed that there are people that play doom with motion blur on
gaming,not_removed,those guns are stock dude
gaming,not_removed,have u played the single player
gaming,not_removed,i use a controller but fuck motion blur right in the ass
gaming,not_removed,no and not interested if i wanted to play an edgy generic fps i would play brutal doom which im also absolutely not interested in
gaming,not_removed,you play fps games on pc with a controller
gaming,not_removed,smh dont speak on something you know little about
gaming,not_removed,you play fps with a controller ftfy
gaming,not_removed,yeah pretty sure that you started with brutal doom
gaming,not_removed,bro you havent even played the game and youre saying its shit even when it has received pretty damn good feedback that is talking about something you have no experience with aka talking out your ass try the game it wont kill you and no i didnt start with brutal doom i started with the shareware version on my first computer back when i was a lil one
gaming,not_removed,man im just not interested in the game it just feels generic and i know enough of the game that i can safely say that i hate it from a mile away lets just hope blackroom is good though
gaming,not_removed,but how does the back end match up
gaming,not_removed,icarly
gaming,not_removed,which game is this
gaming,not_removed,paulie would be great at monopoly hed pick up boardwalk on the first go
gaming,not_removed,paulie should have tell the difference by now if he played twice as long as his angered friend renegade also they sure have a lot of games god damn steam sales robbing me blind
gaming,not_removed,i bet they were playing portal
gaming,not_removed,please tell me during paulies rage induced episode you asked paulie want a cracker
gaming,not_removed,old repost but does anyone know which game are these reviews from
gaming,not_removed,not sure but i think it might be cant drive this its a multiplayer game where one player drives a car while the other player is dynamically building the race track as its being driven
gaming,not_removed,the game is called we were here
gaming,not_removed,no he couldnt you cant roll a one in monopoly
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,actually the game they reviewed released feb so it cant be that old game is called we were here edit i screen shot this myself btw
gaming,not_removed,dont tell me what to do
gaming,not_removed,well you dont play wow wow plays you
gaming,not_removed,wow is a great time suck for sure you can grind for hours with the right group and have an absolute blast for the loner though id highly suggest the total war series ive put in over hours into the rome attila medieval and warhammer i get to play armchair general and tickle my world conquest fancy with a varied array of difficulties my favorite series by far
gaming,not_removed,ffxiv a realm reborn
gaming,not_removed,guild wars personally im hrs in
gaming,not_removed,if its between those three ive never played eve have been disappointed by eso and their updates but recently resubbed to wow if youre not specifically looking for mmos try the witcher or mgsv they dominated my year in
gaming,not_removed,dayz
gaming,not_removed,final fantasy x chrono trigger skyrim remastered catch all the pokemans or get level in call of duty what do you prefer
gaming,not_removed,how is wow compared to elder scrolls online if youve played both
gaming,not_removed,already finished it might go back to pay more attention to the lore
gaming,not_removed,hows wow so far
gaming,not_removed,ive hard dayz is really buggy and not worth getting right now is that true
gaming,not_removed,looking for a multiplayer game
gaming,not_removed,yes
gaming,not_removed,you can give me the xbox code
gaming,not_removed,i get the feeling that no matter what people reply to this with they will get downvoted
gaming,not_removed,statistics theres simply more asian gamers so they have more people who play a lot and therefore get really good at games
gaming,not_removed,asian parents tend to be stricter than other parents this means no hanging out on weekdays or goin out to parties more time to spend on video games source am asian
gaming,not_removed,id say it has to do with lack of options they dont really have a lot of pro sports minus ping pong and being a gamer in asia is glorified they are like celebrities
gaming,not_removed,unfortunate sorry guys
gaming,not_removed,the third person camera angles really really suck in loops for a majority of the stunt tracks
gaming,not_removed,actually they should be named ram races because no one ever does stunts and ramming seems to be on the priority list
gaming,not_removed,this latest update is one of the best additions to the game second only to the heists update i would highly recommend revisiting the game to all of those who have let it sit on their hard drive for a while
gaming,not_removed,thats the first and probably last time i will see this the timing for that is insane
gaming,not_removed,i would do this but i dont have gta also no friends
gaming,not_removed,so glad years of trackmania has prepared me for changing to first person any time theres a loop
gaming,not_removed,just keep driving forward its easy
gaming,not_removed,wow absolutely gorgeous what is your setup
gaming,not_removed,i love this game i was born and raised i the region where devs went to grab the inspiration for the environment and textures the first time ive played it just after player comes out of the tunnel into the forest was very emotional it felt so good to just wander around remembering walks to forests surrounding my home the vanishing of ethan carter gave me an opportunity to feel like im back home while being so far away from it now i need to save some money to buy a decent rig vr then ill be able to experience game on a whole new level great album op thank you
gaming,not_removed,such a short but beautiful game
gaming,not_removed,gtx ftw msi corsair vengeance and im in love
gaming,not_removed,thats a great experience to have i love when games can give us that feeling go get yourself that vr
gaming,not_removed,what is this
gaming,not_removed,thanks for including the game name in the title op
gaming,not_removed,the psychiatric patient part may have something to do with it
gaming,not_removed,i know straight women who hate men whats to be confused about
gaming,not_removed,i didnt know those two traits could be had together for everyone wondering the game is called rimworld and its an excellent colony simulator
gaming,not_removed,i absolutely love this game would recommend to anyone who can handle the pressure of managing a colony
gaming,not_removed,at least hes optimistic about it
gaming,not_removed,reminds me of little britian
gaming,not_removed,i know at least one person like that
gaming,not_removed,just closeted is my guess
gaming,not_removed,and neither does he
gaming,not_removed,because he is dick caddick
gaming,not_removed,made it to rgaming
gaming,not_removed,put the fucking name of the game in the title its not rocket science like seriously i would hate to see the disorganized mess in your house no coasters under glasses mismatched cups carpet in the kitchen chaos
gaming,not_removed,omg attention d
gaming,not_removed,so hes a republican
gaming,not_removed,heh
gaming,not_removed,yeah this looks relevant to my interests as well
gaming,not_removed,straight men who hate women are pretty common too like just because you want to have sex with something doesnt mean you like them
gaming,not_removed,i too know my fair share of feminists s
gaming,not_removed,thank you kind stranger
gaming,not_removed,can you tell us what game this is
gaming,not_removed,yay
gaming,not_removed,rimworld
gaming,not_removed,the game is redundant to say so at this point but wanted you to get the reply with info
gaming,not_removed,sorry i have no idea
gaming,not_removed,the first ninja turtle
gaming,not_removed,kaaaaaameeeeeeeeehaaaaaaaa
gaming,not_removed,best money spenti mean besides the curse of majora and all credit retro nerd studio httpswwwetsycomshopretronerdstudio
gaming,not_removed,i finished majoras mask this week for the first time on the id given up back in the day due to the water temple glad to finally put it to rest everyone should play it
gaming,not_removed,also love the metroid one
gaming,not_removed,nice
gaming,not_removed,majoras mask
gaming,not_removed,nice mayan style zelda art
gaming,not_removed,colorized
gaming,not_removed,and mario above him
gaming,not_removed,nice
gaming,not_removed,yeah fucking eyes keep watering an burning makes it hard to type
gaming,not_removed,not rekt rekt
gaming,not_removed,heres the original
gaming,not_removed,i love this﻿
gaming,not_removed,nice play
gaming,not_removed,this just feels awfully staged
gaming,not_removed,im not sure that rape automatically counts as sexism if any thing its just roleplay of being a real banditraider that being said who doesnt love a good table turning
gaming,not_removed,yeaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
gaming,not_removed,having played dayz a lot i can tell you its probably not
gaming,not_removed,wow first comment that didnt take long
gaming,not_removed,youve got to be kidding me so any shit people say on dayz is just them roleplaying okay buddy
gaming,not_removed,thats a level of realism thats completely unnecessary in a multiplayer game if you want to enact rape fantasies do it on your own time in a single player game the rest of us would rather do without you
gaming,not_removed,damn points the sjws are strong in this post let me do my part and make this a
gaming,not_removed,yeah but people enact all kinds of fantasies in that game like forcefeeding rotten food and disinfectant to people they capture
gaming,not_removed,how other people choose to play open sand box games isnt up to you and being a marauder is kinda a big part of dayz iv seen videos of people playing a psycho talkers cannibal tribes and all other manner of crazy things
gaming,not_removed,yeah anyone who doesnt like rape is an sjw what the fuck is wrong with you people
gaming,not_removed,look murder is already an established part of that game rape is not theres no reason it should be either if youre the kind of person that needs to enact a rape fantasy in a multiplayer game youre sick and in need of help
gaming,not_removed,yah ok you just go out there and do your rape fantasies have fun pretending to rape one day i hope you look back and say to yourself what the fuck was i doing arguing that people should be able to force rape fantasies onto others in videogames your argument is fucking pathetic as is your opinion on the matter
gaming,not_removed,taking things literally and completely unable to see the joke is a clear sign of a sjw dont worry redss virtue signal received loud and clear
gaming,not_removed,its just a video game man most of these people are stupid kids
gaming,not_removed,yah ok you just go out there and do your murder fantasies have fun pretending to murder
gaming,not_removed,or maybe you just have a terrible sense of humor is there a punchline to that joke im missing youre getting downvoted because if its a joke then its in very poor taste has nothing to do with sjws httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyuafzoxhpe is a skit that approaches the same subject it works because there is an actual sense of humor involved
gaming,not_removed,i cant wait for you to try that joke at open mic night surely youll have tour dates lined up across the country after you pull out that gem my bet is that in the days of classic forums your post signature would say stop screamin bitch lets not turn this rape into a murder lol my gamrtag is btw you were almost certainly a fetus during that period in internet history however
gaming,not_removed,people dont seem to understand its a video game its not like they endorsing rape any more than shooting other players is endorsing murder they are just playing up to the role of bad guy after all games like dayz are just asshole simulators theres a good reason that people often start off trying to be friendly to every one but before long the game breaks them down to where they just kill every one on sight and before long if she keeps playing she will be using her feminine voice to bait other players while her friends attack them from behind
gaming,not_removed,ah yes the age attack classic indeed another attempt at character assassination but this time instead of going for my morals its my maturity you are aiming for lets just say when i was a fetus their was no internet or at least not how we know it today however the concept existed and was in use by some companies just not by the common person in their homes personal computers where not yet a thing back on topic check httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvfwmukkqxos out or or
gaming,not_removed,what a weakass piece of trash argument murder is a core part of the gameplay enacting your pathetic little rape fantasies on others is not its playeradded by people who cant get any on their own time so they take that energy online it doesnt take a saint to see why its disgustingly bad form or maybe you cant maybe you just cant
gaming,not_removed,oh man using louis ck to defend le righteous rape jokes we did it reddit center square on shit head bingo i mean hes generally a turd who is lasertargeted at edgy redditors but he at least told a passable joke ill give him that the guy youre defending did not why is it so important to you that you be able to say rape at people unprompted is it really part of your upcoming routine im looking forward to your first dvd we can call it sobbing and wretched i mean itll be funny but in that cringe comedy sort of way
gaming,not_removed,so rape fantasies bad murder fantasies good or is your only argument if its not part of the games it not tolerated you cant form a party or team up yet people still do it they just choose not to shoot each other should that be not allowed also
gaming,not_removed,you know the fact that youre trying to defeat an argument that says forcing rape fantasies onto another human is bad says a hell of a lot about your character a whole hell of a lot
gaming,not_removed,as opposed to forcing your murder fantasy i can keep batting this right back at you your argument holds as much water as video games make kids want to shoot up their school expect yours is video games make people want to rape each other i get it you cant win the augment so your taking the character assassination approach classic sjw tactic for sure but also a staple for any one that has no ammo left to spend hell im half tempted to misspell something to see if you will jump on that granaid as well þ
gaming,not_removed,noones saying that this makes people want to go out and rape you colossal idiot im saying that you shouldnt force your sick fantasy onto others online and this is the crux of the issue here youre a person so devoid of empathy youd rather turn this into some strawman where you can attempt to successfully argue that people should be able to foist their rape fantasies on others rather than simply say yeah thats bad shouldnt do that im not resorting to attacking your character this has always been about your character your character has always and immediately been in question in this discussion because of the deplorable premise to your statement you cannot separate yourself from it i get it you cant approach the issue honestly because doing so would be admitting the deep lack of value present in your character and you simply cant have that so instead youre going to attempt to go the clinical debate rout so you can hide behind other peoples ideas to avoid stating the truth which is that youre a sick individual arguing that its ok for people to force their sick ideas onto others and the funny part is that youre bad at it as well your arguments come across like a child begging their parent to be right but but thats like saying videogames make people muuuurder nice try it would be a good attempt for a year old but something tells me youre beyond that age range your arguments smell like rotten eggs as does your character youre trash get outta here
gaming,not_removed,i reckon i would sounds pretty good im a teenager from australia if youre interested in demographic
gaming,not_removed,this already exists at least in my area its amazing
gaming,not_removed,fascinating idea id honestly be okay with just about anything
gaming,not_removed,before the gaming lounges in my area shut down my favorite thing was weekend lan parties with tournaments and computer parts as prizes hundreds of people would show up with their own comps people would be playing outside the lounge in an enclosed mall and would compete in the newest games not everyone was outside the lounge just the ones that arrived after the main room filled up
gaming,not_removed,absolutely would need a big ol banner somewhere prominent saying no unsolicited backseat gaming though
gaming,not_removed,im a teenager from australia as well
gaming,not_removed,what do you like about it at that place
gaming,not_removed,im an australia in teenager as well
gaming,not_removed,i like that they have a ton of games and they get new games as they release also they have a stage where you can play rock band which is pretty cool
gaming,not_removed,im a well in teenager australia
gaming,not_removed,australia teenager a well im in
gaming,not_removed,i think it opens noon est
gaming,not_removed,thank you
gaming,not_removed,i used to play bns when it first came out to the western part of the world after a long wait i havent touched it in a few months but id love to get back into it sadly my laptop isnt that good and the game isnt optimized the best
gaming,not_removed,dude whats up with cup noodle lately they seem to be making a really strong marketing effort out of the blue and theyre just warming up
gaming,not_removed,fuck now im hungry it doesnt help that the food looks fantastic in this game even the diner french fries
gaming,not_removed,also constantly reminds us to get a haircut
gaming,not_removed,upvote because that pun was good also idk man but they e been pushing to come back or maybe they never left to begin with lot of product placement in this game too though
gaming,not_removed,you look fantastic
gaming,not_removed,quality post
gaming,not_removed,i think you forgot a little everything
gaming,not_removed,but theres nothing there just a title
gaming,not_removed,cant you see it is poetically devised to simply say nothing at all
gaming,not_removed,tears up so deep so beautiful
gaming,not_removed,while some redditors post shitreposts and call it new content others post actual content we need less reposts here
gaming,not_removed,rgamingcirclejerk
gaming,not_removed,oh this post again this exact same post that gets posted all the time does karma really mean that much to you stop reposting crap and stop fishing for karma
gaming,not_removed,blood and wine was amazing would buy again p
gaming,not_removed,seriously fuck off dae le geraldo of rivers man xdddd
gaming,not_removed,well to be fair this is the first time ive seen it since we entered into i reckon ill see it another times before comes along
gaming,not_removed,reposts are like dakka never enuff dakka
gaming,not_removed,i can taste the salt
gaming,not_removed,what is dakka
gaming,not_removed,you are on rgaming and you dont know what dakka is shame ding its a warhammer reference its an onomatopoeic word made up by the space orks that refers to conventional firearms collectively especially automatic fire weapons orks are obsessed with guns and you can be sure that an ork structure will have big guns sticking out of any and every possible opening never enough guns never enough dakka
gaming,not_removed,waaaaaagh
gaming,not_removed,look closely at the extra detail in the flames and behind the altar in the church
gaming,not_removed,i dont think thats a very good representation probably due to the camera i mean the one on the left is certainly more orange
gaming,not_removed,to me it just looks like someone dropped the exposure and boosted the contrast i see more detail but the pictures on the left are noticibly darker
gaming,not_removed,so whats the point of hdr if i can see these differences on my crappy laptopscreen
gaming,not_removed,looks great but id like to see a tiny bit less colour on the hdr it seems like they cranked it up to
gaming,not_removed,but surely as im not viewing these comparisons on a hdr screen i shouldnt be able to tell the difference
gaming,not_removed,to my untrained eye it looks like only the saturation has been turned up
gaming,not_removed,i think hdr is software that alters the picture on the go and you need new tv with good enough processor for it and you can probably turn it on and off the image on the right is probably more like real life but left one looks better and cinematic just my guess dont quote me on this one
gaming,not_removed,hdr gets a lot closer to accurate colour representation yes it does these pictures tho ehhhhhh
gaming,not_removed,i think hdr is software that alters the picture on the go and you need new tv with good enough processor for it and you can probably turn it on and off the image on the right is probably more like real life but left one looks better and cinematic just my guess dont quote me on this one

gaming,not_removed,i read that initially as geraldo of rivera hmmm
gaming,not_removed,who else read this as geraldo rivera at first
gaming,not_removed,did not see that coming
gaming,not_removed,all the old people just read geraldo rivera lol
gaming,not_removed,ive considered starting this game again dlc included and ive spent about playing it one of the best games ever made
gaming,not_removed,m man
gaming,not_removed,i read this as geraldo rivera many times
gaming,not_removed,he looks like hes seen some shit
gaming,not_removed,upon first glance i thought it read geraldo rivera
gaming,not_removed,been playing witcher and i suck really bad at it any tips for combat i feel like im missing something cause i usually grasp games eventually but not this one
gaming,not_removed,surprise motherfucker
gaming,not_removed,i worked with a guy named gerald who said his uncle was one of the animators and that he made the character after him he wouldve been the right age seemed legit
gaming,not_removed,autocorrect from geraldo rivera
gaming,not_removed,wow i read that as geraldo rivera its early
gaming,not_removed,i was hoping for clandestine

gaming,not_removed,they really stretched their anatomy back in the day
gaming,not_removed,no artist credit
gaming,not_removed,wait i dont get it can someone explain please
gaming,not_removed,i like how changing the last letter changes how you pronounce the first letter
gaming,not_removed,an awesome hairstyle
gaming,not_removed,same thing happened when i googled geraldo rivera
gaming,not_removed,why do people google random nonsense phrases
gaming,not_removed,ok
gaming,not_removed,the journey is the destination man
gaming,not_removed,anyone else read the title too quick and think what does geraldo rivera have to do with hey arnold no just me
gaming,not_removed,the internet provides
gaming,not_removed,i really should get around to playing through that game if only the combat was more fun
gaming,not_removed,thats a penis

gaming,not_removed,silver sword and the steel sword need to switch spots
gaming,not_removed,rshitpost
gaming,not_removed,i love this i want a print of it
gaming,not_removed,google is probably seeing how many people searched gerald of rivia since this post
gaming,not_removed,phoebe must be thrilled
gaming,not_removed,anyone who didnt grow up with the show will be completely lost oh well oo you are now obligated to turn this into a series of meme images go
gaming,not_removed,thy must say stoop kid never leaves his stoop
gaming,not_removed,yeah but gerald has seen the death of thousands and it haunts himoh how it haunts him
gaming,not_removed,i seem to be out of the loop can someone explain this to me
gaming,not_removed,why is his head shaped like a cylinder
gaming,not_removed,read this as geraldo rivera and havent laughed this hard in a while
gaming,not_removed,i feel like i came up with geraldo of rivera but i dont have the photoshop skills to do it
gaming,not_removed,bong head
gaming,not_removed,thanks for the new wallpaper
gaming,not_removed,this is the best thing i will see all day nothing will top this ill report back if anything does if not let me laugh aloneeee in darknesss
gaming,not_removed,ive been playing the witcher recently its really awesome i am much more pleased with the combat system even though you basically swing the sword the same or ways every time it sure beats skyrim
gaming,not_removed,well considering you spelled geralt wrongthis makes sense
gaming,not_removed,i am not sure what to say about this but i hate seeing uploads without comments
gaming,not_removed,inspired by this guy there is a croatian rapper named geralt iz rivije and he is pretty amazing you should check him out he recently released a new album with burky and the legendary hiphop producer koolade
gaming,not_removed,dat hi top fade tho
gaming,not_removed,yeah he just killed the nameless king he also turned into a skinny lizard man
gaming,not_removed,i heard he was collaborating with the lord of stoops
gaming,not_removed,an excellent hairstyle
gaming,not_removed,do you member hey arnold oooh ooh i meeemmmberr
gaming,not_removed,this unexpectedly made me laugh so loud it woke my girlfriend so now shes pissed but what you said is still funny so i equally hate and love you
gaming,not_removed,thats pretty funny i do upvote
gaming,not_removed,that was way more terrifying than i expected
gaming,not_removed,i mean i remember making back when jaden smith was the king of memes
gaming,not_removed,heeeeelgaaaaaahhhhhhh
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,get to the choppa footballhead
gaming,not_removed,artist page this makes you a cool person
gaming,not_removed,well that was nice to wake up to
gaming,not_removed,needs more tooth gap
gaming,not_removed,he looks like hes escaped from a dire straits music video
gaming,not_removed,yikes
gaming,not_removed,i think it looks like gronk lol
gaming,not_removed,well there goes the happy feelings
gaming,not_removed,i legitimately laughed out loud thank you for that
gaming,not_removed,about half and half it is from deviantart but its actually just a screengrab i dont remember which episode its from i think gerald and arnold had a fight in that episode
gaming,not_removed,i swear ive seen him sweep it back at one point and it sprung back up so id say its mostly hair
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i think it hides a huge pair of bunny ears like marge simpson
gaming,not_removed,always reminded me of a bong
gaming,not_removed,the marge mystery
gaming,not_removed,i just realized right now that his head is a bong shape his ear is the bowl
gaming,not_removed,his head is actually a bong his ear is where you pack the weed then eugenes head is a tin can with the top opened up while arnolds is well a football of course
gaming,not_removed,or is his head just a bong for aliens
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,its real life op and in real life you cant always win
gaming,not_removed,for those who might not have heard hey arnold is actually its only a televised movie granted as opposed to a full renewal but most of the original voice cast and writers are returning and the story is going to be a direct continuation of where the series left off so therell finally be some closure at least im kinda hoping it stirs up enough interest though where we might get to see nickelodeon do something more with it in the future hey arnold really delved into a lot of mature topics and handled them in mature meaningful ways despite being marketed as a kids show i enjoyed the more silly stuff like spongebob catdog and rugrats as much as any other kid but hey arnold was the one that resonated with me most it wasnt afraid to confront you with harsh realities from time to time and teach you lessons about life — and i love it for that
gaming,not_removed,agreed since of memes are spongebob memes i say we give some of that percentage to hey arnold memes
gaming,not_removed,whatever you say stoop kid
gaming,not_removed,no you keep the karma
gaming,not_removed,shout out for rheyarnold

gaming,not_removed,oh yeah thats money right there
gaming,not_removed,httpiimgurcomkuroijpg
gaming,not_removed,nopejust every single comment
gaming,not_removed,yes
gaming,not_removed,about in the middle it is from deviantart but its actually just a screengrab i dont remember which episode its from i think gerald and arnold had a fight in that episode
gaming,not_removed,thatd be some good shit theres so much mythology on the supernatural and witchcraft on that continent
gaming,not_removed,or like anyone who watches nicktoons teennick late enough edit mixed the channels up
gaming,not_removed,hi daryl
gaming,not_removed,hello fellow grammartyping nazi
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,thank you i knew this was a repost
gaming,not_removed,dodge first attack second attack once or twice then move
gaming,not_removed,if youre playing on pc get a controller for it it feel way better on controller
gaming,not_removed,rurashithead
gaming,not_removed,geralt of rivia with a t is the proper name of the witcher series protagonist gerald is a character from the old nick show hey arnold op accidentally searched the latter name with the formers title and found this pic
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,yes that is the joke
gaming,not_removed,the nameless king is the best worst boss ever
gaming,not_removed,i killed the nameless king and all i got to show for it was class order hall resource
gaming,not_removed,stoop lord never leaves his stoop
gaming,not_removed,im sure he cant contain his excitement
gaming,not_removed,i like it i wanna see a full episode done with swarzenegger as arnold and no one comments on the fact that hes a chiseled hunk of manbeef
gaming,not_removed,even picasso has nightmares about this
gaming,not_removed,i cant stop looking at it
gaming,not_removed,how can reddit be real if our memes arent real
gaming,not_removed,back when jaden smith was the king of memes his reign shall never end you treasonous swine
gaming,not_removed,dat repetitive clone stamp tool
gaming,not_removed,i read that scrolled down and then a few seconds later heard the governator yell out helga inside my head damn you
gaming,not_removed,rpicturesofpictures
gaming,not_removed,thanks friendo
gaming,not_removed,such a classic episode they got in a fight over working at a flower shop
gaming,not_removed,disturbing
gaming,not_removed,gerald kafka jimmy kafka
gaming,not_removed,thatsapenisgif
gaming,not_removed,theres just no bones in his headhump its a fleshy protrusion inflated with fluids
gaming,not_removed,except for his brain
gaming,not_removed,o my god
gaming,not_removed,jesus no
gaming,not_removed,i dont see anything
gaming,not_removed,so he is a conehead
gaming,not_removed,wait what
gaming,not_removed,marge isnt much of a mystery shes shown with her hair down plenty of times
gaming,not_removed,as a rerfresher the series ended with arnold discovering his parents journal that detailed his birth and their adventures exploring central america in the final scene arnold discovers a map that leads to where his parents went when they disappeared so the movie is going to depict arnold heading to the jungle to find his parents
gaming,not_removed,what other cartoon hits you with the fall of saigon hey arnold was heavy indeed
gaming,not_removed,agreed that was what i didnt like about doug it was just i can only think of milquetoast as a word to describe it but i think that word is only reserved for human description
gaming,not_removed,that karate episode was powerful man
gaming,not_removed,yeah even as a kid hey arnold had that certain something that most other shows lacked that gave it its own charm over the more zany and silly stuff
gaming,not_removed,it wasnt afraid to confront you with harsh realities from time to time and teach you lessons about life — and i love it for that this completely
gaming,not_removed,remember that giant turtle episode
gaming,not_removed,stoop kids afraid to leave his stoop
gaming,not_removed,but do you member star wars
gaming,not_removed,havent all celebrities
gaming,not_removed,if at first you dont succeed something something cocaine

gaming,not_removed,httpsmyoutubecomwatchvdrgoggbyalu
gaming,not_removed,thats a thing
gaming,not_removed,hi brian
gaming,not_removed,yr welcome
gaming,not_removed,i have thought this exactly
gaming,not_removed,why the down votes
gaming,not_removed,the nameless king is what made my implode not me
gaming,not_removed,midboss
gaming,not_removed,worst as in hardest i rather liked the actual boss fight other than the difficulty
gaming,not_removed,nah bro the red death in fallout far harbor hard as hell with no special drops
gaming,not_removed,i just killed the nameless king for the first time the other day very satisfying i found his first form really annoying because sometimes its extremely easy and sometimes hell use his really hard to avoid attacks over and over where he flies up and shoots fire is the worst one so the first stage felt kind of random stage is really hard but once i got the timing of his attacks down there was nothing that felt cheap or undodgeable you just have to be in the zone with your roll dodging and not be greedy with doing damage
gaming,not_removed,actually found him mad easy killed him on my second try with no shield the dancer of the other hand
gaming,not_removed,underrated metareference right here
gaming,not_removed,i heard the lord of stoops rides a majestic giant pigeon
gaming,not_removed,swarzenegger is
gaming,not_removed,my dream is to see the original jurassic park every thing exactly as it is now but the little boy replaced by swarzeneggar no changes to his lines or actions just him in too small clothes acting like a kid yelling a bunch while dinosaurs run around
gaming,not_removed,anyone else remember that site manbeefcom
gaming,not_removed,i concur i also feel the human emotion of fear
gaming,not_removed,even speedwagon is afraid
gaming,not_removed,ill have what hes having
gaming,not_removed,wtf
gaming,not_removed,i didnt know i could cringe this hard
gaming,not_removed,bro what the actual fuck
gaming,not_removed,bird up
gaming,not_removed,you doing ok there buddy
gaming,not_removed,wont be getting anything with that attitude let alone a college girl
gaming,not_removed,wanna go get vert with some freshman in the quad
gaming,not_removed,okay did you post this in the wrong sub
gaming,not_removed,sure
gaming,not_removed,dude smoke a fucking bowl and pick up a hobby helllloooooo
gaming,not_removed,uh what
gaming,not_removed,dafuq
gaming,not_removed,that actually sounds ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gaming,not_removed,how can memes be truly real if supercomputers arent even smarter than baby giraffes jaden smith
gaming,not_removed,free will is a myth religion is a lie we are all pawns controlled by something greater memes the dna of the soul
gaming,not_removed,mirrors and eyes mirrors and eyes

gaming,not_removed,no it was about baseball
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,so if i was to touch it would feel like a giant flacid penis or like a giant boob
gaming,not_removed,thats terrifying
gaming,not_removed,yeah the truth can sometimes be horrifying mate
gaming,not_removed,his head goes into the hairhis head has a huge cylinder on top
gaming,not_removed,on a rating from one to rhombus how hard did you fail geometry
gaming,not_removed,matt groening originally wanted to include a gag in the show there marges hair was meant to conceal a tall pair of rabbit ears which would have been revealed at the end of season four of the show unsurprisingly this idea was scrapped perhaps because it was just really fucking weird but for a short time it was a part of the character in the simpsons arcade game you can see marges bunny ears as part of the animation when she gets electrocuted
gaming,not_removed,but where do her bunny ears go then
gaming,not_removed,smashing
gaming,not_removed,well his dad should be fine family curse offs you at
gaming,not_removed,that was the last episode
gaming,not_removed,yes ive always received weird looks when i mention this but no other kids show that i know of had such a jazzy theme and not just the intro song the little jazzhop transitions between scenes the few times they featured dino spumoni and how subtly they snuck in jazz sax in place of a traditional orchestrated score
gaming,not_removed,i thought that word was for when someone has milk with toast
gaming,not_removed,i member
gaming,not_removed,lockjaw
gaming,not_removed,i member do u member when rgaming wouldent shut up about the witcher
gaming,not_removed,throw a stroller into traffic
gaming,not_removed,oh sorry apparently its teennick not nicktoons they show a bunch of old cartoons at night including angry beavers and rugrats
gaming,not_removed,trust me its worth it i went through the same thing
gaming,not_removed,bed of chaos would need to actually be a boss before it could offer any competition
gaming,not_removed,bed of chaos nameless king ornstein and smough yeah theyre tough but i had more trouble with fucking kalameet than any other boss in the ds series that could also be because i play a heavy str build with ugs
gaming,not_removed,bed of chaos is the best worst boss
gaming,not_removed,mmmid boss
gaming,not_removed,vyers
gaming,not_removed,yeah hes the best worst hes an awesome boss fight but hes hard as hell and took me like tries to beat
gaming,not_removed,the muscle adds three inches
gaming,not_removed,really id have guessed at least dude looks huge but i guess that happens when youre an international bodybuilder
gaming,not_removed,google says he is i have heard stories that he makes an effort to never be photographed while next to taller built men idk anyways i was always under the impression he was under but guess not
gaming,not_removed,now i can say im bigger than arnold schwarzenegger
gaming,not_removed,oh god not this again rbodybuilding inbound
gaming,not_removed,rtotallynotrobots
gaming,not_removed,i rather enjoy your username
gaming,not_removed,are you sure this is the type of person our mothers always warned us about
gaming,not_removed,look at his first comment that he postedover downvote lmao
gaming,not_removed,dont read his other posts youll cringe so hard youll shit yourself
gaming,not_removed,whoa dude youre not being an okay guy right now
gaming,not_removed,professor richard saint dawkins once described a meme as a unit of explained cultural information if this is true and it sure fucking is because the professor sayeth so swine then we are all indigenous to a land that has a whole lot of explaining to do youre right also in saying that free will is a myth its so because saint samuel st harris once wrote that the neuroreceptors responsible in isolating all the heterogenous vibes which inform our sense of the now or grooviness are throwing us foul balls doctor harris said what we perceive as occurring now is actually like five god damn seconds behind schedule whats the deal he asks i am becometh meme the employer of texts made to fit comically against a corresponding backdrop of sensitive semiotic data
gaming,not_removed,how about full of shit is that a meme too
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,free willis a smith
gaming,not_removed,the market crashed so fast it created a dank inflation
gaming,not_removed,huh didnt know that that was incorrect thanks for the information
gaming,not_removed,nah bro they got jobs at a flower store and gerald was getting mad at arnold because he wasnt working hard or having to much fun or something
gaming,not_removed,like a bag of sand
gaming,not_removed,because of the softness of this protrusion and the texture of his hair it would feel exactly like a sheeps testicles scrotum edit wrong body part
gaming,not_removed,i dont get it
gaming,not_removed,oval
gaming,not_removed,triangle
gaming,not_removed,oh shit i never noticed that
gaming,not_removed,ew
gaming,not_removed,i feel like ive seen this hentai
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,hnnnyaaagh
gaming,not_removed,the crossover nobody knew they wanted to see
gaming,not_removed,no joke id love a wild thornberries movie that picks up like ten years later with a eliza in her late teensearly traveling the world on her own and saving animals with a teenage donnie as her sidekick
gaming,not_removed,christ that would be depressing
gaming,not_removed,or that they left because they were working for the successors to httpsenwikipediaorgwikiairamericaairline what gramps tells are the cover stories designed to deflect attention from the massive costs in lives and personnel incurred during their missions
gaming,not_removed,only kids remember
gaming,not_removed,probably one of my favorite episodes of the series really shows arnolds character and i think its the most you get to see of him and his grandma together
gaming,not_removed,wait what thats not right
gaming,not_removed,yes im reminded at least twice a week
gaming,not_removed,your parents are smart people i bet their brains taste better than most
gaming,not_removed,not souls but bloodbourne in the expansion the first boss ludwig is still havent beaten him
gaming,not_removed,artorias whooped my ass a good times before i was able to not make one mistake and get punished dual pursuers are just absurd
gaming,not_removed,thank you people never mention kalameet when talking about the hardest bosses kalameet was fucking hard
gaming,not_removed,the tigers from the last dlc r by far the worst
gaming,not_removed,i caved and called in a helper if im honesty
gaming,not_removed,to his hair
gaming,not_removed,idk where this guys getting
gaming,not_removed,he used to be but people get smaller as they age
gaming,not_removed,no you really cant
gaming,not_removed,ofc thats a thing
gaming,not_removed,rsubredditsimulator is leaking again
gaming,not_removed,even speedwagon is afraid is a memorable quote from the japanese manga jojos bizarre adventure said by the protagonist jonathan joestar to describe the emotional state of the supporting character robert edward o speedwagon during their confrontation with the vampire villain dio brando online the snowclone derived from the original quote has spawned a number of derivative reaction faces in which the subject appears rather frightened or intimidated
gaming,not_removed,probably a deliberate downvote troll then
gaming,not_removed,i just shat myself then
gaming,not_removed,oh my god hes the real life version of kenji from katawa shojo
gaming,not_removed,hes trying to burn through all that karma as fast and as hard as he can
gaming,not_removed,tbh i know i have a lot of free time since im sitting here reading reddit comments but i am truly impressed by people who search other peoples previous posts like thats on a whole other level not only you read someones comment which is alright i guess but you actually take the time to read their comments on unrelated posts you probably have absolutely no interest in httpiimgurcomynlqwrmjpg edit did i rustle your jimmies reddit
gaming,not_removed,stupid long horses ulittodowse
gaming,not_removed,richard i made a dumbed down version of saussures sign theory and called it innovation dawkins
gaming,not_removed,now theres a pretty meme exquisite
gaming,not_removed,its just redundant as theyre both ways of ending a sentence sorry if i came off as a prick its just rare that i see that sort of thing cheers
gaming,not_removed,its a bong
gaming,not_removed,agreed weird shit
gaming,not_removed,considering tim curry cant return as nigel i dont want it to come back
gaming,not_removed,so arnoldxeliza confirmed
gaming,not_removed,ive always wondered if shes demented or just acts crazy because it makes life more fun
gaming,not_removed,its ok i member
gaming,not_removed,do the meme do the meme do the meme
gaming,not_removed,yeah that was a joke man just like the dragon god the bed of chaos is more of a puzzle than an actual boss fight in both games you fight the environment more than boss itself
gaming,not_removed,bed of chaos was a platformer battle in an rpg also literally any weapon but your fists could kill the bug in hit
gaming,not_removed,oh dear it only gets worse and momentarily way better dont want to spoil in case you dont know the bosses it youd like shoot me a fr and i can help you out with ludwig or check out rhuntersbell or you can summon the confederate bossname escapes me at the moment to the right of his boss arena
gaming,not_removed,ive played bloodborne many times on my first time i killed all bosses up until the or on my first try except the first boss he took me like tried and every time i start a new game i always have so much trouble killing that fucker
gaming,not_removed,i couldnt beat him on my own i got him so close but after about tries i gave up and summoned
gaming,not_removed,keep trying man the way i see it its a game of numbers if you have the determination to keep trying eventually some crazy shit will happen and youll win first time i beat him i had bros summoned to help me he happened to charge into a corner and get stuck and we proceeded to stunlock him with his face in the corner so he couldnt move lol ludwig is definitely one of the hardest bosses in that game though second only to laurence imo omg laurence why why
gaming,not_removed,also i can try to help you if you want try being the operative there ludwig is a motherfing bch lol
gaming,not_removed,capra demon i dont know how many times i attempted him but his fucking dogs got me every time i tried to get past him had to put them down
gaming,not_removed,parry
gaming,not_removed,i dont think pontiff is all that hard because landing the parries on him is decently doable even for a parry noob i will say though that hes definitely probably the most satisfying landing a parry and impaling the dude with the choir music going all crazy in the background is a delicious moment
gaming,not_removed,this boss wasnt too bad for me i beat him quick enough that i dont remember the fight very much it just took me tries to kill the nameless king though pretty exhausting boss fight
gaming,not_removed,ive never died while fighting him but ive been killed many times by curse rotted greatwood i dont get it
gaming,not_removed,to his height
gaming,not_removed,kill joy
gaming,not_removed,oh god fucking kenji remember its all a conspiracy
gaming,not_removed,i think hes underflowing his comment karma
gaming,not_removed,i think hes trying to underflow the comment karma counter its working reddit cant save karma as a negative number
gaming,not_removed,it took maybe a minute tops to scroll through his shit posts i was seeing if it was one of those accounts that posts something totally random to try and get up votes this dude is something else entirely
gaming,not_removed,i mean you literally just click on their name its one click its all there
gaming,not_removed,and you think thats a good enough reason to tell someone the world would be better off if they died you dont think maybe thats a slight overreaction if not just nasty
gaming,not_removed,i mean although i was being entirely sarcastic its a bit of a stretch to discredit dawkins work on set anthropological models you surely dont disagree that even as saussure was working in somewhat original premises there is in every inch of his writings a deep acknowledgment of hegelian discursive and why compare dawkins who is not nor has he ever claimed a personal sanction on his being a forwardgoing sociologist to saussure a linguist and rhetorotician of language also as dumbeddown as dawkins might present himself and his work in the world of the audience an important distinction as the more generalized the receiving intellect goes the less space there is for complex arrangements of theory and hardly any room at all for passive inquiry which is really the condom of any practicing philosopher in saussures case his early books display an eager amount of insight into basic hominid cycles you can see that he does overall a fairly good job at distinguishing not just the coadaptive patterns of early ancestors of h s sapiens but also makes many crucial efforts to discuss scientifically the archetype of the psyche with each advancing notion of a species his insight into behavioral roles of h habilus is i think expounded on in at least two of his earlier works saussure didnt go on cable news networks and represent his most incisive ideas i dont think dawkins has to appreciate that his public appearances are by and large an appeal to the masses hes not going to pretend everybody cares about the behavioral composition of an egret is he try reading the principia aloud to guests at a party that one of your lads has decided to throw in honor of getting shitfaced for the occasion of getting hugely shitfaced ill stop you ive tried it before nobody wants it they stopped me heres your sign william engvall
gaming,not_removed,nono its clearly an upside down turtleneck
gaming,not_removed,holy fuck tim curry is
gaming,not_removed,oh yeah i mean i wouldnt be surprised just bummed out
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,just like the dragon god you mean demons soul dragon god right
gaming,not_removed,not even the environment really for the bedit was easy enough to show up with nearzero souls kill part die on purpose come back down kill part die on purpose come back down run straight forward and finish up the hardest part of boc is navigating from one side to the other but doing so is entirely optional as the boss doesnt recover when you die unlike every other boss in the game
gaming,not_removed,bed of chaos is really more of a lottery than a puzzle
gaming,not_removed,the floor attacks
gaming,not_removed,even your fists until about or so
gaming,not_removed,i never could beat the final boss of that dlc so i went and beat whats his face the final boss i forget his name expecting it to be like and giving me a chance to do other stuff like beat the dlc final boss before ng i was sorely mistaken
gaming,not_removed,im always amazed to read this as a noob i beat that guy on my first try and didnt think anything of it my friend who got me into ds nearly shit himself watching took me forever to figure out how to kill a fucking prowling demon though
gaming,not_removed,capra demon was literally the worst for me the tight area dogs so early in the game the one boss in all the souls series ive never beaten i had to have my much better at ds friend to beat it for me
gaming,not_removed,cheese him by throwing fire bombs over the fog gate seriously
gaming,not_removed,there is a trick to killing the capra demon without having to go through the fog door just toss dung pies over the doorway and eventually he dies
gaming,not_removed,pinwheel heres
gaming,not_removed,while it isnt consistent because fucking dogs usually i try to immediately run or roll past them all onto the stairs to turn around and kill the dogs while the capra demon slowly makes his way around the stairs once you kill the dogs you can kite him up the stairs and towards the ledge where you can either jump off or get him to fall while you throw fire bombs at him
gaming,not_removed,its alot quicker for me to just throw firebombs over the wall thats all i do these days
gaming,not_removed,capra demon was ez on my run i played a split magic and melee character so i could camp the top of the stairs on the ledge and not have to go down unless i was drop attacking
gaming,not_removed,use the stairs my man
gaming,not_removed,to his peener
gaming,not_removed,so under his hair he has an enormous forehead
gaming,not_removed,what does this mean
gaming,not_removed,like i dont have time to read all these laborious posts i just read the first word of an entry to get the jist of what they are saying and move on
gaming,not_removed,goddamnit first they steal my turtleneck look then when i try to reinvent it by turning it upside down they take that from me too
gaming,not_removed,he also had a major stroke in and is restricted to a wheelchair
gaming,not_removed,boooooooooo we want memes we want memes we want memes
gaming,not_removed,no he means the hello kitty island adventure dragon god
gaming,not_removed,one small flaw in your strategy you can actually just quit and reload while in the beds boss room and it will spawn you right outside the fog gate just a tip in case you ever revisit
gaming,not_removed,orphan of kos yeah hes a fucknut in any case you can get back to the dlc immediately after vicar amelia so if you ever feel like collapsing that benjamin button wannabes skull let me know i love playing through bb
gaming,not_removed,httpdarksoulswdfilescomlocalfilesenemiesskeletonbeastlargejpg yes that entire area
gaming,not_removed,nito is a peice of cake with a divine weapon though
gaming,not_removed,nito was one of the easiest bosses in the game for me and i didnt even use divine weapons you just have to use shield a lot and know what the cue for the floor sword and aoe were
gaming,not_removed,drop attack is your best friend against that boss early game if you ever try him again run to the top of the stairs this is also an isolated spot capra cant reach you and you can kill the dogs easily then drop attack his ass repeat until his ded
gaming,not_removed,i feel like im the only one that got lucky on capra and got him first try os however made me ragequit the game ended up restarting the game because of those two
gaming,not_removed,capra demon was my wall in but once you figure out how to use the stairs and take out the dogs hes not bad os took me forever though even being able to pretty much oneshot poor smough
gaming,not_removed,this was performed by a bot please contact uetoeskape if you have any problems this was triggered by you using alot the correct way is a lot
gaming,not_removed,to his weaner
gaming,not_removed,to his wife
gaming,not_removed,dont we all
gaming,not_removed,it means reddit doesnt know how to save karma as a negative number so hes getting positive karma instead
gaming,not_removed,youre coming across as a bit of a shitty person first of all all you did was feed the troll and then you said some really uncalled for stuff because he made you salty just kinda sad really dont you realise he has won
gaming,not_removed,i keep forgetting this and every time i am reminded it just makes me sad as a kid i completely loved him as long john silver in muppet treasure island
gaming,not_removed,that one was a though soab
gaming,not_removed,dragon god was the final boss in ninja gaiden iirc
gaming,not_removed,we hardcore hello kitty rpgamers need to stick together
gaming,not_removed,im so meta even this acronym uthefaeranblade
gaming,not_removed,i still play it but never to fight the bed of chaos p
gaming,not_removed,i would take you up on this offer but i have a strict solo only rule for bosses i havent beaten before that and i dont think i have the time or patience for that games dlc in ng
gaming,not_removed,the orphan is the last boss of the dlc you need to beat ludwig first
gaming,not_removed,i just killed the dogs and kept running and cheesed him with my sunbro lightning spears
gaming,not_removed,i really should try again i feel like i might have gotten gud since thenmaybe probably will still make me cry
gaming,not_removed,holy shit same here i was already like into the playthrough i got pissed that i kept dying and blamed it on my build or so hrs later was back at os and couldnt beat them had friend join me who claimed they were easy he kept dying first and finally i beat it despite him joining making the difficulty harder making fun of him for life mission accomplished edit also i didnt have too much trouble with kapra his demise just felt a lot gimmickier on my part ledge jump attack rinse and repeat
gaming,not_removed,os had me using pyromancy and just trying to get lucky with the two that shoot flames from the floor tot he ceiling the names escape me at this point eventually it worked out but it was indeed infuriating
gaming,not_removed,i got capra on my first try with the bass cannon just went in swinging and luckily got both dogs early then gave cappy the ol tank n spank
gaming,not_removed,os took me forever i was always able to kill s but kept losing to uber o then i figured out how to kill him with arrows and managed to cheese him to death
gaming,not_removed,to his wenis
gaming,not_removed,skip to
gaming,not_removed,you found a repost at your local shop
gaming,not_removed,its funny how many people think this is something new this has been circulating the web for the past few years
gaming,not_removed,dats purty gud rit ther
gaming,not_removed,its funny but i have seen this like times in the last months sooo
gaming,not_removed,hell ive only just started browsing rgaming at work the last few weeks ive already seen it like times xd
gaming,not_removed,yup
gaming,not_removed,story time
gaming,not_removed,lost my password wasnt an issue because it auto signed in got new hard drive couldnt recover password contacted support and they fixed it it was so good because they were quick kind and helpful
gaming,not_removed,cs go is the most popular competitive fps
gaming,not_removed,team fortress i mean seriously hats off to valve
gaming,not_removed,csgo popular and gets constant updates
gaming,not_removed,most hacked
gaming,not_removed,can confirm
gaming,not_removed,i hear the cheating is really really bad though what do you think
gaming,not_removed,not really funny
gaming,not_removed,you must be the everyone whos better then me is a hacker guy there is one of you every match
gaming,not_removed,well i would say css and cs i myself love those both but it is very hard to almost impossible to find a server that runs official maps without mods
gaming,not_removed,╯°□°╯︵ ┻━┻
gaming,not_removed,the music is so loud compared to the voice edit aaaaand i saw the end of the video did you just make a whole mod entirely for that punchline
gaming,not_removed,it looks more like changed the name of a book and a spell both do absolutely nothing
gaming,not_removed,new youtuber with some fresh content very nice quality honestly was surprised
gaming,not_removed,bait and switch with trynna play games with me
gaming,not_removed,how many times does this have to be posted
gaming,not_removed,coming from mass effect to was like night and day for me i loved the improvements to combat and yeah the characters in that game are phenomenal
gaming,not_removed,my heart cries when people say these things mass effect was a masterclass in character development and all around a great game however the main story is complete and utter bullshit and doesnt build on the first game in any way i absolutely love the characters but at the end of mass effect youre in exactly the same place as you are at the end of mass effect was superior in every way except character development
gaming,not_removed,i didnt like first time through but i still played the demo because why not its free the moment i walked out onto the spoiler i was just in love
gaming,not_removed,recently finished and moved on to the next day i loved the first game but is so much more polished and welldeveloped
gaming,not_removed,gosh i envy you my man one of the best in the series wish i can forget i played mass effect at all and start fresh
gaming,not_removed,do i have to play the first one in order to enjoy me
gaming,not_removed,and then you play mass effect and youre like what the fuck happened
gaming,not_removed,the changes in the combat system threw me off at first it was fun to go nova on your ennemies with the sentinel in the first me the new system feels more tactical i like it
gaming,not_removed,i agree with everything youve said has better gameplay but the story in is just superior it feels truly epic rip sovereign while is like a side story by the time you start feels like a waste of time especially because they were setting up some dark energy storyline for and then completely dropped it so all the little hints in are also pointless but still its a fun game i do feel the first one was the best though
gaming,not_removed,i have to admit its a little sad that everyone from the original crew is gone right at the beginning of me and only a few ones are recruitable after that i also agree that in me you dont feel like the scope of the story is as big as in the first one it doesnt really feel like youre trying to save the galaxy anymore
gaming,not_removed,im glad i didnt read anything about me before playing it no spoilers and complete surprise
gaming,not_removed,yeah they really did a good job with that moment loved it
gaming,not_removed,i know right when i first entered the omega station and talked to the npcs i got this huge blade runner feeling i loved it
gaming,not_removed,i hear they have a new biotic implant for that
gaming,not_removed,it isnt required however you can carry over your character paragon or renagade points over from which can give you earlier access to different options during conversations
gaming,not_removed,i started with then went back and played the first one and ive never looked back mass effect is a completely different story references to the first game will go entirely over your head but the story mass effect tells will remain entirely intact
gaming,not_removed,cool thanks im gonna get them when they are on a sale then
gaming,not_removed,i hear a lot of disappointed comments about mass effect its starting to make me hesitate about playing it
gaming,not_removed,only thing i didnt like was how it ended but i understand why it likely is how it is
gaming,not_removed,dont hesitate its a great game but the last minutes are bad its worth playing
gaming,not_removed,no way its great game and with free dlc extended cut its not bad even at end so play it i love it even more than but many people will disagree
gaming,not_removed,just remember that disappointment isnt a scale of goodbad its a scale of expectations vs reality people had very high expectations for
gaming,not_removed,rannoch and tuchanka missions were the high point of the series imo
gaming,not_removed,make sure you play the citadel dlc just before the end best dlc ever thats the canon ending for me
gaming,not_removed,you should play for the conclusions of storylines if anything the ending is stupid but it doesnt take away from the experience before that its just disappointing your choices dont have more of an impact
gaming,not_removed,look at the entirety of as the ending to the trilogy and not the ending of the game proper theres a lot of great story elements that are resolved in over the course of multiple missions namely quariangeth krogan genophage among a few others people were frustrated their choices didnt impact the ending more which is understandable but your choices and the history of your imported characters absolutely impacts the above story elements ps on do miranda jacks loyalty missions first and asap youll thank me later also create multiple saves every so often usually after loyalty missions
gaming,not_removed,dont listen to them saying its not good its fantastic
gaming,not_removed,im gonna disagree entirely with what people are saying the game isnt a great game with a bad ending its flawed throughout it pretty much takes the leap to straightforward action game with incredibly linear missions nonstop shooting and then progressing to the next area of missions are start here fight your way through enemies reach destination end mission say goodbye to loyalty missions investigating talking your way out of situations its a third person shooter that puts heavy emphasis on combat shepards dialogue is mostly autodialogue which means most of the time you cant choose what shepard says the game chooses for you the opening cutscene has about ten minutes of dialogue and you only get about three choices in dialogue the rest is selected for you its a war game for me i didnt like it for the same reasons i dont particularly care for gears of war its a linear shooter but thats really all there is to it get the citadel dlc though that feels more like mass effect than the entire rest of the game
gaming,not_removed,the ending bothered me but not as much as other people my problem with was that i saved everyone from me and i couldnt even use half of them in
gaming,not_removed,thats reassuring i tend to focus on the good points of the game im playing so even if the ending sucks its still worth playing the game thanks for the tip about the loyalty missions ill get to it asap
gaming,not_removed,i love watching this guy i hope he continues to make these videos im usually able to catch him on twitch on sundays but not recently
gaming,not_removed,i havent watched this guy but oh man the beginning was hilarious
gaming,not_removed,dude check out all of his videos he doesnt post often but theyre always quality
gaming,not_removed,i remember really enjoying the mod on my awhile back and i imagine if i redo the heat sink i might if im lucky be able to dig through the systems files till i can locate the map but im doubtful i recently bought the black edition on steam and was hoping to play this map but im having difficulties in locating it
gaming,not_removed,these shitty io games are the new minecraft
gaming,not_removed,every time i see a witcher gif or screenshot i want to play it but im not sure if my laptop could handle it or if i should get it for
gaming,not_removed,using ive got like hours played and pretty sure ive still got a ton of content left without even including the stonewine dlcs though its interesting to see that random glitchy stuff is not limited to pc as i once thought
gaming,not_removed,the reflected building look familiarbut hey thats cool that poster
gaming,not_removed,location
gaming,not_removed,anytime anywhere with anyone sounds a bit naughty
gaming,not_removed,birmingham uk handsworth to be exact
gaming,not_removed,i went to a switch preview event in birmingham 😄
gaming,not_removed,if youre going to repost you should at least wait until the original isnt on the front page anymore
gaming,not_removed,put in in your account and wait for a sale with a little patience you can buy both
gaming,not_removed,garrys mod way more to do in it
gaming,not_removed,ooh man i know its not one of the choices but with you should really look into terraria by far the best game for the value
gaming,not_removed,gmod is whacky and that makes me happy while csgo is very competitive and i find that to be oh so repetitive
gaming,not_removed,i sure do love habbo hotel
gaming,not_removed,just remember that if you get garrys mod you will need to have other games because garrys mod uses those textures the games really needed are counter strike source some other textures come from half life episode but that is few in many you also might as well get for stuff since it is free if you do not have css the textures will all be in black and purple boxes and you will see error as assets basically it will look like
gaming,not_removed,any word on the next sale
gaming,not_removed,ok maybe ill buy csgo and wait for gmod to go onsale
gaming,not_removed,there are small sales in the middle of the week but those are usually for games that dont get much attention or wouldnt be bought if they werent on sale still it wouldnt hurt to put the games you want on your wishlist as you get emails when they go on sale other than that they usually do seasonal sales so there will probably be one around septemberoctober there are also special events where things go on sale like anniversaries of game releases or things like that
gaming,not_removed,ive played several citybuilding games the game mechanics difference between citybuilding and wargames is very different so it would be hard to give the player a full gaming experience of both the game that comes closest to what you want is games like anno caesar and pharaoh my alltime favorite
gaming,not_removed,do you want to try a clone of actually based on freeciv but timebased mmo we are working on it the longterm goal is the balance between the war and the world building it is under development httpswwwgacivsinfo
gaming,not_removed,honestly i wouldnt know personally but i like to look at it like this a game engine is only as intense as what the person developing a game for it wants it to be take for example the original doom engine from or id tech what id originally did was groundbreaking at first but quickly lost steam once rolled around with games like duke nukem quake and halflifeteam fortress classiccs by then doom had lost much of its muster then flash forward to when source port engines like gzdoom came around and then people started to get crazy take for example sgtmarkiv with his massively popular mod brutal doom it has the original doom running for cover with the amount of stuff thats in it the same goes for the proceeding iterations of id tech unreal and goldsrcsource what developers put out is the guideline with the exception of frostbite since diceea does not have a developer kit for potential modders for newer games in the battlefield series the rest is what those who tinker and toy with the engine can come up with source is twelve years old and one of the most visually stunning games to come out in recent years is black mesa which uses a heavily modified version of that very engine unreal engine is nine years old and while its been overshadowed by both unity and unreal engine it still has some visually impressive titles on it like bioshock infinite and borderlands you ever heard the phrase beauty is in the eye of the beholder i believe that applies to video games too and it shows at least for me id refers to id software the company behind wolfenstein doom a dos port of super mario bros you read that right and commander keen to name a few
gaming,not_removed,fox engine seems pretty amazing
gaming,not_removed,unreal engine
gaming,not_removed,fox engine it was used on like one game and it makes me so incredibly sad the physics texture quality and animation are above the bar
gaming,not_removed,very interesting you have to give credit where credits due tho you most likely wont see a game as visually appealing as rise of the tomb raider on the unreal engine
gaming,not_removed,it does im wondering what makes one engine better than the other in my given fields by which i mean the visuals and physics ease of use and user friendliness aside
gaming,not_removed,phantom pain did look pretty good
gaming,not_removed,how so what makes it stand out
gaming,not_removed,i dont know i honestly thought bioshock infinite was quite appealing to look at
gaming,not_removed,oh it is believe me but dont you think if it was developed on the cryengine it would look better i dont want to come off or pretend that i know what im talking about but i would think theres a reason the engines ive mentioned have games that look much more realistic than anything made on unreal idtech rage avalanche respective to their time of release dont get me wrong theyre all great engines but you look at and compare it to battlefield and frostbite clearly has more detail than idtech does
gaming,not_removed,honestly i go for level of fun and replay value realism sure battlefield may have more detail and be more realistic than but battlefield is a game i would find difficult to play not in how hard it is mind you but how much i trudge along looking at every texture as if i were a genuine soldier as for a game like doom black mesa or avalanches mad max i go to those not for realism but how much fun i can have and that is one reason i return to classic doom maybe even load up a couple of mods for it if anything im a simple gamer i come for the appeal play for the enjoyment and replay because why the hell not for me video games are a means to escape the hustle and bustle of modern life be it by slaughtering hordes upon hordes of demons with a gun so big that it could crush an ordinary man being a physicscrunching badass while traversing through the halls of some overlyexpansive research facility in new mexico shooting at the occasional alien along the way or cruising the wasteland in a supercharged nitroboosted spikecovered death car
gaming,not_removed,i agree with you but you missed the point i was trying to figure out what about frostbite and cryengine and whatever proprietary engine tomb raider was made on make it look better im just assuming engines like idtech and unreal have no games that compete with and battlefield visuals because frostbite and cryengine have something they dont
gaming,not_removed,oh oh well the crysis series was always made to look stunning and battlefield at least for me looks like a tech demo of sorts like dice is saying this this is what we can and hope to do more in the future
gaming,not_removed,oh boy this is getting better and better cant wait to see multiplayer
gaming,not_removed,so cool looks great man keep it coming
gaming,not_removed,awesome
gaming,not_removed,probably not a good idea to use the trademark name ultima so brazenly will probably incur the wrath of ea
gaming,not_removed,og shit
gaming,not_removed,amy relation to the band
gaming,not_removed,yes sir
gaming,not_removed,nope
gaming,not_removed,come to think of it clementine and carl are almost the same age now they might end up being a thing
gaming,not_removed,yeah
gaming,not_removed,why why would you need to apply scotch tape to an adhesive label
gaming,not_removed,todd what are you doing with my im taping that price tag from that shitty game we got at the goodwill on it why because i wanna get internet points by doing this
gaming,not_removed,so what who wants a free one
gaming,not_removed,fuck that the demographic of people who would pawn a scares me probably dust ash roaches etc in that shit
gaming,not_removed,but whats crawling around the inside
gaming,not_removed,goodwill price tags have not looked like this in many years
gaming,not_removed,rthathappened
gaming,not_removed,be very very careful if you decide to dismantle it and give it a good clean which you should if you want it to keep running google what it looks inside the fan full of dust and you will agree the connector which holds power for the fan is very difficult to separate the connector will break loose from the motherboard very easily and there is no easy way to reattach it
gaming,not_removed,if only
gaming,not_removed,i hope it workedi always see at my goodwill but never a
gaming,not_removed,i once found a dollar transformer figure at goodwill for bucks it was the best day of my life
gaming,not_removed,a real jackpot would be this system for with ofw on it
gaming,not_removed,so why wouldnt an older generation not be that price goodwill doesnt test their consoles when they get them into inventory this is why the consoles are so cheap the buyer takes the risk of buying something that doesnt even work possibly
gaming,not_removed,you know i wonder what its gonna be like when all of the hardware that is now highend will cost only a few bucks because in contrast to a decade ago games now look pretty photorealistic so then youll get amazing graphics for a low price
gaming,not_removed,resell value to game stop for one game
gaming,not_removed,giggity
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i was extremely late to the game acquiring a it was awesome discovering an entire generation of gamesall ungodly cheap too
gaming,not_removed,niiiiice
gaming,not_removed,but i heard has no games
gaming,not_removed,generation old dont want p you are not making me jelous
gaming,not_removed,not to be that guy but its because op tore the label off the box of an easy bake oven and it wouldnt stick without curling
gaming,not_removed,ive seen goodwill do this so the price tags are harder to swap
gaming,not_removed,actually at goodwill we do it because people often do remove labels and stick them on other items the tape helps make sure it is more difficult to get them off its v hard to get taped labels off of items without harming the label in one way or another
gaming,not_removed,at least ops only uses tiny labels mine uses big ass stickers for electronics and shit they come off in one piece about of the time
gaming,not_removed,came in to say i got a nintendo wii for bucks last week so i believe it
gaming,not_removed,being an employee at goodwill i can confirm i placed out an older style a week ago for bucks it didnt have a controller if it did we would have asked to for it
gaming,not_removed,i agree i was in my local goodwill the other day and they were selling​ at year old tv for i call bullshit
gaming,not_removed,this guy
gaming,not_removed,dang would love to have gotten a
gaming,not_removed,goodwill isnt a pawn shop people donate stuff and they use the profits to help people find jobs and job training also its for a you could just turn around and trade it in at gamestop for assuming it works
gaming,not_removed,just car keys and some cash
gaming,not_removed,they vary from district to district apparently mine doesnt use printed price tags they have set prices for clothes shoes movies games household items picturesframes cables the only things they have tags for are electronics furniture and special items behind the counter though they use big tags with handwritten prices in north georgia that are basically impossible to take off in one piece because they rip easily
gaming,not_removed,staff infection uawildsketchappeared could you please
gaming,not_removed,each
gaming,not_removed,which would explain why it was conveniently near the logo
gaming,not_removed,i worked at goodwill and we did in fact do this to make it harder to switch tags
gaming,not_removed,i did not know that
gaming,not_removed,mine has big stickers with the prices written on and a description of the items makes it impossible to swap those tags but the stickers rarely come off in one piece anyway because theyre sticky stickers and they rip easily fucking sucks taking them off when they apply them directly to the item
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,well a wii is really worth only tops so
gaming,not_removed,rekt
gaming,not_removed,i got one from savers last week no cables for got home plugged it in and blinking red light
gaming,not_removed,really goodwill by me sucks then i think the was about heck even the og playstation was without controllers
gaming,not_removed,goodwill needs to have set prices for certain items i asked an employee how they determine the prices and they said it just depends on the backroom employee that prices it some are stingy fucks and some are realistic i asked because there were two exact items and one was special priced at and the other was like new the item was like so i dont know where they got the other price ill see comic books sometimes that are marked at when they only sell for like on ebay
gaming,not_removed,pm sent anyone want an while im at it both come with games im paying shipping this will cost you zero
gaming,not_removed,same but the only game i want one for is the last of us
gaming,not_removed,plus goodwill tests electronics if theres anything wrong with it they toss it in a compactor
gaming,not_removed,bet he finds a gamecube
gaming,not_removed,why did you comment so many times
gaming,not_removed,well here is your
gaming,not_removed,yeah im pretty sure that when me and my bro sold our wii and all its games we had a lot our mariokart disc it was scratched so it didnt even work was worth the most got around bucks or so
gaming,not_removed,ive seen old and sega saturns come in really sucks i cant buy any of them will mark them on the floor for bucks for the console and about buck or two for the controllers
gaming,not_removed,that sucks to hear i know that with goodwill any plug in electric device sold comes with a day return policy for store credit
gaming,not_removed,it all depends on the people that run the store my store we get a lot of nicer dishes in so instead of them being priced at we sometimes go to or even if they are really good
gaming,not_removed,sounds cool why are you giving them away
gaming,not_removed,ill take the xbox
gaming,not_removed,ill take if op isnt in need of the tres
gaming,not_removed,ive watched a play through of it looks really good might get last of us one day if it goes on sale for a good amount
gaming,not_removed,man reddit is weird sometimes why are you getting downvoted for this hell ill probably get gold for this stupid ass comment
gaming,not_removed,there was a glitch in the matrix
gaming,not_removed,i honestly just noticed it been a weird bug with reddit mobile
gaming,not_removed,that was six bucks youre a big fat phony
gaming,not_removed,im gonna try and take it apart and reapply the heat sink since thats usually the cause
gaming,not_removed,both are sitting on the floor beside me havent been turned on in at least a year i am an upper middle class guy who doesnt care about a few bucks and doesnt know what to do with them im a pc gamer too rarely played those consoles a couple high rated exclusives thats it got a now and all ive played on that is uncharted and horizon
gaming,not_removed,ahaha i know right maybe ea is a trigger word or something l its also my first post in this sub safe to safe im going to go back to lurking if this is how this sub reddit behaves
gaming,not_removed,i wanted to copy paste his comment since he double posted but then i kept reading and got bored of reading it so saved myself the trouble
gaming,not_removed,dude i guess
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,youre a good person
gaming,not_removed,kinda looks like zelda
gaming,not_removed,they didnt even try to not get sued
gaming,not_removed,wow crystals almost million uh bolts full spaceship bar too that guy really knows how to play not skyrim
gaming,not_removed,wow i cant believe they just blatantly copied gta v
gaming,not_removed,how the fuck did bethesda get away with copying this game
gaming,not_removed,ratchet clank mixed with skyrim pretty odd combo
gaming,not_removed,oh cool the new fallensouls is out
gaming,not_removed,that chicken got me in so much trouble
gaming,not_removed,lol the hud is from rachet and clank
gaming,not_removed,how do they get away with this shit
gaming,not_removed,dovahkin paarthurnax going commando
gaming,not_removed,finally a mobile version of mario twins they look the same
gaming,not_removed,ratchet and clank hud on skyrim weird i be they have a mod for that somewhere
gaming,not_removed,the chinese dont have to give a fuck and we cant really do shit about it plus you know this is false advertising because if youre stupid enough to download the game youre greeted with some ridiculous level graphics and a story line less sophisticated than pong
gaming,not_removed,wait would ratchet be a khajiit albeit a far smarter and less annoying one and clank would be a tiny dwemer centurion right this needs to be a mod
gaming,not_removed,clearly they reskinned fallout
gaming,not_removed,looks like minecraft to me
gaming,not_removed,its called fallensouls clearly a falloutsouls ripoff guys
gaming,not_removed,i saw an ad for some online zombie game on tumblr recently that was showing days gone gameplay im surprised companies arent losing their shit and claiming copyright and shutting this shit down
gaming,not_removed,i like how the health bar clearly has a spaceship next to it
gaming,not_removed,how you gonna use the ratch and clank hud smh
gaming,not_removed,fuck that chicken
gaming,not_removed,ah yes roller coaster tycoon
gaming,not_removed,how is doing this legal i see so many awful rts mobile games advertised on instagram either stealing from another game or portraying their game as more than it actually is mobile strike your game looks nothing like the ads
gaming,not_removed,i think that might be fallout yeah thats the one
gaming,not_removed,fallen ratchetrym
gaming,not_removed,they must be having a laugh they even put together a name from dark souls and its offbrand western imitation lords of the fallen
gaming,not_removed,ratchet and khajiit
gaming,not_removed,man the sheer size of the lawsuit is making me horny
gaming,not_removed,looks exactly like ratchet and clank
gaming,not_removed,fuckin christ sven
gaming,not_removed,yeah i dont know if its just me but ive been seeing a lot of ads for some incredibly bad parodies though that might actually be a compliment at this rate of popular games or if not parodiescopies the trailer itself shows something completely far fetched lol
gaming,not_removed,fuck i knew the new call of duty ripped off mario
gaming,not_removed,man i cant believe mobile games are still years behind console and pc look how terrible the graphics are cmon phones are you even trying
gaming,not_removed,fallenscrolls
gaming,not_removed,ratchet clank
gaming,not_removed,man hes really been grinding bolts
gaming,not_removed,morrowwind
gaming,not_removed,psst i know who you are
gaming,not_removed,i believe its dark soulscould be bloodborne but i would put money on dark souls
gaming,not_removed,it is like they dont even try to hide it anymore
gaming,not_removed,its clearly ripping off legacy of discord
gaming,not_removed,rimsky or something like that
gaming,not_removed,perhaps this is a good idea for a future title skysouls future tools of destruction darkscrolls going commando
gaming,not_removed,the new call of duty looks amazing
gaming,not_removed,seriously
gaming,not_removed,looks like minryks to me
gaming,not_removed,these flappy bird rip off mobile games have gone too far
gaming,not_removed,looks like pokémon
gaming,not_removed,omg i saw this ad today i was like theres no way you can play this on a phone then i realized it was skyrim 😑 well played
gaming,not_removed,who the fuck are the people that liked the post
gaming,not_removed,ahhh demon souls ofc
gaming,not_removed,nioh
gaming,not_removed,bethesda can sue over this cant they
gaming,not_removed,yes because medieval times needed bolts and had jet pack robots
gaming,not_removed,skyrim and ratchet and clank
gaming,not_removed,that reminds me i havent finished playing it yet
gaming,not_removed,i used to be a aaa game like you but then i took an arrow in the knee
gaming,not_removed,cringe
gaming,not_removed,with a hud like something out of cod
gaming,not_removed,reminds me of copyright infringement and false advertising i still remember a dev at about or years ago saying that console and pc gaming is dying and that mobile gaming is the future lol
gaming,not_removed,the mobile gaming community really needs to die every other god damn add i see for a mobile game is just a screenshotvideo from another game or just cgi bs that they say is gameplay
gaming,not_removed,is this what the no mans sky patches have been all about
gaming,not_removed,i think its probably dark souls
gaming,not_removed,i knew half life was a thing
gaming,not_removed,well let me refresh your memory its a game called skyrim
gaming,not_removed,aha thats the one its the totally not ratchet clank hud that threw me off there
gaming,not_removed,the thing on the upper left corner seems like a spaceship that in the bottom right a bolt skyrim helmet fallensouls title dark souls skyrim ftl ratechet and clank crossover
gaming,not_removed,or far cry without guns
gaming,not_removed,moron obviously its two worlds
gaming,not_removed,but what if zelda was a girl
gaming,not_removed,the least they could do is not have him wearing one of the most easily recognized armor sets in any game ever even people who have never played skyrim before know this is skyrim
gaming,not_removed,basically there are so many of these kinds of blatant pieces of copyrighttrademark infringing mobile game that no game studiospublishers legal department can file enough cease and desists with the courts by the time the legal copyrighttrademark holders can get to this game sixteen others with elder scrolls intellectual property will have popped up in its place
gaming,not_removed,they wont get sued the game might get blocked but some suckers will buy it and thus the scammers make money
gaming,not_removed,you havent played ratchet and clank get on that shit
gaming,not_removed,i think i spam spaceship too much it doesnt have enough time to fully recharge
gaming,not_removed,consolepc gaming has no integrity unlike these poor persecuted mobile devs
gaming,not_removed,my fantasy
gaming,not_removed,because theyre in china and good luck finding them let alone suing them
gaming,not_removed,mobile
gaming,not_removed,nobody cares enough to actually sue them over it
gaming,not_removed,the bigname game companies wont do anything about this shit because itd just be too expensive the cost of suing all these little companies would massively outweigh any potential profit or money theyd get and itd just be a waste of time theyre like flies you kill one and a dozen more pop up to take its place
gaming,not_removed,your princess is in another house go away
gaming,not_removed,i would say to them you want ice cream cone both of them say yes
gaming,not_removed,they know theyll get caught they just dont care the bigname game companies dont do anything about it because going after all these little ripoff games would be extremely expensive and ultimately futile you take down one of these little companies and a dozen more pop up the next day
gaming,not_removed,im almost tempted to download it
gaming,not_removed,it cant be that clear its a jetpack
gaming,not_removed,i love when they push the free to play thing on ads for mobile games anyone who has played free mobile games knows that you get about minutes of gameplay only to hit that inevitable youre out of energy would you like to buy energy for or wait hours to regenerate energy
gaming,not_removed,forgotten scrolls eye of the nerevarine
gaming,not_removed,wow
gaming,not_removed,httpimgurcomgalleryaxjmn
gaming,not_removed,you must be super fun at parties
gaming,not_removed,why are you even here do you get what a joke is
gaming,not_removed,tough crowd
gaming,not_removed,i was going to bring that up too rather unrealistic having bolts
gaming,not_removed,and trying to associate themselves with the souls series
gaming,not_removed,hahahaah skyrim and ratchet clank weird combo
gaming,not_removed,i love
gaming,not_removed,unicorn potions
gaming,not_removed,the taint
gaming,not_removed,they took this shot from the trailer
gaming,not_removed,dude this is ratchet and clank
gaming,not_removed,can confirm i knew it was skyrim didnt know you could jetpack though
gaming,not_removed,it wont stop people on reddit for asking what game is this when somebody doesnt include it in their post
gaming,not_removed,that doesnt make any sense though why cant they just file as many claims as possible why would they simply throw their arms up and not even bother even if your argument is that by the time they shit one down many more will have popped up that would happen regardless of whether they try to stop one of the companies or not they might as well do what they can even if they can stop it all rather than simply doing nothing besides that dont you actually lose a copyright if you take no active measures to protect it
gaming,not_removed,i am not even sure if they have a case the game doesnt look at all like that and the picture doesnt say in any place fallensouls they just can say the picture is not related it is clearly a clickbait crafted to avoid trouble copyright and trademarks laws are full of bullshit and they know how to game them
gaming,not_removed,i knew a recognized those hud textures from somewhere now its personal
gaming,not_removed,one day china is going to create a fake china and no one will be able to tell the difference except for the fake china will give you ass cancer
gaming,not_removed,i hate mobile gaming one of the biggest problems is that there is no quality control as soon as something starts getting popular the mobile market is flooded with cheap clones and bad knockoffs not to mention all the other games aimed at little kids with daddys wallet
gaming,not_removed,how in the hell
gaming,not_removed,cut off one head two more will take its place
gaming,not_removed,yes i was making a joke too everyone thought i was being serious
gaming,not_removed,suck it alduin ive got a ryno
gaming,not_removed,that was common on playthrough if you were good at dodging
gaming,not_removed,clank has become invisible apparently
gaming,not_removed,lol cant fool the reddit gaming community
gaming,not_removed,legend of the lords of the dark fallen souls the wild hunts breath of the final morrowind
gaming,not_removed,the people who work for this company must have the easiest jobs ever
gaming,not_removed,mods can do wonders
gaming,not_removed,the reason it makes no sense is because its not the reason why this stuff is allowed to happen the companies operating these scam games are not beholden to american law and it takes quite a lot more effort to try and get them to do anything or even sue them than it would if there were just thousands of scam operations out of milwaukee the amount of them is a factor but only because it makes the main issue even worse not because its the main issue itself ripoff games do operate in america too but theyre dealt with and because theyre dealt with there are way fewer of them and theyre a lot less blatant
gaming,not_removed,remember you need to pay your legal teams it costs money to actually pursue legal action the cost of suing all these little shit companies would massively outweight any potential profit theyd gain and itd just be a waste of time like the other guy you take down one and a dozen more show up to fill the gap usually the same company with a different name
gaming,not_removed,its like playing whackamole on expert but you have to pay your lawyer every time you actually whack a mole
gaming,not_removed,besides that dont you actually lose a copyright if you take no active measures to protect it this is for trademarks and not copyright and i think ive heard that it doesnt even apply to trademarks so i dunno it definitely doesnt apply her
gaming,not_removed,while im not familiar with ripoff games if its anything like fake makeup makeup that is usually made in china and replicated high end brands then there is a shit ton of it so many places and so many websites propagate it that it would probably cost more money paying the legal teams to hunt it down than it would to just let it go
gaming,not_removed,this is why google play and the app store needs a better approval process
gaming,not_removed,theyre twins thats why
gaming,not_removed,yeah but the sarcasm is so evident that being literal ruins it
gaming,not_removed,dragonborn you may have a ryno but you dont have a ryno ii
gaming,not_removed,knuckles
gaming,not_removed,final chapter prologue prequel sequel x unchained part
gaming,not_removed,ripoff games sounds like the name of a great small time developer trying to be ironic but would inevitably be swallowed up by ea and no longer be ironic
gaming,not_removed,which is why actually interesting projects usually get taken down at the last second like that skyrim mod where they wanted to make the entire world of lotr which was sent a cease and desist letter several months before launch dont feel too bad for companies for having to put up with assholes because when its to their advantage theyll be just as much the asshole as them
gaming,not_removed,im certain they have generic cease and desist forms drafted by a legal firm they can just send out whenever they want
gaming,not_removed,theres no sarcasm

gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i get what youre trying to say man it really is sad that business ethics is looked at as some kind of abstract theory days
gaming,not_removed,just read the title again
gaming,not_removed,not only is han frozen he shrunk a lot or everyone in the star wars universe is inch tall like their action figures o
gaming,not_removed,maybe everyone in the fallout universe is feet tall
gaming,not_removed,how funny would it be if the star wars universe was pint sized and in a spin off they cross galaxys and time and meet a human from our world and they are like the giants in bfg youve got these little tiny jedi creatures trying to kill you with the force and all they do is create a bit of a breeze at your ankles hahaha
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,so the galaxy far far away is really only a few miles
gaming,not_removed,that sir or madam is the best un recognized comment ever
gaming,not_removed,this is incrizbdle huh was writing incredible and it auto corrected i was going to fix it but its kind of beautiful anyway the death star is really just a big beachball
gaming,not_removed,look in your device manager under graphics adapters
gaming,not_removed,or run dxdiag and check video
gaming,not_removed,make sure you power supply is hooked up properly
gaming,not_removed,its hook up properlywhat if my gpu cant really handle even psp games is that possible
gaming,not_removed,it is possible emulation is far more resource intensive than running the software on native hardware i referred you to your device manager because you had asked what gpu you have you can see what gpu you have from your device manager
gaming,not_removed,but even guilty gear psp is a but wont run properly i assume i only have intel gmai guess
gaming,not_removed,if you dont have a discrete graphics card then you are running an intel hd graphics you can look up the specifications of the card but generally integrated intel graphics do not perform very well im not sure what your bottleneck is for your emulator but generally emulators are more cpu heavy
gaming,not_removed,nice video dude i post minecraft videos aswell so feel free to check them out﻿
gaming,not_removed,is the game called shit post
gaming,not_removed,you thought about it first that means it was over before any of us even knew about it since you had already lost
gaming,not_removed,you just mad because you lost
gaming,not_removed,im sorry but he is right this is a shit post the game is over it has been over for years read the rules and how it
gaming,not_removed,i cant find the off button oh god im so sorry
gaming,not_removed,i just love how preston keeps talking about settlements while melting your flesh
gaming,not_removed,preston is the biggest dick in the game from nowhere he promotes you to general despite having no clear obligation he informs you the general that settlements need help and then proceeds to command you to do it despite voting himself as the subordinate like a dick thats all while hes shooting you in the face because hes an arsehole and knicking all the good loot you never knew about until that moment you lose it go into his inventory take off his hat and throw it in the fucking river
gaming,not_removed,why dont you carry this heavy missile launcher incase i need it tries to shoot a dog with a missile launcher and kills player
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a bit different for you
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a bit different for you fwoooooooooosh
gaming,not_removed,i lose it every time he turns its so quick and he keeps doing it
gaming,not_removed,he was tired of you not helping the settlements
gaming,not_removed,like talking to a drunk guy peeing
gaming,not_removed,that one friend that sees a mosquito on you
gaming,not_removed,didnt i see this a few hours ago with a higher resolution edit i saw it on imgur
gaming,not_removed,the minutemen are the worst
gaming,not_removed,whats that you say this flamer is very loud do you want me to let go of the button
gaming,not_removed,this is cartoonlevel hilarity
gaming,not_removed,this isnt a bug this is a life lesson dont start conversations with people using flamethrowers
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i really wish there was a way to kill preston i fucking hated him
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,oh but try and retaliate and the whole damn community flips their shit why are we attacking the general of the minute men because he felt the need to defend himself getim
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,at least its not raining
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a bit different for you he wasnt wrong
gaming,not_removed,this is what happebed to the settlement this happened
gaming,not_removed,preston listen to my mixtape
gaming,not_removed,i dont want to set the world on fire i just want to start a flame in your heart
gaming,not_removed,i got tired of your shit you think you can walk away i see you i see the looks you give me you knew what i was gonna talk about dont you those settlements need you help
gaming,not_removed,prestons revenge
gaming,not_removed,vault dweller preston preston preston preston takes off headphones spins around quickly vault dweller standing there body made of ash i was wondering if you could turn that off
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a bit different for you is right
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a bit different for you
gaming,not_removed,it was a pleasure to burn preston garvey fahrenheit
gaming,not_removed,fire fire
gaming,not_removed,i guess when you didnt go help the settlement that needed your help he decided to light a fire under your ass literally
gaming,not_removed,more like minute steakmen
gaming,not_removed,i laughed too hard at this
gaming,not_removed,this is why you do not interrupt a person who is operating dangerous equipment
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a bit different for you uhh sorry preston im really not into that sort of thing
gaming,not_removed,it just works
gaming,not_removed,let me mark it on your map motherfucker
gaming,not_removed,obligatory wrath of preston garvey link best thing i ever saw happening on a fallout playthrough
gaming,not_removed,yeah oh and what was with those two fucking giant power generators that the radio requires
gaming,not_removed,it seems like something that could definitely happen in real life the day they are training soldiers to use flame throwers
gaming,not_removed,saving this i need this on a loop in a digital frame on my wall
gaming,not_removed,why the fuck would you give preston a flamethrower
gaming,not_removed,thats why companions cant have nice things
gaming,not_removed,op shouldnt have dressed up as a deathclaw for halloween
gaming,not_removed,he probably was busy thinking of another settlement that needs your help
gaming,not_removed,i think he likes you
gaming,not_removed,if you wont help the settlement then ill take one back
gaming,not_removed,love this game
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a bit different for you yea a face full of napalm
gaming,not_removed,i like the settlement crafting part but the constant interruptions and disconnect between setting up defense and bad guys spawning wherever was annoying if i set up defense it should be self sufficient maybe you get a rare huge raiding party that needs one of your lieutenants to help or get attacked at once and you get to help out once in a while where a huge raiding party dozens or more is attacking they just need to tweak the mechanics
gaming,not_removed,a new settlement needs our help preston did someone say settlement
gaming,not_removed,preston i got something different for you starts lighting player on fire
gaming,not_removed,still better than being asked to defend a settlement
gaming,not_removed,classic bethesda
gaming,not_removed,i legit just spat my coffee out at work
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a little bit different for you orders you to kill raiders
gaming,not_removed,when you want to roast a jerk but he literally roasts you instead
gaming,not_removed,i love how he still gave you the quest hahaha
gaming,not_removed,ah the flamercy
gaming,not_removed,i have another mission for your general
gaming,not_removed,shhhhhno tears only dreamsanother settlement needs your help
gaming,not_removed,ive got something different for you
gaming,not_removed,hahaha 😂
gaming,not_removed,i hate him
gaming,not_removed,dont bother the man when hes working dude
gaming,not_removed,i cant find
gaming,not_removed,and thats what happens when you bother a man cooking breakfast
gaming,not_removed,this was really funny
gaming,not_removed,lmao holy shit the subtitles perfection
gaming,not_removed,that vault dwellers a spy
gaming,not_removed,you need to watch this use gentle pressure when talking to preston
gaming,not_removed,um why do the flames keep following you hes not moving
gaming,not_removed,neutralize the cleaners agent
gaming,not_removed,what a heated discussion
gaming,not_removed,i see why this made it to the top of the hot posts
gaming,not_removed,no matter where you go the fire follows your direction it reminds me of sitting around a campfire i always seem to be the one the smoke chooses
gaming,not_removed,i actually died when he did that to me edit and had to retake the castle because of it
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a bit different for you
gaming,not_removed,a metaphor for how well youve been doing on all those settlements
gaming,not_removed,thats why i never help settlements got burnt enough times
gaming,not_removed,ive tried to play this game for like hours and i just cant get through it its just kinda boring
gaming,not_removed,look with your head not your whole body
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a bit different for you my sides are in orbit
gaming,not_removed,sorry you had a bug on your face
gaming,not_removed,thought this was battlefield at first glance
gaming,not_removed,yeah had that happen to me once too
gaming,not_removed,im logging in to kill preston right meow
gaming,not_removed,damn you op i broke out laughing in the middle of a lecture
gaming,not_removed,fuck preston yo there are no minutemen in fallout just you the minuteman
gaming,not_removed,oops my finger slipped oops my finger slipped
gaming,not_removed,i dont like this npc whatsoever
gaming,not_removed,get that fucking gun out of my face preston i just wanna know where i need to go
gaming,not_removed,i love how it follows you even when preston stops moving
gaming,not_removed,somehow i get sudden urge to reinstall the game
gaming,not_removed,i shouldnt watch these while im on the phone with tech support clients i just laughed in her ear
gaming,not_removed,wheres the fus ro dah when you need it
gaming,not_removed,why did you give him a flamethrower of all weapons
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a bit different for you
gaming,not_removed,i knew where this was going but the anticipation made it better somehow
gaming,not_removed,never distract a guy when hes flamethrowing
gaming,not_removed,spy checking is always important
gaming,not_removed,hes just distracted p
gaming,not_removed,what did he say i dont know
gaming,not_removed,pro tip dont try to talk to the guy using a flamethrower p
gaming,not_removed,tread carefully here preston for you tread on my dreams
gaming,not_removed,i really really enjoy this game but i just cannot invest time in it until they fix the god damn fire support bug it isnt even that big of a deal but that righteous authority would be so useful on survival and with no mods and no console its just permanently bugged how can they be sitting on such a widelyreported bug for such a long damn time
gaming,not_removed,is that a fucking flamethrower
gaming,not_removed,firs thing that came to my mind
gaming,not_removed,i have to say my favorite part of the game is when you finish up the nukaworld missions and preston never fucking talks to you again its wonderful ive never felt so free
gaming,not_removed,dont bother a man while hes working haha
gaming,not_removed,i can see why preston was never promoted to general
gaming,not_removed,its like that scene in grandmas boy
gaming,not_removed,this is such a bethesda gif
gaming,not_removed,you didnt do what he asked
gaming,not_removed,this is like when someone is peeing and cant cut off their stream and then someone else pulls or pushes them and it just sprays everywhere
gaming,not_removed,fuck dude this had me laughing in class
gaming,not_removed,thats why i killed it ass for his hat and jacket
gaming,not_removed,this is spectacular peak garvey
gaming,not_removed,thats ok the real punishment is hey there is a settlement that needs our help
gaming,not_removed,the npc version of moonmoon
gaming,not_removed,two things for you to do mod it kill it
gaming,not_removed,do you think were ready to retake the castle
gaming,not_removed,oh my god thats amazing half the fucking castle is on fire when hes done
gaming,not_removed,yup learned real fast that your companion should not carry a flamer
gaming,not_removed,i like how the wall is just covered in fire
gaming,not_removed,wow now thats what i call heat seeking
gaming,not_removed,see this is exactly why i dont let my followers have fire or explosives
gaming,not_removed,least favorite companion
gaming,not_removed,i kill him everytime i play fallout
gaming,not_removed,being on fire is a poor excuse for failing to help that settlement i sent you too shakes head the minutemen are supposed to help people not run around screaming maybe next time youll put more effort in
gaming,not_removed,trigger discipline
gaming,not_removed,lmao
gaming,not_removed,im sorry but i have to do this to save the settlements
gaming,not_removed,i got full influence with preston for the first time the other day and now i cant meme on him anymoreleave preston alone
gaming,not_removed,supressing fiiiiiiiiiiirrrreee
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,there is a futurama reference here
gaming,not_removed,i love how the entire back wall is burning
gaming,not_removed,ive got something different for you
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a bit different for you proceeds to roast the player alive
gaming,not_removed,another settlement needs your help toasting marshmallows fwoooosh
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a bit different for you
gaming,not_removed,hes always doing something to make you mad
gaming,not_removed,i cant get the fucker to stop talking about 🚨 spoiler alert 🚨 setting off the reactor to destroy the institute ive been playing an additional hours and he still keeps saying that was one hell of a bang
gaming,not_removed,i cant tell you how many times sulik killed me in fallout a bandit would run up and stab me in the face then sulik would run right behind me and minigun the dude right through my goddamn body
gaming,not_removed,why cant i stop laughing
gaming,not_removed,i zoomed in on the speech and preston ive got something a little bit different for you ill say
gaming,not_removed,pranked
gaming,not_removed,i said another fucking settlement needs oour help do i have your attention now
gaming,not_removed,meanwhile on rprestongarvey the same gif is entitled stupid fucking pc startles me when im trying to burn out the rest of the crab eggs flamethrower goes everywhere somehow im still to blame
gaming,not_removed,so much time i invested on my settlements so much time
gaming,not_removed,i guess all that pent up aggression wasnt healthy
gaming,not_removed,say it dont spray it
gaming,not_removed,hey preston watcha doin oh hey hey it burns it burns stop it stooooop
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a bit different for you
gaming,not_removed,your fault for distracting a guy while hes using a flame thrower
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,preston thinks your the thing
gaming,not_removed,greatest ever
gaming,not_removed,here ive got a new settlement for you to help ill mark it on your skin grafts
gaming,not_removed,fieldgun ftw
gaming,not_removed,prestoncanyoufukinnot breh
gaming,not_removed,i was having such a bad day at work my god this made me laugh at work thank you
gaming,not_removed,i just finished this mission yesterday that queen mirelurk was a bitch
gaming,not_removed,settlerslivesmatter preston garvey
gaming,not_removed,its because your hud is that god awful green instead of amber
gaming,not_removed,preston firebreathing nah firepissing
gaming,not_removed,just when i thought bethesda couldnt be any worse at making video games
gaming,not_removed,and this is why i hate these sandbox bethesda games more freedom and vast universe crappy immersion in said universe but bethesda doesnt care they get this feedback every time but continue to churn out the same game with a boiler plate plot and tons of side quests that in the end dont mean anything no real resolution to the story hate it
gaming,not_removed,bethesda make gud gmes
gaming,not_removed,what game is this s
gaming,not_removed,fuck this gif froze my fucking phone and forced me to hard reset
gaming,not_removed,httpiimgurcomfdasrrupng
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,httpiimgurcomxppnlydgif
gaming,not_removed,the best part is the subtitles ive got something a little bit different for you as he fucking lights you up
gaming,not_removed,are you fucking sorry
gaming,not_removed,that actually made me laugh 😂
gaming,not_removed,at least its not mininukes
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,secretly hes all like burn yes burn i will be in charge again
gaming,not_removed,what i cant hear you this flamethrower is really loud
gaming,not_removed,this is why we cant have nice things
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,ive got something a bit different for you
gaming,not_removed,somebody needs to make a comic where a mentally challenged fellow gets promoted to general by preston then commanded to run into a pit of deathclaws with a peashooter i dont know how he does it but he keeps on coming back at first it was a joke and now i just give him missions to see how long i can keep this up for
gaming,not_removed,from nowhere he promotes you to general despite having no clear obligation you ever think he does that to make you the fall guy if the minuteman group fails its your fault not his also you forgot to mention that he leads a group into your neighborhood then decides that he and his group will become squatters in your home
gaming,not_removed,although as a male character you do have military experience preston doesnt know that though so he can go fuck himself
gaming,not_removed,i did a play through without ever going to save them and it was a much better game
gaming,not_removed,id love to see a machinima where preston and father go around the commonwealth together giving huge responsabilities to random unqualified strangers
gaming,not_removed,if you decide to play along with the raiders in nukaworld for a while since you know youre trapped in the middle of a burgeoning civil war with them he bitches you out and eventually stops talking to you
gaming,not_removed,welcome to a part of why fallout is so flawed the sole survivor shouldve been another npc not the games version of commander shepard you shouldve busted into vault found mr survivor then gone through the tutorial until you reached sanctuary preston would make him the general and he and preston could give you quests some of which involve finding shawn then you could either do their quests or tell them to fuck off while you dicked around boston etc without it seeming so stupid that the general who is desperate to find his kid would decide to go investigate the glowing sea for no good reason
gaming,not_removed,wait whats this about him getting the good loot
gaming,not_removed,topping from the bottom
gaming,not_removed,is the only place in the universe where sht rolls uphill
gaming,not_removed,what are you talking about thats how armies work all the lower rank just meander around the fort while the general runs around doing everything with his dog
gaming,not_removed,take off his hat and throw it in the fucking river i dont know exactly why but that has tickled me hilarious
gaming,not_removed,ive always figured that the reason why preston treats you the way he does is because deep down he really wants to be the leader of the minutemen but he hates himself for failing them and doesnt think hes good enough to be the real leader but then you come along this amazing militarytrained leader personality with more charisma than he could ever hope to have and so he promotes you to general thinking you could be the one to save the minutemen hes the one really leading the minutemen by giving you orders and leading the troops and generally taking care of all the logistics but hes so damaged and depressed that he literally wont allow himself to take credit for anything he does so he uses you as some kind of totem for his admiration and success and allows you to take credit for all the good deeds he wouldve wanted to do on his own he idolizes you because hes chosen to take all the hopes and dreams he had for himself in trying to resurrect the minutemen and transfers them to you out of a belief that youd fulfill those dreams better than he ever could which ultimately you usually do in other words while he may not entirely have planned on it youre his puppet not in a malicious way just in the sense that preston would rather lead you from behind the sidelines and hold you up as some kind of savior of the minutemen than to take up that mantle himself and potentially risk leading the minutemen to destruction all over again similar to how gage wanted to run nukaworld i guess but i dont think even preston is entirely aware of why hes letting you take credit for everything its probably subconscious
gaming,not_removed,and hes the only one bad at it when im surrounded by supermutants in a destroyed suburb cait takes out the fat man she found from somewhere and kills everyone in three seconds whereas preston just throws a molotov to a ghoul charging me killing us both thanks a million
gaming,not_removed,psych another settlement needs our help
gaming,not_removed,why does it burn
gaming,not_removed,a bit fiery
gaming,not_removed,these flames need your help
gaming,not_removed,in grade my friend let me drive his moped i didnt make it out of the driveway before i drove into a giant bush i panicked and just kept throttling this reminds me of that
gaming,not_removed,op is willing to do anything in order to help those poor settlements
gaming,not_removed,your comment is good and you should feel good
gaming,not_removed,guys if youre ever in denver hahaha wtf
gaming,not_removed,they have funny hats and a general not quite in the running for commonwealth faction of the year
gaming,not_removed,im on my first play through of any fallout game right now after meeting the brotherhood and the railroad the minutemen seem like the best option to align with at this point i havent met the institute yet but i cant imagine myself going with them the minutemen are the only faction it seems that doesnt have some weird thing with synths i dont want to take a bullet for a synth so the railroad is out i dont want to wipe out all synths so brotherhood doesnt really fit really i dont care about what the synths do as long as they arent trying to kill me or other people
gaming,not_removed,i actually love the minutemen because they can be whatever i want them to be were bringing justice and democracy to the commonwealth
gaming,not_removed,not even a good name fucking minutemen sounds like a help group for dealing with premature ejaculation
gaming,not_removed,you are looking at the lake
gaming,not_removed,eeehh factionwise theyre the only ones as far as i can tell who dont have a dick up their ass trying to force you to kill everyone else this actually made me stop playing for months because i didnt want to betray any of the factions or blow up a place where there were children running around which is why i loved the far harbor dlc you can bring peace between the factions there with minimal bloodshed
gaming,not_removed,did you say no or go
gaming,not_removed,im sure theres a mod
gaming,not_removed,hes genuinely the reason i stopped playing halfway through hes more annoying than the needy cousin in
gaming,not_removed,but he is standing still
gaming,not_removed,bet he uses a phlog too
gaming,not_removed,hey preston go guard this totally empty settlement on the other side of the map with those useless survivors you brought with you
gaming,not_removed,theres a flamer lying around in the castle for some reason preston wanders off and equips it when youre retaking it i think thats the case anyway
gaming,not_removed,could not upvote this more even if i wanted to
gaming,not_removed,do better
gaming,not_removed,super mario bros
gaming,not_removed,this is in the running for the best thing ive ever seen
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i thought id never have use but something something i once corrected the simpsons minigun upvote gif apparently there was a reason in the future why i did it
gaming,not_removed,holy fuck thats great httpimgurcomyxvhusf
gaming,not_removed,seriously who let him do this
gaming,not_removed,what the hell lol
gaming,not_removed,wait is that daredevil with punishers minigun
gaming,not_removed,i need some context
gaming,not_removed,is he shooting transformers
gaming,not_removed,casually tossing fire at the reporter always gets me
gaming,not_removed,i remember my first firebending training
gaming,not_removed,firemage level
gaming,not_removed,what on earth is going on in this gif
gaming,not_removed,came here for this
gaming,not_removed,hes not a fireman hes fireman
gaming,not_removed,thank you
gaming,not_removed,hahaha amazing especially fills me with terminator nostalgia
gaming,not_removed,perfect
gaming,not_removed,i never knew i needed this thank you
gaming,not_removed,theres a settlement that needs our help
gaming,not_removed,we purposely trained him wrong as a joke
gaming,not_removed,i rather like
gaming,not_removed,i feel as though that would make a great bitter strike animation
gaming,not_removed,theyve just got that perfect blend of invulnerable and expendable that makes for the perfect henchman
gaming,not_removed,its not your house its across the street
gaming,not_removed,its starting to add up that hes a dick though i mean he has two options hes either setting you up as a fall guy or he meets a stranger that declares he is the time child from before the war who saw the bombs fell and has traversed through space and time to be here with a youthful zesty look and his immediate instinct is that story checks out you want to run my organization i like the thought that the minutemen are just a bunch of fucking morons that dont scrutinize things and play dress up like most modern american militas
gaming,not_removed,i did every playthrough after my first where i save him and then just say no thanks when he brings up the whole general thing
gaming,not_removed,you know the annoying neighbors in of all sitcoms the ones that are always up to some wacky adventure and trying to rope the protagonist into it thats preston garvey you do him one favor and suddenly he thinks youre his best friend ever and will totally let his entire band of eccentrics crash on your couch and never get a job fuck this guy and fuck every one in his group too the bitchy one the douchey jonny bravo one the druggie psychic and the spineless one nobody remembers i did not know i was holding that rant back
gaming,not_removed,i did the same thing i got bored and bogged down on my first play through so i started over with my one goal being never go to concord
gaming,not_removed,i like my artillery though
gaming,not_removed,eventually stops talking to you praise jesus
gaming,not_removed,is he the only one that reacts i took strong with me thinking hed enjoy himself and he didnt say anything
gaming,not_removed,being commander shepard is fine mostly because its commander not general shepard is the tip of the spear forging and leading an elite unit the sole survivors job of general is basically urban planner mixed with personally showing up to save peoples asses
gaming,not_removed,thats why i loved oblivion youre just some dude fated to help save the world maybe its irrelevant point is your job is to fix things youre the guy who goes on missions which makes for a fun rpg the person who if they died would literally ruin everything sits in a nice safe fort guarded by trained soldiers all day if you died it would suck but they could probably find someone else to go into caves and retrieve artifacts if they needed to if oblivion was made by bethesda today you would be martin septim heir to the emperors throne who is good at everything and everyone who meets you invites you to be their boss since youre the emperor but you also sometimes steal vegetables for some reason and do favors for daedric princes
gaming,not_removed,now that you mention it it probably wouldve been a lot more fun if we were seeing this plot from the outside it wouldve added a lot more mystery on if the sole survivor is actually prewar or a synth because we all knew theyd never have the balls to do that twist hed be a fun manoutoftime companion to adventure with maybe some locations would trigger dialogue where hed talk about what prewar life was like and talk about his family and give you more of an emotional incentive to follow up on the quest the plot twist with the institute would probably have to be changed but ive yet to hear anybody say they liked the idea to begin with
gaming,not_removed,they could have established that one of your prewar neighbours also had military experience then after the bombs if you dont want to be general you conveniently hear about someone else who had left the vault a week earlier
gaming,not_removed,gah why dont you go write for bethesda so much better an idea
gaming,not_removed,your companions will randomly and quietly pick up loot sometimes youll notice them with a new weapon and some ammo if they started out empty gotta watch them greedy bastards
gaming,not_removed,really raiders in the settlement on the other side of the map as general i order you to take care of the problem preston
gaming,not_removed,if video games and anime have taught me anything its that someones position in any kind of hierachical organization is directly proportional to their level of literal power
gaming,not_removed,i never give any companions weapons least i just watch them fire every bullet ive ever found never had them pick up weapons of their own either
gaming,not_removed,i once gave deacon plasma grenades i thought he was only throwing them at me because we were in combat a minute and a half later after everything was long dead and looted hes still throwing them at me and im dancing around trying to get close enough to take them away from him never give deacon plasma grenades
gaming,not_removed,feral ghouls at the national guard training yard no way no way i have shot that glowing guy on the toilet about times yeesh
gaming,not_removed,general try fighting fire with fire
gaming,not_removed,i rode a bike into a car once i didnt know how to stop
gaming,not_removed,whiskey throttle
gaming,not_removed,im trying to imagine casually startling someone
gaming,not_removed,briar is really good though
gaming,not_removed,are they any worse than the toasters are people too the only good person is a dead person or these are my human tinkertoys factions though they only faction worth a damn in the whole commonwealth are the atom cats also the slog because they manage to deal with their raider problems on their own but i wouldnt mind seeing a mod where they team up with the atom cats and take back the whole commonwealth
gaming,not_removed,in terms of story and lore yeah the minutemen are the best faction in the game but in terms of playing the game theyre awful and its just tedious
gaming,not_removed,you should probably not be in this thread if you havent finished the game do yourself a favor and check out of here before you get spoiled
gaming,not_removed,the institute actually may be the right choice for you if you get over the fact that they sometimes do bad things to get what they want i mean they might kinda fit with your opinion of synths as just robots
gaming,not_removed,the institute can be neat to side with but i think fallout the pitt dlc does the best job at making you pick a significant side new vegas is a must play for anyone but for me it often feels like a cant we all just get along thing where you can get of the factions to side with you with enough work
gaming,not_removed,democracy is nonnegotiable
gaming,not_removed,the real minutemen were actually quite cool though httpsenwikipediaorgwikiminutemen
gaming,not_removed,except for the player character hes a sixty minuteman
gaming,not_removed,by the end of the story i only protected the drive in the alley and red rocket all the other settlements i didnt give a fuck about all are super fortified so i just warp in and do nothing but im still forced to go there its dumb i feel like after a certain defence rating you shouldnt have to help them any more
gaming,not_removed,hey ugadgetuk it me your cousin roman do you want to go see some big american tittys
gaming,not_removed,you could just make him hate you you can kill him when he leaves
gaming,not_removed,thats why the nuka world dlc is so great you do the quest there and then preston quits talking to you
gaming,not_removed,hey its me ur cousin theres a settlement that needs ur help
gaming,not_removed,is there a bowling alley in the wasteland somewhere
gaming,not_removed,hes a slightly more advanced pyro who knows how to press s but he presses it at the same time as w because hes still an idiot
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,oh i see well this never happened to me that makes it more hilarious actually
gaming,not_removed,challenge accepted im already making a video game anyway
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,hmmmm
gaming,not_removed,i told you to keep that image of me private
gaming,not_removed,i dont know why youre getting downvoted rubbing yourself with butter is a perfectly acceptable reaction to that
gaming,not_removed,oh god that made me uncomfortable i was made uncomfortable by a cartoon of some toast
gaming,not_removed,i watched that gif for far too long than i shouldve oo
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,it looks like the text was replaced seems like it was probably supposed to be a standard badass panel but this is obviously the much better version
gaming,not_removed,the text was replaced look around the letters they have a weird halo
gaming,not_removed,you get a fire you get a fire you get a fire you get a fire you get a fire everybody gets a fire
gaming,not_removed,last time i saw this posted people were saying that was actually the mayor he casually tossed fire at it was supposed to be some kind of fire safety demonstration which obviously did not go well
gaming,not_removed,it looks like it got him pretty good too
gaming,not_removed,it really shows his disdain for modern journalism
gaming,not_removed,they are called firefighters for a reason
gaming,not_removed,i remember my first agni kai
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,youre welcome
gaming,not_removed,ill burn the location on your map
gaming,not_removed,i bleed first making me the winner
gaming,not_removed,this means he must be wearing squeaky shoes
gaming,not_removed,if youve got a settlement ill help it nyah
gaming,not_removed,wait till you see my face to your plasma rifle proceeds to sponge a storm of lasers and bullets killing everyone with a baseball bat
gaming,not_removed,oh my christ thats the best thing ive seen in ages fuck me lol
gaming,not_removed,what fresh hell have you introduced me to and why cant i look away
gaming,not_removed,you got any paracetamol
gaming,not_removed,and yet a fairly accurate representation of jun
gaming,not_removed,christ now im reading all the comments with a geordie accent
gaming,not_removed,i couldnt understand about half of what was said here but it was incredible im not a fookin johnny im from unintelligible
gaming,not_removed,fook ah you lookun at ya cow
gaming,not_removed,its still your neighborhood they didnt ask if they could set up there they just show up and take over
gaming,not_removed,also they knew about this since before you were unfrozen the last time of which was years ago
gaming,not_removed,to be fair people end up squatting all over the damn neighborhood i dont think theres anything to keep them from doing it in your house if theres a bed in there
gaming,not_removed,i find preston sleeping in the bed in my house all the time
gaming,not_removed,either that or he sees some strange guy slice and shoot his way through an entire gang of bandits who then tells him that he is over years old and was born before the great war but isnt a ghoul and he is looking for his son walt said strange man then hops into power armour which usually requires training to use and murders a deathclaw and some more bandits preston decides well this guy may be a fucking maniac but at least if i point him in the right direction he might do some good in this wasteland so he tells you that you are the general now to humour you then sort of points you in the direction of enemies like you are some sort of autistic superman
gaming,not_removed,or he meets a stranger that declares he is the time child from before the war who saw the bombs fell and has traversed through space and time to be here with a youthful zesty look and his immediate instinct is that story checks out you want to run my organization i justify it in my current play through as being partly due to the fact that i look almost exactly like gognak and have the stats to match vats blitz crafting build with base strength and was in fact slated to play him in a tv show that never aired imagine running into arnold years in the future if the bombs had dropped just before conan came out yeah youd try to use that with all the desperation and incompetance you had also the pip boy goes a long way to back up your story
gaming,not_removed,id love a fallout where the game conveys to the player that they have an amazing backstory but really their character is just a liar and has been making up his story the entire time
gaming,not_removed,so what do you say general no thanks dont be silly general theres a settlement i need you to look into
gaming,not_removed,same much better
gaming,not_removed,good goood let the hate flow
gaming,not_removed,did you accidentally describe the scoobydoo gang
gaming,not_removed,i dont know about the others but i intentionally let the druggie overdose so i could be rid of her then i quietly dismembered her coprse and threw it in the river
gaming,not_removed,king of battle
gaming,not_removed,if you go talk to him in sanctuary during different levels of the dlc hell yell at you
gaming,not_removed,shepard also has a bunch of lore reason to have the various positions and responsibilities heshe gets there isnt anything in fallout lorewise that justifies why the sole survivor is this bethesdagrade unstoppable one man apocalypse that can and will do everything for everyone
gaming,not_removed,what i meant by that was that fallout shoehorns you into a role you are this exsoldier or exlawyer who can use power armor with a dead spouse and a missing kid who will be expected to rebuild the wasteland like it or not you cant create your own character for this game really its made worse by skills especially speech not meaning anything and not having an effect on the plot you are fred fallout you have a destiny and nothing you do can change that theres no player expression allowed in your character there are no real builds for your character nor does the game react to any choices you might make regarding your perks even the previous games only gave you an origin courier vault dweller etc and you were allowed to be at the very least an asshole or a saint sometimes to specific people or factions in fallout the only effect your behavior has is will my companion like or hate me the other games didnt restrict you like does it was find your dad or maybe get revenge on that guy who shot you beyond that it was up to you in fallout its find your kid and another settlement needs your help
gaming,not_removed,or just put codsworth in charge of them theyll either die off within the week or be the tidiest military force in the commonwealth either way its winwin
gaming,not_removed,always remove your fusion cores from your power armour
gaming,not_removed,happened in skyrim as well went into a mine overlooking whiterun to clear it out of bandits half way up to the exit i kill this dunmer with this cool dragon staff im a magicaka user so mentally i tell myself to make sure to loot her when im done killing her buddies end of the fight im looting or so bodies and im having a hard time figuring out which one has the staff im confused because i knew we killed her but the staff is no where to be found so frustrated i move on to more bandits only for flames to shoot past me and engulf the mobs i turn around to see lydia there staring at me like im an idiot with a sword in one hand and that cool dragon staff in the other
gaming,not_removed,its more fun to mod the companions to have infinite ammo for the weapon there have just dont give them grenadesmolotovs
gaming,not_removed,ada seems to like blasting me every time the fighting is done finish wiping out a bunch of baddies and sure enough the whole screen goes white and blurry as she blasts me in the back again
gaming,not_removed,build one artillery piece in every settlement you will have worldwide artillery coverage nothing sweeter than tossing blue smoke into a raider nest and watching the fun begin
gaming,not_removed,is this key and peele
gaming,not_removed,nah man but i wish i could i got stuck with this critical yet boring mission of doing my laundry good luck
gaming,not_removed,i opened a door and startled someone yesterday it was pretty casual
gaming,not_removed,ive been okay so far if it gets spoiled it gets spoiled it is more my fault that i am playing a game that is over a year old the fun is in the journey not the destination
gaming,not_removed,itll be interesting right now the institute is the bad guy so we will see
gaming,not_removed,are synths not people too yes they are not people too
gaming,not_removed,ive had it about weeks now but have close to hours in it i can only play a few hours a week so obviously i have been getting in time whenever i can loving it though so much fun exploring and i am enjoying the settlement building part way more than i thought i would im nearing the point where i need to chose a side in the story though
gaming,not_removed,later on there were
gaming,not_removed,nah fuck that long live the queen cunt
gaming,not_removed,if you become hour man consult a physician
gaming,not_removed,that and the fact that i spent so much time building walls and choke points only for the raiders to just teleport into the middle of the settlement every time
gaming,not_removed,whats dumb is the settlers never know how to fix their own damn settlements i give them enough scrap to fix a few turrets and they never do whats the point of protecting settlers who dont even try
gaming,not_removed,best of luck its fun but hard
gaming,not_removed,yeah and im sure your retro pixel shooter will be oh so original and on par with one of the biggest releases of last year
gaming,not_removed,my favorite comment was a weapon to surpass metal gear hahaha
gaming,not_removed,now a couple people are wondering why there is some guy taking a shit and laughing about it
gaming,not_removed,lil bits
gaming,not_removed,reminds me of the dude who
gaming,not_removed,day of the tentacle remaster has even worse resolution than the original
gaming,not_removed,the sound it makes is the best part vrrt vrrt vrrt vrrt vrrt
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,username checks out
gaming,not_removed,yeah just blow right by the fact that hes a giant toast monster
gaming,not_removed,what about rubbing other people with butter
gaming,not_removed,i thought that was a plug socket
gaming,not_removed,nobodys concerned about the pat of butter whos clearly not enjoying this
gaming,not_removed,i kind of find it erotic ninja edit words
gaming,not_removed,i watched it and instaclicked off it i still watched it far too long
gaming,not_removed,im sure he got fired
gaming,not_removed,what are you talking about it went as intended
gaming,not_removed,you are thanked
gaming,not_removed,lets burn your skin a bit and youll fit right in
gaming,not_removed,ill burn the location on your map flesh ftfy
gaming,not_removed,face to foot style howd ya like it
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,kung pow enter the fist
gaming,not_removed,im not a geordie im from hartlepool geordies are people from newcastle hartlepool is a town south of newcastle where everyone has the same accent its a local joke that anyone not from hartlepool just sees them as geordies as well
gaming,not_removed,i learned more about futbol soccer chants andor references from that video than any other source id also never heard of httpsenwikipediaorgwikistottiecake before i hereby say that this video is of an educational nature and should be shown in schools
gaming,not_removed,im not a fucking geordie im from hartlepool understanding northerners is a skill that takes years of dedication
gaming,not_removed,yeah its pretty weird that you never get a chance to mention that in the museum theyre squabbling over whether or not sanctuary is safe and you cant say hey guys ive actually cleaned it up and im living there
gaming,not_removed,i assigned him to a bed far away from my house fuck that guy
gaming,not_removed,things take an amusing turn if you imagine preston clucking his tongue and going man i just joined this for the larping and the tacos
gaming,not_removed,this is my favorite interpretation
gaming,not_removed,shaun not walt
gaming,not_removed,its more ocd than autistic though damn did you just give me a mission i can ignore that i can nooo ok im going just get out of my list
gaming,not_removed,they took my son
gaming,not_removed,i think you may have nailed it
gaming,not_removed,like you are some sort of autistic superman you mean httpsenwikipediaorgwikibizarro
gaming,not_removed,havent played the game but im familiar with the intro i think this is best explanation
gaming,not_removed,autistic superman is my new favorite show on the cw
gaming,not_removed,when you learn the power of head canons anything is available in your story
gaming,not_removed,exactly there is almost no freedom in how you go about the world factions and your own fate
gaming,not_removed,excepting the fact that shaggy is easily the most memorable one also is velma then the druggie psychic
gaming,not_removed,there isnt anything in fallout lorewise that justifies why the sole survivor is this bethesdagrade unstoppable one man apocalypse that can and will do everything for everyone exsoldier doesnt say what kind of soldier i always figured my character to have been some sort of special forces elite since i focus on crit bonuses and stealth hits plus a lot of crafting my play style comes out like john mcclane in the first die hard movie my husband periodically catches me doing it out loud too oh why am i doing this why do i even care about these people oh crap oh crap oh crap and then i pull back come about drop down to one knee and wham take out something enormous in one welltimed shot its a blast literally too did you know if you shoot the gas puddles they do like oil slicks in skyrim and if theres something splodey in the gas puddle it splodeys
gaming,not_removed,this is perhaps my main reason for modding the game to the extreme it does not make sense that im this uberhuman capable of taking down a team of hardcore raiders in corvega without so much as a scratch instead ive modded the game so very few people have guns there is a lack of ammo and supplies and that im a synth with a definite lack of softfleaahy bullet sponge meat around me
gaming,not_removed,as a fallout fan from the first game yes you nailed it the only way to get around this is to never go to sanctuary and meet codsworth and never save preston and his crew in concord problem with that is that the speech options are still pathetic yes yes yes or sarcastic yes and the game ends up being pa crafting and looting simulator wherein the sole purpose is to become a total badass if bethesda wants to redeem this series they need to go back to the drawing board lose the voice actors for the player character make stats actually have an effect on the game ever play with int in and allow the player some freedom to play as they wish
gaming,not_removed,they did state when they announced the game they were going with a more story oriented game design which necessitates a bit of that defining the character they didnt do a great job but they tried
gaming,not_removed,learned that one the hard when i had to spend mins looking around the castle for suits randomly hidden all over the place with their cores at
gaming,not_removed,why is that
gaming,not_removed,give them a fat man and unlimited ammo then you get to play dodgeball for the rest of the game
gaming,not_removed,and then watch it go on for like an hour if you dont mod it to be more functional those settlers seriously need some fire discipline i need maybe shells from each gun not fucking verdun
gaming,not_removed,good way to look at it also for fallout it is even better since in my opinion doing pretty much anything but the main quest line is huge amounts of fun
gaming,not_removed,my favorite
gaming,not_removed,got a good chuckle from this
gaming,not_removed,lol
gaming,not_removed,guess what the wall just got feet higher
gaming,not_removed,if youre into mods get settlement management software it gives you a holotape that allows you to well manage settlements you can autoassign settlers to tasks check unassigned objects a few other things it also has the option to mark the enemy spawn points in a given settlement so that you can make sure youre not dooming them to spawn in your base it also allows for some interesting trapsetting since you know exactly which directions theyre going to be coming from
gaming,not_removed,at least ill have enough foresight to have an npc stop shooting his flamethrower when talking to a nonenemy
gaming,not_removed,i working on a simcity style city builder that count i hope this count ineedhelp
gaming,not_removed,what

gaming,not_removed,stop ruining our shitty scripting player one
gaming,not_removed,guess the joke was lost on you
gaming,not_removed,i just assumed uchazzing was making a joke you literally can turn down prestons offer to make you general and not do any of the minutemen stuff youll still have the option to talk to him later and take him up on his offer if you change your mind but you are in absolutely no way shape or form railroaded into becoming the minutemen general
gaming,not_removed,the only thing you can do to save yourself from player one is to ask them to do something else
gaming,not_removed,if i remember correctly the male character is a recipient of the medal of honor
gaming,not_removed,fortunately perks pa and the main story are totally optional played on survival as a survival combat game its very fun
gaming,not_removed,npcs will steal the armour
gaming,not_removed,sounds like a challenge how would that work indoors
gaming,not_removed,not yet i am not worried about finishing the story though since there will still be much to do afterwards
gaming,not_removed,yeah bugs happen youll never work at that level so i guess youll never get it
gaming,not_removed,im the guy

gaming,not_removed,my nipples look like milk duds
gaming,not_removed,i was thinking just today about how i still want a sequel
gaming,not_removed,they should go back and kill the first one too
gaming,not_removed,paracetamol is the uk version of what we americans call acetaminophen which is much more commonly known by its brand name tylenol
gaming,not_removed,paracetamol i think americans generally know it as tylenol
gaming,not_removed,paracetamol its a pain killer
gaming,not_removed,oh yes never watched that tv show completely missed it due to no context
gaming,not_removed,can confirm joke
gaming,not_removed,lets see fallout wiki depending on player choice the sole survivor is either a male retired army veteran or a female law school graduate according to prewar records of the lookout at the uss constitution the husband served in the battalion infantry regiment while the wife was a lawyer you know what though im playing a female and i decided early that she was going to be the soldier i dont care what the opening says so as you can probably guess if i dont care that shes supposed to be the lawyer instead of the soldier i also dont care that hes supposed to be an infantryman if i want her to be exspecial forces guess what shes special forces the dialogue actually makes more sense that way
gaming,not_removed,currently doing this with a melee raidermadman character its hard but fun
gaming,not_removed,my sparkling suit of ended up on the other side of the goddamn commonwealth because one of my traderoute settlers decided it was theirs i found it after maybe hours of play randomly when i bumped into them in the wild
gaming,not_removed,yeah they do happen and they happen all the time in bethesda games but hey the community will fix them through mods and that makes it okay and theyll also fix the gameplay and the graphics and also theyll fix all of the crashes
gaming,not_removed,oh im going to go take a poop and laugh solidarity brother
gaming,not_removed,makes sense now franks
gaming,not_removed,theyre burnt theyre moldy and some are good to eat i suppose
gaming,not_removed,where giant toast monsters smear butter on themselves they will soon smear giant toast monsters on themselves
gaming,not_removed,wiiiuwiiiuuiwiiiiuwiiiiuwiiiuwiiiu
gaming,not_removed,no leave it alone its perfect as it is ive never laughed so much at a film as i have done the first time i watched kung pow if i could blank my memory and watch a film again for the first time it would be kung pow
gaming,not_removed,i was thinking just the other day how im still waiting for the incredibles
gaming,not_removed,i remember there was a building i went into i think its the one where the male is actually supposed to give a speech to that day it said something about a medal of honor or something
gaming,not_removed,either that or court cases in us were resolved through deathmatches between attorney and prosecutor armed with anything they please including power armor and heavy weapons
gaming,not_removed,sit tall friend
gaming,not_removed,ftfyfranked that for you
gaming,not_removed,we are going to build a breakfast nook and the giant toast monsters are going to pay for it
gaming,not_removed,if you dont like it then make your own giant toast monsters
gaming,not_removed,shit tall friend ftfy
gaming,not_removed,frank you for that
gaming,not_removed,make breakfast great again
gaming,not_removed,grab toast by the crusty

gaming,not_removed,im never going to try minecraft on vr because ill probably freak out the moment i hear a creeper hissing behind me i dont know what it is with vr but somehow scary experiences in vr somehow scare me when im not afraid of anything when sitting in front of a screen ive played every silent hill game without getting spooked but vr just makes things seem like its me in that situation not a character controlled by me
gaming,not_removed,guess thats the point of vr
gaming,not_removed,noice
gaming,not_removed,the whole game httpsgfycatcomacceptablecandidamericancrayfish
gaming,not_removed,youre old enough to know the truth now thats how vw beatles are made
gaming,not_removed,also my hud keeps disappearing and i dont see my menu to select weapons favors etc
gaming,not_removed,on a more serious note how is the new dlc
gaming,not_removed,tell me httpimgurcomkhjhzel
gaming,not_removed,i am almost finished with it i will have to admit i had a little grin when i found out you get to grow different strains of weed and upgrade your grow house with planters lighting water etc to cultivate the best plants the story line was really nice too and i have my new favorite car now the nightcrawler is the best
gaming,not_removed,how many new cars do you get and is it possible to customize the new vehicles
gaming,not_removed,you get an el camino what looks like it that sounds sick and is almost indestructible and a vm beetle van like the one in the screenshot you just have to finish certain missions to unlock them i have customized the nightcrawler el camino but i have not unlocked the van i am sure you can though
gaming,not_removed,sounds cool but i heard the dlc is rather short around hours and you can finish everything content might be good but for bucks i dont see myself playing this
gaming,not_removed,it does seem pretty short and it was not as difficult as playing the regular missions i am still going through i bought the deluxe version which came with the season pass so it just comes with it but i can see it being more of a purchase than i am not sure if the extra features come with the dlc i can drop grenades while driving proximity mines and my new favorite feature which helps since i drive simulation is the slowmo option
gaming,not_removed,i can drop grenades while driving proximity mines and my new favorite feature which helps since i drive simulation is the slowmo option fortunately these abilities are for free everyone gets them
gaming,not_removed,then yeah but you get to grow weed if you are into that
gaming,not_removed,dont get me wrong i forced myself to enjoy mafia for what it is as i waited years the taste is still sour i put in around hours completed it twice the thing is you cant do much with the money except for customizing your vehicle with such a beautifully detailed world theres nothing to do for bucks i would be willing to buy all the dlc combined then i might get a bang for my buck hours is not enough as i would probably receive the same experience if i were to watch it on youtube
gaming,not_removed,for me i think i enjoy the music since i feel old and it is a change i cannot play it constantly though i would play a few missions get bored then goto i would play about games in mypark due to lag how long it takes to connect etc and finally load up witcher so i agree with what you say it gets old fast
gaming,not_removed,the music is phenomenal probably that and the gunplay is mafia strongest points i want to enjoy mafia when it was first released my excitements through the roof then i noticed the fps bugs and just terrible graphics thats why i had to force myself to enjoy mafia paying bucks to beta test this shit is an understatement to how i felt unfortunately only have on pc its still sitting there in my library need to check it out
gaming,not_removed,ahh i am not a pc user yet i play on xboxones with a tv i havent seen the low frame rate yet but i do get more glitches now since the new dlc and the gunplay is awesome i stick with the suppressed weapons low damage but i sneak everywhere whistling and doing a takedown is probably my next highest way to kill
gaming,not_removed,damn thats too bad i stick with the suppressed weapons low damage but i sneak everywhere whistling and doing a takedown is probably my next highest way to kill i used every single gun or special abillity to make the game more interesting each mission a different approachweapon if you ever feel bored and want to try out something fun try taking over a stronghold with just your fists and knife hilarious have a good day man
gaming,not_removed,koopa better hurry before the enchanted mushroom rots away
gaming,not_removed,why does bowser look like a hipster tho
gaming,not_removed,fire flower
gaming,not_removed,you wont get those years back
gaming,not_removed,and when she does a chargeback you will also have your accounts banned
gaming,not_removed,good one
gaming,not_removed,grand theft auto is a good one
gaming,not_removed,rocket league
gaming,not_removed,i think your best practice is to just drive with your parent
gaming,not_removed,usa truck driver simulator hands down get you a ticket if you dont use a blinker or run a red light
gaming,not_removed,mario kart
gaming,not_removed,i second gta i used to get blazed and pretend i was driving with my girlfriend and obey all the traffic laws then id eventually get bored and run into a cop and yell oh shit natalie we gotta run and then just go crazy trying to evade cops but yeah you can just jack a normal car and wait for red lights and shit
gaming,not_removed,heh sleeping dogs will get you all confused set in hong kong so you drive on the left side as far as i know there arent any games that will teach you driving rules gta is set on american roads but honestly if you follow the law while playing gta you aint playing gta ive heard simulators like forza motorsport and dirt rally can help you learn steering and turning though obviously these are racing simulators and help with steering not rules of the road also its kinda doubtful how much they really help in real life driving
gaming,not_removed,bus simulator
gaming,not_removed,i cant tell you how many times i use those skills since i started transporting large scale model planets around skate parks
gaming,not_removed,yeah it goes great until i get to a fourway intersection
gaming,not_removed,i was going to suggest euro truck driver simulator but that sounds better
gaming,not_removed,wow an actual suggestion i got euro truck driver simulator as a gift though i havent played it does the same thing apply
gaming,not_removed,the more you do it the better youll be i believe a way intersection rules are whoever arrived at a sign first goes but a much better driver moral or self rule is dont be a dick if youre getting anxious about it wave the other people to go ahead if its you and another person and they wave you to go go makes it a lot easier edit good news is your state might have a permit app test you can download for your phone and the repetition will help you remember some rules and what not
gaming,not_removed,i believe its accurate to road rules but they would be european road rules and on the wrong side and itll get you totally confused so i wouldnt recommend it even so with american truck sim youre still driving big trucks theres enough differences you really should just learn from someone or take drivers ed
gaming,not_removed,i try when i can uhh same thing kinda i mean it wont hurt does have blinkers and what not if im not mistaken european signs are nothing like american signs obviously so that aspect wont help but the right on red rules and stuff are the same nothing honestly beats driving with someone else a video game will only teaches so much but it doesnt hurt to get somewhat of an idea how things work
gaming,not_removed,uncharted although doom was great
gaming,not_removed,im tied between overwatch and final fantasy not many games can grab my attention for long but those two have sucked away many hours of my life and i enjoyed the fuck out of them overwatch was a suprise as i really dont care for shooter type games and only play a select few was everything i wanted it to be plus more i went in with low expectations and was blown away
gaming,not_removed,i really really digged the witcher and its expansions thats it for me edit oopsy time travel is weird
gaming,not_removed,dark souls
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,uncharted also amazing
gaming,not_removed,on one hand you have a super addictive fun shooter but on the other hand you can ride chocobos so
gaming,not_removed,witcher came out in
gaming,not_removed,its a draw there were many games i liked but i cant pick a winner out of the two i dont feel like i could choose yet anyway they are both games that are still growing and opinions might change over the course of time
gaming,not_removed,holy crap well ive lost an entire year what did i miss
gaming,not_removed,my vote goes to dota
gaming,not_removed,vainglory
gaming,not_removed,hots is probably best moba i still play dota cause im really good at it and love destroying noobs in custom games
gaming,not_removed,lol
gaming,not_removed,lol
gaming,not_removed,lol love destroying boobs i bet youre that guy who joins the stacked team on counter strike
gaming,not_removed,high rank doesnt mean skill reminds me of all the cry babies on siege that bitch when someone picks recruit then said recruit proceeds to own everyone and outlive team i was just on a battlefield server where my buddy whos rank was knifed by a low level player said player messages my friend talking shit about how he just killed a skilled player my friend is possibly the worst battlefield player ever
gaming,not_removed,to be fair the game is like years old youre probably the only people playing it
gaming,not_removed,infinity ward brought over their same matchmaking skills to infinite warfare
gaming,not_removed,gta vice city
gaming,not_removed,grand theft auto vice city
gaming,not_removed,i want a story mode with multiple characters like but instead of having them all work together i want them to be opposing forces one loose cannon cop trying to do the right thing one professional criminal payday style professional one im not sure i dont get paid to think of cool shit like this but something opposed to the other two maybe a criminalvigilante like omar from the wire a stickup man who does the right thing occasionally
gaming,not_removed,i would agree with you i used to use the cheat code for the fib buffalo and chase down criminals until it got too tedious those were good times would love to see those missions make a comeback
gaming,not_removed,destructible environments like in battlefield games
gaming,not_removed,id like to see gta vice city againp
gaming,not_removed,uk or at at least somewhere other than america hong kong in sleeping dogs was a nice change even though the story was a bit too predictable i cant see that happening though dan houser himself said
gaming,not_removed,better menus and gui i always had the impression that gta was somehowclumsy in terms of menues and hud messages dont know if anybody else ever felt so though
gaming,not_removed,gtavr
gaming,not_removed,simultaneous pc release with console tired of having to wait months for mods and everything else that comes on pc
gaming,not_removed,i want them to take on chicano culture in a future game theyve already done most shit they did miami vice street gangsters mafiaish gangsters i want them to do a sorta chilo gangster type of thing i love how they touched on it a bit with san andreas they could have a chicano protagonist it would be cool imo you get me
gaming,not_removed,new city drones wingsuit a lot more pedestrians almost every building can be entered better cheats remember gta cheat explode all cars and crazy pedestrian cheat where everyone goes crazy and attacks each other
gaming,not_removed,i just want rockstar to stop screwing singleplayer over like literally theyve added vehicles to multiplayer that they wont add to single player for no reason other than it encourages people to buy their shitty shark cards
gaming,not_removed,it would be awesome but what do you do after every structure in the game is reduced to rubble in minutes i think thats the main problem developers face with adding fullymostly destructible environments in modern online games
gaming,not_removed,i was pretty impressed with destructible environments love how it totally changes the way you have to play a map in the middle of the game also as a noncamper i absolutely love being able to destroyexpose camping nests
gaming,not_removed,checkout the new crack down coming out for xbox whole city is destructible
gaming,not_removed,or another london type gta
gaming,not_removed,i agree
gaming,not_removed,gta vi rio edition
gaming,not_removed,why the downvotes
gaming,not_removed,maybe have a construction crew rebuild it while youre in a different area or something like it could take days in game time to rebuild a structure or something like that
gaming,not_removed,great idea really
gaming,not_removed,civ vi because its the latest dont settle for less oops wrong game
gaming,not_removed,civ because caveman to cosmo is a good learning mod
gaming,not_removed,do you plan to play mostly multiplayer or singleplayer at the moment civ vi lacks refinement like every other game in this series at the beginning especially concering the ai with steam sale still going on left civ v is defenitive the safer bet also has a ton of user created content for never ending fun
gaming,not_removed,i prefer civ way more
gaming,not_removed,if youre brand new go with civ v its waaaaaaay cheaper for a huge game compared to vi that isnstil being worked on and not really super balanced yet
gaming,not_removed,hell go with if your trying to save money
gaming,not_removed,oh yeah definitely jump on that you wont be missing a whole lot on
gaming,not_removed,probably mostly multiplayer with my friends again i have never played either so i have no disappointment when it comes to whatever is new with civ vi
gaming,not_removed,civ is like bucks right now
gaming,not_removed,i was very aggravated while watching this not sure why
gaming,not_removed,i have no idea what im watching here
gaming,not_removed,if the point of the car was to ejaculate everywhere then i do believe you made an excellent vehicle
gaming,not_removed,probably the slippery tires these are the first ive ever made so maybe the compound isnt right or something
gaming,not_removed,i thought i was the only one shit i felt my soul break watching this so bad so bad
gaming,not_removed,what in particular are you wondering about edit might as well say something interesting facts about the car the wheels were laced radially which is why the outside of the wheel doesnt turn at the same time as the inside if i laced the wheel with a tangential pattern it would probably be much stiffer overall an important difference between this machine and the previous one i posted the valve timing rods are closer to the center of the crankshaft which increases their mechanical advantage to push and pull the valves with more force i pumped the pressure to the max for extra speed and adjusted the valve timing to compensate for less energy being lost to valve switching and the overal increased torque of the engine
gaming,not_removed,why does somebody always make a jizz joke
gaming,not_removed,who said anything about jizz get your mind out of the gutter sir

gaming,not_removed,rainbow six siege
gaming,not_removed,now theres zero physical aspects to my game
gaming,not_removed,i feel ya now i feel a bit sad or let down when opening a new game where is my poster where are my f stickers
gaming,not_removed,shovel knight physical copies still have a or so page instruction manual complete with quirky backstories and artwork so a for that unfortunately thats the most recent example i can think of
gaming,not_removed,as a kid nothing could beat getting a new game and opening it up to read the manual in the car on the drive home and when you were at school and couldnt play reading the strategy guide was almost as good with the release of classic pokemon on virtual console i was able to pull the strategy guide from the archives where it has rested for the last years feels good
gaming,not_removed,cd projekt red has you fam
gaming,not_removed,my recent copy of dragon warrior came with a digital manual i just walked over and grabbed my copy and pined i do admire nintendos plastic casing efficiency though all those square holes must save like of the material
gaming,not_removed,i cant tell you how many times i played through dragon warrior from start to finish one of the best games ever imo
gaming,not_removed,wow that brings back memories of my first nes game dragon warrior the first one good times and a great game
gaming,not_removed,httpswwwtheindieboxcom httpsstoretheindieboxcom go here for physical releases they did that stanley parable manual that was on the front page a few weeks ago
gaming,not_removed,there are still some games i can still count on to have good shit in the box elder scrolls youre god damn right im buying that hard copy
gaming,not_removed,i used to love the game manuals included in games back then super mario was definitely one of my favorites with the cool little cartoon diagrams and power up descriptions
gaming,not_removed,preorder today and get the same styled cover but with a genuine metal case a statue made out of the cheapest plastic we could find and a guide book that may or may not be in the games tutorials all of which are totally not available on ebay for a discounted price
gaming,not_removed,best game ever behind chrono trigger
gaming,not_removed,now days if you want that you need to preorder the collectors edition gta had a nice safety deposit box full of stuff
gaming,not_removed,i bought something today and the only other thing in the box was a link to the online setup info
gaming,not_removed,i remember buying that gamei actually remember buying and playing all of the dragon warriors on the nes those games used to be around its pretty much crap how games these days dont even come with a manual last game that came with a bunch of stuff was witcher
gaming,not_removed,it exists ive only played dragon warrior on my gba and could not find anything on is it snes only edit ive never owned a nes or snes i just know that they both come from nintendo and snes is like super nes and assumed its like an upgrade or something
gaming,not_removed,now having flashbacks to opening ultima game boxes and getting medallions stones cloth maps
gaming,not_removed,today we get the pamphlet manual
gaming,not_removed,get indiebox man
gaming,not_removed,now unless you buy the deluxe version of a game for an extra youre lucky if you even get a instruction manual witcher was the last game i got with an actual manual some stickers and a thank you letter from the developer for buying their game the normal version of the game too
gaming,not_removed,man forgot how dope that old square enix logo was
gaming,not_removed,that game was awesome
gaming,not_removed,i had a game on atari that came with not only a manual but a novel a full strategy guide and list of commandsit was a textbased adventure game and a little plastic glowinthedark rock that was apparently ones ultimate weapon in the game
gaming,not_removed,some would argue its all been downhill httpgalleryguetechorggreyboxhtml
gaming,not_removed,wow that nintendo sleeve takes me back
gaming,not_removed,i still remember the smell of opening a newly bought super nintendo game smell is the strongest sense tied to memory
gaming,not_removed,i always thought it was funny that on the snes german versions of jrpgs always came with a walkthrough book terranigma mystic quest secret of mana etc as if they expected people wouldnt get it did they do the same in your region
gaming,not_removed,that right there is what game companies consider now to be a limited edition nowadays
gaming,not_removed,opening the witcher was pretty awesome
gaming,not_removed,yep i got mine for free too whenever a battle would happen and the screen flashes i would jump eventually got used to it
gaming,not_removed,i used to manage a used video game stir in the mid that game had a waiting list of probably people on it and we probably got in a copy every months that game was crazy hard to come by nobody wanted to trade it in
gaming,not_removed,their was a time where you would get actual befits on preordering a game
gaming,not_removed,dont worry youll get lucky eventually
gaming,not_removed,you still can butttttttt you have to pre order it exactly at at gamestoop on main st not the one close to olive garden but the one close to target
gaming,not_removed,wheres my club nintendo code
gaming,not_removed,im pretty sure nintendo sent it to me for free for subscribing to nintendo power
gaming,not_removed,dragon warrior was nes
gaming,not_removed,that picture doesnt look like a snes game

gaming,not_removed,but like why would you even need can games even run that
gaming,not_removed,pretty much it was my first build and bought the monitor first i was only planning on spending about but that quickly changed i was waiting for the but got impatient and just went with the instead but yeah i think a monitor is in order here im just curious what other people are getting
gaming,not_removed,i swear hamsters have the life tiny burritos tiny pancakes and now tiny arcade machines
gaming,not_removed,bouse
gaming,not_removed,but its riding a photocopier
gaming,not_removed,even better with a typo

gaming,not_removed,download winmtr and do a trace to the ip you are trying to connect to usually the server of the game do note not just any ip because the route could be different winmtr will trace your route and show you where your packages are going and ping these hops then you can see where you have packet loss normally shown with loss of normally means this hop isnt be able to be pinged which sometimes is normal so look for lines that had received packages but a ping of isnt that bad and wouldnt result normally in lags check if you have rubber banding which is normally the case for internet lag if it is something else like freezes check your hardware driver etc monitor your ping in the game too i had lags in a game at some point in which i had lag spikes every few seconds from to sometimes it does make sense to open ports for some games but this shouldnt result in lag normally
gaming,not_removed,thank you it is definitely more of rubber banding than freezes ill check for packet loss too is there anything i can do to fix that if its the problem
gaming,not_removed,if winmtr points you to a location on your route that has massive package loss then the only thing you can do is contact your isp tell them where the problem is and ask them to contact the hoster of this hop if they know what you are talking about then they will do that if not well you need to wait until it fixes itself i waited a months when i had the lag spikes until the problem was resolved with multiple contacts to my isp
gaming,not_removed,thanks for all your help
gaming,not_removed,mafia imo people complained about the gameplay i thought it was fine the story was out of this world good and it ties up some of the plot lines of mafia loved quantum break agree with that one
gaming,not_removed,zero time dilemma is incredibly good if you already played the first of the serie and you should have played the first and second one if you like visual novels the story is wonderful
gaming,not_removed,let it die
gaming,not_removed,dead rising is awesome
gaming,not_removed,necropolis
gaming,not_removed,they say its clunky and repetitive as someone who only plays games a couple of hours at a time usually i didnt find anything wrong with it i enjoyed it you can take out the districts in different ways and try and use different routes basically like a gtahitman combination
gaming,not_removed,theres nothing that cant be made better with googly eyes

gaming,not_removed,looks like the average ubisoft release
gaming,not_removed,ive got you in my sights
gaming,not_removed,i agree it makes the case better but god i hope no one actually pays money for that trash because the eyes skew their judgement possibly worst game of
gaming,not_removed,mcafee bro you can get much better av software for free that crap congests your system and gums up the works
gaming,not_removed,spreading lies and slander is a worse way to impair their judgement
gaming,not_removed,so many instances of them doing this in their games i get blizzard has made some missteps with gamespatches in the past but you can tell they really do love their community
gaming,not_removed,watch him as he goes

gaming,not_removed,if only all games have an option where anyone with a crappy internet connection or outdated hardware couldnt join
gaming,not_removed,looks good man
gaming,not_removed,but how can you get a better framerate out of a game that does barely have any graphic options
gaming,not_removed,actually the game looks great i dont even know what youre talking about it looks great on an xbox let alone a slim i was able to broadcast it on youtube at frames and my brother was able to connect to it on his playstation on his tv and he said it looked great played a bunch of games and it was awesome then we share played a bunch of games
gaming,not_removed,yeah i know but that is not what i meant console games do often not have graphic settings to change so how do you want to archive a higher framerate is there actually a way
gaming,not_removed,triple a title
gaming,not_removed,how does this happen
gaming,not_removed,cora did that for me on the tram when you first arrive at the nexus when the tram stopped you could hear her cry out in paint then poof she was next to me
gaming,not_removed,all that and no squirtle
gaming,not_removed,massager
gaming,not_removed,i wonder how the guy found this trick out oh look lemme toss this vibrator onto my phone oh cool my eggs are hatching
gaming,not_removed,with all the vibrating that should have been a jigglypuff
gaming,not_removed,i wonder why my heart rate instinctively went up when i saw that exact type of vibrator on the screen accompanied by japanese characters
gaming,not_removed,im no phone doctor but i dont think thats good for your phone
gaming,not_removed,japan used earthquake its super effective
gaming,not_removed,was anyone else like get that doduo ive never seen one and im lvl guess i have to go to ny
gaming,not_removed,im sorry i dont speak japanese
gaming,not_removed,i think the way the pokemon trainer is walking in the video makes it all worth it
gaming,not_removed,that just looks like the gps is having trouble finding his exact location my dude walks all over our downtown when im on the wifi or even on my
gaming,not_removed,last time i checked pokemon go uses gps tracking and if in some cases if you really want to pinpoint where your device is its aided by wifinetworks using a vibrator will not help you trick the gps larger chance this is made to fuck peoples phones up if they have cheaper models want to cheat ride a bus bicycle or car at slow speeds
gaming,not_removed,what if my neck really hurts
gaming,not_removed,sorry but the massager isnt doing anything the gps drift is whats increasing the distance
gaming,not_removed,mom no i swear its for pokemon go
gaming,not_removed,youd look less silly hanging from a ceiling fan
gaming,not_removed,pokemon go fuck yourself amiriteyouknowcausevibrator
gaming,not_removed,so is it reading the vibrations as motion or is it counting it as clicksi do not and never will play that game so
gaming,not_removed,what youre looking for is rinsertions the hitachi massager is very popular there
gaming,not_removed,theres a good pun there somewhere but im too tired to work it out
gaming,not_removed,i was expecting a tentacruel
gaming,not_removed,those two headed fucks are everywhere here in the panhandle
gaming,not_removed,rcodzombies is leaking
gaming,not_removed,you are in fact wrong
gaming,not_removed,i guess it tricks the pedometer to thinking that steps are being taken or it just messes with the gps and makes it go all over the place or both or this video is just complete bullshit i dont know
gaming,not_removed,motion
gaming,not_removed,motion
gaming,not_removed,its reading the vibrations as dicks
gaming,not_removed,i dont understand that sub at all putting stuff in vaginas politics and ghostbusters
gaming,not_removed,rt
gaming,not_removed,its gps the app doesnt use pedometer
gaming,not_removed,it is bullshit the game uses your gps location so repeatedly tapping or vibrating your phone does nothing
gaming,not_removed,yeah its just amazing
gaming,not_removed,you have a strange concept of amazing
gaming,not_removed,since external assets for skyrim on are prohibited even though skyrim and fallout are both made by bethesda and use the same engine doesnt mean that they are accessing the same engine on the harddrive each games is its own closed workspace and everything outside of that is an external asset even if you could get the assets like textures color pattern and mesh shape in the other game doesnt mean it would work there are still things that would needed to be modified like rigging skeleton of the mesh and animations movement that is what the mods have to change and adjust and working with the same engine would make the thing a lot easier but i dont know that much about modding that i can tell for sure
gaming,not_removed,i believe bethesda wont allow it morrowblivion had a conversion tool that used a lot of assets from morrowind in oblivion bethesda shut them down for using assets from their other games basically so they had to go back and recreate a lot of stuff themselves
gaming,not_removed,that game was really hard
gaming,not_removed,but the shit stain has abs
gaming,not_removed,im sad you cant emulate it i have a home brew wiig that plays super mario like a dream but will always freeze on map selection screen for shadow of the empire
gaming,not_removed,this game had some seriously awesome boss fights
gaming,not_removed,just added to the immense realism if a great game
gaming,not_removed,dash rendar would bitch slap han solo then run of with his girl dude is a badass
gaming,not_removed,name
gaming,not_removed,kinda eerie too this game used to creep me out so much
gaming,not_removed,yeah i have a homebrewed wii too im disappointed that not many people are working with it anymore to actually warrant working on compatibility for the emulators they just got mario working and said well thats it they did great work with what they did but they just stopped when new scenes opened up on the wiiu and
gaming,not_removed,shadows of the empire nintendo
gaming,not_removed,uh this is my third day as a facebook gorilla expert and im offended by this video
gaming,not_removed,super smash bros cincinnati zoo
gaming,not_removed,we all need jesus
gaming,not_removed,the only thing its missing are the people bitching about how the potential harmdeath of the child didnt justify killing the creature theres a lot more of those than i ever could have predicted
gaming,not_removed,havent you seen the post
gaming,not_removed,too soon
gaming,not_removed,super cincy smash only for cincinnati reds and ohiu
gaming,not_removed,i like the people that bitched about how they wouldnt have shot the gorilla of if were a black kid they had some serious egg on their face afterward
gaming,not_removed,dont forget the people bitching about how unjust it is to care about this instead of other more important news
gaming,not_removed,are we just going to ignore this absurd racism
gaming,not_removed,apes monkeys have tails and are smaller apes dont have tails there are great apes which include gorillas chimpanzees and orangutangs and maybe humans and lesser apes which include mandrills the male mandrills penis is red and the scrotum is lilac the face is also brightly colored the coloration is more pronounced in dominant males
gaming,not_removed,trying a little too hard i see dont strain yourself
gaming,not_removed,to be fair those animal nuts are crazy about anybody involved with the death of an animal no matter who it is a lot of times those things where people go yeah but if he was black tend to be true but in this case theyd be just as angry if it was a white kid
gaming,not_removed,thanks for this
gaming,not_removed,trying very hard and thank you for the advice
gaming,not_removed,patience lots of patience
gaming,not_removed,you have to be ages with nothing else to do

gaming,not_removed,in watchdogs who are we we are hackers no we are it service
gaming,not_removed,so this is how repost bots earn karmafind links to top posts of reddit generate a random expression and repost to gaming by what ive seen of posts on gaming are reposts of which are bots are sentient beings and last are discussionslegit oclinks to new stuff
gaming,not_removed,its painful to see unilad gaming watermarks on gaming memes when you know they just stole it from reddit

gaming,not_removed,you really dont need it save yourself
gaming,not_removed,the pic is obviously fake they didnt have color photography back then
gaming,not_removed,i doubt they knew what electricity was back in ad oh really
gaming,not_removed,depends people were aware that some species of fish had electrical stings though they didnt understand what it was or why it did it it was even some form of early medicine that people with gout should purposefully be stung by these electric fish it wasnt until the century that the arabs surmised that lightning and the electrical fish had some sort of connection also people were aware of rudimentary static electricity from rubbing furs together with conductive rods to attract objects like feathers however it wouldnt be until the century onwards that electricity became more than a passing curiosity

gaming,not_removed,shit son i am flabbergasted
gaming,not_removed,no altair we are myerists
gaming,not_removed,and here i was all amped up to hear some
gaming,not_removed,ill just chant my mantra ohmmmm ohmmmmm ohmmm
gaming,not_removed,special edition has graphical upgrades built in and an incredibly easy to use mod manager integrated into the game
gaming,not_removed,special edition played both extensively alot of the great mods have already been ported over and others will be ported when script extender comes out all the dlc is included in either one so either way youve got tons of content to go through plus the special edition look amazing
gaming,not_removed,i got the special edition for free from steam because i had the original edition
gaming,not_removed,legendary edition some great mods are not supported in se
gaming,not_removed,legendary has more mods but all the mod community is likely to focus on special edition from here on out there are tons of amazing mods for special edition already and its interfaced in game a lot easier i would choose special edition only because new mods are likely to be developed for it instead of legendary both are the same amazing game
gaming,not_removed,legendary edition if you want to mod it
gaming,not_removed,i have it ive put in hours in for a year or so now majority of that gameplay was within the first month or so of buying it its a really fun game but very grindy and its one of those games that youll play constantly for awhile then not touch it and the randomly pick it back up after a break
gaming,not_removed,i own it it has a ridiculously complicated learning curve if you enjoy games like euro truck simulator then this is very similar to that
gaming,not_removed,i do not own it hope this helps
gaming,not_removed,i have a good amount of time in the game got up to a fully upgraded vulture playing as an assassin my brother made bank as a trader but it required hundreds of hours doing nothing but flying from spaceport to spaceport all in all the dogfighting is super fun but as has been stated previously the game has both a massive learning curve and a massive time commitment it is an excellent game to play whilst binge watching a show or listening to an audiobook i havent done much of the planetary stuff but at the very least it sounds intriguing i like the game overall the scale and realism can be very immersive but if your attention is exclusively on it then the game can get dull
gaming,not_removed,i got it played for a few hours and then gave up
gaming,not_removed,i have it on pc and xbox played many hours on both if you like flying spaceships you will enjoy it
gaming,not_removed,have it enjoy it would enjoy it more if it had some eve like components large guilds and territory and such its awesome that its so large but thats also one of its problems
gaming,not_removed,ive sold my xboxone but i did own a copy for that i found learning to play was quite difficult even after watching multiple tutorials i always felt lost id consider picking it up again if the has vr
gaming,not_removed,i have it it isnt fun its a space truck simulation game go to a station buy good pick up delivery missions go to another system drop stuff off sell goods repeat thats it you can fight and do all that but its highly complex there is a very steep learning curve and there is no set difficulty you may take a contract to hunt a dude down go to that system find where he is if you can because thats also complicated and on a timer and find out the area he is in has ships waaaaay stronger than yours die lose all your stuff if you dont have the money to afford it back etc etc you can infer the rest but this is the entire game and it isnt much if you have friends that play the game it can be fun
gaming,not_removed,i agree the devs need to move away from more grind add some more procedural systems and then cross link more of the recent playstuff engineers for srv and fighters and new types of srvs
gaming,not_removed,yeah but euro truck simulator had a flexible economic system less so in this
gaming,not_removed,a very nice sentiment
gaming,not_removed,there are large guilds and territories such as powerplay
gaming,not_removed,indeed as you know there are many flaws but the core mechanics are spot on which helps me forgive them
gaming,not_removed,i know its just the scope of the game is so big they hardly ever impact you except in negative ways piracy and such
gaming,not_removed,it seems too easy to steal my guess would be that you cannot use them i mean one could theoretically buy the card with cash activate the card without using any personal info add to the balance rent games at each keep or sell them for huge profit theres got to be counter measures in there somewhere right i dunno ive never tried it
gaming,not_removed,good point yeah they probably dont take them
gaming,not_removed,theres got to be counter measures in there somewhere right is this a facetious post or are you really unaware of how much people are httpswwwredditcomrgamingsearchqredboxrestrictsronsortrelevancetall
gaming,not_removed,i dont use redbox i dont know anything
gaming,not_removed,looks like a duck
gaming,not_removed,what the hell so either yes they do take prepaid or people are dancing with the devil because this tracks into their cc info right not my intention btw brilliant i must say haha but not my intention
gaming,not_removed,if theres such a game i dont know about it
gaming,not_removed,guess ill have to make it huh
gaming,not_removed,httpwwwhyperxgamingcomuslandingcloudaccessories
gaming,not_removed,thank you my friend
gaming,not_removed,didntt even try to make it look real meh
gaming,not_removed,staged the cat obviously isnt real
gaming,not_removed,funny how it spins around wildly and then stops before the cat even touches the screen bullshit post is bullshit
gaming,not_removed,ok thats it awkward has lost all meaning to me
gaming,not_removed,how is that akward
gaming,not_removed,wow thats so awkward i cannot contain myself
gaming,not_removed,that cats mouth
gaming,not_removed,when fake trash like this gets upvotes it just convinces me that upvotes are easily purchased
gaming,not_removed,thought this was awww the fact that rgaming upvoted this shit makes me sick
gaming,not_removed,i am convinced that reddit is filled with upvotedownvote bots
gaming,not_removed,i unsubscribed from raww but i can see rgaming is going to post this shit also
gaming,not_removed,i dont care if this is fake it made me laugh and made me forget that i almost died today
gaming,not_removed,that roar xd yea boiii
gaming,not_removed,that awkward moment when you play angry birds
gaming,not_removed,im gonna be the one to state the obvious this cat has absolutely nothing to do with anything thats happening on the screen it is too obvious on spinning but for some may be not obvious in the tap moment
gaming,not_removed,gamer cat
gaming,not_removed,hear me roar
gaming,not_removed,if this is real this is beautiful do you happen to have the source
gaming,not_removed,i have never played angry birds what is it supposed to look like
gaming,not_removed,your comment is so mehhhhhh
gaming,not_removed,you can tell by the pixels
gaming,not_removed,or hes the one meo instead of neo okay im done thats enough bad puns for now
gaming,not_removed,that awkward moment when you realize your cat is a hipster who does pranks that you think are mean
gaming,not_removed,meow meow
gaming,not_removed,meow meow
gaming,not_removed,hey you ever been alone in a room with a cat playing video games
gaming,not_removed,awkward
gaming,not_removed,as long as it keeps smile on someones face who cares
gaming,not_removed,true my comments got downvoted heavily to
gaming,not_removed,thats because you unsubscribed from raww
gaming,not_removed,oh that escalated quickly
gaming,not_removed,what happened
gaming,not_removed,attention whore
gaming,not_removed,mostly because shit comes out of you
gaming,not_removed,does the bird just spin like that for you in real life
gaming,not_removed,the bird sits in the sling before you pull it back someone was moving it in a circle
gaming,not_removed,you mean the obvious hes not salty by pointing out how groanworthily dumb this is its a banal attempt to garner upvotesandfrankly isnt even a decent attempt soto further that pointits top comment solooks like screaming elvis fans cant be wrong
gaming,not_removed,stfu
gaming,not_removed,you can tell because of how it is
gaming,not_removed,thems some low quality pixels get microsoft on the case
gaming,not_removed,why the fuck was this upvoted
gaming,not_removed,nobody smiled
gaming,not_removed,people who actually care about the quality of the subreddit and believe that upvotes should be dictated by the community not assholes who pay for upvotes
gaming,not_removed,he almost died
gaming,not_removed,almost got hit by a car cops said the car was part of a theft so the fucker was driving fast and it barely missed me
gaming,not_removed,he was shoeless for a while
gaming,not_removed,eks didididididdidi
gaming,not_removed,because you go to the bathroom
gaming,not_removed,played angry birds for less than an hour around when it came out i assumed this was a new mode apparently not

gaming,not_removed,i play the game only on the crapper
gaming,not_removed,rest in pepperonis
gaming,not_removed,mindcat
gaming,not_removed,somuchregurgitatedrhetoricyourepathetic
gaming,not_removed,and yesbecause as another post i was looking at today pointed outtheres a huge disconnect between those that upvote and those that comment look at the comments you have to scroll down a full page before anyone says anything that you wouldnt deem saltyalsoget some new material the salty thingwas played out years ago besides whether youre aware of this or not people can have negative opinionswithout being mad or upset moron
gaming,not_removed,yes i found it to be very tragic
gaming,not_removed,yeah caught me off guard
gaming,not_removed,its alright im kinda used to it p
gaming,not_removed,the survival
gaming,not_removed,people are so immature
gaming,not_removed,that isnt an argument you fucking pussy lol ur sooooo salty ecks dee oh shit i gotta go back to school
gaming,not_removed,yesbut two wrongs dont make a rightand while youre correctit only serves to perpetuate the pissing contest
gaming,not_removed,also have fun ever getting laid
gaming,not_removed,rmeirl
gaming,not_removed,its reddit it can be the most unfriendliest place in the world sometimes
gaming,not_removed,what are you even talking about at this point
gaming,not_removed,are you
gaming,not_removed,youre retarded
gaming,not_removed,its weird to think that there was a time when mouses werent the golden standard for control in pc games
gaming,not_removed,good luck finding a floppy drive to install this with
gaming,not_removed,the cover is about a second away from being the goriest one ive ever seen hes going to rip half that things face off
gaming,not_removed,better get a gtx just in case
gaming,not_removed,never had the universe seen such a mighty space janitor before
gaming,not_removed,man that guy is flexible as hell look at his leg
gaming,not_removed,fuck the zero gravity hockey level
gaming,not_removed,is this yours or a yard sale find this and countless other old game boxes is still on a shelf in my old bedroom at the folks house xd
gaming,not_removed,lol needing of memory will have to delete all my music
gaming,not_removed,its interesting you point that out as this is the first space quest game that more heavily relied on one becoming the classic point and click interface we still associate with the adventure game genre today previously the first three not including the vga remake were parser text based and whilst you could use a mouse to move you were more reliant on typing commands and moving with the arrow keys or number pad keys
gaming,not_removed,i like type to play games hugo was one of my favourites
gaming,not_removed,mouses i used to argue with my mom all the time about the plural of computer pointing devices i advocated mouses while my mom believed in mice eventually i discovered that the control panel in windows had a dialog called mice and pointing devices ending the debate
gaming,not_removed,i actually have some in storage along with a custom rig with one on it i built for classic gaming
gaming,not_removed,eh vohaul deserves it
gaming,not_removed,his knee is above his shoulders
gaming,not_removed,a flea market sale and it is now mine i have a collection of classic big box games as well though its been a while since ive come across a factory sealed one
gaming,not_removed,ever play the infocom interactive fiction games
gaming,not_removed,not to open it up again if is pretty standard today that when speaking of the computer mouse the plural is mouses
gaming,not_removed,lets hope the data on those floppy disks hasnt magnetically degraded then
gaming,not_removed,i have not
gaming,not_removed,im pretty sure its not i have plenty of spare mice i dont got no mouses
gaming,not_removed,oh ffs
gaming,not_removed,they were pure text based adventure games one of the best was an adaptation of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy
gaming,not_removed,interesting from how ive encountered it is often mouses to disassociate it from the animal though ive also have heard people say mice but usually when only proceeded by computer not that often have i heard them be referred to being mice alone
gaming,not_removed,i know the story but i cant get off earth
gaming,not_removed,i dont think either one is wrong i just never hear anyone say mouses
gaming,not_removed,yeah with tech it is perhaps that both are right that is a nice way to look at it i blame english and its seeming contradictions
gaming,not_removed,when my first one finally quit on me i was years old and it was about shades darker than this one and the start button was missing i know for a fact i put more of my time and energy into that game boy than anything else in my life
gaming,not_removed,wow that one didnt yellow over time
gaming,not_removed,im not getting the nostalgia factor from this picture because i dont think ive ever seen one so pristine
gaming,not_removed,nice it may have been kept clean or recently cleaned by a pro you take off the plastic shell and clean them in hot soapy water or use rubbing alcohol lots of people fix up old gaming things to sell on
gaming,not_removed,nostalgia can still make nes games amazing but im not sure it compensates for the original gameboy screen
gaming,not_removed,i bought one for bucks on flee market a good find but you could buy one for much cheaper
gaming,not_removed,it better not have any dead skin in the crevasses
gaming,not_removed,a photo of a gameboy
gaming,not_removed,her its a gameboy
gaming,not_removed,her
gaming,not_removed,looks so new that it looks fakereproduced even the brand new pictures of a game boy has some yellowing to it
gaming,not_removed,way overpriced mate
gaming,not_removed,yeah i kind of get it but isnt calling a game boy her a bit too much
gaming,not_removed,a picture of a gameboy
gaming,not_removed,literally a picture of a gameboy
gaming,not_removed,her
gaming,not_removed,i cant imagine how long you had to wait for the system update to finish
gaming,not_removed,her its a boy
gaming,not_removed,i remember playing gameboy like years ago on car trips with the familynight time was the death of fun i loved mario though
gaming,not_removed,hold on are you telling me the things arent supposed to be yellow
gaming,not_removed,game boy her hmmm🤔
gaming,not_removed,i hope it wasnt in an unopened box if so you just lost a couple hundred potential dollars or save it for later generations go buy a cheap on in good condition if you want nostalgia edit seemed this got a lot of traction overnight you am i popular now i just wanted to say a couple of things this doesnt really bother me that much i just wanted to point out what hes missing out on by opening an unopened box idk how much its worth i tried looking it up briefly and without wasting too much time i think its worth about with special editions going all the way up to i dont think this was from an unopened box i found a couple brand new game boys for sale on ebay but already out of the box for only also idk why theres an argument between should he have sold it or not well it is a collectors item i would think by this point and if they save it for awhile it could be worth over not a lot to richy rich people but when you cant even afford lentils its a pretty big deal either way imo shouldnt open a unopened box for a bit of nostalgia when you can go buy a cheap one to play and keep the unopened for collecting but like i said i dont think its from an unopened box new opened gameboys are for sale for in multiple places i think
gaming,not_removed,i got a gameboy color at goodwill for two quarters a month ago
gaming,not_removed,please tell me it was already open
gaming,not_removed,i am not sure if anyone has noticed but i believe we are looking at the first transgender gameboy as the op says i picked her up even though she started out as a gameboy she always felt like a gamegirl
gaming,not_removed,why
gaming,not_removed,gee what a steal s
gaming,not_removed,him
gaming,not_removed,one of the best buys of my life was years and years ago on ebay got a gameboy color and every pokemon game red blue yellow gold silver crystal pinball tcg and idk if theres others a gameshark for it i think link cable and they included a big packet of gameshark codes lol including shipping it was just best day ever
gaming,not_removed,thats not an original game boy not thick enough
gaming,not_removed,the buttons must feel so good to press down
gaming,not_removed,wow it looks like it was kept in a cryotube and never unfrozen

gaming,not_removed,why do you call it a her its a game boy
gaming,not_removed,looks real good
gaming,not_removed,gameboy picked her up today did you just misidentify the gameboys gender
gaming,not_removed,why wasnt i informed that i could take a boring picture of a fucking game boy that millions of people owned and get the top post on reddit who upvotes this shit maybe tomorrow well see a playstation hit the front page not like millions of people have one of those lying around collecting dust
gaming,not_removed,got a like new one for £ if youre gonna use a mint one you may as well have got a well loved previously owned one for cheaper looks gorgeous though
gaming,not_removed,i envy you looks magnificent wish i had mine still from back then but it broke down at one point and then no clue what happened to it
gaming,not_removed,found a brand new game boy advance sp at a swap meet for
gaming,not_removed,its a boy
gaming,not_removed,♫ like a virgin turned on for the very first time ♫
gaming,not_removed,she told you that youre the first but other dudes played that before you saw her
gaming,not_removed,nah nah what you do is buy one for bucks at a thrift store realize the soldering has gotten loose then buy a soldering iron from radioshack open it up then rub the iron across the heat resistant film to melt the solder back in it aint proper unless you burn your fingers off
gaming,not_removed,her its a boy damnit
gaming,not_removed,its a game boy not a game girl smhhhhhh

gaming,not_removed,sorry but no way in hell thats worth id never pay more than
gaming,not_removed,what its got smudges all over it no wait thats my screen
gaming,not_removed,i bet you were just dying to post this yesterday but had to wait due to it being april
gaming,not_removed,i came expecting you to be the first one to turn her on
gaming,not_removed,awesome pick up that brings back a lot of memories as a kid i spent way too many hours staring at that screen
gaming,not_removed,shes beautiful
gaming,not_removed,it belongs in a museum

gaming,not_removed,i can sell mine for
gaming,not_removed,literally a picture of a gameboy
gaming,not_removed,mint
gaming,not_removed,youre describing how i met my wife
gaming,not_removed,i have a black one i got it from a friend who bought it for but then decided he didnt want it after realizing it didnt have an internal rechargeable batterylol
gaming,not_removed,her you sexist pig
gaming,not_removed,game boy her please
gaming,not_removed,when these things came out i was working a job cleaning planes and kids were always leaving them behind i was finding at least a couple every week eventually i stopped turning them in no one ever came back for them and was selling them to a video game store for
gaming,not_removed,did you just assumed its gender
gaming,not_removed,she lied to you bro
gaming,not_removed,i remember opening my gameboy in that my grandmother got me from service merchandise it came out of the box more yellow than this
gaming,not_removed,mine looks like a pile of s comapred to this one nice find mate
gaming,not_removed,cool find honestly though for actual nostalgia gaming id rather use an sp which can use the same cartridges has a backlight and a rechargeable battery that beast is super battery hungry
gaming,not_removed,her
gaming,not_removed,wow did you just assume its gender unacceptable
gaming,not_removed,that one looks too thin to be an original game boy might just be the angle though
gaming,not_removed,imo you over paid
gaming,not_removed,why is the nintendo gameboy a her
gaming,not_removed,whoa i need to go through my parents attic pronto
gaming,not_removed,what i always loved about the gameboy is that its not white but just a very bright grey with a blueish tint
gaming,not_removed,wow that is in exceptional shape was it still in the box or something
gaming,not_removed,my grandma had a brand new pristine game boy in her closet a few years i should have taken it when i spotted it it was a gift many years ago but they never touched it i asked about it a few weeks later and she said that she threw it out rip
gaming,not_removed,look i am all about gender equality and all but its a game boy not a game girl use he not she smh
gaming,not_removed,aliexpress dollars for a replica casing and you know it nice try though
gaming,not_removed,game boy her
gaming,not_removed,how is it a her when its a gameboy
gaming,not_removed,her this is a gameboy how dare you misgender him you sexist pig ill have you know that im a black knight and i will do everything in my power to provide inequality for the sexes and grow the gender wage gap
gaming,not_removed,that seems ridiculously expensive
gaming,not_removed,its practically new finding one like this is rare and id say for its a bargain
gaming,not_removed,if the box is cherry turn it off and put it back in the box very carefully now go and buy a cream coloured crap one to bash a round some games and sell that cherry one for a bagillion
gaming,not_removed,her really
gaming,not_removed,reddit is so weird post a picture of a game boy get upvotes do something that actually takes an effort no one cares
gaming,not_removed,that looks amazing great find
gaming,not_removed,cool what does it do
gaming,not_removed,slight dirt in the speaker says thats a lie
gaming,not_removed,game boy triggered
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,overpriced
gaming,not_removed,um hello it is a gameboy
gaming,not_removed,imagine all the updates youre about to sit through oh right that was back when they finished software before selling it and yeah i know better but still in the past few years patches have been getting a bit out of hand a security vulnerability discovered a year later patch fine but shipping unfinished software to meet a deadline and then patching it is bad business imo
gaming,not_removed,game boy her makes sense
gaming,not_removed,dude its a gameboy its a boy its in the name why call it her
gaming,not_removed,i dont get it why something that has been superseded many times is it just a hipster thing do these people cook on campfires is it a yearning for when they were young and it was always sunny and bright baffled from birmingham
gaming,not_removed,i dont see a usb port how does it charge

gaming,not_removed,you lucky bastard
gaming,not_removed,wow looks almost brand new
gaming,not_removed,enjoy the hell out of it op
gaming,not_removed,nice
gaming,not_removed,picked em um from the printer this morning
gaming,not_removed,yeeee
gaming,not_removed,theres a bit of grim in the speakers and some handjam in the cracks around the dpad so its definitely not brand new but good nick nonetheless the amount of time i spent on tetris and super mario land back in the day
gaming,not_removed,thats a steal im no gamer but boy do i have found memories of playing hours upon hours of tetris on the old gameboy™
gaming,not_removed,holy cow that thing looks perfect i wish i still had my original game boy that thing was a tank i cant tell you the amount of times i dropped it kicked it stepped on it all on accident i swear etc and the only thing that ever happened was that the plastic cover over the screen had a tiny but deep gouge in it up in one of the corners
gaming,not_removed,you lucky ba
gaming,not_removed,logo bugged out better blow on the cartage and try again
gaming,not_removed,goddamn it that looks like it was minted yesterday nice find op enjoy your find
gaming,not_removed,i remember my first gameboy it seems so primitive these days but back then it was something else must have spent countless hours on tetris dr mario and super mario land was just a quality product engineered well
gaming,not_removed,oh man this takes me back
gaming,not_removed,had a dreamcast for years and has it set out almost every day the plastic thing was not only hit or miss it was also fixed on some newer consoles when i sold mine it was commented that i must have gotten a later model i do not know if this could have happened with the gameboy but dang is that shit pretty
gaming,not_removed,i think right now i will spend hours to play on it
gaming,not_removed,does it include any game
gaming,not_removed,that dpad is better than the dpad on the switch pro controller
gaming,not_removed,i miss that out of the box nintendo smell theres really no other like it
gaming,not_removed,everyone talking about their systems breaking down and not lasting at all this is why im glad to have grown up with sega because with the exception of the segamega cd all of the hardware was really high quality and built to last i still play my sega megadrive from the and it works like a charm you just gotta blow on it
gaming,not_removed,probably been fitted with a new shell off of ebay
gaming,not_removed,only way to determine if its actually new is by monitoring how much the battery lasts
gaming,not_removed,if the screen is more blurry than you remember them being it might be suffering from rot of the ink
gaming,not_removed,ah the memories i used to play this a lot as a teenager but i could never do super mario any better than my idiot brother
gaming,not_removed,dot matrix with stereo sound
gaming,not_removed,the nintendo logo seems to be a block blow into the cartrige and into the slot aww i miss that
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,wow paid for an artifact
gaming,not_removed,wow i spent so many hours on marios golden coins with my first gameboy never completed it though i was about in my defence
gaming,not_removed,theres a guy on twitch that restores old games and systems to sell them he does some really excellent work ive only seen his stream a couple of times but it was a surprisingly good example of how impressive attention to detail can be when someone cares about their craft
gaming,not_removed,is there a sfw porn sub for gaming hardware there is rgamerporn but i think thats more for screenshots
gaming,not_removed,wow where did you find it
gaming,not_removed,shit looks flawless
gaming,not_removed,i hope you either have a large stash of aas or you have a girlfriend that does
gaming,not_removed,now bivert and backlight that bad boy
gaming,not_removed,your a legend
gaming,not_removed,congrats brother your virginity remains safe forreal tho nice find
gaming,not_removed,i like the way how the caption fits perfect for a slut
gaming,not_removed,did u get any games those would be hard to find now
gaming,not_removed,damn lucky
gaming,not_removed,she mustve been waiting for you
gaming,not_removed,was there ever a version that decent backlighting or was that after the gb color
gaming,not_removed,now playing with power portable power
gaming,not_removed,jealous
gaming,not_removed,thats what she said
gaming,not_removed,muh gem muh nostalgia
gaming,not_removed,i remember being curled up in a lazyboy chair playing tetris mega man kirbys dreamland and techmo bowl on this thing
gaming,not_removed,everyone one of these came with tetris you need to find her soul mate
gaming,not_removed,when i was in school long ass time ago i won the award for most door to door candy sales they gave me two options a sealed gameboy or a dollar gift certificate to toys r us i picked the gift certificate and bought festers quest
gaming,not_removed,dot matrix with stereo sound
gaming,not_removed,thats a classic
gaming,not_removed,i was waiting for you jedi
gaming,not_removed,i spent so much time playing games that were too hard for me to ever beat it didnt matter though i never considered if a game was good or bad or if the developers shipped a glitchy unplayable mess i just played whatever i had i have no idea how i looked at that screen for hours on end shit man a picture is worth a lot in memories
gaming,not_removed,shoulda blown in that tetris cart lol at the rectangle instead of nintendo logo
gaming,not_removed,gba is brand new quite a price difference
gaming,not_removed,shes a thing of beauty i still have my original handset but shes weathered by age
gaming,not_removed,i dont know why nintendo bring these models out as brand new again i bet the sales would be massive i would deffo buy one if they where same as original
gaming,not_removed,looks like a shitty blender render
gaming,not_removed,dayyyummmmm son u rich now
gaming,not_removed,screen fades over years too how does the screen look
gaming,not_removed,i still have mine it doesnt have yellow on it mine looks thicker than yours but it could just be the photo though the only thing wrong with mine was the battery cover broke off but theres a store here that sells old nintendo consoles games parts so i was able to replace it i need to go back there get more games😀
gaming,not_removed,i was going to tell you you overpaid until you said it was brand new wow mine is too sun yellow faded to see
gaming,not_removed,im jealous anyone got one i can buy or any classic gaming equipment
gaming,not_removed,nice article on yellowing of computergame counsel cases if anyone is curious
gaming,not_removed,drool
gaming,not_removed,its a boy
gaming,not_removed,font looks funky
gaming,not_removed,bought two recently got the extra so i could upgrade it with a rpi gives me a project for the summer planning to do a lot on it though most of the ones online are basic conversions i want to upgrade it a lot more but keep it looking the exact same outside
gaming,not_removed,now steam conveniently tells me how much time ive wasted gotten out of a game
gaming,not_removed,i like to attribute my seeming youth to a lack of exposure to the sun or as i like to call it gamer glow
gaming,not_removed,being in a box all this time away from the sun helps a lot there
gaming,not_removed,this reminded me that ive an astroboy gameboy light thats never been used sitting in a box somewhere wonder if its held up over time
gaming,not_removed,you can actually reverse the yellow process oddly enough it involves a chemical solution and the same uv light that turned or yellow
gaming,not_removed,when i was a kid i had an snes that didnt yellow on top i sold it to a then mom and pop game shop and they gave me an extra because of that weird
gaming,not_removed,middle child
gaming,not_removed,i did when i bought mine with my allowance money back in
gaming,not_removed,bucks man i wouldve given you my mine in its neveropened box its taking up too much room in the back back corner of my attic
gaming,not_removed,i find peroxide works a lot better bleaches out the yellow that most of nintys plastic takes on
gaming,not_removed,check the guys restoration videos on youtube absolutely amazing to see an apple ii looking brand new
gaming,not_removed,retrobriteperoxide the sun makes it look brand new
gaming,not_removed,yeah the virtual consol thing on the is a godsend in that regard
gaming,not_removed,yeah id have a tough time playing on an og gameboy id get some serious eye strain the games can definitely still be fun though
gaming,not_removed,when i craved some good old pokémon blue i got my advance sp out not because i couldnt find any of the other gameboys though that was also a reason but because of the good screen and backlight its all just so visible its great i love being able to see my video games
gaming,not_removed,easy solution but if youre going to go you might as well go all out
gaming,not_removed,i just did this instead httpimgurcomkxgxpmc
gaming,not_removed,for real though while going though some stuff in prep for a move i found my girlfriends old game boy color with a copy of pokemon yellow in it score and manthat screen is hard to look at
gaming,not_removed,hell that was an issue even back when it was out which is why we have the godsend that is the super game boy for the snes
gaming,not_removed,it does source carry a gameboy or gameboy pocket with me daily depending on which type of batteries im currently out of
gaming,not_removed,httpimgurcomasneow
gaming,not_removed,a brand new one edit i really dont see the point in collectors items it was built to be played not sit on a shelf somewhere as well people can do whatever the fuck they want with their own money this has got me thinking about people buying a new gb in box how do you even know its in there weight can be simulated and you dont want to open the box losing value from what i have read there is already enough issue over fake games feels like there would be a fake market especially at in box
gaming,not_removed,flea market not flee
gaming,not_removed,flee market flee and on it is this some dutch immigrant speak
gaming,not_removed,found the picture of a gameboy while cleaning out my parents garage

gaming,not_removed,did you just assume its gender
gaming,not_removed,yup boys can be hers nowadays too didnt you hear
gaming,not_removed,egg
gaming,not_removed,gamegirl
gaming,not_removed,oddly enough inanimate objects like cars boats and consoles have always been addressed with feminine pronouns ex look at my new car isnt she a beauty
gaming,not_removed,is she funny
gaming,not_removed,yes op is a nerd and will never hold a real her
gaming,not_removed,triggered
gaming,not_removed,nobody is getting the arrested development reference
gaming,not_removed,i think it looks like the contrastbrightness wheel needs a little adjustment it would look like this if the nintendo text logo had too much contrast and the letters would sort of melt together
gaming,not_removed,what installing a firmware update how where is it getting the new firmware
gaming,not_removed,did game boys get firmware updates how would you get the update on the game boy do you have to plug it into your pc and download some it
gaming,not_removed,i had super mario land that was a fun game
gaming,not_removed,thats where came in useful
gaming,not_removed,maybe heshe is the later generation
gaming,not_removed,i dont understand this just because something is worth money to someone doesnt mean its enjoyment outweighs that value to someone else
gaming,not_removed,i hope it was an unopened box just to give people like you conniptions
gaming,not_removed,i would pay bucks to open a sealed piece of gaming history just to feel it thats worth more than a couple hundred bucks to me
gaming,not_removed,yes im not that much of a monster
gaming,not_removed,thats what he said
gaming,not_removed,its and boys can be girls
gaming,not_removed,did you just assume her gender
gaming,not_removed,agreed mine lasts about now i need a replacement battery
gaming,not_removed,youve never seen people refer to electronics or cars as a female
gaming,not_removed,it lets you play tetris in stunning shades of greenish monochrome edit chrome not tone
gaming,not_removed,right rightit should begamepersondamn male chauvinist nintendo
gaming,not_removed,it doesnt you buy aa batteries and play for eternity i found my year old game boy in the garage when my parents moved and it still worked wario cartridge inside and all yellow af
gaming,not_removed,what are you gay
gaming,not_removed,games are easy to find but the battery in the cartridge is usually dead when i get them
gaming,not_removed,im no expert but id imagine it would be incredibly costly to manufacture the exact same parts considering we have long surpassed that technology and it isnt mass produced anymore
gaming,not_removed,just make sure to never type played on your main wow character
gaming,not_removed,i have over hours in and i dont regret second
gaming,not_removed,hours in the new zelda game
gaming,not_removed,mine reminds me of how many games i never played yet
gaming,not_removed,in germany we have a word for that kellerbräune
gaming,not_removed,on the spanish island of menorca there is a beach inside a cave you can only reach through a underwater tunnel using scubagear no natural light can enter and it is called playa ingles because it is the only beach on the island where the english tourists wont catch a sunburn
gaming,not_removed,spray tans ftw
gaming,not_removed,or as its more commonly known wankers pallor
gaming,not_removed,older consolessystems dont always only yellow due to sun exposure though that does speed it up theres a substance used in the plastic as a flame retardant that reacts to oxygen over time and at varying rates which is why the top or bottom of an old game system may be moreless yellow than its counterpart
gaming,not_removed,my snes was never in the sun and is now yellow af we dont smoke either
gaming,not_removed,my husbands family has a newinbox atari that he keeps insisting probably isnt worth much i cant find a listing online to dispute that because i cant find a single one that is in the same condition
gaming,not_removed,gameboy lights seem to get screen cancerlcd bleed over time you might want to loosen up the back screws on that a little
gaming,not_removed,my brother had the gameboy and technically owns all the systems which sort of pisses me off since the nes and snes were definitely for all of us i ended up getting my own gameboy color later im the youngest of four but our two older sisters never cared much for video games past the nes i might have had more of a chance of obtaining one of the systems if i had had my own roomtv i guess oh well at least my pc is better now
gaming,not_removed,triggered
gaming,not_removed,clothes bikes toys i was a man before i took the plastic off of anything
gaming,not_removed,yes 😞
gaming,not_removed,yes extremely middle the middlest of childs actually
gaming,not_removed,or just young enough to miss the early years of gameboy i remember getting a weird green one from a pawnshop with a game of kirby my first own video game
gaming,not_removed,never opened box 😮im hard at work and not in a productive way
gaming,not_removed,ill pay for shipping if you want to mail it to me pm me if serious
gaming,not_removed,i havent seen someone write ninty since i read the nintendo official magazine in the
gaming,not_removed,nintys eh i bet your autocorrect put on an epic showdown to try and talk you out of that and you still followed through with it nintys good god
gaming,not_removed,its called retrobright and its incredible how well he makes that old hardware look definitely worth a watch theres a min youtube video on it but he does it in a lot of vids on mobile so i dont have a link right now
gaming,not_removed,if you must have bw the pocket screen is soooo much better
gaming,not_removed,you ever play on a virtual boy them things eyeball fuck game was on point
gaming,not_removed,but if youre going to go you might as well go all out i had that for my old game boy and it was awesome it was heavy as sin though
gaming,not_removed,why in hell would you want a stick though if there is no diagonal movement
gaming,not_removed,holy shit you reminded me that i had one of these things nostalgia overload technology really advanced in the past years
gaming,not_removed,go big or go home

gaming,not_removed,ea sports drugs its in the game
gaming,not_removed,i had never seen this before probably the funniest reddit post ive seen all week thanks for sharing
gaming,not_removed,typical storage wars episodepng
gaming,not_removed,i was wondering when that would show up
gaming,not_removed,fine you win
gaming,not_removed,as soon as i saw this i was hoping it was the gamecube steal
gaming,not_removed,would be an insanely low price for a boxed gameboy and op would be an insane fool for opening it up and playing it
gaming,not_removed,i agree completely i still occasionally play on the gbc i had as a kid works perfectly apart from the speakers they just have digital noise coming through
gaming,not_removed,i believe the idea behind collecting is that eventually they will be played with just not today like my collection of mega elixirs waiting for their moment in every jrpg ive ever played
gaming,not_removed,collecting things is sometimes just because the person likes it but mostly its because as something gets rarer its value massively increases investing in rare items is like investing in the stock market except that you are far less likely to lose money its doubtful a company will start producing something again so the value of what you buy is only likely to go up its actually really good that people collect things if they didnt there might not be any proper record of it in the future there will probably be a way in the future to scan the entirety of something without opening it including the materials involved with that you could start reproducing it so that it never dies
gaming,not_removed,putting the gb in lgbt

gaming,not_removed,thats what i thought but i dont think its a reference just questioning why op referred to a game boy as a her
gaming,not_removed,if i remember correctly its been years since i turned on my original game boy if you powered it on without a cartridge in instead of the nintendo logo just a black rectangle would appear
gaming,not_removed,bit wifi duh
gaming,not_removed,is this serious no they did not maybe in the factory but not after it was made most people did not have internet the internet was purely the scientific world and for the army at that website actually most people had no computer at the time

gaming,not_removed,fuck those exploading koopasi know theyre not koopas in the first game

gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,makes me wonder if this a legit original or copy you think there would of been a bit of breakdown
gaming,not_removed,thanks for answering one of the few mysteries i had left about life
gaming,not_removed,its the plastic material that causes it to yellow over time but its easy to clean and return to its nice bright grey colour saw plenty of guides online and even on reddit
gaming,not_removed,its nothing to do with smoking its the type of plastic they used in them
gaming,not_removed,i think its less about sun and more about uv light in only basing this off of comic book collecting your regular light bulbs give that off thats why we keep comic books in dark boxes or behind protective glass that protects comics from yellowing
gaming,not_removed,post pictures of said unit for all to enjoy
gaming,not_removed,i would suggest they do not open or throw away that atari it would be worth thousands seriously what kind is it
gaming,not_removed,i have a pretty much brand new nes back at my parents house picked it up at a carboot sale for quid
gaming,not_removed,wow that brings back some good memories i still have my atari and a dozen or so games packed away somewhere but cant remember if it was the i stopped playing when nes came out but maybe its time to dust the old girl off still have my commodore as well
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i use pricechartingcom for retro game value they dont have a value for an unopened atari but open and complete is going for right now and in june of last year a complete in box sold for worth looking into imo
gaming,not_removed,why do they keep it
gaming,not_removed,oh my gosh my sister and i are the same way she claims that she owns all of the consoles that we shared she hasnt even touched any of them in years probably like years honestly theyre just at our parents house edit i shall take them when i move out of the state in a couple months and away from the rage which is sure to follow my parents understand the value of them and think my sister deserves them likely because they think my newborn niece will want to play them when shes older
gaming,not_removed,yep same with my older bro damn him
gaming,not_removed,when i was moving out for college i bought my little brother a nintendo wii the newest nintendo console at the time just so i could take our shared which held significant sentimental value for me
gaming,not_removed,ah yes ninty powey
gaming,not_removed,probably because no ones used that term since before autocorrect was created
gaming,not_removed,it attempted minty at first but im not allowing a machine to correct my nostalgic terminology
gaming,not_removed,in the nintendo store you can buy old games for like bucks like i have pokemon red and blue on my
gaming,not_removed,if you have money to spend the light is really good the glow feels old school and delicious and it doesnt have too much motion blur takes aas too so it lasts longer than a pocket
gaming,not_removed,that shit was made for playing under a blanket
gaming,not_removed,i found my original gb my gb color a few months ago at my dads house and then this most recent trip back to clean up found that the handy boy its called i believe then i found yet another gb that looked almost as good as ops im guessing it was the replacement bought for my sister since she thrashed her first one the nostalgia hit pretty damn hard and also the fact that pokemon as a whole justtotally passed me by so i wanted togive that a shot game over store opened near me and they had yellow so i also bought red and blue off ebay so far so good i can see how it grabbed people and sucked their soul into the pokemon world a decent amount of fun that
gaming,not_removed,the stick was much much easier on your hand for long play sessions the a b buttons kinda sucked though
gaming,not_removed,surely the gameboy had diagonal movement didnt it
gaming,not_removed,happy cake day
gaming,not_removed,peripherbot the autobot that attaches to other transformers and enhances their powers
gaming,not_removed,good memory yeah it was made in response to looks likes about a gun magazine and a bag oftylenol
gaming,not_removed,he forgot the last and probably best picture
gaming,not_removed,it wasnt in box and opened or else he wouldnt have done that he said probably the first person to turn it on which implies that it wasnt in box and unopened
gaming,not_removed,the files are in the computer
gaming,not_removed,serious nice to know i have one
gaming,not_removed,op would be an insane fool for opening it up and playing it no because whats the point of having a brand new game boy if youre not going to play it lol disclaimer i agree with unblazeaway in that i think collectors are insane fools for buying things at inane prices and then just sitting them on a shelf or whatever
gaming,not_removed,he was foolish enough to pay for that one so dont raise the bar too high
gaming,not_removed,wait are you being serious of all the things that appreciate in value over time consumer electronics is not one of them you wanna collect million dollar paintings so they triple in value by the time you retire sure buying a gameboy color will get you maybe more in a few years before nobodys gonna spend money on it
gaming,not_removed,a simpler explanation is that its people deluding themselves into thinking that their hobby might one day be profitable
gaming,not_removed,game boy did you just assume this handheld devices gender
gaming,not_removed,did did you just assume its gender
gaming,not_removed,i think you might be correct now that you mention it i found mine also years old in my parents garage recently and it still worked however it did have a cartridge inside so the logo looked normal
gaming,not_removed,this is true the image is stored on the cartridge and the gameboy checks a hash of it is the same as a hash stored on the gb if they dont match ie if the cartridge is plugged in wrong or if the games broken the system stops the code from running also possibly an attempt to legally stop unlicensed cartridge producers since theyd have to reproduce the copywritten nintendo image for their game to run sega lost a court case when they tried that though so its misguided if so
gaming,not_removed,correct i have all my carts back at my dorm and im home for the weekend
gaming,not_removed,somehow i can remember this from my childhood but not much of the other shit 🤔
gaming,not_removed,right thanks man i though that was the case but what is the initial boot sequence of the game boy ive never seen it is it just a loading bar
gaming,not_removed,some people have enough money to not care about
gaming,not_removed,some people just dont care about collectibles game boy was meant to be played not sat on a shelf in its original box never opened at that point why not just buy the empty box and packing materials
gaming,not_removed,but then you cant play it

gaming,not_removed,for evening things out
gaming,not_removed,could have been restored recently uv light with hydrogen peroxide can remove the yellow
gaming,not_removed,it can also be one from the later batches where they didnt use bromine as a flame retardant anymore
gaming,not_removed,my original isnt yellow i didnt know that could happen probably dont need to worry though if it hasnt done it in years it shouldnt start now
gaming,not_removed,sex makes babies i just took all the other mysteries away too
gaming,not_removed,only the snes revisions have stable bfrs in their plastics that will not yellowlike ever
gaming,not_removed,its oxygen not the insignificant uv from house lights
gaming,not_removed,its somewhere at my inlaws house but ill try to get pics next time were over there
gaming,not_removed,im not sure i dont know much about ataris and the last time i saw it was about a year ago
gaming,not_removed,thousands last i checked most nib ataris were going for max
gaming,not_removed,carboot sale
gaming,not_removed,we had a commodore ah the good ol days we had the keyboard with the cartridges that load into the back like a nintendo and then the cassette tape thing and the old floppies so quaint
gaming,not_removed,because they never get rid of anything ever this includes things that are unattractive and worthless creepy falling apart toys and craft projects from years ago catalogs from last christmas etc and things that are expensive and potentially useful to someone else ereader digital camera fitbit that were expensive gifts that mil wont try to learn how to use edit the reason they have it in the first place is that they bought an atari for their kids when they were relatively new the kids loved it and played it a lot so when ataris were on their way out the parents saw one on clearance and picked it up in case the original one broke not long after that they got whatever new gaming console was out nintendo i think and the new atari stayed on the shelf
gaming,not_removed,just take them yo
gaming,not_removed,my parents solution to this was to always give the consoles as christmas presents under the dogs name so none of us could fight over it it wasnt our console it was the dogs
gaming,not_removed,video games will always outweight your relationship with your siblings especially if yall played mario party growing up cuz deep down inside you know your not on the same team after that
gaming,not_removed,i went behind my sisters back and asked my dad if i could take the snes and to college with me because i was the only one that ever used them
gaming,not_removed,what is it with older siblings and things like this my older sister sold our pokemon xd game it was never hers to sell im still bitter about this
gaming,not_removed,i had a sub to nintendo power when i was a kid starting with the first issue i am now waiting for doc to show up in his delorean so i can go back and tell my past self to not let my parents throw away all my gaming history i had it all every game system you could think of all the best games accessories etc and my parents tossed it all in the trash im still sad when i think about how much cool shit i would have i miss you nester edit i not u
gaming,not_removed,i never understood why they only sold gameboy and nes games on the virtual store for surely it could handle snes and gameboy advance games too
gaming,not_removed,also if youre on firmware version or below you can hack your this lets you do vc injection making a vc game using a rom file this lets you play any rom at full speed and perfect audio
gaming,not_removed,the old ads were literally some kid in pjs playing under a blanket
gaming,not_removed,those are vicodin sourceam vicodin
gaming,not_removed,those pills could be anything tbh
gaming,not_removed,its there you just need to press load more image at the bottom
gaming,not_removed,it wasnt in box and opened or else he wouldnt have done that if youre implying that he wouldnt have opened a brand new one still in its original packaging why do you assume that i would have done it id have happily opened it up and put some games in it and played the heck out of them
gaming,not_removed,but why male models
gaming,not_removed,to collect it and thats really not that bad at least you can see what the product is and it looks cool tim atwood collects nes games and they are all in plain cardboard shipping boxes of course everything is brand new and sealed from the factory but its pretty boring to look at now thats crazy
gaming,not_removed,whats the point of buying a brand new gameboy just to play it just buy a second hand one and play it
gaming,not_removed,this is normally true but after about years they stop being consumer electronics and start becoming vintage collectibles
gaming,not_removed,my is worth approximately what i paid for it in things really only appreciate if people value them like art seems to so yeah
gaming,not_removed,in most cases yeah but some people actually make huge profits on selling rare items
gaming,not_removed,if nintendo release the gameboy today then tumblr would be outraged lol
gaming,not_removed,its not an assumption if its explicitly stated
gaming,not_removed,its a nintendo logo that scrolls down if no cartridge is inserted the logo is all black the device itself is basically just a cpu and two ram chips so it has no rom or software that data is all stored on the cartridge
gaming,not_removed,loading bars didnt exist on consoles back then switching on a gameboy would show a and then the game started if no game was inserted the nintendo logo was replaced by a black bar that would come down the same way
gaming,not_removed,i dont have enough money to not care about but if i didnt already have a gameboy and i came across this i would open that shit up without hesitation
gaming,not_removed,hence why its not called collect boy
gaming,not_removed,my uncle collected dbz figures for a long time never understood it i always opened them up and played with them as a kid
gaming,not_removed,i thought days on runescape preeoc was bad wow
gaming,not_removed,wow i quit forever after i hit months played and i played the shit out of it
gaming,not_removed,mine hit during mists stopped playing near the end of legion
gaming,not_removed,never reddit on mobile from bed in the morning if you arent willing to check auto correct mistakes

gaming,not_removed,httpsenmwikipediaorgwikidonaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaft im sure english has a word that describes this too or donaudampfschiffahrtsgesellschaftskapitänskajütenschlüssel
gaming,not_removed,german has more compound words than english does though and very long ones sometimes
gaming,not_removed,or they use an english word the wrong way gotta go my handy rings

gaming,not_removed,dont open it youll ruin the value
gaming,not_removed,can you describe what the box looks like is it in shrink wrap as well
gaming,not_removed,its the uk version of a yard sale everyone drives their cars to a field or empty stadiumrace track and sells shit from the back of their car

gaming,not_removed,me too thanks
gaming,not_removed,extra strong mints give them out to the kids down the local park
gaming,not_removed,weird i was on res and there was only images minutes ago
gaming,not_removed,hes saying if hes the type of person who took pictures of a generic gameboy then hes definitely the type to film an unboxing since he didnt we must assume the worst but honestly who gives a fuck
gaming,not_removed,because you could sell it and buy five used ones instead
gaming,not_removed,i mean why bother buying a boxed one if youre gonna play it you can get a cheaper gbcgba for the same if not better in the case of gameboy advance sps that backlight yo gaming experience without ruining a pretty uncommon collectable
gaming,not_removed,i feel like im taking crazy pills
gaming,not_removed,because we have to establish proper routes if were ever gonna compete with the pony express
gaming,not_removed,whats the point of buying a brand new anything
gaming,not_removed,youre not wrong but for every story about the guy that sold his childhood lone ranger action figure for schmeckles youve got another few thousand refusing to throw away junk because you know thats an investment for the future bro i do like your initial point about collecting preserving items for the future though ephemera can tell us a lot about the time and culture that produced it to me thats of more value than a dollar figure
gaming,not_removed,yeah but most of those people actually make a profession out of dealing collectables choosing not to remove a toy from its packaging because it might be worth something one day is just dumb youd probably make more money in the long run from leaving your money in a savings account
gaming,not_removed,oh the mario coin sound one of my all time fav startup sounds
gaming,not_removed,we arent even halfway to end of the legion tho
gaming,not_removed,were not at the end of legion yet though

gaming,not_removed,who does use any oxygen
gaming,not_removed,dude ill fourth the fuck outa that
gaming,not_removed,i would fourth this but i cant think of something cool to say
gaming,not_removed,i had an atari st as a child with about pirated games thank you pompey pirates et al and one legal copy of batman which was shit my step dad threw them out when we moved house after my parents divorce years later he is still not forgiven and havent spoken to him since bastard
gaming,not_removed,some parents are pretty stupid they see you collecting things throughout childhood and hear you talking about their value and how collectible they are and how much you treasure them and then one day they need space and toss out a bunch of your shit and you find out they just tossed out worth of highly appreciated collectibles and you want to go on a rampage
gaming,not_removed,i have a broken rip
gaming,not_removed,now of sort of feel bad again about buying all those games from an old couple that was having a garage sale i probably got someones prized collection for i got like games half of which were still in the boxes and had manuals and stuff i guess at least it didnt end up in the trash though
gaming,not_removed,woof
gaming,not_removed,ds or that makes a big difference here the new is also capable of playing snes games while the doesnt
gaming,not_removed,cool when you do could you tell me how the hell to beat loz ive played many old games but loz is a whole different beast in terms of figuring out what the hell im supposed to be doing with basically no directions

gaming,not_removed,til you can ruin a relationship with someone by throwing hisher games out
gaming,not_removed,burn every bush bomb every wall push every tombstone then get lost in the woods
gaming,not_removed,its old school take notes for weeks or cheat with an online guide the game is from the days of only having three games for a system
gaming,not_removed,you need the instruction manual which came with tips map or some power
gaming,not_removed,know how the world is a grid that fits nicely on grid paper you should get some grid paper and make a map so you know where things are oh and spectacle rock is actually a pathway that looks like glasses sorta theres two rocks and its in the mountains but thats spectacle rock thats the only thing that i can recall being actually hard to figure out once you apply yourself
gaming,not_removed,i beat the original legend of zelda when it came out it had a second round where all the stuff was hidden in different places when i beat the second round i kept going and soon found nothing to do i called nintendo and the live person answering the phone was impressed that i beat it twice and confirmed that there wasnt anything more to do in the game i dont recall taking notes so i must have a bad memory or was an idiot savant or both over years later im playing breath of the wild and my beating the original games comes up my and year old kids were genuinely impressed what a history nintendo has the difficulty and admiration of a mid eighties game reaching year olds in while playing an amazing new game in the series just wow
gaming,not_removed,dont worry buddy it took year old me about months to get through that game
gaming,not_removed,its part of a larger exhibit
gaming,not_removed,nintendo handheld consoles 😜👌
gaming,not_removed,jawohl
gaming,not_removed,im extremely confused as to what you want to say am i an idiot
gaming,not_removed,alright alter
gaming,not_removed,alice in a wonderful bar
gaming,not_removed,elben
gaming,not_removed,and supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
gaming,not_removed,he is a doctor hes still a surgeon at a hospital in manhattan im certain he only works like one day a week but yeah hes definitely got a legitimate md at the end of his name
gaming,not_removed,he is actually a very successful httpsenwikipediaorgwikimehmetoz
gaming,not_removed,good a time as any for a sixth sensing
gaming,not_removed,i mean it is a pretty petty fucking thing to do the step dad was being a douche and trying to hurt him as a kid even though he didnt do anything
gaming,not_removed,its not the object thrown out that makes it hurt its the sentimental value of the object and intent of action that hurts there was no real punishment given out the parent was just mad and decided he should destroy a highly treasured object just so someone else could feel like shit its grade a asshole move to perform
gaming,not_removed,id be hurt if my parents had thrown out any of my property without asking after i moved out
gaming,not_removed,now if only nintendo made your decision easier and declared the switch as successor to both wiiu and but go for a new so you can play the snes zelda too or go for a new fire tablet at and play all for free
gaming,not_removed,look into a retropie with a wiiu pro controller i made the onefor xmas and so far i have beaten pokemon emerald link to the past pac man world and sonic on the thing
gaming,not_removed,you can still play nes games with the help of a flash cart it lets you download and place dozens of gamesroms for nes and ds games on the card this is the one i have
gaming,not_removed,ah memories of our ultima mapping notes notebook
gaming,not_removed,looks fake thats the guy from the first one the guy from deadwood
gaming,not_removed,original
gaming,not_removed,a repost of a repost pasted onto a card that was reposted nice
gaming,not_removed,is it his birthday
gaming,not_removed,not really funny when reposted in rfunny and not really gaming posted here
gaming,not_removed,any credit on this
gaming,not_removed,its like manual repost
gaming,not_removed,looks utterly underwhelming i dont even want to play that one minute and i quite like the original raiden
gaming,not_removed,close your eyes
gaming,not_removed,ohevery online game there i fixed the title for you op lol
gaming,not_removed,judging from yonibears comments you arent very good at this game
gaming,not_removed,if hes playing with a bunch of rookies or semipros then his teammates are just making it harder for not only him but themselves as well
gaming,not_removed,yeah probably but yonis comments make it seem like this person blew the game by having shitty aim
gaming,not_removed,nice never used a invading ship before ive only beaten the boss times its so stressful
gaming,not_removed,ive never played what am i looking at here
gaming,not_removed,oh i was just using this to host the image so the ship on the left is my ship the ship on the right is the enemy ship the red markers are systems that are no longer functioning i sent my crew to the enemy ship they messed it up then teleported back
gaming,not_removed,youll get out of these games what you put into them do you want a funfriendly game with a simple story and some fun exploring then pokémon is for you do you want an extremely strategic game with an amazing battle system and countless ideas to explore then pokémon is for you do you want a game where theres always something to do aka completing a legit pokédex training pokémon a few side events etc then pokémon is for you nbsp you can play some pokémon on mobile via emulators but i recommend a real copy to get the best experience if you have a i recommend pokemon x or y since those still have online otherwise you could go retro and buy any of the versions that were available on various gameboy platforms nbsp as a final note i recommend if possible to have a friend that is familiar to the series be there for questions and tips if youve played the games for decades like most then this may sound funny but seriously it wont hurt to have a friend explain different moves stats etc
gaming,not_removed,i was able to get the original ruby sapphire emerald fire red and leaf green on ebay for so id check it out the games dont really have an age limit in my opinion if youre open to what the game is if you dont think exploring a region in search for pokemon and battling them to their max is fun then no otherwise theyre a great way to sink a couple hundred hours into i have hrs so far and im not even really into breeding yet good luck and have fun
gaming,not_removed,long answer yes short answer yes
gaming,not_removed,people usually fall into of categories nostalgia preferencial or non interested the first group of adult players play because it was a staple of their childhood and have fond memories of it the second group may not necessarily have played pokemon growing up but if you have a preference for mobile rpgs and the fact that youre looking into playing it on your phone suggests you are then you might enjoy them the third category is pretty self explanatory if youre indeed in category two give em a go you can usually find some cheap copies on craigslist to give em a try
gaming,not_removed,hell yeah the newer ones especially have something for everyone i recommend the real copies because of the ability for online trading and battling also nintendo recently rereleased the first ones red and blue on the nintendo eshop for about if you wanted to experience what you missed out on
gaming,not_removed,i just got the new xl and pokemon last week for my birthday so yes its absolutely fine
gaming,not_removed,i recommend starting with fire red or leaf green you could go back to the originals but thats up to you as for your question yes it is
gaming,not_removed,they are prefectly fine as mobile games go and you can sink more time into them than other games and later games get more advanced with eviv spreads natures and breeding
gaming,not_removed,no they suck get a girlfriend instead
gaming,not_removed,extremely strategic is a bit of a stretch if theyre just planning on playing the game and not attend competitions and shit its about as strategic is rockpaperscissors but with a lot more possible values like metal ground lighting flying dragon fire water etc etc
gaming,not_removed,what other games can this be done with for android just switched from iphone where i only could get pokemon
gaming,not_removed,seems logical ill probably go the emulator route instead of craigslist though
gaming,not_removed,thanks they sound like they could be a great time killer
gaming,not_removed,hey fellow asshole ive got a girlfriend so i can cross that off my list thanks for looking out for me though
gaming,not_removed,while thats all up to personal preferenceplay style as uthecodinggamer noted the games are so much better on than they are on the phones having played both i wont go back to the emulator copies either way you can easily sink quite a bit of time into them enjoy edit thats probably bias im in category i still play pokemon on my gbpocketcolorsp from time to time
gaming,not_removed,sup fellow asshole didnt see you at the meeting this week you okay
gaming,not_removed,no problem now go fuck yourself
gaming,not_removed,seems like the correct response
gaming,not_removed,eh hes trying a little too hard
gaming,not_removed,fun fact he outbid jayz and beyonce for it
gaming,not_removed,its in a nice area bit unless the photo is misleading it seems incredibly small
gaming,not_removed,not my style personally not really into that modern look if i had his money id do a cabinmansion in the woods big lake boat and im set
gaming,not_removed,thats one level of multiple
gaming,not_removed,ranks in the membership what also yeah i remember all of that
gaming,not_removed,even though ive never actually played club penguin this is kinda sad
gaming,not_removed,i dont have carpal tunnel but i do own an elite i noticed i play bettet and my hands dont get tired or sweaty as hard the paddles on the back migt make it easier for you
gaming,not_removed,had one since release october i think the weight is nicer and mapping things like andor lbrb to those back paddles is sweet the only problem ive had is that the default thumb stick grips have worn down but no failures or plastic falling off for me and my wife and i use it daily
gaming,not_removed,i have had one since release day and have had zero problems with it i absolutely love it and the paddles are nice along with button mapping
gaming,not_removed,im not sure you know what carpal tunnel is op a controller change isnt going to change the fact that your wrists are cutting the circulation to the carpal nerves in your wrists a controller change isnt going to fix that but taking a break every thirty minutes to lumber up yours hands will bending your wrist in different directions helps theres many articles online that show stretching techniques that minimize the nerve punching after gaming sessions
gaming,not_removed,they dont last very long the rubber sides have ripped off during normal use and there is no way to replace them except buy a brand new controller ive heard the usual thumb stick drift actually effects elite controllers earlier than normal controllers
gaming,not_removed,nice it might make a difference then how long have you had it have you had any issues with it or anything yet
gaming,not_removed,that doesnt sound too bad the thumbsticks can be replaced easily enough so not a big issue i think im going to give it a shot and pick one up after work today thanks for the feedback man
gaming,not_removed,awesome i think im going to give it a shot and pick one up after work today thanks for the feedback dude
gaming,not_removed,i am well aware of what carpal tunnel is my problem is the way i bend my wrist back when using the lb and lt on the controllers aggravates the issue quite a bit extended use of those buttons like using the shield excessively in dark souls really causes issues the elite controller would allow me to map those buttons to the back right of the controller so i wouldnt have to bend my wrist that way which would hopefully allow me to hold the controller in a different way that wouldnt aggravate the tendons and cause them to swell and mess with the nerve thats my hypothesis anyways and i was hoping someone here may have tried the same thing and had luck with it
gaming,not_removed,you can buy replacement rubber grips
gaming,not_removed,i got it as a christmas present i have yet to have a single issue with it
gaming,not_removed,definitely some budding editing skills although i can tell you for sure people arent going to want to watch a bunch of second videos like that a longer compilation of similar stuff for a few minutes could be cool
gaming,not_removed,yea thats what im going to end up doing im going to make a long cod and rocket league ones soon this was more of a test to get used to making them
gaming,not_removed,i mean im sorta meh on the seriesand fanboys can get a little annoying but generally i dont care enough
gaming,not_removed,if you go on to the next pages people hating it say they havent and will never touch the franchise kyuubi kitsune wrote i will never give kingdom hearts a chance and i dont even want to people should be ashamed of themselves for playing that mess anyway and its better not to be involved in it i hate it that much enough that i avoided the series if you strongly disagree with me then you shouldnt reply to this thread i started i dont take haters offensively and there the ones missing out i dont get why this happens with all the good franchises mgsffpersona and never really happens with games ranging from mediocrecod to straight up badfifa seriously the controls are awful not a reply because the save button disappeared lol
gaming,not_removed,this is very clearly a troll post and you forced me to give him attention god dammit
gaming,not_removed,its my favorite game series but yeah the fanbase can get annoying at times especially the yaoi fangirls there fanart can ruin the games xd still though the games get more hate than love this shows how little haters actually know about the franchise
gaming,not_removed,this shows how little haters actually know about the franchise if you didnt like the game you probably didnt play a lot of it do you expect them to know a lot
gaming,not_removed,fun fact the makers actually came to australia and filmed the sky to use in the game
gaming,not_removed,i wish forza made an illegal street racing game
gaming,not_removed,it does look absolutely amazing such a shame that the pc performance is a shambles and im pretty sure theyve given up trying to fix it
gaming,not_removed,this is one game i really wish had i really considered switching just because of this game maybe we will get a gran turismo thats this beautiful
gaming,not_removed,if the car damage and physics was like gta then racing games would be awesome unfortunately i hate to bounce off brick walls and lampposts without a scratch
gaming,not_removed,this fucking game is why i love my xbox
gaming,not_removed,abzu
gaming,not_removed,you obviously havent played horizon zero dawn
gaming,not_removed,but its too damn expensive and i keep on hearing the pc performance is shit
gaming,not_removed,what do you mean i have it and dont have performance issues unless im missing something
gaming,not_removed,i have forza is still better graphics wise and hzd is damn good
gaming,not_removed,racing games pretty much have most other games beat in terms of graphics less to render few npcs it probably helps that youre moving at most of the time horizon is definitely a beautiful game though
gaming,not_removed,it uses gigabytes
gaming,not_removed,still micro stutters a lot for me enough for it to bother me it just doesnt feel smooth it cant seem to maintain a consistent frame rate for me at least and my system isnt too bad ram
gaming,not_removed,luck of the draw i think some gpus seem to cope better than others
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,ah gotcha thats not fun im guessing my system is just muscling through it but its not a testament to their optimization ive got a and hopefully they work it out though
gaming,not_removed,it played like shit with my gtx but i was gonna upgrade so i got a a gtx and it runs fantastically gtx ram but it still dropped frames randomly i wish the steering wheel was better for horizon and it plays like shit some reason and i tried everything
gaming,not_removed,means give in polish
gaming,not_removed,it means that one in the netherlands and that is where it comes from also reposted
gaming,not_removed,how is that leeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeroy
gaming,not_removed,well attacking a foe that you cant win against
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i miss didnt always get to watch it but loved when i could uh to answer the question probably not on regular tv like but there is many a talk shows on twitch about topics that would cover
gaming,not_removed,i heard about this thing while riding the subway to work these two kids were talking about it u toob something like that i hear theres a shit ton of tech and gaming content on there
gaming,not_removed,attack of the show was goat
gaming,not_removed,twitch has things like this
gaming,not_removed,i seriously hope youre joking u toob
gaming,not_removed,obviously im joking what im getting at is youtube basically took over the techgamingcomputer science entertainment industry
gaming,not_removed,i was playing terribly on halo and someone told me that i suck and i just replied tell me something i dont know he never replied i guess i shut him up
gaming,not_removed,i love
gaming,not_removed,cod players need love more than any other so hateful
gaming,not_removed,does xbox chat just always bring up a report option after each message
gaming,not_removed,for the record it was in a gungame i randomly got into last night went i think and won im assuming he sent this message right after but i didnt see both till an hour later ps do not report him pls
gaming,not_removed,it makes me really sad that its so accepted now to tell someone to kill themselves i get that trash talking is part of gaming but thats just not cool
gaming,not_removed,i dont play cod but i absolutely love cod because it creates a barrier between me and a huge number of people i have no desire to ever interact with for all the shit cod gets its the perfect net to catch immature gamers
gaming,not_removed,surprisingly relevant username
gaming,not_removed,this is my new response any time somebody is being toxic in overwatch i dont usually get a response but more often than not the toxicity stops i wish i could understand what would cause a person to be so awful
gaming,not_removed,username checks out
gaming,not_removed,some people just need to be loved
gaming,not_removed,one time playing battlefield there was a guy on the mics being a jerk i jumped into the fray and he asks hey whats the strongest muscle in your body i replied with ur cock took the punchline out of his mouth or he was too embarrassed to reply
gaming,not_removed,now that his username was posted publicly i wonder how many death threats this kid got from reddit lurkers
gaming,not_removed,as is tradition
gaming,not_removed,why does it say report message after every message
gaming,not_removed,doing gods work literally
gaming,not_removed,tell this to ten people and youll get at least one i love you more and better than you sad could ever do
gaming,not_removed,youre
gaming,not_removed,i never respond to any messages on xbox it just takes so much damn effort to select each letter
gaming,not_removed,just reported him because i can
gaming,not_removed,i dont see how people can do this unless it was cleary a fuck up on my part i cant tell someone something like that i have to aruge back
gaming,not_removed,i was playing in a tank game and these two guys in the same clan using the single toughest tank in their tier bracket fail to average more than damage together each game for games for the average player its about per game and for a skilled player its just how even saw them miss a point blank shot to the exposed side of an enemy tank which is about as easy a shot as shooting a gun at the broadside of a barn literally i was polite and didnt say a word but i know that if i see them in any future games i wont be playing to win because weve already lost
gaming,not_removed,for some reason this reads like rthathappened even though i know that this could have definitely happened
gaming,not_removed,i love accepted your full album has been uploaded to your device it wontcant be removed thanks for listening to
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i love one
gaming,not_removed,if this was a scrubs reference it appears no one else got it so i just wanted to say i got you fam
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,u talkin to me
gaming,not_removed,i think you spelt league players wrong
gaming,not_removed,try trials of osiris in destiny the salt is real lol
gaming,not_removed,if theyre not on your friends list yes
gaming,not_removed,yes and if one has an xbox make sure you never curse at someone because the report option works very well my friend got a suspension for responding to trash talk with a cuss word and he got his communication privileges revoked for a week
gaming,not_removed,there is a line between trash talking which is fine and this which is not
gaming,not_removed,the downside to this name
gaming,not_removed,anonymity and poorly developed social skills
gaming,not_removed,i just troll them ive found the most fun to be had after saying its just a game or chill out to a toxic player depending on stats ill also say something like well i have more kills and less deaths than you so at least im not the worst
gaming,not_removed,none he loves me too
gaming,not_removed,nooooooooooooooooooooooooo
gaming,not_removed,you do it by rationalizing it as a spiteful action let me explain you can force yourself into this peaceful mindset by removing the peace from it make it about taking away what they want they want to argue with you they want to validate their hate for you they want you to give them a reason to hate you so they dont feel bad about it they want you to take their pain seriously you take this away and you win so a smiley face an i love you or even complete silence in some cases is enough to royally piss someone off their desperation to be taken seriously or acknowledged will cause them to do stupid shit they may throw a game they may piss off an admin with their raging and get banned they may tk you repeatedly and get autokicked or deranked desperately trying to trigger a reaction the most pleasure ive gotten from an internet ragetard has been from belittling their existence so much as to disregard it completely a rager is an ant to me tldr the greatest insult you can give to an enemy is to ignore them and if they decide to apologize or chill out thats cool too
gaming,not_removed,if youve seen me play video games you would know i am an absolute disaster at many different games just today i was playing super mario bros and i was getting game overs left and right around times
gaming,not_removed,they sound better at video games than me
gaming,not_removed,the lack of punctuation likely
gaming,not_removed,i will listen to it forever and ever and ever and ever and ever
gaming,not_removed,it was an alright album but i still havent found what im looking for
gaming,not_removed,relevant username
gaming,not_removed,how dare you
gaming,not_removed,there are literally dozens of us who understood that reference dozens of us
gaming,not_removed,so true the community on lol is why i left lol before i was able to fully invest time into it edit added a sentence because reasons
gaming,not_removed,only if you mean rocket league probably pretty close on terms of hatefulness really
gaming,not_removed,console players because lol and csgo players are champions of friendliness and love
gaming,not_removed,nicely said
gaming,not_removed,thanks professor
gaming,not_removed,right on point as ive grown that was my best realization i think the best one for me is giving them no reaction no response at all people get to tempted and cave in i never do i know it eats away at them inside
gaming,not_removed,of retail the angry arsehole customer causing a big scene in the supermarket will always leave more pissed off than they started if you smile and wish them a nice day on the way out thank fuck i dont work in retail anymore but it sure was fun watching their face contort when they dont get a fight back
gaming,not_removed,super mario bros is not a very easy game especially if you didnt grow up playing it i got it on vc a couple years ago and still havent beaten it
gaming,not_removed,i will listen to it forever and ever and ever and ever and ever accepted immortality granted condition listen to everyday
gaming,not_removed,are you fucking sorry
gaming,not_removed,arent they all
gaming,not_removed,like the song by
gaming,not_removed,or at least and a subreddit somewhere
gaming,not_removed,i tried lol once and got cussed outberated for not knowing what i was doing so i decided to try dota thinking the community would be nicer i got death threats
gaming,not_removed,lol
gaming,not_removed,rust players
gaming,not_removed,ive never had a problem with the community seems to me everyone playing that game just wants to engage in some friendly memeing
gaming,not_removed,no problem bro
gaming,not_removed,id be careful about doing this at work especially in retail i use this technique on raging gamers because their anger is pretty much irrelevant and pointless its a video game and theyre freaking the fuck out about it like a toddler so its fun and entertaining to watch them stew its like watching gorillas at the zoo the only thing theyre likely to hurt is their computer and that would make it more hilarious because the only thing their rage would be doing would be draining their wallet but i would never use this technique on people i deal with at work because people could get hurt by some douche having a childish ragefit i supervise a hospitals security staff on the weekends and often deal with belligerent psych patients or drug addicts cigarettes included you have to take those people seriously because adults acting like children are violent chestpounding motherfuckers who hurt people that doesnt mean bend over for them or goad them into a fight but it does mean that you need to consider what their desire is try and understand their position and work within the boundaries of what your workplace can do but no matter your job never cede your authority or make an exception just because someone is being unreasonable it undermines you your position and your place of business if they want results you need to make it clear that they need to be willing to break bread with you and compromise or they arent getting squat grats on getting out of retail though
gaming,not_removed,yes it is really hard and the stupid lives system makes me have to repeat the hard levels if i screw up a later level honestly as far as nes games go i prefer the mega man games
gaming,not_removed,you dropped this three slashes etc etc
gaming,not_removed,sounds good to me cant wait for their new album
gaming,not_removed,how much every day
gaming,not_removed,you like that you fucking retard jolly rancher something something broken arms now i need a poet
gaming,not_removed,how do you pee
gaming,not_removed,oh i see now
gaming,not_removed,yeah mobas arent exactly the games to play if you cant deal with toxic teammates the players are nice when youre winning but as soon as you start losing the blame game begins i personally prefer dota however heroes of the storm seems to have a friendlier community its not as hard to get into aswell
gaming,not_removed,i got into lol went to try dota thinking they were similar i had no idea what i was doing
gaming,not_removed,nah those guys are just assholes least the ones ive met
gaming,not_removed,wise words mate i didnt mean to fuel them rather just show that their tirade has no impact i had many instances of the reverse effect over the years too they would see it wasnt escalating things the way they hoped and theyd back down some even apologized i learned really fast in many customerservice jobs that they take it out on the service not you it took a lot to faze me people would come over to me after a tirade and be like oh my god are you ok but it never got to me because i knew i was just the outlet for their frustration when they realized someone was listening and not upping the ante theyd reconsider it was the passiveaggressive ill never shop here again ones that got the smile and wellwishing i guess the interactions over the years worked in my favor since im now working as a counselor
gaming,not_removed,you dropped this
gaming,not_removed,colby
gaming,not_removed,how do you pretend
gaming,not_removed,honestly smite has a pretty helpful community which in the moba world practically makes them saints
gaming,not_removed,however heroes of the storm seems to have a friendlier community hots is the only game somebody has ever told me to shut the fuck up before the game even began
gaming,not_removed,dota is on a whole different level i tried it and i sucked so bad i felt bad to even play it i didnt want to be a burden on people
gaming,not_removed,i wonder if this guy will be my friend lifts torch
gaming,not_removed,you go first
gaming,not_removed,all mobas are filled with salty people its rediculous
gaming,not_removed,every game has salty people its just the way it goes
gaming,not_removed,yeah but in mobas they all are
gaming,not_removed,the greatest disappointment created award damn thought my mother gave me that one
gaming,not_removed,thats fucked
gaming,not_removed,they won the innovation award they made great strides in the field of convincing people they were making something amazing instead of a giant empty space with the depth of an evaporated puddle no other company has been able to reach such great levels of hype they are true pioneers
gaming,not_removed,for so many reasons
gaming,not_removed,pioneers use to ride this hype for miles
gaming,not_removed,if you play previous fallout games youll know why one major thing i hated was the dialogue options again you would understand if you played older fo games
gaming,not_removed,the fact that the progression system restricts players in an impractical way by using a skill perk system rather than a skill system the fact that there is no real choice most of the decisions are actually just an illusion as events in quests either change minutely or dont change at all based on your dialogue choices some people also find that the fixed voice protagonist eliminates the sense that your character is yours and can sound like whatever you want
gaming,not_removed,i feel like we can argue that it is a rpg but compared to previous fallout installments it has extremely dumbed down quests choices and build routes youre also forced to play the same exact character every single time thanks to the voice acted protagonist the dialogue system is absolute garbage
gaming,not_removed,id say the lack of depth and over simplification of all the rpg elements when compared to previous fallout games it feels as though the devs dumbed it down to capture a larger audience ie the fps crowd
gaming,not_removed,mine biggest complaint is lack of skills and skillchecks perks work well but its not the same level of character building also a lot of people are crying over voiced main characters because muh immersion but i dont mind more than four dialogue options would help a lot though that being said shooting is a lot better than in
gaming,not_removed,linear quests no matter what you do you get the same outcome no karma youre just kind of existing throughout the entire a game its hard to feel like a hero when you have no other choice minimal armor and weapon attachments as well as weapons and variants the game gets kind of stale after you complete it so most people stopped playing around level you cant really side with people to make new friends and enemies that being said i still really enjoyed the game stopped at lvl i might pick it up again sometime
gaming,not_removed,in rpgs you usually can influence where things go and how characters answer options do not matter characters are one dimensional writing is rather lazy and primitive quests are just fetch quests thats what fps are nowadays they improved on shooting mechanics but rpg elements were simplified the game is still fun but its very different from where the series started
gaming,not_removed,it is an rpg and does feel like one just a very simplified one rpg genre is so diverse some would argue tloz is not an rpg when it is p
gaming,not_removed,fallout oversimplified fallout a bit much
gaming,not_removed,some of us feel it does it better then the past ones its a matter of opinion
gaming,not_removed,in fallout you have next to no no lasting impacts on moral choices all its progression makes choices illusionary some videos criticize nicely how fallout does not allow you to play a morally bad character
gaming,not_removed,it is pretty lackluster but i still think giving him a voice to actually speak your choices was very cool and new for fo
gaming,not_removed,kinda using a loose definition there one that pretty much makes any game in which you play the role of a character an rpg not that its incorrect mind you you are very correct i just think the discussion was about the more colloquial use of the term as a video game genre and what is expected of the genre
gaming,not_removed,i found myself quicksaving midconversation because i wasnt sure what my character was going to say if i picked a certain option how is that better than being shown the entire line beforehand
gaming,not_removed,yes sarcastic yes more info no but you have to say yes eventually im sorry but the dialogue is trash theres no argument to be made here
gaming,not_removed,lol i think youre the only one bud
gaming,not_removed,i vehemently despise it because i dont want to hear a troybakerlike sound coming out of every single character i create plus we are naturally going to get far less freedom about what we say because they wont pay voice actors to say them the reason i have soft spots for other games like fallout skyrim and new vegas is because my character was my own he or she sounded like who they were and i could create my own motivations fallout forces me into one single role with very limited forked roads which means that after one playthrough im done not to say that voiced protagonists in rpgs are always bad witcher but the difference is in the writing if you can craft a story intelligent enough to accomodate it then great but bethesda cant write a game worth shit and their ego is so massive that they forgot that as a result they made a game that i just simply dont want to play through more than once
gaming,not_removed,pretty much
gaming,not_removed,oh it isnt i agree
gaming,not_removed,no i agree it is trash but the combat and leveling feels alot better imo dialogue and story isnt what i play rpgs for
gaming,not_removed,fair enough but i know people who agree with me p its obvious we are the minority i prefer the combat and perks in the new game
gaming,not_removed,i hope you realize this is the equivalent of saying comedy is not the reason i watch comedy movies
gaming,not_removed,no it isnt there are alot more things in rpgs then dialogue and story i play rpgs for the character development and roleplaying and character development story and dialogue has never interested me as a first i prefer jrpgs over western rpgs for that reason as we see the reddit hivemind downvotes anyone who disagrees with their perception of what makes an rpg an rpg to me an rpg is character development and roleplaying and gameplay
gaming,not_removed,i prefer jrpgs over western rpgs for that reason i also prefer jrpgs but i prefer my general rpgs to have semi competent dialogue and story i dont mean to imply that dialogue choice is important hell even among wrpgs we have mass effect and witcher which are a bit more linear if my choice is going to be limited then i want smart writing to follow throughand fallout completely fails in this regard but even so i think its unfair to compare fallout to jrpgs they have completely different philosophies and goals i would say you got downvoted mainly because youre internally putting those two in the same exact category for some reason
gaming,not_removed,i see jrpgs and rpgs as the same type of genre personally i guess thats why
gaming,not_removed,gta v
gaming,not_removed,bloodborne got hundreds of hours of rage inducing stressed out masochism out of that game when i finally grow a pair and go back to finish it im sure ill get at least that much again as it pile drives my pathetic noob body into the ground over and over again because ive forgotten how to properly time the reverse firebomb after dodge rolling keep doing your thing from soft never change
gaming,not_removed,the witcher and bloodborne i would happily pay twice for these games
gaming,not_removed,resident evil i have since purchased it again every time its become available on a new platform or console
gaming,not_removed,modern warfare
gaming,not_removed,this gen halo hundreds of hours of gameplay with monthly free updates
gaming,not_removed,witcher every zelda game forza horizon civilization addons anno smash bros skyrim oh there are so many of them who where definitely worth the money
gaming,not_removed,witcher gta v mad max tomb raider grid project cars sw the old republic xcom enemy unknown civ v none of the new ones though
gaming,not_removed,witcher end of list
gaming,not_removed,witcher
gaming,not_removed,i pre ordered got premium and i still play it today even after moving from to xone it is such a great game
gaming,not_removed,didnt regret the season pass either
gaming,not_removed,fallout and xcom most recently
gaming,not_removed,the witcher also it was closer to taking into account dlc and how fucking expensive everything is here
gaming,not_removed,witcher iii
gaming,not_removed,witcher mgsvtpp bloodborne dark souls and i never paid full price for demons souls and dark souls but gladly would have
gaming,not_removed,fallout and deus ex mankind divided as of recently im going to shell out the full price for titanfall as well and i know ill love that
gaming,not_removed,destiny forza horizon many othersthese were just the two that came to mind because i play them currently
gaming,not_removed,fallout i took a risk as im not really great at first person shooters but i love that game
gaming,not_removed,that i do not regret idk the ones i like i guess last of us batman red dead however i do regret spending on no mans sky though
gaming,not_removed,street fighter a lot of people do regret the purchaseor perhaps beleive full price was too much but for me i love it and have definitely got my moneys worth
gaming,not_removed,i dont remember what i paid for ffxiv along with the monthly sub but it has by far been my favorite game story graphics soundtrack gameplay customization is all there and in good quality really love the game
gaming,not_removed,super mario kart
gaming,not_removed,skyrim im still playing almost daily years later id say i got my moneys worth
gaming,not_removed,dishonored im at maximum hype for the new one this year
gaming,not_removed,nms only game i regret buying
gaming,not_removed,skyrim
gaming,not_removed,question should be what price would a game have to be to stop you from buying it especially if its a top seller
gaming,not_removed,castlevania lords of shadows any of them really theyre all very long games with great story with challenges and difficulty that just has me coming back
gaming,not_removed,red dead redemptionskyrimfallout vegasgta all versions and a few others battlefield series etc
gaming,not_removed,total war warhammer one of those games thats got that replay ability plusi realy cant get enough of watching thousands of men and monsters fight to the death for my amusement
gaming,not_removed,morrowind og xbox
gaming,not_removed,witcher and all of the dlc included
gaming,not_removed,portal skyrim battlefield middle earth shadow of mordor halo reach halo halo fallout destiny contraversial doom probably gunna spend on battlefield titanfall kingdom come deliverence the witcher game of the year edition skyrim special edition zelda breath of the wild
gaming,not_removed,black ops zombies can keep me entertained for years
gaming,not_removed,• the witcher • forza horizon • destiny
gaming,not_removed,battleborn and fallout dont hurt me fallout wasnt a bad game just wasnt the game i was expecting
gaming,not_removed,witcher and smash
gaming,not_removed,wow now that i think of it its been a long time since i paid full price for a game thanks to and steam sales last one i remember was battlefield on launch which i have now hours in so i dont really regret it
gaming,not_removed,i payed for uncharted and i dont regret it at all
gaming,not_removed,rocket league and i got it when ps had it for free all of that awesome content
gaming,not_removed,dito it just felt like a whole package it was decently optimized not very buggy lots of content fun to play and came with gta online bundled right into it
gaming,not_removed,im inclined to agree with this one its one of the only games i ever picked up at a midnight release played obsessively until i had
gaming,not_removed,this and all the souls games even at their low points i love em
gaming,not_removed,i just bought bloodborne for having never played a souls game before died excessively in the first area havent touched it in a week
gaming,not_removed,odd those are three games ive purchased that i was disappointed in for this gen got and witcher as soon as i got my early this year literally could not get into witcher at all despite being an rpg fanatic my entire life i got burned out on after about hours and i didnt even really get anywhere in the story it felt like they were trying to do to much and change too much so they kind of lost my enjoyment bloodborne i just picked up a couple weeks ago very cheap and cannot bring myself to keep playing
gaming,not_removed,ive bought every battlefield and while i dont have high hopes for one ill probably still buy it gotta keep that veteran status
gaming,not_removed,same here
gaming,not_removed,is xcom good i havent heard anything about it and really enjoyed playing the older ones
gaming,not_removed,honestly to me it was the worst fallout game at best i regard it as blah
gaming,not_removed,yeah that game was a giant money burn
gaming,not_removed,lol pretty sure thats the last game i got for too though i didnt get many hours from it started a job when it first came out never really got back into it ed i lied i got last xd almost forgot about that need to play it more got the pipboy edition and have barely touched it
gaming,not_removed,stop using
gaming,not_removed,i think you may have misunderstood the question
gaming,not_removed,its good once you get used to it basically once you beat your first boss fight it starts to open up and has some of the best exploration in any video game ive ever played that said dark souls is the place you should really start in the series personally i think it has the tightest story and level design and isnt quite as hard as bloodbornw my two cents though they probably arent for everyone and ill be honest im like through bloodborne and got so frustrated i set it aside for a few months
gaming,not_removed,cant really help you on and to me they are great games but to each their own right concerning bloodborne maybe the difficulty is the problem that is what i call a reward game what you feel when you finally take accomplish something or take down a boss is just unreal take your time dont rush learn the patterns
gaming,not_removed,curious but why low hopes for the beta felt like the most refreshing battlfield experience since bad company to me just curious on opinions of those less then enthused
gaming,not_removed,salutes
gaming,not_removed,yeah the first one and its expansions are solid pumped new life into the genre and was a good revamp to the franchise
gaming,not_removed,to be fair as much time as i put into rl and the amount of sheer joy from that game would be a bargain i missed the ps giveaway but even paying i felt like i was ripping off the devs the excitement of your first first hit goal your first epic save the stadiums the utter rage as xxxhitlerdidnothingwrongxxx comes flying upside down and hits it at an angle bouncing off different surfaces before beelining into your goal the music rocket league is the fucking best
gaming,not_removed,i was meaning even tho the game was free when i got it ive spent a ton of money on dlc for a free game not sure or not rl will be one of those games i continue to pour money into and woulda paid retail for the game worth every cent
gaming,not_removed,oh trust me i feel you im well accustomed to difficulty in video games grew up in the atari and nes era playing mega man and everything else theres just something so inherently frustrating about feeling like im gaining traction in bloodborne only to die and lose all my fucking experience that just saps my motivation i know that i can sit and grind for small bits of experience but i just dont feel like i have the time for it with a fulltime job and a three year old and four year old children haha im sure ill pick it up again but damn if it doesnt go out of its way to discourage you at every opportunity
gaming,not_removed,the beta was fun but i found myself going back to
gaming,not_removed,for me i feel like any not modern bf is somewhat of a step backwards because its naturally throttling gameplay variety for an ounce of historical accuracy you take away all the zany gadgets parachutes weapons and vehicles of and you simply have less stuff to play with my exact complaint with hardline as well obviously to a much worse degree
gaming,not_removed,this guy gets me i never even heard of this game until it dropped for free luckily for me that was the same week when my so and kids were out of town played the shit out of it for days on end screaming at the top of my lungs nothing gets you more hyped then that beautiful goal you accidentally made nice shot nice shot
gaming,not_removed,personally id go with over any day mostly because my graphics card couldnt pump out on ultra
gaming,not_removed,widescreen gaming is pretty nice im enjoying my budget pick lg immensely
gaming,not_removed,thank you also if a monitor has a displayport that means its freesync compatible correct
gaming,not_removed,i use the korean qnix monitor i have a triple screen set up
gaming,not_removed,i use the korean qnix monitor i have a triple screen set up
gaming,not_removed,consider widescreen like lg it has ips panel so quite good colors as opposed to tn it has freesync it has refresh rate of out of the box in case you are avid player of twitch shooters then probably go with full hd refresh tn panel unless you can burn money on versions
gaming,not_removed,depends what your using it for casual gaming with single player games get the competitive gaming get if your comp could run the games at
gaming,not_removed,that is not true at all if you want freesync make sure it is an explicitly freesync capable monitor
gaming,not_removed,glad i wasnt the only one to do this
gaming,not_removed,achievement unlocked curiosity killed the cat
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,you did the only logical thing
gaming,not_removed,you either get super powers or you die
gaming,not_removed,good i miss that stupid ways to kill yourself in modern games somewhere in cod this laser would be behind unbreakable glass
gaming,not_removed,to be fair op whoever hasnt done this hasnt truly been immersed in the game
gaming,not_removed,i would actually be more suprised if anyone didntt do that
gaming,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqmpfcrqzhce
gaming,not_removed,a test fire or do you want to watch yourself on camera fuck yourself
gaming,not_removed,i see green lasermist i presume its gonna heal me
gaming,not_removed,deadly fire do not eat
gaming,not_removed,you gotta risk it for that superpower biscuit
gaming,not_removed,ah just like in questionable ethics what could possibly go wrong if i shoot myself with a giant wallbreaking laser
gaming,not_removed,maybe something like in halflife a hole in the wall i did kill a possessed with it but no acheivement
gaming,not_removed,i was in game qa for years i feel compelled to do this sort of thing to see if it will really work whenever i come across a situation like that
gaming,not_removed,are those finger smudges on the touch screen if so thats an amazing attention to detail
gaming,not_removed,there was a bit like this in half life
gaming,not_removed,i thought it would turn me in to the hulk
gaming,not_removed,i did this
gaming,not_removed,you posted the name of the game you posted the link as a gifv you win rgaming
gaming,not_removed,welllllllllll that was genius
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,do they do the virtual darwin awards
gaming,not_removed,for science
gaming,not_removed,i think you can call it a successful test
gaming,not_removed,time that right and take out some fools
gaming,not_removed,it just shoots ya it doesnt make you breakfast at all
gaming,not_removed,video games letting us live out all the intrusive thoughts in our heads without real consequences
gaming,not_removed,you know they put it there with that delay specifically so you could do that to yourself dont worry it was intentional
gaming,not_removed,that glass console surface was perfect had the smudges the reflections looked great
gaming,not_removed,im stuck in this exact location i need a yellow key card to proceed and have no idea where it is any help would be very much appreciated
gaming,not_removed,whats funny is that even having seen this i guarantee ill still do the same thing when i come across it
gaming,not_removed,the dirt on the screen of that control unit mind blown
gaming,not_removed,reminds me of
gaming,not_removed,is it just me or does this look very similar to that level in halflife where you have to blow a hole in the wall with that laser
gaming,not_removed,did anyone not do this i mean i knew what would happen i did it anyway
gaming,not_removed,anyone who played the original halflife knows you always have to press every button and see what it does
gaming,not_removed,hahaha thats hilarious
gaming,not_removed,hl
gaming,not_removed,i looked everywhere for the button never found it damn i wanted to start that thing up
gaming,not_removed,i did this with absolute certainty that i would get an achievement for it i didnt
gaming,not_removed,this is the doom equivalent of quicksaving and jumping into the forge in fallout
gaming,not_removed,i did the same thing xd
gaming,not_removed,you know theyre tracking the number of people who do this in the game and will eventually put it in a fancy thank you post with big numbers
gaming,not_removed,hulk
gaming,not_removed,thats just step one to becoming hulk
gaming,not_removed,this is one of the best parts of video games i was in the iron forge building in fallout and saw that huge pot of molten iron and immediately knew i had to test how real the game was i died
gaming,not_removed,i would have tried that too its just a given haha
gaming,not_removed,lmao i did it too
gaming,not_removed,i do stuff like this hoping for achievementstrophies i was sad it didnt trigger one bronze play stupid games
gaming,not_removed,that it might be just a scripted event with no consequences
gaming,not_removed,i know i expected a fps gif guess not
gaming,not_removed,god that frame rate man if youre gonna post something like this at least so us all a favor and turn down the graphics or something
gaming,not_removed,are you on console
gaming,not_removed,when i did this the first thing to come to mind is the poor sap who got this far on ultra nightmare and did this in hopes that it would transport him somewhere or give him some sort of power up i know you exist where are you come and tell us about it
gaming,not_removed,so choppy must be playing on a pc
gaming,not_removed,me neither i actually couldnt figure the right way out initially and thought maybe it would transport me or something nope
gaming,not_removed,there are screens on each side to activate this they make the gun do different things so i ended up doing this twice
gaming,not_removed,after respawn and satisfaction brought him back
gaming,not_removed,pulls lever again achievement unlocked still have seven lives
gaming,not_removed,so what youre saying is im a scientist
gaming,not_removed,when i was younger like or so and i saw a orange cone on the sidewalk in chicago not on the street but just sitting in the middle of the sidewalk i thought for what ever reason to kick it so while walking i kick it midstride and my leg just doesnt find land and it goes into a pretty deep hole and my first thought was so thats why thats therei was not the brightest back then
gaming,not_removed,simpsons did it a lot
gaming,not_removed,for science
gaming,not_removed,somewhere in cod this laser would be behind unbreakable glass you cant seriously be criticizing game devs for not taking extra time to make a usable prop that does nothing useful
gaming,not_removed,i killed demons with it assumed it would also kill me i did not do that
gaming,not_removed,why would you stand in front of a laser what did you think was gonna happen
gaming,not_removed,completed the game never did this
gaming,not_removed,dead dove do not eat
gaming,not_removed,its the lab where they made the bfg the bfg always fired green orbs
gaming,not_removed,wwi might want to have a word with you
gaming,not_removed,i did the same i was really hoping it would be an achievement
gaming,not_removed,relevant just took this picture today standing in the huge fire in jorvaskr
gaming,not_removed,i had the half life thought as well okay how do i get this to fire through the wall you dont thats how
gaming,not_removed,rretiredvideos
gaming,not_removed,you need identification to get into the lab your biometrics arent on file however buuut perhaps theres someone else that is somewhere
gaming,not_removed,no not the feels
gaming,not_removed,who cares
gaming,not_removed,it also took me a really really long time to figure out how to progress in this part of the game
gaming,not_removed,for one split second i thought my suit would absorb it and i get a new power
gaming,not_removed,not like the button says test fire or anything
gaming,not_removed,thank god someone did i really wanted to do it but i kept thinking i would die well atleast i was right
gaming,not_removed,really guess i know how im dying today
gaming,not_removed,not until you write the results down
gaming,not_removed,in the name of science ahem
gaming,not_removed,you cant seriously be criticizing game players for wanting to take extra time to play with random usable props
gaming,not_removed,no but it does add a little something to the game that lets know that the devs want you to explore
gaming,not_removed,maybe the publisher for not giving the devs enough time to put in some fun stuff
gaming,not_removed,useful
gaming,not_removed,i can
gaming,not_removed,same here its the same logic just you know a safer one
gaming,not_removed,for science
gaming,not_removed,i got lost at that point and thought it might do something
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,good thing i wasnt alive back then
gaming,not_removed,i think most of what was used was either white or yellow
gaming,not_removed,and with battlefiend right around the corner
gaming,not_removed,you need a popup to praise you for doing something interesting
gaming,not_removed,i think hes joking about the extremely choppy frame rate in this gif
gaming,not_removed,i no scoped with it
gaming,not_removed,that should have been worth an achievement
gaming,not_removed,enemies stumbling into hazards so you dont have to
gaming,not_removed,i killed myself with it
gaming,not_removed,rthathappened
gaming,not_removed,im still stuck on this part
gaming,not_removed,ya i almost restarted it i thought it glitched or something i was so frustrated
gaming,not_removed,thanks adam savage
gaming,not_removed,communicate them somehow yeah so op is the real scientist here
gaming,not_removed,your comment doesnt make any sense none whatsoever i said nothing positive or negative about consumers playing with usable props when they are available not a single thing he commented that cod devs would build the item and put it behind glass not make it functional and it was obviously supposed to be a knock against devs that do this my point was that it takes work to make stuff like this there is nothing wrong with devs making a prop that has no function especially if it has no bearing on the story edit why is this being marked as offtopic tell me where i said anything about players and what they do with their time
gaming,not_removed,its pretty easy to just tell someone else to put more of their own money into an investment isnt it a game has to come out at some point a game has to have a deadline there has to be a point where there is enough for devs to say its gold they could keep developing and adding content until the end of time but that isnt going to give publishers a return on their money or consumers the chance to play it its great when games have side interactions and details like this but not every single one needs it and they can still be fun without a ton of random side activities
gaming,not_removed,ive seen this a million times but still dont know what the story behind this gif is show is
gaming,not_removed,lets just say if you were you wouldnt be anymore
gaming,not_removed,fyi
gaming,not_removed,it helps with the crippling depression
gaming,not_removed,shouldnt it be no scoped
gaming,not_removed,that has got to be the stupidest posting of that link i have ever seen its a video game mate the room was full of demons its not like its some overly complicated incredible feat
gaming,not_removed,you need a dudes body to drag over to the retinal scanner but hes kind of hard to see and even knowing that i needed him it took me a long time just keep searching the attached rooms hes one of the corpses
gaming,not_removed,youre not wrong you just made the most boring comment board the circle jerk train instead
gaming,not_removed,my point was simply that useable props are fun to play with meaning that they have a function
gaming,not_removed,that bag had a note on it that said dead dove do not eat the man in the gif proceeded to open it and be surprised by the straightforward nature of the note i highly suggest the source show arrested development as it is one of the best comedy shows ever
gaming,not_removed,pretty much regardless yeah
gaming,not_removed,not true year old lady died recently born she was married with kids in the first world war picture that
gaming,not_removed,huh til i guess i never thought about what color chlorine gas was since most depictions are either white or yellow
gaming,not_removed,only if youre a noob
gaming,not_removed,no
gaming,not_removed,didnt your mother ever tell you its rude to point
gaming,not_removed,i literally have no idea why i posted that to this thread
gaming,not_removed,i hate those money loving investorspublishers kojima should have an infinite amount of time and resources cod is literally the same thing every year and needs to go away even though i dont buy it devs should never delay games but i still expect an infinite amount of content that runs extremely smoothly better am i rcircl rgaming material now
gaming,not_removed,you didnt eat that dove did you cause i only have a couple days left to return it
gaming,not_removed,not if he finds that healing mist
gaming,not_removed,to be fair it is a yellowy green but as you can see they didnt just use chlorine in other words you were wrong but for the right reason
gaming,not_removed,no
gaming,not_removed,they learn so fast
gaming,not_removed,woo my favorite kind of being wrong p
gaming,not_removed,your webcam is looking at you very suspiciously
gaming,not_removed,oh god he was framed and then hanged what did you do
gaming,not_removed,this made me realize that gengar goes from white eyes and red mouth to red eyes and white mouth teeth p
gaming,not_removed,thats awesome
gaming,not_removed,mega gengar
gaming,not_removed,canada dry excellent choice of beverage
gaming,not_removed,didnt you have to trade it with someone for the gengar
gaming,not_removed,is there a link to that art definitely need it for my phone
gaming,not_removed,bigger make it bigger really big
gaming,not_removed,your mismatched monitors bother me to no end
gaming,not_removed,not that op is taking credit but they definitely did not make this ive seen this posted before on the sub
gaming,not_removed,good im not the only one who saw that
gaming,not_removed,httpsyoutubektcoozdjqs
gaming,not_removed,yeah hes a spooky son of a bitch thats why hes my favorite pokemon spooky but goofy as all hell
gaming,not_removed,yeah gengar is a trade evolution
gaming,not_removed,ditto
gaming,not_removed,also would like to know
gaming,not_removed,im guessing op brought it off of for about
gaming,not_removed,seems like glados has taken over his computer
gaming,not_removed,not to mention his grin almost never goes away
gaming,not_removed,gengar my favorite too for the same reasoning as yours
gaming,not_removed,thank you
gaming,not_removed,only changes in intent it goes from im gonna fuck with you but we will all laugh afterward to i will turn you into me
gaming,not_removed,p
gaming,not_removed,because waiting until a certain time irl would be a pain in the ass to start spefic missions that are only available at certain times i dont think anyone would like to wake up at am to do just one specific random encounter and theyd most likely be busy with workschoolpersonal buisness for most missions
gaming,not_removed,because it wasnt coded to do that
gaming,not_removed,they can always change the internal time thats the case in pokemon too
gaming,not_removed,but pokemon
gaming,not_removed,but no one wants to do that
gaming,not_removed,who reason to implement it if you expect that people will find a workaround
gaming,not_removed,thats honestly a murky subject to begin with there are publishers that own publishers
gaming,not_removed,this information is readily available on wikipedia from there sony tencent league of legends among other things microsoft nintendo activisionblizzard ea bandai namco king nexon mostly asian rpgsmmos and running asian servers for american games ubisoft
gaming,not_removed,just check wikipedia
gaming,not_removed,can you give me an example because sometimes video games feel generic example all ubi games feel the same all ea games feel the same all activ games look the same
gaming,not_removed,all activ games look the same keep in mind as of httpsenwikipediaorgwikiactivisionblizzard since their merger so with them comes the warcraft starcraft and diablo franchises along with overwatchand the billions of dollars that comes with i would actually be surprised if theres a more lucrative studio than activisionblizzard hell activision have owned like half the game studios to ever exist
gaming,not_removed,ea and activision games are actually fairly diverse simply because of the sheer number of different studios they own
gaming,not_removed,didnt blizz by back the right to sell out their soul a few years ago
gaming,not_removed,nope blizzard entertainment themselves still fall under activisionblizzard the blizzard crew thoroughly hold their own though since it was a mutual merger and not a takeover or acquisition or some such blizzards franchises are fucking huge even if it werent balanced between the two theyre still responsible for a huge amount of that income the only thing i remember reading people speculating about was that it was the suits at activisionblizzard that were putting pressure on blizzard to smash out the oneyear expansions or whatever the fuck they were thinking in wow but nobody can say if thats actually true either way blizz recently acknowledged that they now know that wasnt feasible and basically said our bad and the playerbase really let them know that they failed with the warlords of draenor expansion
gaming,not_removed,and new vegas are better
gaming,not_removed,start with the original and the sequel fallout and are still the best games in the series followed by new vegas
gaming,not_removed,to answer the question you asked which isnt about is it better than the prequels yes its an ok starting point you dont need to know about the previous games in order to play this one
gaming,not_removed,it is a very good starting point as gamplay goes it is really easy to get into but it kinda lost its fallout feel i would suggest new vegas its gameplay mechanics may be a little weird for a newcomer but its hands down the most falloutish game from the ones
gaming,not_removed,yeah i loved fallout was never really into the previous ones myself but this one was more like skyrim in a post apocalypse type setting
gaming,not_removed,if you want to play old games on old systems by all means play the previous fallout games they each have different stories following different people in different geographic regions of the usa the only thing they each share is the settinglore well fallout are linked but those are ancient history from years ago buy fallout and enjoy it is a great game and the setting is a real joy to play in expect more fallout games in the years to come
gaming,not_removed,its fine the connection between the games is pretty insignificant and most of it is little more than easter eggs for fans personally id suggest picking up the first games if youre a fan of old school isometric rpgs and have any type of pc but really any fallout game is pretty much stand alone
gaming,not_removed,if you want a shooter sure go ahaid if you want a good fallout game play new vegas
gaming,not_removed,thank you everyone i went and got it cause i had free gamestop credit so i hope its good
gaming,not_removed,i hate this game bought if for xbox and turns out it has the perfect combination of field of view and head bobbing to give me motion sickness and they dont even give you the option to disable it
gaming,not_removed,fallout is the best
gaming,not_removed,was my favorite
gaming,not_removed,i started with new vegas by chance and i completely agree here
gaming,not_removed,welcome to gaming get downvoted for opinions i didnt like it that much myself preferred a little overcomplicated new vegas that wasnt even that complicated but the shooting in is soooo much better but lower weapon choice is kinda offputting
gaming,not_removed,did you try going into third person
gaming,not_removed,yes i did and obviously it fixes the problem but the game wasnt designed as a person so it just doesnt work too many issues id never spent more than on a game and not finished it until this one
gaming,not_removed,he got reqd
gaming,not_removed,super game
gaming,not_removed,i was hoping this could be deja vu worthy
gaming,not_removed,nice attack all over again
gaming,not_removed,i did that once the enemy driver just kept tooling around and let me shoot his friends it went on for like five minutes
gaming,not_removed,lmfao insane play love how he just ejects the blue and continues to kill others without even looking back
gaming,not_removed,posted this on rhalo and its gotten a lot of good attention thought id post it here too full clip
gaming,not_removed,man this game looks like shit
gaming,not_removed,you could say he was the guardian of the garage
gaming,not_removed,you judged that off of a second clip
gaming,not_removed,would you like to maybe defend your point i mean ive actually played it and i thought it was very enjoyable but if you actually have solid grounds for saying it looks like shit id love to hear your side of things
gaming,not_removed,you assume ive never played the game the visuals in multiplayer are total fucking trash its an insult to the community and before you start circle jerking its no secret that this is the least popular halo game to date with a tiny player population you can start circle jerking now i know youre going to
gaming,not_removed,really if anything games have gotten too easy recently with handholding and linear objectives im actually having to start turning the difficulty up to hard on some games
gaming,not_removed,video games are too easy nowadays its boring
gaming,not_removed,they are getting too hard go and try to play the original supermario brothers on the nes without savestates or warp pipes if you go gameover anywhere in the game youll have to start over at that was hard or the old metroid or the old mega man these games were hard recent games are so much easier with the checkpoints spammed all over the place so it gets nearly impossible to loseto not see the end
gaming,not_removed,games are so damn easy its a joke the only game to come close to being hard more frustrating actually was dark souls edit i immediately go to the hardest difficulty and laugh at how dumbed down it is thankfully mods exist to make it harder
gaming,not_removed,this so much but dont let anyone judge you for not being into gaming anymore i feel it too i just dont want to play as much as i did years ago it happens man just gotta get out and doing stuff more is all literally any other thing you can think to do
gaming,not_removed,the older you get i think its just harder to be immersed by games and so many are geared towards online play that the single player is almost an after thought still some gems out there
gaming,not_removed,it goes both ways though im an older gamer and for better or for worse i like being a gamer right now if right now this is what i want to do and i am satisfied doing it is that so bad idk most of my friends are or were gamers it kind of sucks to see someone go from being cool to play with to bagging it out as if its just a stage to pass through edit im always interested though to hear about the desire to play waning i think if its really how you feel then the natural thing to do is go with it gaming is not the kind of thing to force i can see how someone would be torn between the one and the other though and that to me sounds like the worst part of it wanting to get the same feeling but not being able to get it i think the reason im still playing is that i pretty much just play league of legends or multiplayer games with friends for me the social aspects and shared experience is what i go back for
gaming,not_removed,thats true too
gaming,not_removed,i feel you on the social thing idk what it is i do feel torn a lot and every time i get a new game i go through this honeymoon period where i nolife the shit but once that passes im not sure why but the compulsion to load up literally anything just doesnt personally appeal to me the way it used to as for your own gaming habits go as hard as you like bro i wont ever judge anyone for it given my own tendency to put in hour gaming session when i do sit down to play im myself and i doubt ill ever fully give it up
gaming,not_removed,park souls horse but hole
gaming,not_removed,why did you wait so long to post this
gaming,not_removed,httpimgurcomjbhlppt
gaming,not_removed,can you explain a little further was this something handheld or mains connected did it drive a display was it a monochrome display or color or did it have its own screen or was there no visual element to this at all was the device black or white plastic or fake wood styled was it in a single unit or was there a master unit and a controller on a cable was there a single controller or multiple was there only buttons or more what year roughly was this early mid late somewhere in the perhaps answer what you can i love a good challenge
gaming,not_removed,rtipofmyjoystick
gaming,not_removed,there was no visual element at all it was completely audio based it was made of plastic and it was blue just one device with no controller there were buttons no more and no less i have no idea what year this came out in i was born in so i doubt its very old oh and it was handheld
gaming,not_removed,wow that is obscure as all hell ill try more questions so just to confirm absolutely no screen whatsoever sounds odd for the year but okay i am assuming you heard via an internal speaker or was it headphone operated what country was this likely purchased this is fun
gaming,not_removed,there was no screen imagine youre holding it in your hand yous slide a cartridge in from the top the image on that cartridge is the only visual youd press a small button to turn it on and the device would tell you to refer to the card of the card decklike playing cards that comes with the cartridge no headphones its an internal speaker youd read whats on the card and at the bottom itd give you some options each option had a combination of buttons that went with it pushing those buttons on the device would indicate you made that choice the game would play some audio and then tell you which card to go to next so in short no screen internal speaker and i got it in the usa as im from the usa
gaming,not_removed,okay i think i got it wow that was hard tangled tales starter punch that into google images am i right
gaming,not_removed,the winning google search term for me ended up being chronicle handheld audio game card deck in google images and about half a page down there it was the only image matching your description
gaming,not_removed,thats exactly it i dont know how you found it but thats it
gaming,not_removed,you can still buy them on ebay bit expensive lol
gaming,not_removed,idk where i got chronicle from guess its been a while
gaming,not_removed,i think one of the games is actually called chronicles it appears
gaming,not_removed,what do i win d
gaming,not_removed,you win the satisfaction of being right the opportunity to know about a great fucking kids toy
gaming,not_removed,hah awesome actually it looks kinda cool i wouldnt mind having a play of it ingenious the way they did it to get away with no screen though i would have expected with technology like that to have been much older than it was most of my searches were for and even toys until you clarified in my experience everything since the gameboy had a screen s how wrong i was
gaming,not_removed,reading a bit about it looks like it wasnt very popular looking on ebay it costs but someone on another website has it advertised as rare and is trying to get for it ha
gaming,not_removed,oh my first ebay hit here was over o
gaming,not_removed,op might want to resubmit it through imgur instead
gaming,not_removed,most of it is printed i did not make the model
gaming,not_removed,this is what happens when software engineers get bored
gaming,not_removed,after years he is making games within games and i didnt even get to own the game after years feelsbad
gaming,not_removed,ok im not sure what to think am i supposed to be impressed is the screen on his minecraft gameboy animated using nothing but blocks and hydraulics etc or did he hack the game to put pokemon onto that gameboy if its the later then meh
gaming,not_removed,idk man id probably start by reading the article
gaming,not_removed,what are your systems specs
gaming,not_removed,thats outdated weak hardwer man you should update it s
gaming,not_removed,i dont think ive ever played a better tactical game than heavily modded jagged alliance even xcom seems shallow when you compare the two
gaming,not_removed,homm or xcomeu are pretty great
gaming,not_removed,has always been my happy place game the mod was great but i cant find a version that works on steam any recommendations for good mods
gaming,not_removed,that whole stat setup was pointless
gaming,not_removed,seriously though it was completely pointless and the player creation could have been a lot better
gaming,not_removed,thats not irony irony is assassins creed
gaming,not_removed,i had more fun on division than wildlands and i find division to be very boring
gaming,not_removed,wild lands hurt my eyes for some reason kinda gave me a migraine
gaming,not_removed,i spent more time downloading it than playing it
gaming,not_removed,too much driving and waiting for everyone to get to the objective
gaming,not_removed,the driving and flying controls were so bad i found myself running everywhere
gaming,not_removed,had bren looking for a sudoku app found one that required the ability send receive calltext activate mic and camera and access contact info yeah soooo downloading that
gaming,not_removed,welcome to the clock app we just need your name email address contacts permission to read your messages your blood type your browsing history sending out smss on your behalf power of attorney and your eternal soul
gaming,not_removed,go to sleep and charge your phone
gaming,not_removed,all the legion companion app demands of you is the same price wow does your every waking moment of attention
gaming,not_removed,you should also look at permission details just that none show up there does not mean no permissions are requested that view shows a userfriendly version but does not give the full list that said the legion app is very minimal its nice to see an app only requesting what it needs
gaming,not_removed,thats because blizzard already knows how you live your life
gaming,not_removed,able to send and revive phone calls camera access access to all files able to send and receive txt messages humm i dont think i want this ringtone any more
gaming,not_removed,easy blizz has all information about you already
gaming,not_removed,how can you data mine to sell information if you have no permissions
gaming,not_removed,i actually laughed really loud when i went to download telegram on request from my friend it wanted access to virtually everything on my phone plus required me to disable my phones default vanilla security settings how the fuck is it allowed on the google play store
gaming,not_removed,i dont mind giving too many permissions but what the hell is the poop cam and why does my flashlight app need permission for it
gaming,not_removed,hey mom why does an app that takes pictures makes phone calls and accesses my hard drive need permission to use my camera and microphone they obviously want to spy on you shit omg big brother
gaming,not_removed,it depends on what you mean by utility app for example my roommate works for a company that created a video ringtone app for android it requires some fishy permissions but all it does is plays cat videos when your phone rings
gaming,not_removed,itt people who either know how perms work or people who access denied depending on version of android
gaming,not_removed,how about weather
gaming,not_removed,srsly
gaming,not_removed,do you people not know what permissions do for instance caller id and contact permissions just lets apps knew when youre getting called if the app is open
gaming,not_removed,idk if this makes it better or worse but when developing for android the permissions are usually set to be requested by default so i think if developers dont need special permissions they dont even turn any off
gaming,not_removed,define utility app the utility apps i use require many permissions but then again im a super user so i might be in a minority here
gaming,not_removed,in nougat maybe marshmallow too dont remember you can disable app permissions after installing them even if they werent compiled to support the new permission model where apps only request permissions when they need them this can cause apps to crash or otherwise fail but half the time it works fine for me
gaming,not_removed,although the activate mic is weird in old versions of android you needed the calling permission to detect when a phone call came in the newer android versions just do this by default and allow you to remove permissions at whim so the more is sort by recent when looking for apps
gaming,not_removed,yeah this is the problem i had with the sailor moon drops game i know they say it doesnt actually use those permissions but i dont understand why it needs them
gaming,not_removed,dont forget the first born
gaming,not_removed,havent you played any mmo in your life going bed after midnight is part of adventure
gaming,not_removed,but theyre
gaming,not_removed,i use this app and able to receive all kinds of notifications and calls the only thing that annoys me is it pauses spotify when i open it
gaming,not_removed,all of what youre talking about is no longer true in newer versions of android marshmallow and nougat also allow you to manually disable permissions such as access to contacts and microphone
gaming,not_removed,ive never encountered any of the problems you have listed and i have been using android since gingerbread
gaming,not_removed,cool so you wont be able to see incoming texts or phone calls or really any other popups while that app is open in old android versions thatd be true newer versions have that ability built in and do not require apps to have permissions for those
gaming,not_removed,i dont think thats exactly true i have a pokemon app that requires no permissions and ive received calls and texts and notifications etc while using it no problem so i dont know what youre talking about
gaming,not_removed,yeah i was going to comment this without those permissions whenever you went on that app it will be only thing your phone can do
gaming,not_removed,doesnt telegram have buttons for sms and phone just like the default sms app itll require those permissions then that will also explain camera and microphone for mms i know theyre not using those protocols but you know what i mean if it asked for access to storage it would be to send pictures already stored on your phone the one thing im not understanding is the security settings what did it make you change i got tired of waiting so i just went and looked at their requested permissions in the play store and i dont see anything you wouldnt ask for in a featurerich messenger replacement to be honest you want features but you dont want permissions youre gonna be in for a world of featureless apps
gaming,not_removed,wait so if you dont give an app access to your contacts you are telling me that if someone calls you the phone wont even notify you why in gods name should that have anything to do with the app that sounds like weapons grade stupidity
gaming,not_removed,yeah it was a while back but some apps such as for example facebook refuse to allow you access if you take off alot of permissions even if youre not using them i removed contacts camera mic and while it technically worked i couldnt even read a full status between it asking for more permissions
gaming,not_removed,marshmallow is when it was introduced
gaming,not_removed,the new permission system is really nice but what isnt so nice is that apps still want to work around it and deny you access if you disable some permissions kakaotalk did this some others have been documented to do it as well
gaming,not_removed,i didnt know you could sort
gaming,not_removed,can we have access to this we wont use it at any point but we want to be able to sound logic
gaming,not_removed,going bed after midnight is part of adventure or just my daily routine
gaming,not_removed,underratted comment right here i want my years back blizzard
gaming,not_removed,its not so much the popups he mentions but if the app say needs to pause your game while a call is coming in it has a few permissions already just none deemed special
gaming,not_removed,which is installed on a grand total of of phones combined
gaming,not_removed,why does an app need to be able to make a call for you to make a call when using the app are mobile operating systems not multitasking
gaming,not_removed,reminds me when i used to have an app in the google play store and people would leave me negative reviews about how it was slow eg they were uploading photos to facebook if you want to upload faster do it over wifi or get data dont blame me because you are on thats just commonsense it had speedy in the name but people just assumed it had some sort of magic power over bandwidth it was called that because it was quick and easy to post with
gaming,not_removed,just downloaded telegram again my phone flags it as a security alert and will not open it unless i whitelist it edit oh cool its free without any fees or ads and its claiming to be the fastest messaging app in the world thats not sketchy
gaming,not_removed,no see in lots of games the game will pause if you get a call things like that but not if you dont grant that permission
gaming,not_removed,googles lack of fine grained permissions andor a party analyticsad library can lead to stuff like this
gaming,not_removed,i use fb through web browser on my phone the app wrecks my phone battery probably surveillance for the nsa
gaming,not_removed,meirl
gaming,not_removed,it doesnt need access to make calls it needs access to it so its allowed to bring up phone calls if you receive one during using the app
gaming,not_removed,sounds like you needed a new name for your app if many people were making that connection
gaming,not_removed,developer often have this thing called logica lot of people dont
gaming,not_removed,your phone flags one of the most well known and trusted secure messaging apps on the market as a security risk interesting i wonder what kind of unnecessary security software youre running
gaming,not_removed,why does the app need to bring up the call why cant the phone
gaming,not_removed,like i said the default vanilla security options that you can play with in your settings app
gaming,not_removed,which ones specifically just did an install on a nexus note and galaxy tab without issue youre being extremely ambiguous edit for the hell of it i just tried a coolpad rogue as wellno issue edit i realize i forgot to mention it earlier but in regards to your questioning the legitimacy of the developers because you couldnt google their business model telegram was founded by some very security conscious people concerned with the state of privacy its currently running off a very generous endowment from pavel durov an entrepreneur who shares their feelings and works with the developers httpsenmwikipediaorgwikipaveldurov
gaming,not_removed,sounds like the game just isnt for you theres nothing wrong with that everyone has different tastes
gaming,not_removed,it happens when you get too much hyped for something
gaming,not_removed,i found it incredibly boring so youre not alone
gaming,not_removed,i feel you ive actually been an avid naughty dog fan since crash bandicoot and jak and daxter when last of us came out i was excited but put it off until the version came out i didnt hate it but felt it was ok with a good story but i agree the gameplay was boring stealth wasnt that great but it did the job the story kept me playing to the end tho
gaming,not_removed,stealth is really meant to be your primary goto tactic with the exception of a few parts where shooting is kind of necessary
gaming,not_removed,if your just looking to watch the game i suggest watchin ga lets play had the same thing for me
gaming,not_removed,youre not missing anything the writing and setting are really engaging but mechanically the game is a really generic person arena cover shooter with a light dusting of stealth mechanics i couldnt get into it either and ended up watching a play through as a result
gaming,not_removed,it happens i absolutely hate the uncharted games but understand that most people love them the last of us is one of my top games however
gaming,not_removed,thanks it checked all my boxes before playing but it just plays so clunky
gaming,not_removed,its just oh shit a bunch of militant enemies oh shit a bunch of zombies oh shit a bunch of militant enemies oh shit a bunch of zombies rinse and repeat i feel like uncharted games are the same except sub out zombies with some boring climbing
gaming,not_removed,as the game says early on clickerrunner first encounter tried stealthing upwards of ten times nothing finally stealthed one blasted clicker and hand pummeled one runner at time while the others stood idly by exact same leaving museum with human enemies
gaming,not_removed,maybe ill try that thanks
gaming,not_removed,i totally get it i thought the story was fantastic but didnt love playing it either call me crazy but i prefer tomb raider over uncharted as well
gaming,not_removed,that actually looks incredibly boring and slow compared to todays games dont get me wrong i remember playing that map but whats the fun in standing still or in a small area while aiming down sites and sometimes hip firing
gaming,not_removed,dude stop branching to random subreddits and spraying uneducated shit out of your mouth
gaming,not_removed,wow thats convinced me that im wrong
gaming,not_removed,thats right you stupid cuck
gaming,not_removed,how did you fix the problem
gaming,not_removed,i havent and a week later it still hasnt worked im left to assume my internet has some bs firewall i dont know about but thats pure speculation at this point i put money down on a game that wont work ill have the opportunity to use a different internet cause im moving so if it doesnt work after that then im going straight to xbox support or ubisoft support
gaming,not_removed,gifs and images dont do the game justice especially on pro in with hdr enabled its gorgeous
gaming,not_removed,far cry solely because of the skrillex and damien marley song when you burn that field of mary jane
gaming,not_removed,radiant silvergun written by the same person who did original ff tactics i mean listen httpsyoutubezxrfdejohza
gaming,not_removed,kingdom hearts

gaming,not_removed,lmao that part was pretty great
gaming,not_removed,that does sound pretty good im a guy who usually pairs music experience though so its at a disadvantage if i havent played the game lol

gaming,not_removed,is it too hard to link to the original creator
gaming,not_removed,and whats chalk canyon without the big jump httpsapomfcatkjrnmwwebm
gaming,not_removed,monster contracts earn you a decent amount of crowns
gaming,not_removed,the free dlc for the armour has to be bought from a certain merchant to make coins go to all the question marks on your map loot as much as you can and sell them on contracts are also great for getting the dosh good luck on the path
gaming,not_removed,sell armour to armourers and weapons to smiths for the best prices
gaming,not_removed,you can make coin by selling stuff you loot throughout the world or by looting coin straight up you can also do witcher contracts
gaming,not_removed,obviously you want to be looking out for better weapons and armour but for other random alchemical and crafting type stuff at the start of the game id just take it all the great thing is they have no weight and so you arent restricted in what you take its always good to have a stockpile because you will need parts to craft new weapons and armour green armour is witcher gear and its damn good youll want to find the diagrams for them eventually and also to make oils bomb potions etc which all give you extra buffs when fighting a certain type of monster which youll do a lot for the contracts top tip always consult the beastiary it will save your ass
gaming,not_removed,dont succumb to the looteverything mentality and get weighed down with brooms cups and grandmas dirty linens if it has silver gold or jewels in it you can get some decent money
gaming,not_removed,should have gotten the seahawk version d

gaming,not_removed,must have been the shadow play
gaming,not_removed,more visibility is never bad is it evga cards are recommended left and right here many people might have them even if theyre not nvidia enthusiasts
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,what the chips werent even the issue with the note
gaming,not_removed,true hardware failure happens sooner or later but when a card happens to be defective hopefully the manufacturer will cover it
gaming,not_removed,no reason to not use evga precision and keep the fans pushing at or higher at all times
gaming,not_removed,noise i dont want a freaking turbine next to me while im sitting at my pc watching netflix or browsing the web
gaming,not_removed,i get what you are saying but modern pc cases do an ok job of dampening fan noise plus they sell padding that you can apply to your case that will reduce noise as well meh ill take the extra noise to assure that the gpu i spent a lot of my hard earned money on will stay cool at all times

gaming,not_removed,assassins creed some companies cant develop a decent game within years i dont know where ubisoft get the balls to do one every year since assasins creed the gameplay hasnt thrilled me the environments in black flag where incredible and the voice acting is usually good unfortunately the missions become repetitive and since the mechanics seem more slugish i thought was building on the platforming of which was building from it seems like the free running mechanic since is different and not as fluid i suspect the developers lost previous code and had to rebuild it or something
gaming,not_removed,devil may cry the original was great as a stand alone game the rest just got progressively worse and worse
gaming,not_removed,watch dogs luckily the sequel was good but you cant deny that first game really didnt deserve it
gaming,not_removed,final fantasy xiii trilogy
gaming,not_removed,generals
gaming,not_removed,this
gaming,not_removed,can you even count that series as a sequel its more like volumes in other terms but i agree they should have done different wars instead of the fantasy crap theyve come up with ive yet to see a vietnam game thats actually any good
gaming,not_removed,dmc was okay i only played that one and four four was horrible and they keep trying to sell hd remakes
gaming,not_removed,one was the best but three is a great game
gaming,not_removed,xiii japanese would disagree with you on that
gaming,not_removed,well it looks like ass its almost cut different ways and the colors are all over the place looks like brass honestly worst way to spend
gaming,not_removed,aed ahha thats what arabian do
gaming,not_removed,it may have a pricetag of usd but it is absolutely not worth that much there probably isnt even that much gold in it i doubt thats even approaching gold content in the plated alloy i bet its a lot closer to gold content if that
gaming,not_removed,the plastic nubs came off the sticks of my first controller within months this looks like itd take less than a week
gaming,not_removed,games were developed to play and enjoy gold plated body can not improve skills and processing speed and even graphics
gaming,not_removed,and they always said console gaming is cheaper
gaming,not_removed,although really wouldnt a large amount of wealth explain all the free time necessary to be the best at video games wait doesnt being the best at video games result in monetary rewards i guess only in competition either way this is totally unnecessary and subversive to the plight of the enslaved proletariat
gaming,not_removed,doesnt even look like gold
gaming,not_removed,saw this in mall of the emirates dubai all i could think was what somebody who owned this would do once the gold came out
gaming,not_removed,dubai airport
gaming,not_removed,anyway it looks amazing d
gaming,not_removed,and then there are pcs worth
gaming,not_removed,i bet
gaming,not_removed,does not look aesthetically at all and why this giorgio armani and fake gucci logo looks like it was designed by a small child
gaming,not_removed,doesnt even look like gold not sure if its my screen or the picture itself but it looks like a really polished copper or bronze and it looks like pure shit too
gaming,not_removed,spend on ultra nice liquid cooled titan equipped led loaded gaming pc profit 👌
gaming,not_removed,id do
gaming,not_removed,im also jealous
gaming,not_removed,i dont think they did
gaming,not_removed,say what now
gaming,not_removed,i have a buddy who specializes in gold plated playstations he just called and said its worth best i can do is its going to sit on the shelf and honestly i might make off it after taxes
gaming,not_removed,its not even a pro
gaming,not_removed,ill give you and rice cakes
gaming,not_removed,there are tons of great games sounds like you only play games made by shitty devs and then make a blanket statement about all games
gaming,not_removed,sounds like youre buying from the wrong companies or you like the games advertised as the new best ever now with nazi zombies i dont mind giving dlc money to companies like bethesda gearbox cd project red as they produce full games to begin with skyrimfallout dishonored borderlands witcher
gaming,not_removed,its a bit funny when you think of it everyone hates dlc but they dont realize that because of dlc we arent getting charge per game basically dlc is catching the video game industry up with inflation
gaming,not_removed,dlc isnt always a bad thing some companies for the most part have handled it well for example a good number of people enjoy the witcher dlc perhaps you should find something different to like in the newer games since they arent trying to be exact copies of what youve played growing up understand that things do change
gaming,not_removed,because gaming totally consists of aaa games only
gaming,not_removed,companies who release dlc well bethesda to name one rockstar pregta v to name another are the exception to this i really hate the day one season passes the content that should be in the game the pay for some in game currency thing and all the other microtransactions companies are putting in now
gaming,not_removed,i think your current mentality is causing you to overlook certain games and even games that do seem to be more dlc focused ive had tons of fun with games from this generation with and without dlc
gaming,not_removed,can you give some example of specific games
gaming,not_removed,i greatly enjoy new games but i also love going back to old games and replaying them if you are done with modern gaming there are plenty of older games for you to revisit and get enjoyment from for years to come best of luck to you
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,stop flocking to aaa devs they just want your money and produce highly polished turds that look good play like shit and are ridden with bugs years and years after release because they do not care they have your money already
gaming,not_removed,dont play shit games
gaming,not_removed,i know what you mean battlefront and the newest dragonball games are disappointments however i can only insist that there are other types of games that stay away from pumping their fans for money for example witcher or how i learned to love dlc seriously i just started the blood and wine content after finishing the hearts of stone content and im blown away hearts of stone was good too proof that dlc doesnt always have to be shitty
gaming,not_removed,subjective
gaming,not_removed,rimworld buy it love it
gaming,not_removed,fallout is amazing i love that game most of the others though are meh
gaming,not_removed,or you live in canada and a new game is just about anyway count yourself lucky
gaming,not_removed,no bullshit i have seen dlc put to good use like binding of isaac but many aaa devs release games with day one dlc or like the sims franchise sell expansion packs that are the same price as the base game and only add small content so if you want it all you literally pay thousands of dollars there is a time and place for dlc but many producers and devs abuse it make their games pay to play even though you have purchased the game others expect exorbitant prices for virtual goods i have seen a dress in an mmo go for you can buy a real dress for less games used to be made by people passionate about their work then came the aaas and those passionate about their work doing it in small teams like it used to be done are now called indy the problem is as much with the consumers as it is with the devs every bethesda game since skyrim has been riddled with bugs that they refuse to fix fully documented and verified on wikis the community has to put together massive patch sets to fix the bugs and the devs know the community will do this so they dont give a shit and leave the bugs cause they already have your cash and we still keep flocking to buy their products we created this mess as much as they did
gaming,not_removed,what causes games to be that price if they dont have dlc what makes it different
gaming,not_removed,thats another thing gta sucks everything costs too much this what i mean by squeezing every last penny out of you this is why i call gta a rich persons games
gaming,not_removed,star wars battlefront the newest one dragon ball xenoverse and the problem is that it doesnt interest me anymore
gaming,not_removed,what others if you thought fallout was an amazing game that you loved then seriously you shouldnt have such a hard time finding games youll like have you played witcher last of us horizon zero dawn nier automata bloodbornedark souls nioh uncharted deus ex dlc isnt always a bad thing in the old days before dlc you beat the game and thats it its over with dlc its a way to keep adding more content and breath new life into the game or keep it going for longer if you want it witcher released awesome dlc for example it could have ben its own sepetate game really its only a bad thing when certain companies abuse it by trying to make more money of pointless stuff or content that isnt worth the money but the choice is always yours
gaming,not_removed,what fallout is arguably the worst one ever made this sorta discredits your entire argument thus far imo
gaming,not_removed,oh dont worry i agree with you day one dlc is a complete bullshit in my previous comment im referring to content created after a games release
gaming,not_removed,usually overtime money loses value some forms of currency lose it or gain it faster than other thats why the euro is worth more than the us dollar video games when they first arrived were only while other products have increased in price video games have barely increased relative to other industries most aaa games cod battlefield assassins creed are very expensive to make so to make up for the lack of money games use dlc and micro transaction inflation is a bit of a complicated topic but to keep it simple more time higher prices
gaming,not_removed,you can certainly play it without spending a dime but you miss out on a bunch of cool shit or youre spending all your free time grinding i caved a couple weeks back and bought some money so i could do some ceo stuff ive earned back the money that i spent and more and i hate that i had to support microtransactions but tbh theyre putting out free dlc all the time so im just considering that my payment for all the new content
gaming,not_removed,yeah but theres so many games
gaming,not_removed,yes and new vegas were far superior to
gaming,not_removed,just as a quick comparison to your point in had the same buying power as in if you actually go all the way back to its almost
gaming,not_removed,games used to be for the nes and sega
gaming,not_removed,oh snaps rolling up he sleeves with economics up in this thread

gaming,not_removed,man i love medal of honor
gaming,not_removed,at first i thought this meants you get if you beat him and i thought yeah thats a dope deal then i realized what it actually meant and i thought to myself who the hell would even consider paying this
gaming,not_removed,that guy is a dickhead anyway i wouldnt pay anything id rather pay to have him go away

gaming,not_removed,blunt however extremely accurate
gaming,not_removed,i was gonna ask why even bother commenting but then i remembered you are an asshole s
gaming,not_removed,as completely impossible as your team assembly is fuck it im a writer ill hear your idea
gaming,not_removed,rgamedev
gaming,not_removed,is there nudity involved
gaming,not_removed,i can program a little and would be willing to help out
gaming,not_removed,that is the badass attitude i want hear thanks
gaming,not_removed,i didnt know that existed since you cant move a post might as well leave it i will check that later
gaming,not_removed,so far no i think my including nudity it would reduce the audience and unless it is for story purposes then no for sure adding nudity seems stupid anyone can just watch porn easily but i am open to suggestions and if someone can make a good point for nudity i am game
gaming,not_removed,i will let you know i am going to wait for the response from the writer i figure when assembling an avengers like team you should get one member at a time i was just joking when i said avengers like team
gaming,not_removed,no problem just thought this would help you
gaming,not_removed,well youll need a programmer either way right
gaming,not_removed,yes i want to create a game but i might have to dial down my expectations
gaming,not_removed,well we start small and work our way up ive been messing around with unity so we could use that we get a base laid out and slowly work on the story while making the game i could see that working out pretty well
gaming,not_removed,get a
gaming,not_removed,double tap the home button glowing white x and your sidebar should pop up with an option in the main view that says y for screenshot and x for record it does your last seconds of gameplay
gaming,not_removed,get the camera thing
gaming,not_removed,go to game dvr app and you can choose to record up to mins of gameplay at a time alternatively press x on the snap menu and you can capture the last seconds
gaming,not_removed,this joke is dead let us keep it that way
gaming,not_removed,i get it because of your mouse
gaming,not_removed,some asshole in that case its very good for your health that you didnt eat somones predigested candy
gaming,not_removed,i was about to get in this thread to lecture you about how expensive razors are and that no one would put in the effort of just giving them away to kids but i was fooled
gaming,not_removed,ive been twixed
gaming,not_removed,you got me
gaming,not_removed,wow good thing you didnt swallow it
gaming,not_removed,nice
gaming,not_removed,im so glad that not a real razor
gaming,not_removed,i wish i got that in my candy which razer is that
gaming,not_removed,i knew this was fake when i saw the razer mouse and realized it was not an actual cutting razor
gaming,not_removed,i like to beat a dead mouse
gaming,not_removed,im surprised he didnt i can barely even see the hidden razer in that chocolate bar
gaming,not_removed,thats a scooter this is a mouse
gaming,not_removed,no mice
gaming,not_removed,why would you put caramel on your mouse tho
gaming,not_removed,mouses
gaming,not_removed,because hes stupid duh d
gaming,not_removed,never heard of choclate mousse
gaming,not_removed,meese
gaming,not_removed,mices
gaming,not_removed,nice
gaming,not_removed,i didnt like and i didnt like unless you can really get into it then no you wont like it i have read about it and it has some cool lore though
gaming,not_removed,disliked the witcher a lot the witcher is my favorite game of all time
gaming,not_removed,i didnt like witcher didnt stick with it anywhere near as long as you did the controls are still a bit janky in witcher but otherwise the game is fantastic the world is huge beautiful and very detailed and its by far the best open world narrative design weve seen in a game so far it puts something like fallout to shame
gaming,not_removed,yeah combat and everything else is a lot better in witcher in my opinion the game is also an open sandbox differs a lot from previous games
gaming,not_removed,no the witcher is the witcher writ large
gaming,not_removed,witcher is an entirely different beast its just a better version of skyrim
gaming,not_removed,witcher is an improvement in almost every way the only bad thing i can say about it is that i wish the combat was more improved im not say it didnt improve but its basically a more responsive version of combat
gaming,not_removed,definitely i fucking hated witcher i found it clumsy plodding and boring i consider witcher one of the best games of the generation so far and i dont see that changing
gaming,not_removed,yes i never played ether the first nor the second i loved the third really is an amazing game
gaming,not_removed,the second was my least favorite of the three if i didnt want to carry on my save from i wouldnt have finished it is amazing it really knocks the other out of the water and is muuch more accessible to a larger crowd
gaming,not_removed,its not a sandbox it may be of the chooseyourownadventure type but open world and sandbox are not interchangeable synonymous or anything like that
gaming,not_removed,agreed the combat in was much sharper the only thing i would have loved to see in combat would be the ability to counter two attacks at once similar to assassins creed and maybe a few more kill animations but i say that about every game that has kill animations
gaming,not_removed,hes not dead right
gaming,not_removed,he makes a metal gear spiritual sucesssor and it flops terribly like would be sad for us but also hilariously ironic
gaming,not_removed,no but metal gear died
gaming,not_removed,i was joking but yes mgs has diedcue metal gear survive
gaming,not_removed,this video is part of a series filmed in elite dangerous it is meant to be both entertaining and educational
gaming,not_removed,sad thing is i ended the game with the x mark so he is not in my memorial for fallen heros
gaming,not_removed,once again op didnt say what game this is
gaming,not_removed,well you see i spawned in a school and was on my way to go hoard books when i see a couple zombies then as i start running to go into the hall i see more after that i turned back towards where i hoped would be a single hallway after which i spent an hour killing zombies with my fists until i got a baseball bat this is when i equipped the bat and began bashing all their heads in halfway through the day the walls to the library in front of me collapsed i continued to kill the zombies for most of the day after feeling i had thoroughly killed the zombies in the immediate vicinity i start smashing the bodies so they couldnt get back up i began to investigate the school with minor wounds and ragged clothes i overcame two infections before a third actually manifested in my chest then finding a second horde of the undead i died from a fatal swipe to the chest after killing off another
gaming,not_removed,i think its httpencataclysmddacom amazing game its very hard to live more than a day for the first time but once you learn the basics you live a week easily i play the zombieonly mode
gaming,not_removed,yes that is the game
gaming,not_removed,that was kills if you zoom in
gaming,not_removed,so tell us your story how your character ended up dead and how the f do you kill things on your first day
gaming,not_removed,well you see i spawned in a school and was on my way to go hoard books when i see a couple zombies then as i start running to go into the hall i see more after that i turned back towards where i hoped would be a single hallway after which i spent an hour killing zombies with my fists until i got a baseball bat this is when i equipped the bat and began bashing all their heads in halfway through the day the walls to the library in front of me collapsed i continued to kill the zombies for most of the day after feeling i had thoroughly killed the zombies in the immediate vicinity i start smashing the bodies so they couldnt get back up i began to investigate the school with minor wounds and ragged clothes i overcame two infections before a third actually manifested in my chest then finding a second horde of the undead i died from a fatal swipe to the chest after killing off another
gaming,not_removed,wow my early game never were that intense i always start on a field maybe some recent version cuanged that then spend a time hunting with a bow then i approach a city and start jumping house to house looking for water and food then i leave to a farm and keep going to the city from time to time to restore my stock of food and books once i tried to explode a entire city making a chain of ammonia jugs around the streets and houses after a ingame month a zombie dog bit me and i spent two days agonizing on a reinforced house filled with food on the border of the city until i run out of water and drank the toilet seat water a day later i died of some infection
gaming,not_removed,i like how the wad of cash just slides out from under him
gaming,not_removed,even sells it like vince would
gaming,not_removed,what a maneuver
gaming,not_removed,sheamus
gaming,not_removed,my gawd maggle with god as my witness he has broken in half
gaming,not_removed,baw gawd king
gaming,not_removed,was feeling balor
gaming,not_removed,that red mohawk tho
gaming,not_removed,not me saddened pc player
gaming,not_removed,the only gameplay video has no gameplay in it really brave to make a game with no gameplay
gaming,not_removed,when does it get released
gaming,not_removed,webs better attach to buildings or gtfo
gaming,not_removed,been
gaming,not_removed,so hyped i love spiderman really hope they dont fudge it up
gaming,not_removed,why is spiderman the only free roam superhero game that ever surfaces why no avengers or xmen games they churned out marvel platformers and beatemups in the but now that we have the tech to do them right they vanish man on the original xbox hulk ultimate destruction was one of my favorites so many moves midair combat enemy mechs edit batman of course proves marvel needs to get in on
gaming,not_removed,aww yeah
gaming,not_removed,i just hope its good id still rather play spiderman spiderman or ultimate spiderman than any of the recent ones and that spiderman game holds up still a ton of fun
gaming,not_removed,i have faith in insomniac games
gaming,not_removed,i hope they take their time porting it to pc
gaming,not_removed,courage™
gaming,not_removed,the swingings gotta do a lot more than just that for me to care
gaming,not_removed,yep if after release i see that it lives up to the hype im going to buy a just for this game
gaming,not_removed,the xmen and avengers dont really free roam its natural for spidey to move around new york but those teams would feel more at home in a missionbased game multiplayer would be a must unless you had really good ai for the record id absolutely love a really good xmen game that isnt a fighter and gave you more freedom than the legends games
gaming,not_removed,xd no cow lmaooo somemmoone the on you xdddd
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,repost from not even minutes ago
gaming,not_removed,appeared twice in my stream mere posts apart
gaming,not_removed,thank you for the heads up i didnt see it only looked two pages back ill remove it
gaming,not_removed,sorry about that didnt realize it had just been posted checked two pages and didnt see it removed
gaming,not_removed,fucking celexa man
gaming,not_removed,good
gaming,not_removed,i do that with the scout in csgo lol
gaming,not_removed,i know right that dumbass bitch
gaming,not_removed,noooo the kid didnt get the fist bump
gaming,not_removed,if anyone has steam and wants to try to practice roping to become masters pm me i know enough to tecah whats needed
gaming,not_removed,yes i feel like im just throwing money away if i dont
gaming,not_removed,i have so many steam games i havent finished
gaming,not_removed,yeah i have like games and feel really guilty off i fail to play one off them each week or so
gaming,not_removed,stop buying games mate jesus
gaming,not_removed,not really but maybe i should at least give all of my games hours of gameplay just to see if ive missed anything
gaming,not_removed,nah im like you and get a lot of games added to my library via bundles and things for the most part i just consider my steam library to be like a collection
gaming,not_removed,not really from bundles since i usually only get or games i want from those but generally yes i make an effort to play the vast majority of my library i dont like throwing money down the drain another reason is because you never know if youll like something you gotta move out of your comfort zone sometimes and why not start with games you already own maybe youll love one of those games you placed in the junk pile
gaming,not_removed,fuuuuuuuck no
gaming,not_removed,fairly sure i couldnt beat every game i own in my natural lifespan even if i went hours a day so why worry
gaming,not_removed,not since someone gifted me bad rats
gaming,not_removed,girls son girls
gaming,not_removed,not overwatch thats for sure
gaming,not_removed,im pretty sure nobody says that
gaming,not_removed,video
gaming,not_removed,gow has what we call host advantage for ping titanfall has client side hit detection so most likely if you saw someone with a ping lower than you assuming your at the scenario is that you will most likely kill him before your client gets any of his hit marks he did to you so on his screen he unloaded on you said vulgar words and scratched his head on why you did not die
gaming,not_removed,there are various ways games implement the netcode with various effects on gameplay for example everything can be handled serverside the individual game clients only send player inputs and receive info on all events from the server advantages are that everybody sees the same thing happening and cheating is mostly impossible a disadvantage is that it adds twice the ping as a delay to everything quick can make fast games unplayable without good ping and makes low ping an advantage on the other side of the spectrum the client can handle everything related to that players actions on its own only informing the server of the outcome this makes cheating by modifying the client possible and two players clients can momentarily display different things but it makes ping less important it still impacts gameplay but instead of giving an advantage to the player with low ping the advantage goes to the player with initiative this is generally preferred for fast games tldr yes games handle ping differently
gaming,not_removed,not necessarily in the sense of my own nation but fictional ones i will defend further than i will ever defend america
gaming,not_removed,metal gear i felt the weight of bit boss as a warrior
gaming,not_removed,not really america is trash in civ without mods but the modded americas make more sense than the normal
gaming,not_removed,if thats not the worst thumbnail i dont know what is
gaming,not_removed,no mans sky is good for two things wallpaper generating labelling new things with lewd names
gaming,not_removed,say what you will about the shit game mechanics but no mans sky has some fucking sweet art design
gaming,not_removed,if someone could make a rain meter design of this it would be sweet
gaming,not_removed,you want a good wallpaper generator and experience vanishing of ethan carter photogrammetry is amazing stuff
gaming,not_removed,i dont think the game was bad the only thing i find wrong is this guy who said a lot of shit that wasnt in the game but the fame itself was good
gaming,not_removed,tbh i dont use space as my wallpapers too bland for me
gaming,not_removed,the concept of the game is fantastic first of its kind its not going to be perfect but it opens the doors for bigger better open universe games exciting times
gaming,not_removed,downvote this comment
gaming,not_removed,and the labels arent even permanent
gaming,not_removed,it does but then again websites like deviant art have some awesome stuff too or rimaginarylandscapes
gaming,not_removed,first of its kind the elite series star citizen rodina spore space engineers and a few dozen other games say hi
gaming,not_removed,ok
gaming,not_removed,you got it bruh
gaming,not_removed,yes they are it was a big that has now been patched
gaming,not_removed,it was a client issue definitely not intentional
gaming,not_removed,thought this was a discussion not a circlejerk you dont need friends to help you jerk off and your friends shouldnt need to help you either same thing with postsdiscussions
gaming,not_removed,sorry i should have been more specifici mean the size of the game of course there have been many games in the same genre however to the best of my knowledge it was first with a infinite playable zone
gaming,not_removed,thanksbro
gaming,not_removed,it wasnt even that i believe the servers were just down for maintenance for a bit
gaming,not_removed,oh really i dont follow the game so that was the last i heard at least theres something that works then
gaming,not_removed,infinite doesnt necessarily mean better though with prodcedural generation an infinite universe means youd see the exact same planets eventually same with the real universe if it were infinite you could find an earth exactly the same as ours as it is with procedural most planets feel samey in their uniqueness and more to the point whats the point of an infinite playable zone if you will never experience even a halfpercent of it elite is years old and has about billion star systems generated and the players have barely touched upon them and it would take literal millennia of nonstop play to see it ultimately its easy to procedurally generate at least when compared to handcraft plug in the variables and calculations as you see fit and leave the computer running overnight massive oversimplification for the purposes of gameplay practically infinite sandboxes have existed for a while now many more indepth and complex than what nms achieved dont get me wrong more big space games is really cool but nms hasnt really done much other games havent done already in some form or another
gaming,not_removed,it was first with a infinite playable zone minecraft star made space engineers is also infinite
gaming,not_removed,the playable zones are compartmentalized skyboxes tough not actually what id call open universe when warping to systems you are only loading it up not travelling to it same for each galaxies in comparison elite is an actual full scale galaxy the open playable space might aswell be more than no man skys considering there really are light years gaps between stars
gaming,not_removed,guess some children are still impressed with a simple color swap
gaming,not_removed,i dont play or follow this game but im going to make fun of it anyway fuck off i dont like the game but at least i fucking played it
gaming,not_removed,me stating i dont use space as wallpaper is just a point in the discussion nothing more not every post has to agree with op fervently
gaming,not_removed,i assumed that nms would let you fly to other systems on your own so as soon as i got my warp drive i flew into space and warped out away from my home planet for a minute or two until the fuel ran out just to see where i would end up i was super confused when i came out of warp and could still see my starting planet that was now minutes away i had to shoot some rocks to get more fuel so i could fly back i was disappointed but i guess i can understand the mechanic if other systems are light years away flying through empty space for vast distances would probably be extremely boring but i thought that was how the game was structured before figuring it out on my own
gaming,not_removed,wow really hit a nerve there im sowwy for being misinformed and i pwomise ill do better next time
gaming,not_removed,the problem is there is a lot of circle jerk about this game which started well before release some things are justified some are not the discovery name saving was a day one issue due to server issues and sites like pcgamer wrote misinformed articles over it and the hate continued
gaming,not_removed,although he cussed you out he does bring up a good point you could have easily handled that in a far less assholelike way
gaming,not_removed,is this legit like did they patch that in right before the game gets shut down
gaming,not_removed,this shit put a tear in my eye
gaming,not_removed,context for people who dont play
gaming,not_removed,i remember playing this back in elementary school got me through computer lab at times so cool to see such great ending to it
gaming,not_removed,why will it be shut down
gaming,not_removed,now all thats left is rockhoppers island
gaming,not_removed,this is funny to see how this game can be so well known in some countries and not in others im french and in france i can swear no one as ever heard about that game
gaming,not_removed,yes thank you disney for a parting easter egg
gaming,not_removed,yea
gaming,not_removed,you have been banned from club penguin reason profanity
gaming,not_removed,basically ever since launch it was rumored that if you had enough people drilling the iceberg something would happen it was pretty much the biggest meme in the game nothing ever happened until today ii dont play club penguin by the way i just heard rumors about from my little cousin
gaming,not_removed,long ago there was this rumour that if many penguins gathered in one side of the iceberg it would tip it became a kind of running joke recently it was made possible httpclubpenguinwikiacomwikiiceberg
gaming,not_removed,years of decline sadly
gaming,not_removed,because its not a game its a click and give us money simulator which currently has no place in a browser hence why disney bought it and made a new version for the mobile
gaming,not_removed,sure thats a thing
gaming,not_removed,this is somewhat common with chat servicesclub penguin was basically a gamified chat room in general i think language and geographic barriers impede the word of mouth spreading
gaming,not_removed,its always nice to see games get one last event before they pull the plug
gaming,not_removed,thanks much 😊
gaming,not_removed,thanks 😊
gaming,not_removed,actually theyre shutting it down and opening a new site called club penguin island it sounds like its a reboot of a sort
gaming,not_removed,ignore the downvotes i used to love the game but youre right its not some small sad company shutting down this is disney and for them its about the money
gaming,not_removed,yeah i think so kinda strange anyway for example we are a lot to know reddit or why some website and not others this is the real question
gaming,not_removed,i think its a mobile app
gaming,not_removed,just when i thought you couldnt sink any lower you go and totally redeem yourself
gaming,not_removed,how long did it take to do the shading on the upper lip
gaming,not_removed,amazing
gaming,not_removed,that was awfulget over here
gaming,not_removed,can you do a red version as well thanks in advance
gaming,not_removed,nice cant wait for sub zero
gaming,not_removed,amazing work bro
gaming,not_removed,i have some of my grandpas old war pictures can i ship them to you so you can colorize them
gaming,not_removed,ha
gaming,not_removed,one time we successfully mated a bulldog with a shihtzu we called it a bullshit
gaming,not_removed,i dont get why people buy dlc its endorsing game companies to release partial games and make you pay more for said partial game
gaming,not_removed,if you like a game and more content is offered then of course people are going to want to buy it
gaming,not_removed,depends how long it is between the game release and doc release are you saying the witches expansion packs finishing a partially completed game
gaming,not_removed,depends how long it is between the game release and doc release are you saying the witches expansion packs finishing a partially completed game
gaming,not_removed,witcher and red dead redemption are the gold standard for dlc for me you dont need the dlc to complete or enjoy the main game as the creators of the game intended the additional content is just that additional it adds to the experience and brings a lot of cool stuffstory undead nightmare was basically a whole new game and even some game mechanics were different hearts of stone and blood and wine introduce new characters game mechanics enchantments grandmaster gear etc and really interesting stories plus you can get rich as hell in blood and wine which helps new game and they arent quick two hour quests like some dlc side stories which helps there is heft to them
gaming,not_removed,exactly as long as they are additions to a well told story and they are price worthy keep em coming i dont mind a bolt on if it only costs a few quid
gaming,not_removed,this is why i dont like the new trend of aaa season passes costing the same as a brand new game its not like youre getting two games youre getting one full game and then like extra content hearts of stone and blood and wine cost way less than a season pass for say fallout but offer much much more
gaming,not_removed,yea dont buy passes anymore just like i dont pre order games anymore there really is no point on pc at least
gaming,not_removed,what game is this
gaming,not_removed,almost as cringeworthy as some of the creeps that only upload overwatch ass and boobs jeez guys its just a game do pixels really get you guys off
gaming,not_removed,comment your video game tit pics
gaming,not_removed,gta v
gaming,not_removed,oh yeah man tits in real life shit id probably go nuts and rip them off the girls chest seriously it was a joke apparently not a good one i apologize
gaming,not_removed,not much going on for you friday night huh
gaming,not_removed,no
gaming,not_removed,was just joking
gaming,not_removed,okay
gaming,not_removed,you werent youre weird and have abjectly poor social skills
gaming,not_removed,k go away
gaming,not_removed,well i appreciate your honesty how do you think i can work on my social skills do you think you could show me how i shouldve properly posted this in a way that everyone wouldve known i was joking
gaming,not_removed,maybe if you show me how then all my future posts can have a very pertinent and specific purpose just like all of yours teach me how to not make shit posts bro
gaming,not_removed,dont just down vote me and say a bunch of negative stuff how can i make reddit better surely you know how youre so good at pointing out what is wrong with other peoples posts send me a video tutorial or something i wanna post good content like you
gaming,not_removed,no
gaming,not_removed,teach me how to not make shit posts bro its a very simple process step is what im posting a worthwhile discussion or am i posting this just because i can step if yes to the latter see step if yes to the former see step step post that
gaming,not_removed,dont just down vote me and say a bunch of negative stuff i didnt downvote you and i didnt say a bunch of negative stuff i told you to go away because you say and post weird shit surely you know how youre so good at pointing out what is wrong with other peoples posts send me a video tutorial or something dont be pathetic i wanna post good content like you pls you made a super inappropriate and weird post own it and move on
gaming,not_removed,thanks a lot i knew youd be able to tell me how to make good posts im gonna be a great reddit user one day just like you
gaming,not_removed,see this is what i mean bro you have so much knowledge your comments are perfect never missing a word and no one could ever call you out dont give up on me you could totally show me how to be a better reddit user like yourself
gaming,not_removed,damn sorry i didnt mean to sound pathetic its just i know after years of posting reddit and youve only made eleven posts surely youve dropped nothing but perfect content on this website youd never put out any shit posts is why i asked for a tutorial
gaming,not_removed,yes we need to be a shield against the retards
gaming,not_removed,i know right im the perfect redditor incarnate
gaming,not_removed,its just i know after years of posting reddit and youve only made eleven posts surely youve dropped nothing but perfect content on this website you misunderstand i only post when i have a valid reason to post thats why i have only posted times in years you on the other hand post when your extra chromosome kicks in so theres little comparison to be made
gaming,not_removed,definitely im just so relieved we have amazing users like you that point out these retards and shame them for their wrong doing and shit posts thank you for your dedication i really mean it i was such an idiot for my post and comment thanks for letting me know i made a bad post hopefully you can get that video tutorial sent to me asap
gaming,not_removed,you really are ive honestly never seen someone with no shitty content and not even one bad comment before i checked out your history i really look up to you bro thats why i need that tutorial how else will i be able to turn into the perfect redditor like yourself
gaming,not_removed,i didnt misunderstand its true youve posted nothing but things that contribute well to the subs youve posted in and youve had great discussion about those posts you definitely only post perfect content what else could it be than that do you think you can get that tutorial to me anytime soon buddy maybe you could make it into a post thatd be perfect man not only would i learn how to be a great reddit user like you but everyone else could admire how great your posts are and we could all have a great discussion about it its a win win
gaming,not_removed,you do realize youre having three different conversations with me at the same time but this isnt about you being shit at reddit you literally posted a picture of cgi tits and asked people to post more cgi tits and when challenged you went it was only jokez lolz just stop replying you can only further affirm your retarditude
gaming,not_removed,my posts arent great but they are topical and have a purpose but can you please stop being pathetic and crawl back out of my ass
gaming,not_removed,we already established my extra chromosome and how im shit at reddit so when are you gonna get me that tutorial like tomorrow or maybe tonight if youre feeling up to it i never said it was only a jokez lolz i know how to spell and i didnt even put lol in the comment youre referring to i said it was a joke cause i genuinely meant for it to be one but im apparently bad at making jokes thats why ive asked you to help me which you already have a great deal but i need that tutorial
gaming,not_removed,judging from your attitude youll never be able to do anything but shitpost turn off your computer and never turn it on again
gaming,not_removed,rekt i get it guys i make shitposts maybe you can get me that tutorial if you know all ill ever do is shitpost surely you can spot them which means you must never do it do you think you could make a slow enough video tutorial that my extra chromosome could handle it of the two rgaming posts youve made they have a combined total of upvotes idk if youre on level bro maybe you should watch his tutorial when it comes out
gaming,not_removed,kyle bossman i agree
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,what game though
gaming,not_removed,overcooked
gaming,not_removed,may have been funny ten years ago too
gaming,not_removed,posting to receive updates i want it too
gaming,not_removed,skyrim always annoyed me for half doing this i yield i yield seconds later back on their feet going at you with all theyve got
gaming,not_removed,in titanfall campaign if youre in a titan and you stare down enemy ground infantry some of them will drop their guns and have a mental breakdown its pretty amusing edit
gaming,not_removed,perfect dark was ahead of its time on every level more difficulty levels and difficulty beyond health gimmicks and number multiplayer featuring diverse maps with playercreated layouts hundreds of possible character appearance and mutators out the ass a singleplayer story that was good again with variable difficulty that went beyond enemy health and damage a coop and counterop campaign and secrets everywhere it had bonus missions dozens of weapons side quests a hub world multiplayer stat tracking and unlocks for days all without dlc or microtransactions all without gamebreaking bugs this game gave my childhood what good there was in it
gaming,not_removed,no its just perfect dark was too good
gaming,not_removed,isnt this in metal gear since the first game on loved perfect dark dont get wrong just confused
gaming,not_removed,while everyone is praising goldeneye im sitting here thinking perfect dark was the best game
gaming,not_removed,this is the kind of thing i miss stuff polished textures i miss all the little things that used to make a game enjoyable hidden areas being at the top of my list in game cheat codes coming second
gaming,not_removed,this right here was my childhood fuck goldeneye this was the true shooter for me the campaign was perfect scaling objectives in each difficulty was a nice touch the secrets were fun the guns were unique the music was fantastic the carrington institute hub and its trials were fun the multiplayer had sooooooo much customizability even more than most games today being able to set weapon spawns change load outs remote mine only was my favorite catch change bot personalities and customizable character models elvis body banned with friends of course though just like odd job always was was really the perfect heh game to me and way ahead of its time
gaming,not_removed,titanfall grunts do similar things they react to their surroundings pretty cool
gaming,not_removed,if you wanna see some cleverly crafted currentgen ai i recommend a game called the forest if you killed the leader of a cannibal group theres a high chance the other ones will run away and possibly come back with reinforcements and thats just icing on the cake of what the ai do in that game its kinda saddening seeing how ignored the forest is its so well crafted and the small team pumps out big updates like nothing game even looks better than something like ark yet they optimized it within a week compared to ark now taking years despite having a much more massive team
gaming,not_removed,i am alive had a great mechanic where even if the gun was empty the weaker scared enemy could be scared off and then you could just walk away but the tougher ones would try it on and if you pulled the trigger and click no ammo then the scared ones would then join in was great you had bullet you manage to headshot the alpha and then just threaten the rest of the guys with an empty gun lead to some tense times
gaming,not_removed,two other games from the same era that deserve a mention are soldier of fortune and jedi outcast their ai isnt as complex or naunced as perfect darks since they lack stuff like discarding weapons occasional fake surrendering and so on but if you shot their guns out of their hands they would put their hands up and surrender its a really fantastic touch that is sorely missing from modern fps and tps games and its really striking how older fps games were far less mass murder simulatory than the ones we have today weve got all this improved tech but our games are so much less elegant
gaming,not_removed,my favorite game of all time ahead of its time back when it came out and in some ways is still ahead of fps today
gaming,not_removed,payday has an intimidation mechanic too it also has a perk you can get to cause enemies to scatter when you fire lmgs in their direction
gaming,not_removed,the last level of perfect dark always scared the shit out of me as a kid
gaming,not_removed,i feel like modern game developers kind of gave up when it comes to ai it hasnt really improved much since the days of halflife and that was years ago
gaming,not_removed,i really wish most rpgs would incorporate hidden player values that determine your status in the world so certain questsachievementsevents affected your standing in the world by increasing or decreasing that value depending on the outcome so say this arbitrary value reaches a certain point where it makes you intimidating to lesser enemies or you are beloved by every npc you come across then special events could happen where stronger enemies or highly esteemed guilds or keeps approach you
gaming,not_removed,this always makes me laugh in skyrim you get a guys health down to nothing and he surrenders i walk away only to be getting hit in the back by said guy
gaming,not_removed,ahem titanfall
gaming,not_removed,what a great game
gaming,not_removed,this game was amazing did local multiplayer for hours with college friends wed be on the same team against ai this game was the cause of me rushing term papers the night before they were due
gaming,not_removed,ah back when major games had imagination and there was passion that went into making them
gaming,not_removed,this was a nice touch but i wouldnt say the ai in perfect dark was good or better than ai from most modern games
gaming,not_removed,i remember being able to set characteristics to bots in the multiplayer like one bot would only try to kill the person with the most kills another bot only goes after the first person who kills him for the rest of the match it was so fun
gaming,not_removed,thanks for reminding me of this amazing game
gaming,not_removed,if i remember right they would also pick their guns back up and try to kill you if you turned your back on them
gaming,not_removed,socom had this
gaming,not_removed,this was an amazing thing to witness in game for the first time god this brings back some serious nostalgia
gaming,not_removed,uhhhhhmgs anyone
gaming,not_removed,thats possible in payday
gaming,not_removed,jet force gemini also a rare game had some enemies that would rarely throw away their guns and surrender if you massacred a bunch of their allies
gaming,not_removed,it has ideas and amazing gameplay that makes so many modern shooters and even some other games look like lazy cash grabs oh sure modern games have fantastic graphics and usually smoother controls but thats about it perfect dark the original is a game made by people who loved the game they were making took the time to polish it and add fine details and pack in extra gameplay multiplayer challenges were an awesome addition instead of just empty loops that rely on skinnerbox techniques to keep people engaged its rare pun to find modern games with ai that is decent and in many instances its a step back from what a late game accomplished i noticed that the ai in will sometimes retreat when youre way overleveled and have the ai at an obvious disadvantage now if the ai retreated and got help or tried to ambush you thatd be a halfway decent step up
gaming,not_removed,looking at you skyrim i yield i yield recovers proceeds to get up and charge you again
gaming,not_removed,the highest level difficulty ai was incredibly hard i think their level was called perfect ai you pretty much couldnt even peek your head around a corner without being oneshot
gaming,not_removed,the ai in arma can shoot you through the ground beat that
gaming,not_removed,old game ai always seemed so good compared to modern day might be the rose tinted glasses but i remember nightfire multiplayer ai being awesome to fight against too
gaming,not_removed,timeshift does this metal gear solid also does this batman series of games has intimidation coding although while they react to intimidation they still shoot youeventually my guess is that the lack of coding this is done to make killing people enmasse more fun instead of encouraging people to do the moral choice and put the extra effort into making everyone surrender peacefully or to remove situations where you make someone surrender and then shoot them in the head anyway for fun
gaming,not_removed,ai has stopped being anything other than a marketing buzzword they all claim to have cutting edge ai then they code the enemies to hide behind crates and pop out every seconds
gaming,not_removed,if you really want to see things get real go to the submarine level and shoot one of the guards through the glass window on each door i dont remember which doorguard it is but a few seconds after you kill one of these guards his buddy will run over kneel down next to his body and i shit you not say that was my best friend i have never felt like such a monster since i heard that
gaming,not_removed,seriously just the morale check system from first edition add would improve most games
gaming,not_removed,more like its not preprogrammed into unreal engine
gaming,not_removed,ai advancement is one area of aaa gaming that boggles my mind the bigger firms are dumping large swatches of cash into ai rfuturology yet game companies are not public about their own efforts despite this couch professional suggesting ai offers tremendous opportunity to capture and engage player attention as an indie dev its well beyond my bandwidth to add in more advanced ai capability in addition to the truckload of other things i need to do however youd think the larger studios would be able and open to pushing this envelope i can totally see an asset store for npc brains someday though for example behaviors common to certain types of critters rats bats and gnats its been a long week lets have a beer
gaming,not_removed,they can also simulate an orgasm from oral sex seriously try it go to the carrington institute stand directly in front of one of the friendly npcs i only tried this on the female npcs and continously crouchuncrouchcrouch while standing as close to them as you can they will put their hands on their hips and start arching their back and whatnot i dont even remember how we discovered this i think we read it in nintendo power or something id film it and show you myself but i dont own a anymore
gaming,not_removed,can confirm have done this
gaming,not_removed,right in the midchildhood
gaming,not_removed,jedi knight jedi outcast did the same thing with stormtroopers but then theyd start running around when you turned your back and besides it was fun throwing them to their deaths
gaming,not_removed,mgs would let you disarm enemies or convince them to surrender in close quarters but it is very situational and tricky to pull off they did have a good incentive for it though you could use it to capture and recruit mercenaries with high abilities i need to break out that game again was a lot of fun to play
gaming,not_removed,nudoom does a pretty good job with making enemies that are scared shitless of your power
gaming,not_removed,quite a few metal gear solid games did this iirc almost every one after
gaming,not_removed,i think mgs had similar ai i know the judge dredd game on and swat had it as well although the former isnt seen favourably
gaming,not_removed,this is in titanfall
gaming,not_removed,this kind of ai behavior has been in the mgs games since the beginning
gaming,not_removed,this kind of black magic coding is apparently beyond modern game developers saints row did it
gaming,not_removed,in skyrim they surrender temporarily
gaming,not_removed,i remember scaring a raider into surrendering in fallout but i had fawkes with me so he killed the raider anyway
gaming,not_removed,for all its amazing features my favourite game mode was still players lasers on area max peace sims instakill and everyone just holes up in the bunker with lasers blasting across the door a la resident evil everyone once in a while youd get one sim busting through the pile of corpses and all hell would break loose god i miss that game
gaming,not_removed,some times they fake surrender and then pull a pistol on you when you take your aim off them
gaming,not_removed,the guys on dying light do the same even if your gun is empty i usually hold them up at air drops while my buddy grabs the loot
gaming,not_removed,enemies in turok evolution would surrender or flee in firefights as well funny how some old games could humanize even mutant dinosaur people yet years later some games ai still preform like potatoes with guns
gaming,not_removed,this happens in tlou but soon as you turn your back or you try to shoot and your clip is empty enemy ai will try to kill you very cool feature
gaming,not_removed,this game was goldeneye but way better too bad goldeneye gets all the credit it should rare turned it up to with perfect dark i would say as a sameconsole shooter nothing beats it to this day so many hours against friends and with friends against perfect bots favorite game mode was perfects in the stack from the original goldeneye
gaming,not_removed,jedi knight outcast would let you use force pull to disarm an enemy from there they may try to run away or surrender or if you dont grab their gun they may try to grab it when youre not looking
gaming,not_removed,timeshift does a similar thing if you take away an enemys gun he either surrenders or just reaches for the nearest one on the ground pretty good game btw like half life but not as good of a story
gaming,not_removed,this would happen in nightfire as well
gaming,not_removed,i think perfect dark had some really amazing ai when triggered a npc will do a random action with higher difficulty levels creating a higher chance for a stronger option like just walking at you and firing that one messes you up on lower difficulty settings they are more likely to drop their gun or something along those lines and the difficulty levels while giving them faster reaction time doesnt make them too much more durable unless they are wearing armor or something a head shot kills any human on the easiest or the hardest setting playing perfect dark on perfect agent was one of the best experiences i had in a game and ive yet to find another fps game that was made after this one that isnt just a hide behind stuff and hip fire at bullet sponges
gaming,not_removed,you could force pull stormtroopers rifles out of their grip in that jedi knight also old now game and theyd do this you could also throw them around the map kill them by flinging them into walls toss them off of stuff that game was pretty fun they always had amusing screams to go along with it wow also old had a lot of humanoid classified npcs that would run away in fear literally ran away from you upon reaching low health pretty much the same thing dont know if the newer expansions still have this or not the first two halo games and halo reach had the grunt units that would be prone to cowering in fear and running away especially if you killed their commanders the elite units often if you killed an elite the grunts and jackals would sort of freak out and run around panicking this was an actual tactical part of the gameplay at least on legendary difficulty not sure if the other halos have this or not so yeah i did just list a bunch of other old games that had the same thing but at least it wasnt just perfect dark same games do it through character dev and world building like in the witcher series geralt is treated with fear from the lowborn and blatant disrespect from the highborn the commoners know that you could cut them down easily and certain dialogue choices reflect this while people of higher station usually arent intimidated theres also plenty of army deserters in the game who obviously fled from a fight at some point mass effect renegade choices in all games had a fair bit of out of combat intimidation as well shepard comes off as a generally dangerous individual through certain dialogue choices i love bethesda but one of my bigger complaints about their games is that even some worthless thug will fight you to the death rather than run away or try to surrender this was doubly annoying with skyrim in particular because they always say i yield i yield and then proceed to fight you to the death
gaming,not_removed,this is in payday as well any character can force an officer to surrender if you have a certain perk you can even convince them to work for you
gaming,not_removed,nightfire did a similar thing but that was in like
gaming,not_removed,perfect dark the nonlicensed sequel to golden eye so great
gaming,not_removed,mgs v
gaming,not_removed,actual wizardry
gaming,not_removed,that looks a lot like a pulserifle
gaming,not_removed,unless i am misunderstanding this dont mgs enemies do the same thing since you could hold up an enemy
gaming,not_removed,games today take a colossal amount of planning this kind of detail is the sort of thing that one guy at a computer can come up with in his free time and just throw in there in the you still had relatively small development teams where this kind of organic development could take place in todays world where games typically have development teams in the hundreds and your tasks are specifically laid out in advance this kind of organic development is less common
gaming,not_removed,there is a perk in fallout that lets you sneak up behind enemies and disarm them at which point they surrender and stop fighting
gaming,not_removed,sigh i know like that spiritual successor to eternal darkness was shutdown after some weird kid and sex stuff
gaming,not_removed,okay i see thanks for explaining this to me
gaming,not_removed,yeah sure but watch them pull out a pistol the moment you look away not all of them do but it happens
gaming,not_removed,youll be surprised how games from years ago had the best team ai to date i think with all the advancements in technology over the years ai has either become stagnant or actually declined
gaming,not_removed,i have vivid memories of going on the map with the catwalk and large pit as well as subsequently shooting everyone on the catwalk with tranquilizer darts until theyd drunkenly fall to their deaths
gaming,not_removed,gotta get them dog tags yo
gaming,not_removed,you need to play metal gear solid v you can do much than just making them surrender when aiming at an enemy grunt
gaming,not_removed,you can disarm and hold up in bf hardline campaign
gaming,not_removed,metal gear solid did it for years just because most games dont want this in their game doesnt mean its beyond them
gaming,not_removed,it would happen in phantom pain if you snuck up behind someone with a gun drawn
gaming,not_removed,i think fallout did it right
gaming,not_removed,or it didnt work very well and added little to the game but le good ol days right
gaming,not_removed,you can do that same sort of stuff in metal gear games just saying
gaming,not_removed,fuck off cunt
gaming,not_removed,in titanfall when you execute an enemy any one near by freak the fuck out and run for cover
gaming,not_removed,in skyrim i cosplayed as banshee from x men and just screamed at everyone who would think to oppose me could you call that a bandit only if making someones skull cave in with your voice is a crime
gaming,not_removed,i call that the frieza syndrome
gaming,not_removed,exactly the character is on the ground down for the count begging for mercy so what idiot codes them to immediately start attacking maybe it was the same idiot who coded the ai so vampires still attack you even if youre a vampire
gaming,not_removed,they wanted to make them more believable but wound up dropping them into the middle of the uncanny valley
gaming,not_removed,heartbreaker mod is great for this allows you to rip out enemys hearts when they go down
gaming,not_removed,very interesting i have heard good things about titanfall campaign
gaming,not_removed,link
gaming,not_removed,it worked on the ai in titanfalls mp modes as well if you backed an enemy grunt into a corner with your titan and he didnt carry an antititan weapon hed surrender drop his weapon etc probably still works in attrition in titanfall
gaming,not_removed,fwiw ive had the same happen when i de cloak right behind the last guy as he whips around usually im mid punch by that point the single player requires momentum and follow through on the higher difficulties trying to fight without using your jump kit is suicide and using your jump kit leads to you fighting on instinct as you are going at kmh and aiming grenades and headshots at the same time
gaming,not_removed,ive seen it happen with a pilot
gaming,not_removed,perfect dark was simply the best shooter that had ever existed before halo came out better than goldeneye which i love dearly id go so far as to say it was better than half life at the time though half life was going for a different way to tell a story obviously i remember beating each single player campaign level on perfect agent was one of the hardest things in gaming ive ever done but i did it
gaming,not_removed,all without gamebreaking bugs there is one game breaking bug in the original american version where if you play one of the challenges there is a buffer overrun bug that corrupts the eeprom save data this was fixed in the other revisions of the game but yea perfect dark was a polished very thoughtful game that did a number of things that we dont see in modern fps games its genuinely irritating how dozens of highprofile aaa fps and tps games have enemies who dont actually surrender its so braindead you kill everything you come across the last of us for example all that money and polish and it was too hard to add a few lines of code so that surrendering enemies are actually surrendering so many games have ai that goes dont kill me dont kill me welp now im gonna attack you is it because your year old focus groups responded poorly to ai that behaves like human beings or something is that why basically no aaa videogames have ai that displays a selfpreservation instinct
gaming,not_removed,shit like this spoiled us now they call us entitled gamers but those of us who are older than remember shit being awesome and this feeling of omfg its only going to get better instead it didnt and began to stagnate we still get amazing things from time to time but the industry has taken more steps back than forward for example we focus hardcore on graphics and it seems more and more developers are focusing hardcore on marketing and getting sales than actually making a game that is amazing when are we going to get the next ai leap stealth games are still literally i hide behind this cover while you see the top of my head but nope im invisible oh and you cant hear me walk around you two feet away type games
gaming,not_removed,i can still hear that pinball grenade bouncing all over the room
gaming,not_removed,all without dlc it did require the expansion pak for full functionality
gaming,not_removed,this is why i have so little faith in the current games industry all the things you mentioned and more should be standard
gaming,not_removed,playercreated layouts was this on the xbox version i dont remember that on
gaming,not_removed,if dlc never goes away tho then not having dlc would be behind the times not ahead of its time
gaming,not_removed,dont forget proper bots its mindblowing that when you didnt have your friends over you could play or something with bots and you could have either dumb bots or wallhackaimbot bots
gaming,not_removed,i do remember there was one slight bug i had where you could unlock all the guns modeled after guns in goldeneye since pd was also made by rare by doing like shooting range challenges and i had completed all the challenges but one of the guns didnt unlock for some reason other than that i loved that game i wasnt lucky enough to get goldeneye growing up so that game was a great runnerup in my eyes shame the sequel was subpar
gaming,not_removed,more difficulty levels and difficulty beyond health gimmicks and number hell yes in campaign a more difficult mission asked you to complete several additional objectives some being quite long actually in multiplayer better bots diddnt mean more health or more damage they aimed better they moved faster across the map they had better tactics of which weapons to focus on etc
gaming,not_removed,i really miss old school era rare
gaming,not_removed,oh god i had forgotten fighting hordes of the meleeonly sims off in hit kill mode was amazing so much fun doing that with my buddy theyd eventually sync their deaths and spawn such that they would all attack at the same time and overrun us
gaming,not_removed,i always loved the emergent behaviors the different sims would manifest like how meatsims were totally useless with hitscan weapons because they aimed everywhere except straight at their target but would briefly turn into killing machines if they got a nonhitscan weapon and accidentally started leading their shots properly
gaming,not_removed,red faction on did something similar i guess theyre bringing it back on custom mobs in multiplayer matches it also had really fast movement speed custom weapon selections etc i liked perfect dark but i liked goldeneye more because my brother and i invested a lot of time in it by the time i had perfect dark we had started drifting apart i was starting to be more independent with hanging out with my siblings and started hanging out with friends online or with online friends
gaming,not_removed,you might even say it was perfect
gaming,not_removed,and then there was perfect dark zero shudder
gaming,not_removed,mgs ai would only surrender if you snuck up behind them and pointed a gun at their back theyll stay that way until an alarm is raised this carries over to the other games in perfect dark enemies will throw their weapons away and put their hands up if theyre scared the exact factors involved are a bit unclear if you take their main weapon during combat theyll sometimes surrender or sometimes try to use martial arts or sometimes pull a side arm sometimes theyll pull a side arm and then you blow away the person standing next to them and theyll throw the gun away
gaming,not_removed,goldeneye was just its predecessor is all perfect dark took goldeneye as a base and expanded upon everything tenfold
gaming,not_removed,perfect dark was definitely the better game but goldeneye was first and had the license so is more fondly remembered
gaming,not_removed,and viable couch play
gaming,not_removed,the multiplayer gave me a boner laptop gun was an amazing little sticky turret
gaming,not_removed,but if you shot their guns out of their hands they would put their hands up and surrender and then i took their hands anyway i was not a good jedi
gaming,not_removed,skedar snarling in the dark
gaming,not_removed,fear which came out
gaming,not_removed,halo
gaming,not_removed,its partially because ai is cpudriven and cputaxing and the already weak consoles are even weaker when it comes to cpu capabilities they have to develop for the lowest common denominator after all
gaming,not_removed,do you realize what youre saying dont you remember it was only a few years ago that call of duty ghosts bragged about their ai of how the fish swim away from you when you get to close
gaming,not_removed,basically the premise of fable
gaming,not_removed,this is in a lot of games
gaming,not_removed,i wish they would actually surrender reached a point when if a guy says he surrenders i switch to a paralysis or calm spell cast it on him and then i walk away
gaming,not_removed,ive heard this about titanfall do you have any footage of enemies surrendering and staying surrendered it only happens when youre in your mech correct
gaming,not_removed,hey games still have imagination and passion youre just sold it piecemeal now
gaming,not_removed,imagination and passion are two different dlcs or you can buy the season piss and get artistry as well itll only cost you the price of the fucking game to begin with
gaming,not_removed,most fps ai is not particularly good for one thing it is frequently deliberately crippled to stop players whining that the ai is cheating but one decent metric is does this ai behave kinda like a human being perfect darks ai isnt particularly smart it doesnt take cover for example although it will run to find other ai for support it supports grenade throwing interestingly but the ai only does it during one mission the cpu isnt powerful enough for complex ai calculations that said the ai can successfully use elevators and stuff like that which puts it light years beyond bethesdas stuff in fact ai in fpstps games using elevators to move around is actually pretty rare however the basic trait of human beings in a combat situation is self preservation and it just so happens that most fps and tps feature ai that has zero selfpreservation aside from randomly taking cover behind things mafia iii is an example of this the ai will lay on the ground bleeding to death and saying im not ready to die but it doesnt work conceptually because the ai displayed no genuine preservation instinct up until you shot them fatally a lot of the enemies in perfect dark are essentially security guards heavily armed security guards sure but security guards nonetheless theyre just doing their job they dont want to die why me they utter with their dying breath in deus ex mankind divided security guards will see a killer cyborg gun down a dozen people attacking him and none of them will do the blatantly logical thing and drop the gun and start begging no they act like brain dead psychopaths and proceed to attack him despite the blood and death and destruction that they have zero chance of surviving this is a basic design problem that screams to be fixed and most modern fps games feature it in fact of them do its almost like the ai coders have never researched a single mass shooting or anything like that
gaming,not_removed,if you were playing coop with an ai partner which was a rather interesting feature you could modify the ai behavior aggressive passive etc by holding down a and pressing z to cycle through the sub menus they put a lot of work into the ai behavior even though the cpu was obviously a huge limiting factor
gaming,not_removed,if i remember right they would also pick their guns back up and try to kill you if you turned your back on them only some of them
gaming,not_removed,uhhhhhmgs anyone all mgs characters do is drop their weapon when you point a gun at their backs like nightfire basically perfect darks ai will throw away its weapon if frightened for example if you wound them or kill their allies and surrender if you disarm them whether by physically disarming them or by shooting the gun from their hand sometimes they will surrender or sometimes they will pull out a handgun this handgun can sometimes be taken from them and sometimes they will throw it away of their own volition to surrender surrendered ai will sometimes attack you when your back is turned but this isnt the norm edit i do remember a cqc gun snatching move actually in mgs v but its super tricky to pull off especially on pc you have to press a button during a cqc combo and snake will snatch their gun and point it at them you cant shoot guns from peoples hands or make them surrender through intimidation though
gaming,not_removed,oh god yea arma ai is so fustrating going in a helo and just random headshot brings you out of the sky from a km away
gaming,not_removed,that was my favorite part of that level that and the fact that every so often when you play that part and do that sequence of events the other guy will instead say bah i never liked him anyway
gaming,not_removed,they will put their hands on their hips and start arching their back and whatnot thats just one of the standing around animations they did sorry kiddo nothing special there but your imagination
gaming,not_removed,what do you mean by this ive never actually seen the demons in doom actually do anything other than mindlessly try to kill you
gaming,not_removed,there was also swat global strike team where you had to intimidate armed enemies into surrendering i never played much of it but i think it involved shooting them in the legs and stuff like that but i could be wrong i really should give it another shot sometime
gaming,not_removed,disarming ai wasnt in the early mgs games but holding people up from behind to make them surrender was yes
gaming,not_removed,nightfire let you hold up enemies from behind dont recall anything more sophisticated eurocom were a very good developer they sorta tried to carry the torch for rareware in the fps genre in a lot of ways its a pity theyre gone now
gaming,not_removed,the nonlicensed sequel the term is spiritual sequel or spiritual successor if it was a nonlicensed sequel it wouldnt have been futuristicscifi with aliens and joanna would have been some lowbudget knockoff
gaming,not_removed,in perfect dark enemies will throw away their weapons and surrender unprompted you dont hold up enemies in perfect dark per se theres a system that isnt fully understoodvery well documented where if a pd enemy loses their weapon they will sometimes surrender or theyll pick up their gun again or theyll pull out a pistol theyll sometimes throw away their gun if you wing them wounded enemies will sometimes flee to find other npcs for reinforcements and they leave a blood trail you can follow theyll cross the entire level to find friendly npcs and warn them if necessary or if you kill other npcs in their presence sometimes theyll pull out a pistol and then throw it away its a rather complex system that is likely smoke and mirrors to a degree but it feels real mgs v allows you to steal weapons and hold them up but in the only surrendering mechanic is pointing a gun at peoples backs
gaming,not_removed,well it had more to do with the kickstarter failing denis dyack was a rather talented developer with terrible project management skills kojima was a fan of eternal darkness which is why silicon knights were assigned to make twin snakes
gaming,not_removed,indeed and in my view the fact it sometimes happens is what sells the effect it introduces a variable players have to be wary of and it prevents the ai from being too predictable
gaming,not_removed,first time mgs player eh
gaming,not_removed,or it didnt work very well and added little to the game it added a great deal to the game its not really a controversial statement that most modern games are heavily streamlined mechanically compared to rarewares work
gaming,not_removed,with all due respect i think the proper response is to either talk about pds ai or cite really good examples of modern ai that dont get the love they deserve like titanfall apparently modern games with features like this do exist but theyre rare
gaming,not_removed,despite this being an obvious example i want to take it one step further and say that fallout suffered even worse from this you can be listening in on a conversation between raiders talking about how terrible the world is and how they want to retire from their ways but the very moment your heavily armored head is visible to them instant gunfight to the death it seems like a raider wielding a pipe wrench would think twice about charging a fully decked out tesla power armor suit wielding a minigun
gaming,not_removed,why would other vampires not attack you
gaming,not_removed,maybe it was the same idiot who coded the ai so vampires still attack you even if youre a vampire just a note about software development and if you like a slight insight into how complex legal systems work its not that someone coded the ai vamps to attack you if youre a vampire its that no one ever coded the ai vamps not to attack you if youre a vampire also ai vamps will attack thats what theyre meant to do something needs to be added to tell it to not attack you if youre also a vamp
gaming,not_removed,yes but what are they going to do after they yield they cant run off because that would look weird since you just stabbed them and where are they going to run if you are in a dungeon are they just going to stand there or should the developer add some dialog after they yield then you have to remember that skyrim is a long game and a lot of enemies surrender in the game so then you have to have a conversation with every enemy that surrenders that would quickly become annoying especially if you have the same conversation with them all so then the developer would have to change the dialog to where the enemy have maybe different things they can say after they surrender which sounds easy enough until you remember you need a multiple voice actor to say these lines and thats expensive if they just stand still without saying anything how long are they going to stand there and what happens if you decide to leave and come back are they still there what if enemies surrender at the same time that would be hilarious so in the end the developer figures out that having the enemy attacking you afterwards would be the simplest solution to the problem and the only people complaining about it will be people on a website years after the game comes out
gaming,not_removed,imo it has the best purefps campaign ive played in years borderlands doesnt count since its a fpsrpg ive played a lot of different single player campaigns before but its incredibly rare for me to gain the emotional attachment to any character within a plot the last game that i had any emotional connection with an in game character was mass effect titanfall allowed me to form an emotional attachment with in a hour campaign which i thought was next to near impossible to do in this day and age
gaming,not_removed,let me sell you on the campaign imagine i robot as a buddy cop film but the robot is stories tall and works best with you at its helm you get some amazing dialogue and as the titan learns the about the main character it begins to banter i suggest you do not surrender vocal analysis indicates that the imc is lying pilot you dont really think im that stupid bt i have insufficient data to assess your mental aptitude or my personal favorite pilot there is an advanced titan weapon here it may give us a tactical advantage pilot sounds like someone is in love the human perception of love requires commitment attraction devotion admiration and respect conclusion i am in love
gaming,not_removed,the titanfall campaign is pleasantly surprising witty emotional epic and brilliant its also just smooth and plain fun
gaming,not_removed,alright i just beat the campaign and as far as fps go this was my favorite overall campaign the combat is very fluid and fast the missions are short enough you dont hate them the story line is really well done with great voice acting the graphics are great and have a smooth appearance its one of those rare shooters where you develop an attachment to a character especially a robot the campaign is a perfect mix of difficult and fun even on master difficulty with boss fights that feel rewarding ive yet to touch the multiplayer though
gaming,not_removed,cough hidden titanfall ad cough
gaming,not_removed,zelda
gaming,not_removed,dont have a video but apparently that behaviour was scripted in titanfall i only noticed now because i was going for the annihilation achievement in titanfall the wiki article lists their different behaviours httptitanfallwikiacomwikigrunt
gaming,not_removed,it was a different experience the game did the standard health and number of enemies upgrades for perfect agent but more than that it changed how they fought and moved in small ways they aimed faster dodged more often didnt waste time before shooting they still had exploitable moments but it worked well and the missions themselves changed i remember the first time i went through the villa mission on perfect on the other difficulties you drop down at range and have to snipe a couple of gunmen before they execute your agencys planet negotiator on perfect agent youre the negotiator insteadstarting the mission at a different spot with different weapons and different goals it was intense
gaming,not_removed,bold statements boyo bold statements think youre forgetting doom and system shock though
gaming,not_removed,ai has been lacking its honestly the weakest area of game development as far as time and money go and progress its just so disappointing
gaming,not_removed,a few lines of code all this and you couldnt add a few ounces of metal to cover the building in gold
gaming,not_removed,skyrim is one of the worst offenders in this case they have surrendering available for important characters you beat them down and they turn friendly for you to talk to why couldnt they do the same for bandits or others who attack you instead essential characters forsworn or any random enemy that you get to the ground doesnt surrender they just yell i give up and then once they get back up they attack you full force fortunately mods
gaming,not_removed,i am alive did it well
gaming,not_removed,mgsv the enemies surrendered its just the type of game whats the point of it in a fps where your just killing people soldier of fortune had ai that would too but it was a game all about reactions to bullets which leads to the next topic why is it so hard to have enemies that react realistically to being shot
gaming,not_removed,the only other aaa title i remember that has surrendering enemies is the batman arkham games
gaming,not_removed,yeah but then theyd also have to write a line of code for when u decide to go have a beer with the surrendering ai and then maybe have the ai behave accordingly to when the players groping the ai and then have the ai give birth to your randomly generated baby ai im kidding they could at least run off to a player restricted zone and say screw this im done idk dont the tlou surrendering ai like only attack you when you have your back turned or guards down
gaming,not_removed,im pretty sure that having enemies surrender is not due to coding difficulty but rather to make the game more difficult its not difficult to have the game say if player character points gun at enemys back enemy surrender they put up their hands and then attack you because it could be construed as a realistic action surrendering and then attacking is an element of surprise its not like other games dont have enemies surrendering either look at every single metal gear solid game look at any halo game when the grunts are outnumbered or the battle isnt going well they run around screaming in terror its the same thing as surrendering
gaming,not_removed,uhh in tlou its a fucking post apocalyptic worldif was actually surrendering and then you turned your back to them do you really think they wouldnt do anything nah son first chance they get they would knock you the fuck out what kind of dumb ass person would just sit there surrendering and then not try to take down their enemy after they put their gun awayturn around
gaming,not_removed,the n grenade with its little black holes and the fact that they only did enough damage to disorient the shit out of you ugh
gaming,not_removed,how to get a nervous breakdown in perfect dark make a grenadeonly match activate the unlimited ammo cheat select a map with a lot of corridors and as little as open space as possible proceed to throw tons of pinball grenades in all directions for those who dont get it the grenade secondary mode was pinball it would bounce on every surface like an elastic ball until eventually flying close to someone and exploding like a proximity mine it produced a very characteristic sound at every bounce and let a trail of colored smoke when youre walking nervously around the map and hearing the boing sounds of dozens of grenades nearby you
gaming,not_removed,but to be fair at least the had realized on release that it was limited on the hardware side and had not only planned to allow players to upgrade but did it with an addon instead of a whole new console it wasnt optimum but it opened up options for pd and other games players wouldnt have otherwise been able to make use of
gaming,not_removed,oh yeah you put the weapons where you want and picked the weapons i mean it wasnt map development but you got to build your own game modes from scratch anything from one on one fist fights to twelveplayer well fourplayer and bots throwing knife laser and grenade deathmatches all on
gaming,not_removed,ill never forget with two friends against a single darksim
gaming,not_removed,hehe what sequel right at least we never got perfect dark nuts bolts though
gaming,not_removed,we used to play king of the hill vs fistsims with perfect difficulty zombies with the disarming ability and the dizziness factor of melee hits they were much more damaging empty handed than youd think
gaming,not_removed,or even dark oh wait i think i screwed it up
gaming,not_removed,the laptop gun was my ting same with that alien sniper rifle that could see heat signatures through walls i was that guy
gaming,not_removed,i think the xbox hd port is the best version since it fixed the framerate issue of the version
gaming,not_removed,wait i remember perfect dark fondly but i dont know which one i had was zero the one where you start at the top of a skyscraper or was that the original
gaming,not_removed,huh interesting i didnt remember that sounds like something that would definitely be possible for devs today maybe no one has just put a priority on it would definitely be very cool and go a long way to making ais more believable kind of reminds me of that comic for skyrim where the bear is like that dude just took out a dragoni can take him xd
gaming,not_removed,it also sold a lot more copies perfect dark got kinda screwed being released so close to the next gen not nearly as many people played it as should have
gaming,not_removed,make your sacrifice to the god of war
gaming,not_removed,true fear had superior ai i loved how they would flank you at every opportunity or how theyd get scared shitless if you killed all their teammates and stuff the gunplay in fear was also awesome dropkicking dudes in the face and shotgunning them was amazing its weird how excellent features of certain games are just not continued in other games of the same type youd think that people would adopt the tried and true gameplays of the genre but instead it feels like a lot of titles are not improving and in some cases even regressing
gaming,not_removed,weaker than an lol
gaming,not_removed,which is why i and many many other people loved the fuck out of fable
gaming,not_removed,i know of some that seem to implement some system like this but i certainly dont know of very many the elder scrolls and fallout series certainly do not incorporate this i didnt notice it in dragons dogma or the dragon age series none of the souls games or bloodborne have it in fact the only rpg in recent memory that i can think of that has this or something similar is fable
gaming,not_removed,couldnt find any animated footage they have a chance to slump down and drop their weapon when you keep aiming at them as a titan httpimgurcomaylwtg
gaming,not_removed,yeah but its not an industry standard now
gaming,not_removed,its because it pulls out the rug on the illusion of the game being a remotely plausible scenario i suspect by the end of practically any shooter you have one man ramboed your way through several hundred people across multiple large areas and been shot hundreds of time without much effect you are the terminator essentially everyone on earth would know about the massacres and the army or other large authority would be mobilized enemies acting plausibly a part of the time begs the question of why as soon as anyone realizes who you are they all dont flee in terror or nuke the site from orbit its a small sacrifice in realistic behavior to make the entire thing remotely believable and fun
gaming,not_removed,ive never seen another game do that
gaming,not_removed,in you could disarm enemies if you held the aim button while after which they would surrender
gaming,not_removed,oh good nice to know he doesnt actually care about his buddy
gaming,not_removed,i think you just ruined his life man oh man i cant believe those game developers were so sneaky and clever years later everythings a lieeeeee
gaming,not_removed,when your down to just you and a low level imp or hell razer theyll scramble and jump to find somewhere to hide from you because they know they cant stop you by themselves the zombies are too stupid to hide but the next level of monsters you can tell they really dont want to be there at times
gaming,not_removed,really if theres only one left the imp will usually run and hide and the hellrazers always run from you and try to find a better ambush point
gaming,not_removed,you know i dont disagree i loved the enemies in perfect dark on the original version i made it an effort to get all cheats etc a surrendered guard can be your death on higher difficulties if they decide to screw you over after all so i always just punched them after they surrendered haha
gaming,not_removed,he said modern and thats the most modern iteration
gaming,not_removed,the metro games have that problem as well although youre just playing as a normal teen in them so intimidation isnt your strongpoint thankfully they did include the knockout mechanic in the second game so you could punch out any guards you sympathized with before going on a rampage
gaming,not_removed,not just that think about how many times you can knock the weapon out of their hand and they will just keep picking it back up if you get your gun shot out of your hand and someone is still pointing a gun at you but hasnt killed you yet maybe running to pick it back up isnt such a smart move unless you live in the fallout universe of course
gaming,not_removed,because ai vampires dont attack other ai vampires random vampires will walk by each other with no issue sometimes theyll do the usual random npc banter stuff but for no logical reason if you meet a random vampire in skyrim it will try to kill you despite the fact youre also a vampire theres no logic behind it other than bethesda being lazy about species
gaming,not_removed,someone made a mod that handled this they simply turned nonhostile it really wasnt the difficult situation you are imagining
gaming,not_removed,i can get attached to a character if they are well written but it takes time i think bt took me about an hour to start feeling protective of i stop piloting him the instant there are anti titan weapons deployed so i can get to them faster and take them out before he takes damage all because i feel like i owe lastimosa a character i knew for about minutes i dont know where the writing came from but damn is it good and these are some of the best characters ive worked with so far
gaming,not_removed,have you played the new doom its the purestfps game possible
gaming,not_removed,imo it has the best purefps campaign ive played in years
gaming,not_removed,an emotional attachment is that campaignlol thats sad i thought it was one of the most linear boring campaigns with the same enemies except bosses that ive ever played and the boss fights arent even hard
gaming,not_removed,that sounds awesome i was greatly disappointed in titanfall campaign glad to see has done better
gaming,not_removed,i loved the in love comment my favorite so far was when bt says after further analysis they should no longer take short cuts
gaming,not_removed,witty banter ive never seen that in a game from a quirky companion sold
gaming,not_removed,idk how not funny lines will sellmy a game
gaming,not_removed,im someone who isnt interested in mp so ill be picking up titanfall for the campaign eventually
gaming,not_removed,girl zelda
gaming,not_removed,i remember my first time doing that holy crap my heart was racing
gaming,not_removed,there was only a year and a half between perfect dark and halo ce which to me is strange as it feels like longer i would argue too that unreal tournament which came out half a year before pd would be a better shooter although perfect dark was most certainly handicapped as it was a console based game versus a pc game so the limitations were greater i mean half of the pd game wasnt available unless you had the hardware expansion for your nintendo
gaming,not_removed,it kind of makes sense as ai is hard to sell as a marketing point you cant show a screenshot of ai and its hard to demonstrate in a video without someone explaining the process happening
gaming,not_removed,i think it is the rise of online multiplayer gameplay why bother creating more advanced ai when you can have the player play against other humans and with that they can sell more consoles and games
gaming,not_removed,based some examples ive read i think negative player feedback may play a role developers are unwilling to write better more human game ai because players tend to react negatively to it its a controversial example for a controversial game but the thief team claimed they wrote very good ai for the game that could figure out where a player had gone based on various cues and then had to dismantle it because players didnt like the ai being too smart players aka the dreaded play testers tend to react poorly to unpredictable ai thats why fps games resorted to ai that screams what its doing at the tops of its lungs reloading and stuff like that fears ai is not very good aside from some clever wont run through a door and get shot by player stuff but because it constantly announces every little thing it is doing players react well to it i figure that pdstyle ai that surrenders and very rarely tries to pull a fast one will attract far more complaints from that type of playtester than skyrimstyle ai that tries to pull a fast one every single time in fact they might consider the former to be a bug
gaming,not_removed,theres two reasons ai is really lacking today the first is that modern console hardware is heavily tilted towards graphical hardware because screenshots and video sell there really isnt a whole lot of spare cpu overhead on consoles pc is different to have really powerful ai the second is that games these days typically offer the player a lot more freedom than they used to making ai incredibly complicated if you want it to do much more than the very basics i agree though i wish more effort would be put into the ai for modern games
gaming,not_removed,it actually only requires a very small amount of gold to cover a large area since its so malleable
gaming,not_removed,which skyrim mod would you recommend for resolving that design annoyance im planning on replaying skyrim with the new special edition once they fix the overcompressed audio
gaming,not_removed,sometimes other times you were trapped in the arena until you killed the surrendering dudes
gaming,not_removed,enemies in assassins creed run away if you kill most of their squad
gaming,not_removed,if was actually surrendering and then you turned your back to them do you really think they wouldnt do anything people who arent idiot psychopaths would stay down what kind of dumb ass person would just sit there surrendering and then not try to take down their enemy after they put their gun awayturn around because they have a gun and you dont and they will murder the shit out of you just like the other corpses littering the room
gaming,not_removed,it kinda sounds like a ricochet
gaming,not_removed,oh got it i thought you meant make your own maps
gaming,not_removed,slow motion aztec wrist crossbow only one hit kill head up to the main room enjoy the matrix fights
gaming,not_removed,i liked to do all lasers and onehitkills jousting
gaming,not_removed,dude growing up my sister and i made a zombies mode where the players were on one team and the bots were on the other team the bots were set to slappers only everything was a oneshot kill the ai was set to the hardest difficulty and turbo mode was on it was absolute madness
gaming,not_removed,my favorite was one hit kills pistols only slow mo
gaming,not_removed,i remember i made a map game mode called death day it was set in the temple with all explosive weapons i remember the weapons were grenades superdragon slayer rocket launcher annihilator and the phoenix pistol which was good for shooting down tracking rockets with the explosive secondary fire add in bots and youd hear constant explosions it was so good
gaming,not_removed,let me guess darksim won
gaming,not_removed,kinda dark interms of plot amazing level was carrington defense the whole menu you could walk away from and explore became a battle ground
gaming,not_removed,the guns really made that game its not very often that you see interesting guns anymore in video games i remember trying to use the slayers flybywire and just totally failing
gaming,not_removed,the farsight getting sniped through walls was infuriating
gaming,not_removed,the slayer was amazing i spent hours remotely controlling the rockets it was awesome
gaming,not_removed,watched the whole video i remember back then being completely impressed by the reload animations i still find them quite classy though very fast
gaming,not_removed,i was partial to the reaper those skedar know how to waste bullets
gaming,not_removed,yes and no fantastic port performs beautifully but some of the art design changes are a littlelarge bit grating its also on the xbo as part of the rare replay collection its a shame were unlikely to ever see it officially on pc its definitely far more playable than the version thanks to the beautiful locked
gaming,not_removed,zero was the game that launched with the not the original the original was just called perfect dark no additional affixes to the title and was released for in may of and later on the xbox arcade in the picture in the op is from perfect dark heres the for pdz if it helps as well as a pdz didnt have nearly the selection of guns as the original did and had a loadout system similar to some modern shooters which basically allowed only guns at a time the story wasnt particularly good and its multiplayer was honestly pretty shitty this is of course all compared to the original as a standalone game it was ok but compared to the game the only real improvement was the graphics
gaming,not_removed,skyrims problem is that like many games it has enemies that scream for mercy but immediately try to kill you as soon as their health has regenerated its absolutely stupid and theres no reason why they cant stay down and then quietly disappear when the player has broken line of sight
gaming,not_removed,even the sequels didnt have as great ai it was mostly scripted in the first game by the level designers but it still looks smooth and smart even today
gaming,not_removed,nope but the cpus are taxed by lots of background trash like the ui overlays and features like taking stupid screenshots of gameplay to paste them on facebook for no one to care about then on top of that the devs squeeze every bit of power out of the gpucpu to try to get their game to run smooth at even less than resolutions it doesnt leave a lot of room for something you cant easily adjust or scale like ai
gaming,not_removed,chicken kicker
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i was making a poor joke
gaming,not_removed,the thing is what youve just described should be treated like a problem rather than a product turning the player into a god isnt the only way to make a game
gaming,not_removed,there are very few games where you can actually disarm people or scare them there are some games that feature some kind of surrendering mechanic as folks have noted below but almost never to the extent pd did fallout has an intimidation perk but its basically a press f on character to make them stop fighting gimmick its not a proper midcombat i give up i give up deal where the ais action is unscripted per se i dont know why its so hard for developers to implement this when so many of them have characters that pretend to surrender yet get back up again moments later the fact enemies in pd will throw away their weapon and surrender is something that you basically never see even other games that let you shoot the gun out of the enemys hand for example dont have unprompted surrendering shoot gun from hand theyll always surrender as seen in some of the star wars fps games is too cheap
gaming,not_removed,easily explainable by them being in the same clan
gaming,not_removed,so bandits attack me even if im a man or elf
gaming,not_removed,then people would find it ridiculous that they just stand there neutral as the majority would still slaughter them and some would complain that they do not do anything and ask for having voices or something to do with them death is a clear absolute state that everyone gets interaction ended just like mario removed goombas from the screen
gaming,not_removed,screw that the team they are in game like for minutes and i love them i would love titanfall made ala sw republic commando so i can play as pilots
gaming,not_removed,really i never got attached to any of them just all of them were too generic actually i take that back i would start liking the villians only for them to immediately die i fucking wish ash was the main villian of the game attention everyone i have set this facility to selfdestruct some of you may be thinking this may be overkill and youre right
gaming,not_removed,wanted to say this doom is fantastic
gaming,not_removed,i downloaded the demo a few months back but have yet to purchase the full copy what i saw i thoroughly enjoyed but im a bit short on funds atm due to saving up for a new graphics cardcables so thats been put on hold for now
gaming,not_removed,i wish i could upvote this more i rarely play first person shooters but this game was so much fun and the campaign was absolutely incredible
gaming,not_removed,well titanfall actual campaign got cut because they ran out of money the training thing in the final game was just them doing what they could
gaming,not_removed,in one loading screen reassess definition of a shortcut
gaming,not_removed,humor is subjective i wasnt selling you on the game i was selling op on it you must be fun at parties
gaming,not_removed,guysguyswhat if zelda was a girl
gaming,not_removed,thats true the only game that pulled it off in recent memory is alien isolation they pitched the ai as great and it was indeed pretty good ai granted the game would have sucked if the xenomorph was a moron
gaming,not_removed,and theres other reasons games tend to focus on multiplayer these days so the ones that could benefit the most from better ai often skip it because its easier and cheaper and call of duty might be the worst offender enemy ai amounts to run forward in groups and increasing difficulty simply makes them more accurate shots that deal more damage i think the biggest disappointment for me here is the latter gta games theres a lot of potential to make some good ai routines and i can see from a cost standpoint why that hasnt happened yet but i still feel like its going to eventually become the big selling point for new games in the series even gta v had a few steps back from iv though particularly in cop ai
gaming,not_removed,i think a good balance would be smart ai thats easy to kill instead of dumb bullet sponges
gaming,not_removed,im a bit late to the party but what you described is basically the reason personally my work in ai has been focused on crowd behaviour but i had the pleasure of speaking to andrew rowse who among other things worked on the ai for the in batman arkham city apparently that fight used to be a lot more difficult because the ai was clever enough to not only predict where youve jumped off to but also where you were running to and what youre attempting to do so the boss would intercept players instead of chasing them stupidly and preemptively attack players with his ranged attack before getting visual confirmation the playtesters hated this thinking the ai was simple and lazy on the assumption that the game just told him where they were at all times some also insisted he was teleporting behind them and shooting through walls because they did not see him so in some cases an advanced humanlike ai can become indistinguishable from an ai thats just cheating and they did not want that so they scrapped a lot of his mechanics its still a nice boss though
gaming,not_removed,the problem is the disconnect between the actual intelligence of the ai and the players perception of that intelligence making enemies constantly shout what theyre doing is an easy shortcut to increasing the latter because players dont always notice clever behavior unless the ai constantly shouts whenever they do it unfortunately it does precisely nothing to make them actually more intelligent i actually wish more ais were capable of deception it would be interesting if for example theyd sometimes shout reloading when they still have ammo only to shoot the player when they pop up unfortunately that seems unlikely to happen since many players would complain about the buggy ai
gaming,not_removed,based some examples ive read i think negative player feedback may play a role developers are unwilling to write better more human game ai because players tend to react negatively to it sometimes i wish devs take the chance on selling to the minority not everyone playing an fps wants it to be a power fantasy
gaming,not_removed,its the kind of thing that doesnt show up in screenshots
gaming,not_removed,i concur when ive seen people discussing ai like civ ai they talk about being unable to fully predictunderstand it or it being untruthful as bad features even though these would be key in a really good ai
gaming,not_removed,seemed to work pretty well in the last mgs
gaming,not_removed,did you just say fears ai isnt good granted a lot of it is hardwired into certain parts of the level it performs excellently for intents and purposes if you remove their constant vocal announcements with modding the game is quite challenging
gaming,not_removed,am i the only one who is tired of every other game being openworld with repetetive mission and sidequests also today´s trend of everything glowing and saying what button to press even in last missions press e to open the door press e to climb the ladder doesn´t matter that you already did that xy times before in that game even better if it´s really linear game and there is nowhere else to go than climb the ladder but it will glow and say what to press maybe there will be even cursor flying so you know where to go in the tunnel and maybe it will be even written as part of the mission so you wont forget to climb the only ladder in whole linear tunnel glowing kilometeres away with minimap and trail to the ladder i mean come on
gaming,not_removed,uh really when the came out it had close to the worlds most powerful cpu even the government and military were buying them in bulk to make cheap super computers out of them if anything i would say its the opposite the graphic cards were out dated before the machines were even released which forced development you cut a lot of corners i think the devs are the reason but i highly doubt it was cpu overhead
gaming,not_removed,hence why he said a few ounces to cover a building
gaming,not_removed,my main point was that to everyone not footing the bill it seems like such a simple quick task a few lines of code is usually a rather complex thing
gaming,not_removed,sorry i dont know any ive done a lot of mod browsing but not nearly enough mod testing no gaming pc and even if i had ive yet to encounter one theres bound to be something though
gaming,not_removed,ttheres a guy over there blam blam im the guy im the guy you tell your friends the guys goin to be around for a looooong fuckin time
gaming,not_removed,buddy its a post apocalyptic game the circumstances are not the same as they would be in normal every day situations think a little every one is fighting to survive so what little chance they get to get the upper hand they will take it it seems to me like if you were ever put into such a situation we would know what your outcome would be rip
gaming,not_removed,thanks ricochet thats the word i was looking for disclaimer nonnative speaker pleasedonthateme
gaming,not_removed,aztec was amazing but then all of the holdover goldeneye maps were just great facilityfelicity is still my favorite of course
gaming,not_removed,not always weeps silently
gaming,not_removed,i got way too good at guiding missiles i remember we needed of us to complete that last scenario in multiplayer where you were in slow motion against perfect sims we figured out a strategy to get from our random spawns to one room with only two entrances in the same direction the room had super dragon spawns and we knew the other spawn so a player could grab one on their way to the room we would have one player in the middle of the room by the lower door so we could tell when the ai was approaching on radar and the other would fire grenades at the above doorway main entrance to the room and decimate the perfect sims before they could turn the corner and wreck havoc on us when we figured out that strategy we placed my little bro on radar duty and my friend his little brother and i were on grenade launcher duty we had to time our grenades one after another as to not run out of ammo only one ammo box in the room for super dragons when we finally beat it we felt like we had accomplished something fuck perfect sims
gaming,not_removed,plus it had autotracking of enemies so it was op as fuck but so much fun
gaming,not_removed,ok good i had the original perfect dark then thanks
gaming,not_removed,the devs squeeze every bit of power out of the gpucpu to try to get their game to run smooth at even less than resolutions not true we make the game then when were done we optimise until its fast enough usually it starts off pretty poor ive worked on a game that was running at when the optimisation pass started but also usually we could get a hell of a lot more out of it its just that its a waste of time most games have crap ai because most players dont like good ai and when youve a choice between spending your budget on something noone wants vs something most people want itll always go to the latter
gaming,not_removed,i actually forgot about that perk chain in but i still would like it to be better fleshed out rather than just based on lvl
gaming,not_removed,i was making fun of modern games
gaming,not_removed,scenarios where youre extemely powerful and kill a lot of people are the bread and butter of a huge chunk of video games and remain very very popular dont think thats changing any time soon it is a tonal issue and plausibility issue quite often though id agree how often can nate drake kill people before his adventures are no longer light hearted fun
gaming,not_removed,the only thing that is remotely comparable is the hold up mechanic in mgs but its not something that can happen without certain prerequisites being met like the enemy being unaware of you while you come up behind them with your gun drawn or the enemy having been knocked out and then waking up with a gun on them in the event that they have a weapon they will either put it down and comply or try to slash you with a combat knife
gaming,not_removed,ttodd howard is that you ha in all seriousness that isnt a bad point but it still feels lazy when you meet alva in morthal she knows youre a vampire and tells you that the town belongs to her group she doesnt just randomly try to murder you it wouldnt have hurt to eve make them semihostile so that they tell you to back off and attack if you get too close random vampires treating you exactly like a human who wandered where they shouldnt have is bizarre
gaming,not_removed,could be wrong but iirc in morrowind there are vampires hiding in crypts all over the island and they wont attack the player if theyre part of the same clan
gaming,not_removed,yeah but not if youre a bandit checkmate
gaming,not_removed,there are plenty of characters that already wander the world that you have little or no interaction with if they turn nonhostile they just go back to doing what they were doing before you arrived its already been tested by the many people who installed the mod and all the fantasy scenarios you are coming up to justify bethesdas laziness are simply not an issue
gaming,not_removed,yeah it was really neat being able to fight alongside a team of fellow pilots for a bit instead of expendable grunts that die in a few minutes
gaming,not_removed,getting a new graphics card for it wouldnt be a bad idea you gotta enjoy it in its full glory what card are you planning on getting
gaming,not_removed,i lost it there
gaming,not_removed,yeah humor is subjective then dont show it to op knowing is not fun to all op or me you cant sell games by simply putting fun lines im glad i dont have to use this humor at my parties do proper feedback and stop salt
gaming,not_removed,id hit fo sho
gaming,not_removed,really i thought the ai in ai hueh was weak the only time it could ever catch you was by cheating and dropping in from right above you although it deserves props for not just letting you hide under a table right next to it
gaming,not_removed,oh you mean like instead of making it so the difficulty level increasing just means im a fucking tissue and the enemies are all demigods we make it so the difficulty level increasing just makes the enemies more intelligent i hated playing legendary in the halo games for exactly this reason it didnt make any fucking sense master chief is this supposed space badass that could flip a tank but needed two hits or more to kill an enemy or how you have shields which are supposedly better than the ones the covenant have according to lore but on that difficulty you might as well be wearing an extra layer of cotton over your armor while the enemies have shields that take a full magazine to take down
gaming,not_removed,see this is the thing the problem with making game ai smart is that players are stupid
gaming,not_removed,this is exactly the problem the line between a clever ai and a cheating ai can be difficult for the average player to discern and most players are far more used to dealing with cheating ais than clever ones so its the easier assumption to make
gaming,not_removed,thats the thing though you can make realistic ai without making them super intelligent back to the example of ai surrendering you can code ai to have a hostile squad fall back after taking too many losses without making them perfect tacticians one thing that ive never seen is ai that tries to treat wounded and extract woundeddead if possible if you throw a grenade at a group of guys kill six then hide the six still alive will eventually be like sucks to be those nerds lol and go back to aimlessly walking around also boss fights are generally the least enjoyable things about games for me as theyre all about timing and big elaborate moves by the boss done in a predictable manner
gaming,not_removed,but the majority is where the money is and money talks
gaming,not_removed,its hard being black and trying to buy video games
gaming,not_removed,did you just say fears ai isnt good in fear its largely fairly simple smoke and mirrors the ai performs a simple flanking move on occasion and will sometimes refuse to move through doorways if the player is on the other side the cover system is borderline broken in places with the ai tipping over objects that cant actually provide any cover they seem to lack the ability to prioritise cover the ai doesnt really coordinate or anything like that and its navigation is weak fear was a rather significant upgrade in terms of tactics and the cover system if you remove their constant vocal announcements with modding the game is quite challenging the fact everything is a bullet sponge is a factor there another factor that heavily works in fear ais favor is the heavy use of particle effects every gunshot brings a spray of partciles huge clouds of debris and smoke that you cant see through but the ai can the problem with ai is fears ai strikes a decent balance where it is highly flawed but the average player probably isnt going to notice
gaming,not_removed,on the one hand this is really helpful for gamers who dont get to play often and especially casual gamers who arent used to which keys are obvious like e for interact on the other hand rise of the tomb raider kept putting me in rooms with only one or two objects to interact with and i eventually stopped playing because it just wouldnt stop with the handholding after two or three hours
gaming,not_removed,ubisoft games examples of misusing an openworld taking out the repetitive side missions and collectables most of their games can be finished quickly
gaming,not_removed,seriously this openworld thing needs to stop once in a great while its amazing stalker comes to mind but for the most part they act like the gigantic level the player is wandering around in is the game itself lazy design everything ends up looking the same anyway as they just keep reusing the same assets over and over ohh wow another dungeon cool i guess
gaming,not_removed,whoops i thought you were being sarcastic my bad
gaming,not_removed,oh trust me i know im a developer
gaming,not_removed,but its only seventeen lines
gaming,not_removed,aw fuck hey see ya later
gaming,not_removed,it seems to me like if you were ever put into such a situation we would know what your outcome would be rip id be alive because i wouldnt be moronic enough to try and kill the heavily armed guy who just demonstrated his skills in front of me by murdering every else and leaving me alive i would not attempt to kill chuck norris okay
gaming,not_removed,i once won a against darksim technique first only pistols they would murder me with better weapons second camping i put myself in a corridor in skedar arena with dual pistols and the shield and closely monitored the radar to know when he would burst in front of me worked most of the time but he would damage me pretty bad at each encounter it generally took him less than seconds to respawn find dual pistols plus shield and get back at attacking me
gaming,not_removed,yeah it wasnt executed perfectly but the idea was there and wasnt terrible
gaming,not_removed,vampires are dumb i cured their disease with a lowly bandits soul they had me in their castle and didnt kill me im going to ride a dragon right to their front door and slaughter them all
gaming,not_removed,in dragonborn the werebears dont initially attack you but eventually will if you dont leave and you arent a werewolf i think the vampire thing is probably just an oversight
gaming,not_removed,yeah that was kinda my point the three clans in morrowind hated eachother
gaming,not_removed,isnt anyone playing skyrim technically the singlemost powerful bandit to ever live
gaming,not_removed,it was more a comment on general but why havent they coded that if you get familiar with how software development work not only games youll recognize that sometimes the logic behind some choices is development driven and doing some stuff that add little practical value and will bother but not really this dont stop anyone from playing of your audience might get scrapped in favor of more important stuff it would have been nice sure but laziness is not the main reason plus mods are more easily accepted if they are a little unpolished the main devs have a harder time delivering something random and with small practical purpose why havent you spent your time on x important feature
gaming,not_removed,one of the after comparing my ti with the ti and the it felt like the was the best bang for buck that i could afford
gaming,not_removed,i dont think you understand what the word subjective means httplmgtfycomqsubjective
gaming,not_removed,there was a point in the late early when every developer lauded ai as an important part of the improvementsfeatures in their game nowadays people prefer heavy scripting over ai
gaming,not_removed,the ai was pretty neat the alien would learn how you played like if you use lockers a lot the alien checks it more often same with vents and tables it gets accustomed to the flamethrower and gets more brave if you overuse it it gets wise to your noisemakers i mean its fairly simple but the ai was really what made the game if the alien was overly predictable then it wouldnt have been nearly as scary unless you played on easy then it doesnt learn at all the ai is really nerfed
gaming,not_removed,theres signs that its right above you though drooling for exanple so i dont consider it cheating
gaming,not_removed,more than anything i hated the spawning in halo legendary reach was the worst and the last one i did halos so good about showing the ships coming in dropping enemies etc but in legendary they just sort of pop up feet from you without warning
gaming,not_removed,youre so right with the halo part you beautiful beautiful bastard i dont think we should increase the intelligence level of the enemies with harder difficulty settings because this could be detrimental to the experience when playing on a lower difficulty setting i think itd be great to have intelligent enemies that go from easytokill to normaltokill depending of the difficulty level maybe there could be more enemies on harder levels unless that turns out like the grenade spamming in modern warfare on a sidenote i think harder difficulty levels should opt for a smaller level of handholding in terms of visual and textual cues
gaming,not_removed,true its more about the behaviors at their disposal than about the smart tactics they use the behaviors have to be clearly visible by the player and have to be somewhat predictable otherwise the player thinks the ai is cheating or unfair enemies therefore have to show or bark everything they do a game where enemies transport wounded and tend to their wounds is far cry great combat ai unfortunately they ditched all that cool elements of their ai in favor of cannon fodder in far cry i would really like to see another shooter with enemy squads that work together and pull out their wounded
gaming,not_removed,yet goldeneye outsold many nintendo games on their own platform as a project created by people who never worked on a video game before just doing what they thought would make a good game word of mouth is much more important for a game than prerelease hype is
gaming,not_removed,the minority is an untapped market while the majority is a saturated one
gaming,not_removed,huh what
gaming,not_removed,in fear its largely fairly simple smoke and mirrors the ai performs a simple flanking move on occasion wrong fear might not aged as well as you expected but it is still presentes a more complex ai than many modern games the implementation inspired many other games i would reccomend these httpaigamedevcomopenreviewfearai httpaigamedevcomopenreviewplanningingames also some general ai reading might be welcome when trying to understand what cancannot and how how hard can be implemented i can give some pointers it seems that the believability on how similar they are to real humans of the ai is more interesting to you than its technical characteristics in this case i agree that most modern games npcs lack the depth that makes then feel real
gaming,not_removed,bullet sponge what game were you playing both the player and their enemies get absolutely shredded within seconds without slowmo even on the hardest difficulty although the tank type soldiers and robots were definitely spongy i do agree that a lot of the ai was tailored to each firefight
gaming,not_removed,that sounds like mgsv
gaming,not_removed,doesnt sound like witcher ive never encountered that in hours and no ones ever complained about it on the games subreddit i do recall some other games that do this if you keep dying early on though
gaming,not_removed,oh and also think of it in your perspectiveif you had the upper hand and someone was surrendering would you really just walk away and let them live knowing in the back of your head that they could come back at any time to try to killattack you when you least expect it obviously not so the obvious choice is to get rid of them and not have to worry
gaming,not_removed,doesnt even take any skillsjoel is a construction worker not a navy seal all he has is the right weapons and whatnot the ai is realistic in the last of us in the sense that it makes sense given the world that they live in
gaming,not_removed,ive done decently well and you can set up ambushes use traps or anticipatory crossfire laptop guns or mines etc you can predict sometimes dodge and i dont want to sound like an arrogant bastard here but i used to be one of the best pd players in the world waaaaay back when i was a kid with only free time and thousands of hours of game time used to be i could lane semireliable headshots even on darksims sometimes how i did it with a single joystick and cbuttons ill never know but even then it was a war of attrition even a few lucky kills in a row left you open and catching up as you died a few times could be easier because one mistake in a group of more and you lost everybody giving them a higher score and there were other ways to scheme the system like using slomo or one hit kills to make it just as frantic but a little more possible
gaming,not_removed,yea that does make sense bethesda can be annoyingly sloppy at times especially whese are games that sell of millions of copies and have no end of money available to throw at patching
gaming,not_removed,stop right there criminal scum
gaming,not_removed,did you wasted your time doing it or looking for it
gaming,not_removed,i remember following halo and development on bungienet and they would always go on about how excited they were to be improving the ai and it showed imo fighting an elite on heroic felt like a decent challenge
gaming,not_removed,right up until they realized that they would have to give up absolutely massive processing power to achieve ai that isnt retarded and that processing power is best used to create pretty graphics and rag doll corpses ai is both hard to develop and very costly at the system level i havent noticed much improvement since some time around halflife but then i remember being impressed that ais knew what grenades were in half life
gaming,not_removed,i mean it seems like the enemies should be just slightly more resistant to damage than the player in the highest level but much more intelligent in that theyd use teamwork to flank the player throw grenades duck and take cover use vehicles etc that way a truly skilled player can still kill the enemies by outsmarting them the easy mode should be enemies that act individually and are more likely to charge at the player without any cover and less likely to use grenades or vehiclesturrets and they should be just slightly less resistant to damage than the player its about realism i think its unrealistic that i could be a supersoldier flipping tanks and jumping out of spaceships and landing on the surface of a planet and be basically fine but i cant handle being shot at by a dinky little plasma pistol definitely agree on the handholding and cues bit would also help if the harder difficulties made accuracy more realistic and responsive to incoming damage from enemies like if you get hit with a massive concussive blast you should suffer some loss of accuracy and movement speed for a second or two
gaming,not_removed,bullet spongehard is why i cant stand payday
gaming,not_removed,youre welcome to go blue ocean strategy on it but theres a reason why marvel movies still sell gangbangers every year
gaming,not_removed,heres an example of what im talking about for example when an ai realizes that he is the last surviving member of a squad he says some variation of i need reinforcements we did not really implement any mechanism for the ai to bring in reinforcements but as the player progresses through the level he is sure to see more enemy ai soon enough perfect darks ai will run to a preset node where other ai should be present and will shout we need help or shes here and the other ai will follow them back to your location its not very sophisticated but it is a real mechanic fear doesnt have a functional reinforcement system it has an illusion of one created by simple dialogue barks also the truth is we actually did not have any complex squad behaviors at all in fear dynamic situations emerge out of the interplay between the squad level decision making and the individual ais decision making and often create the illusion of more complex squad behavior than what actually exists far cry had defined squad roles rear cover scout and leader and these worked together removing the leader severely impacted the ais coordination cover would flank scouts would rush you without a leader theyd do this stuff far less effectively
gaming,not_removed,the ai is realistic in the last of us in the sense that it makes sense given the world that they live in when ellie meets david he doesnt immediately try to murder her the moment she lowers her weapon
gaming,not_removed,man i miss that game will try to hit up my brother next time were both home to fire up the with perfect dark
gaming,not_removed,nah educating the developmentally challenged is never a waste of time
gaming,not_removed,i see where you are coming from my point is more on the side that the ai implementation on fear is indeed not simple even if not perfect ideally we want the best of all words id love to have a bdiplanning implementation that could both work on small scale fights but also an ai that could simulate real reactionsemotions and behavior also i am a sucker for multiagent systems so i would love to see better squad systems
gaming,not_removed,watch the scene again they go into the building to get warm as they wait for the other dude to bring the meds ellie is still holding onto her gun when they are in the building she could easily have shot him had he tried anything plus dont forget they were making a trade the deer for the meds so it was in both their interest to keep each other alive until the dude came back because she badly needed the meds and he needed the food then they get interrupted by the clickers and start to help each other fight through them
gaming,not_removed,iits subjective
gaming,not_removed,they also do ten sequels for iron man captain america thor et al would pirates of the caribbean be a better example for you or star wars
gaming,not_removed,the discussion was about why there arent more things aimed at the minority audience as opposed to mass appeal my assertion was that the latter on the large whole makes more money ergo thats what happens most often you havent refuted my point the best selling games right now are all sports games
gaming,not_removed,well june was several months ago that said i dont think that list particularly diminishes his point the only new thing there is overwatch and functionally thats kind of debatable or outright dismissible because lel blizzard everything else is a sequel reboot licensed or the freak hit that is minecraft
gaming,not_removed,look at last months npd numbers sports topped the charts
gaming,not_removed,was the bomb in the day
gaming,not_removed,httpsyoutubegggdzewvgry
gaming,not_removed,the hype was unreal the game wasnt that fun for me
gaming,not_removed,murder death kill one of the best games of the imho
gaming,not_removed,the hell is mdk
gaming,not_removed,thats what i remember it was a mac game that came bundled with something
gaming,not_removed,either that or the designation for murder in the movie demolition man
gaming,not_removed,if they can make great batman games maybe they can finally make a superman game thats actually good
gaming,not_removed,i would love it if they made a spiderman game
gaming,not_removed,i would love to see a game about the flash wondering how they could accomplish such a thing just blows my mind
gaming,not_removed,i think naughty dog is making the next spiderman game exclusive i just hope it isnt movie based and has a great story
gaming,not_removed,i will build a great bunker network and nobody builds bunkers better than me believe me and ill build it very inexpensively ill build a great great trench and bunker network on our eastern border and i will have germany pay for that it mark my words
gaming,not_removed,it took me a bit too long to realize what we were talking about i thought the joke was the austrohungarian victory i was sitting here asking myself is that an issue today its not even a conjoined force
gaming,not_removed,trump did nothing wrong
gaming,not_removed,i am going to build a maginot line and germany is going to pay for it
gaming,not_removed,sounds like a good thing to do if you are going to war
gaming,not_removed,no no no you need the that it part adds more trumpiness
gaming,not_removed,maginot line is what i was referencing and that didnt last long
gaming,not_removed,so were they supposed to not build anything and also the reason it had fallen was because the germans flanked them and came from behind now if you build the maginot line across the whole of france that would be a different story
gaming,not_removed,wrong stuka dive bombers took most of the defenses out allowing the german army to use their blitzkrieg tactic without the maginot line halting them right at the start even if they did build the line on the whole eastern border and not just alsacelorraine they would still face the same issue since they didnt expect the germans to use dive bombers they pretty much expected a second war to be like the first
gaming,not_removed,jk not really the official version just a cool game i found which reminds me of dont starve
gaming,not_removed,nice graphics
gaming,not_removed,spawn kill simulator cool
gaming,not_removed,havent been around rgaming the past few days have you
gaming,not_removed,it isnt are there issues sure but its in no way disappointing
gaming,not_removed,all the people ive talked to in person absolutely love it it seems like its just achieved a memelike status online
gaming,not_removed,it isnt hours in and still having a blast once you get past the facial animations it is a really fun game even the side quests and exploration are fun there is so much to do i keep putting off the main quest line so i can enjoy the side quests havent made to the end yet so ill hold off making final review but for now it is great
gaming,not_removed,its a huge letdown especially after dragon age inquisition showed some promise but the engine might suck for these kinds of openended rpgstyle games they used lowquality developers one of their b studios that probably was only used to doing pickup grunt work and not carry entire games really a lack of experience given they took years to make this game i think if dice had made this game using the same exact script but just executed it in a technically superior way it would be game of the year candidate
gaming,not_removed,typical hyped dissapointment also hate bandwagon but it has some issues in general game is heavily bugged and unpolished facial animations at least for humans are lets be honest far from perfect space travel and landingliftoff animations are long enough to be frustrating lack of active pause and commanding companions some people say the writing is bad but i liked it i guess its too subjective to cling on it but the combat is great environment looks amazing crew members are a really colorful and interesting bunch tldr game is good but has way too many problems for an aaa game hence the disappointment
gaming,not_removed,it has a metacritic score of fans can say that it isnt a disappointment but when almost every reviewer can give you a laundry list of problems its fair to say that the disappointment is not being falsely perceived the game is a mess in many ways what makes it truly a disappointment is that it is a mass effect game had it been anything else i think people would have been a bit more fair to it either way isnt terrible the gameplay is solid and the story is passable all things considered its a decent experience if youre a fan non me fans probably wont like it i think i wrote a review here if you wanna read it shameless plug
gaming,not_removed,poor quality control is why its really getting shit on but the general consensus seems to be that it isnt the mass effect theyve grown to love
gaming,not_removed,you all fell for the hype so what is everyones thoughts on elite dangerous star citizen no mans sky
gaming,not_removed,have to look just review ratings disappointing
gaming,not_removed,there are so many fucking side quests haha i honestly got a little overwhelmed at times when i would go to a planet and the list showing active quests on this planet was the whole screen
gaming,not_removed,before i beat the main questlineother things facial animations arent even bad aside from custom characters faces story is fantastic gameplay fantastic definitely a polished successor to the original trilogy cant wait to see what dlc is forthcoming
gaming,not_removed,this is the best review of it ive found unpolished but not bugged at least in my opinion i play it on a pc and the only real bug ive come across is the escape pod and im not sure if it was a bug but one vault keep an infinite spawn of destroyers and nullifiers generating and i dont know if that was a bug or a fucked up joke it runs rather steadily otherwise id love to know about other common ones though to know what to expect you hit it dead on with the landing and liftoff shit i kind of enjoy the traveling cutscenes because its interesting to get the feeling you are actually flying around the solar system but this could be more polished and to really make it great allow for manual flying as well as skipping the flying the writing i think is kind of bad but only subjectively mass effect and knights of the old republic are two of my all time top games and the writing was so far above andromedas its unbelievable the story i find to be pretty great even if the main story isnt that long but i havent finished it this is hearsay there is so much to do on the side so its not a huge issue to me overall though i am not disappointed it sets up the possibility for more games at least however far i am in now and id love to play more polished versions where the future games story and gameplay build on the outposts that you develop in this game if they dont all get destroyed the combat is damn near perfect i truly hope they make a kotoresque sequel and use the same combat system just replace biotics with force powers wouldnt be that hard and the world building is quite awesome as well
gaming,not_removed,i think its just horribly unpolished i think it is still the mass effect just not nearly as good as the first one i really hate that tann is dinesh from silicon valley his voice is too distinctive and it throws me off hahaha
gaming,not_removed,clearly you havent played it it deserved the hype
gaming,not_removed,mea is a fine game im like hours in going for basically besides some of the task objectives since they dont have quest markers and can be hard to find without luck the combat is way better than the original series and the character interplay and premise of the story are good ive ran into a few bugs but nothing game breaking in my experience it seems the vast majority of the people calling the game bad are people who havent played it and the majority of people who have actually played it have liked it
gaming,not_removed,yep for the first time in a long time im actually looking forward to dlc i hope we get a new crew member or planet to explore
gaming,not_removed,bugs that i encountered are mostly clipping through stuff some doubling npcs during dialogue people being nontalkable until savereload and the biggest bullshit yet this one time enemies were spawning invisible as in no model invisible i agree that space travel looks better than in previous games but speeding it up a bit would be better around halfway through the game i got myself a trainer to speed up those moments and trust me it still looks great but is way less annoying but overall i really enjoyed the game too bad there are so many things that could be done netter but in general i had a great time
gaming,not_removed,ahem not bashing the game and bought it but i honestly thought combat was better heavy melee and grabs were too much fun
gaming,not_removed,if the original trilogy is any indication or reason for hope thats very possible i think dlc squad mates have already been a thing new locations etc im hoping they elaborate on certain questions left at the end though i know thats what a follow up game will be for fucking loved the story cant wait for it to continue
gaming,not_removed,really the global cooldown alone made it terrible for me being restricted to only a small number of powers with basically no meaningful combination of powers due to global cooldown and with mea instead of your class forcing you into a certain playstyle instead your playstyle determines which class you are essentially so theres a lot more freedom and a lot of the eitheror upgrades can be pretty transformative and alter the playstyle a lot like nova and lance can have their cooldowns removed entirely in place of a shields cost to cast them or adding primerdetonator effects aoe radiuses etc
gaming,not_removed,the gamers that can run for more than minute anyway
gaming,not_removed,gamers will be one of the first groups of people to die within
gaming,not_removed,if i have to fight the zombies with the same people i usually play im screwed
gaming,not_removed,except that most of you gamers will die because you got cocky and thought you could just run and gun through the zombies
gaming,not_removed,left dead taught me that a frying pan is all i need time to break some eggs
gaming,not_removed,standing there in the street with your game controller wont do to much
gaming,not_removed,get my family to safety firstthen cold calculated efficient purge
gaming,not_removed,wow havent heard that one before
gaming,not_removed,it doesnt matter how many games ive played im still not really stoked about killing another person zombie or not
gaming,not_removed,the gamers that can run for more than minute anyway depends on the type of zombies we get i vote for the slow ones
gaming,not_removed,ie bots because you have no friends
gaming,not_removed,got to admit would kit up go out to lay waste and probably get eaten because the damn guns arent spawning
gaming,not_removed,also because most of their weapons are novelty fantasy swords cheap crossbows and baseball bats with nails in em
gaming,not_removed,ever try to swing a real cast iron frying pan before shits heavy and the regular teflon pans will break on the second skull lol
gaming,not_removed,bruh if there is this undead being coming at me to eat my face off i will gladly put multiple bullets in its head and proceed to grind its face w a cheese grater
gaming,not_removed,vietnam flashbacks of the fast zombies from half life
gaming,not_removed,no i have to play with random people because i have no friends
gaming,not_removed,but think about all the witty one liners you can spout after smashing some faces with a frying pan shit still thinking
gaming,not_removed,thats one way to crack an egg hey this will be over easy a frying pan eggcellent why are they all egg jokes
gaming,not_removed,stop egging them on
gaming,not_removed,just look on the sunny side there are only so many egg puns left
gaming,not_removed,egg cept for this one
gaming,not_removed,trying to think of a new one has left my brain scrambled
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,guns or alcohol
gaming,not_removed,watch dogs had a mini game like this
gaming,not_removed,basically this but in video game form i thought this is essentially the same game thanks you rock
gaming,not_removed,alcohol like whiskey or vodka
gaming,not_removed,i think this is what i am remembering thank you so much
gaming,not_removed,starting the sanguine quest in skyrim
gaming,not_removed,i wonder why they didnt do a straight air map in mp
gaming,not_removed,is worth getting for
gaming,not_removed,no lie i took pretty much this exact same screenshot on xbox yesterday
gaming,not_removed,im a stand up kind of guy
gaming,not_removed,this damn mission on hard was so frustrating
gaming,not_removed,i bet they will and had air superiority and had coral sea however they do usually wait until after launch to add it in they probably dont wanna massively inflate pilot xp gains until after a dlc or
gaming,not_removed,if youre into its multiplayer and you like the era and the gameplay i say yep its a really good game with a kickass core and an awesome production value if youre only in for the single player definitely wait for a lower price if a multiplayer thats rather fast paced though bigger maps means its not as fast as a cod but still requires tactics and gives you loads of approaches is your thing you should love it oh and it looks amazing seriously everything in this game comes together to feel great except the horrendous heinous menus designed for the attention span of a sloth if youre really on the fence i know its a bit counterintuitive to spend money to know if you should spend money but if you have origin access you can play the game for hours as a demo access is but if you do buy you get off and if you dont well you still have the access for a month and all that comes with
gaming,not_removed,its worth the i spent over at greenmangamingcom
gaming,not_removed,agreed the single player is good but for it alone wait
gaming,not_removed,i made this using piskel the app made it to my front page yesterday and i spent all evening playing with it this was my favourite result
gaming,not_removed,also boty ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gaming,not_removed,nsfw obviously
gaming,not_removed,thats a lot of shiny hineys
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,the amount of porn associated with overwatch is absolutely scary rule was completely overrun by overwatch porn and then they made their own sub for it and more both subs are overwatch people are obsessed with these female characters
gaming,not_removed,dva best girl
gaming,not_removed,it won because of it high quality ingame assets
gaming,not_removed,notmygoty
gaming,not_removed,blizzard knew porn would be popular of their characters nobody is stupid enough to believe it wouldnt they love the free advertising but would never ever admit it
gaming,not_removed,more like game of the rear amiright anyone is this thing on
gaming,not_removed,bootywatch
gaming,not_removed,roverwatchporn youre welcum subreddit obviously nsfw
gaming,not_removed,higher resolution
gaming,not_removed,listen hear that its the sound of sarkeesian getting triggered
gaming,not_removed,thicc
gaming,not_removed,needs more jpeg
gaming,not_removed,i cant help but think those outfits would be really uncomfortable to wear i mean swamp ass is bad enough without the clothing going right up your crack and imagine the wedgies
gaming,not_removed,wheres fking mei
gaming,not_removed,lord give me mercy
gaming,not_removed,overwatch without a doubt had the biggest impact on gaming by far this year uncharteddoomtitanfall are no doubt amazing games but they wont be talked about nearly as much as overwatch in the years to come
gaming,not_removed,you missed reapers booty as well
gaming,not_removed,no love for mei booty
gaming,not_removed,swiggity swooty im coming for that goty
gaming,not_removed,it won because of the plot
gaming,not_removed,weebs
gaming,not_removed,quality content rgaming
gaming,not_removed,dont really think its goty worthy nothing really groundbreaking with it
gaming,not_removed,mei and zarya should be up there too p
gaming,not_removed,gootey
gaming,not_removed,it could have gone another game but i only up voted for the booty
gaming,not_removed,and here i thought scientists found the cure to cancer
gaming,not_removed,so original
gaming,not_removed,it won its fun sure for a short amount of time until youve played the same map times but its not really innovative
gaming,not_removed,realistic body types i can applaud them for that not like those lean chicks have double e chests
gaming,not_removed,dva isnt that tall is she
gaming,not_removed,backsides aside its a damn good game its quick easy to learn challenging to master mostly well balanced with occasional hiccups the community is decent and the game has the attention to little details id expect from blizzard im not sure its the objectively best game made in the year but im also not sure there is such a thing possible
gaming,not_removed,damn widowmaker thicc af
gaming,not_removed,wouldnt it be great if female characters didnt have to be over sexualized
gaming,not_removed,cant believe this game won fuck blizzard on the other hand this or
gaming,not_removed,squats
gaming,not_removed,outter left outter right inner left inner right
gaming,not_removed,butts of the year
gaming,not_removed,what about mei
gaming,not_removed,wheres genji kek
gaming,not_removed,over watching that booty
gaming,not_removed,classic streisand effect
gaming,not_removed,i was going to disagree with overwatch being game of the year but then i saw the other nominees i guess i thought there were way more good games released this year then there actually were
gaming,not_removed,boty
gaming,not_removed,what a weak year overall if fucking overwatch won it
gaming,not_removed,they won it for harambe
gaming,not_removed,how does a game win goty its just a label slapped on by publishers to repackage the game
gaming,not_removed,op confirmed as yo boy
gaming,not_removed,but but but but why
gaming,not_removed,why did they give in and remove of tracer ffs literally unplayable
gaming,not_removed,wait overwatch won holy shit thats hilarious lol i wonder how much blizzard payed for that award just to sell more copies of a shitty fps anyways the only overwatch ill playing is on sfm
gaming,not_removed,i like what i am seeing ༼ຈل͜ຈ༽
gaming,not_removed,how can such a shitty game win goty thats almost as bad as last year where some retarded award gave fallout goty over witcher
gaming,not_removed,ffxv wasnt even nominated for anything what a joke
gaming,not_removed,witcher came out in not so there for why would it even be a goty for
gaming,not_removed,super gay weeaboos need to all be killed because they all are retarded
gaming,not_removed,pretty sure it was the solidly original gameplay bleeding edge graphics and sound and fair pricing
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,which obviously goes to mccree
gaming,not_removed,but that actually stands for battle of the year
gaming,not_removed,is is ana grabbing her daughters ass
gaming,not_removed,its its beautiful tear runs down eye
gaming,not_removed,this only strengthens my thought of mercy being the best in the world sometimes artists really do seem like gods when they gift us with such beauty i mean i fucking love butts but got damn this piece is beautiful and so much work went into it holy shit
gaming,not_removed,lol the guys at the window on the left
gaming,not_removed,no sombra
gaming,not_removed,are you one of those heroes
gaming,not_removed,crops out zaryas man butt
gaming,not_removed,how is this even overwatch
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,what what in the butt what what in the butt
gaming,not_removed,the original was smoother but i appreciate what theyre tryna do with this one tracer is awesome
gaming,not_removed,wow overwatch copying memes its not like overwatch has copied anything before
gaming,not_removed,you arent kidding i teach a modeling class and i use overwatch as an example all the time ive accidentally clicked on some rule overwatch pics while trying to find examples to show my class luckily i warned them it might happen lol
gaming,not_removed,its not just the women people love making porn of the men and the robot
gaming,not_removed,i know its fantastic
gaming,not_removed,dva best girl im more of a widowmaker person myself in the great war of butts
gaming,not_removed,mei is best bae
gaming,not_removed,always
gaming,not_removed,ive felt that way for years but obviously no game will ever be goty with consensus
gaming,not_removed,how on earth could such a derivative and safe title like overwatch of which has the most pathetic rate for turning out new content for a multiplayer game win game of the year seriously go look at how long its taken the content released since launch versus what other multiplayer games are doing and youll notice a problem wheres the server browser wheres the playlists wheres the new modes gears of war is shooting for maps this year for free but nah good ol blizzard deserves gave of the year for essentially copying and adding a move set like a moba shit they even lifted one if the most popular game types out of and didnt even fucking bother to rename it literally every game on the nomination list is better than this derivative ass title also from years of experience with wow they cant balance a class based competitive multiplayer game worth a fuck and when they do it doesnt take long for them to fuck it up goty my left nut
gaming,not_removed,i remember someone saying that you know a game is gonna be popular when there is a shitload of porn of the characters before the game is out
gaming,not_removed,blizzard is making them
gaming,not_removed,har har

gaming,not_removed,httpsmredditcomrmylittlepony is leaking
gaming,not_removed,hell yeah mei is super juicy
gaming,not_removed,not innovative lol leave the reviewing to the professionals
gaming,not_removed,wouldnt it be great if people let others enjoy things
gaming,not_removed,why its about time a multiplayer focused game won game is usually in the top on twitch so its very popular
gaming,not_removed,i dont like da thing i hate who do like da thing me feel valdidadted now
gaming,not_removed,lol agreed here for the buttpuns yet still irritated with character modeling
gaming,not_removed,when publications give them game of the year awards in a competition a game win goty for that publication
gaming,not_removed,youre giving the soylents a bad name with questions like that they win game of the year awards
gaming,not_removed,confirmed as ageist
gaming,not_removed,yes butt
gaming,not_removed,say that to the million people actively playing overwatch lol you clearly have no clue what youre talking about leave the reviewing to the professionals
gaming,not_removed,missed the release window same with pokemon sunmoon also even if it was eligibleone week isnt nearly enough time to judge its merits
gaming,not_removed,it came out too late right the game had to be released before november to be nominated
gaming,not_removed,it came out on friday last week
gaming,not_removed,youre pretty bad at trolling it should be less obvious
gaming,not_removed,feel better
gaming,not_removed,super gay but post is about lady booty weaboo and is about an american game
gaming,not_removed,you must be making a joke winston motherfuckers
gaming,not_removed,thats a funny way of spelling genji
gaming,not_removed,why yes yes she is 👌🏼
gaming,not_removed,it was before sombra but look at widows reflection
gaming,not_removed,ookayy
gaming,not_removed,accidentally ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gaming,not_removed,our next lesson class is how to make anatomically correct character models
gaming,not_removed,almost all of the cast are attractive in some way or other due to how diverse it is
gaming,not_removed,overwatch caters to every possible taste im guessing hence its popularity
gaming,not_removed,people love making porn of the men and the robot yet to see any of that then again im not really looking out for it
gaming,not_removed,im surprised mercy isnt chosen more in the war of the butts her hips are nearly twice her waist size if you look at her straight on
gaming,not_removed,im a mercy man myself
gaming,not_removed,if theres anything weve learned from overwatch is that hitler is still alive and that he designed mei so we should be really careful about those that consider her the best bae
gaming,not_removed,mei prez buildthewall
gaming,not_removed,ive felt that way for years you didnt think witcher deserved to be goty are you kidding me
gaming,not_removed,i feel like if the last of us was delayed to that wouldve been the closest to a consensus wed ever get
gaming,not_removed,honestly im just annoyed that one game can win multiple awards overwatch won best esports game best multiplayer and game of the year like pick one does it qualify as all id say yes but other games should win awards too not that every game nominated should win something mind you but spread it out a bit
gaming,not_removed,and despite all that its still fun as fuck to play i still play it daily since release its my goty for sure also it plays nothing like
gaming,not_removed,uh they did just come out with like new game modes the reason it takes so long to release characters is because its hard to introduce new heroes with new abilities and keep the game still balanced theyre also sticking with the game lore on every release so they have to draw up these characters come up with tons of abilities and then figure out which of these abilities can be releasticallt implemented without fucking up the game the balance team is also also pretty good having been a wow player myself i definitely understand your sentiment on blizzards lack of ability to properly balance anything in a game but the balance team for overwatch is exceptionally better they release videos all the time and are very transparent with the community and actually listen for once id have to definitely agree that they are severely lackluster in the map department having only released two new maps since the game launch while is definitely game of the year for me overwatch was something a lot more unique than you make it sound
gaming,not_removed,while i love overwatch i completely agree for some reason
gaming,not_removed,should have been doom that game came as a surprise to everyone even bethesda
gaming,not_removed,is great but not goty
gaming,not_removed,id vote for the witness but it wasnt even nominated
gaming,not_removed,you mean cutscene simulator
gaming,not_removed,its incredible how fast these people worked from just the screens of the game now that its out and the models are out with themi mean damn its astounding what some people can do i mean is great but these people are just amazing with how they pull off this art plus my willy likes their hard work
gaming,not_removed,one wasnt enough prolly just mods salty about power again
gaming,not_removed,we need to go higher more zoom oo
gaming,not_removed,i
gaming,not_removed,you sunovabitch
gaming,not_removed,every fucking time the link is purple and every fucking time i still click it im dead inside
gaming,not_removed,to be fair the feminism outrage was there first
gaming,not_removed,wink
gaming,not_removed,i know i prefer the bigger girls sure the others are hot but mei is hotter
gaming,not_removed,agree to disagree i think overwatch is safe if anything but thats just my opinion
gaming,not_removed,the quote is not really innovative i do think there was some very little innovation but lets not kid ourselves there have been many games similar to it before it came around and no i dont have to leave shit to professionals
gaming,not_removed,yes and no its certainly the same few battle types and the meta boils down to people getting into familiar groups and makeups frankly i can say that about every online shooter there is period it would be like hating mari kart for just driving around all day either just the kind of game for you or it isnt for those that isnt thats cool you do you boo
gaming,not_removed,wouldnt it be great if femalesaka human aka women werent considered things
gaming,not_removed,i bought it and i take back what i said but i dont think its goty xontender mifht have to play it some more tracer is probably the best character in the game
gaming,not_removed,we always end up with multiple goty games every year because every publication has their own picks there is just no standard my point is that goty is an meaningless designation any idiot with a blog can call it game of the year or a publisher can simply declare it themselves and its usually slapped on titles for rerelease which makes it pretty obvious that its an attempt to gain more sales rather than some industry badge of honor
gaming,not_removed,numbers goty wow crawl back up your moms cunt bro you fail at life for that one
gaming,not_removed,your logic is pleasing proceed
gaming,not_removed,oh ok
gaming,not_removed,this itll be eligible for the awards
gaming,not_removed,ohh makes sense
gaming,not_removed,havent had my snickers yet i need more weebs
gaming,not_removed,are you even trying its all about roadhog
gaming,not_removed,incest is best 👌🏼
gaming,not_removed,why is zarya not grabbin ass and why isnt she wearing a softball jersey
gaming,not_removed,says here try tongue but hole
gaming,not_removed,yeah roadhog is the hottest character in all of gaming
gaming,not_removed,great point most of the characters are sexy stereotypes mcree stoic cowboy soldier warrior tracer upbeat pixie reaper gothangsty rock guy hanzo nobleexotic native junkrat unpredictable wildman mei nerdy girl widowmaker sassy wbig booty pharah nobleexotic native d va young gamer girl zarya butch lesbian lucio cocky but approachable black dude mercy blond nurse
gaming,not_removed,well theres your problem
gaming,not_removed,this guy knows whats up
gaming,not_removed,dont bring it up mercy is our secret
gaming,not_removed,mercy is best waifu
gaming,not_removed,its because everyone chooses her in the war of the tits i feel unclean saying that
gaming,not_removed,mei and mercy best waifus meircy
gaming,not_removed,pharah is the one i get surprised no one talks about she is under a big armor but has the prettiest face in the game
gaming,not_removed,nah fam symmetra is number one
gaming,not_removed,no no he didnt design mei he is simply disguised as mei
gaming,not_removed,believe it or not there are plenty of people who enjoyed witcher but didnt necessarily think it was goty
gaming,not_removed,bloodborne was my personal goty not that witcher wasnt amazing and all i just liked bloodborne better
gaming,not_removed,cant say because i didnt play witcher ive only played witcher and i couldnt enjoy it after trying for a few hours witcher could be very good but for years didnt mean to be every consecutive year just most of them
gaming,not_removed,nah i didnt i didnt like it personally sorry
gaming,not_removed,im one of the rare people who thought witcher wasnt fun not a bad game however the first few hours i disliked the feel of combat also the main character i couldnt even care about hes really boring maybe that changes later on but i dont own it only borrowed from a friend
gaming,not_removed,witcher deserves to be goty every year tbh underated indie gem shame a lot more people dont play it
gaming,not_removed,fallout won goty from aias
gaming,not_removed,no i didnt enjoy it that much
gaming,not_removed,i think that the witcher is a very good game but it doenst deserve that much praise which it is getting
gaming,not_removed,people who only play rocket league probably didnt no
gaming,not_removed,witcher was overhyped as fuck
gaming,not_removed,i dislike nearly all games that are first personish witcher dark soul blood bourne etc i think the closest game i like that to those kinds would be bastion and thats a pretty big stretch
gaming,not_removed,a game that was only on one system i mean i guess if we want a goty that of the gaming ecosystem cant play
gaming,not_removed,hey remember last year witcher won basically everything
gaming,not_removed,overwatch as best esports huh what awards were these serious question id like to lookup all categories and their winners
gaming,not_removed,yea fuck uretrocorn and his opinion how dare he even have one lets just keep downvoting like he clearly fucking deserves guys
gaming,not_removed,im sorry man but it really does play like i got hours in and am level in ow theyre quite similar that doesnt mean its a bad game ill agree with you its fun i just personally feel it doesnt deserve goty that doesnt make it a bad game
gaming,not_removed,yet that lore could be better as an sp campaign it doesnt matter what theyre doing with lore or any of that it plays itfar too safe and feels exactly like what the genre has been doing forever the difficulty in adding new characters means nothing to me dont add characters if they dont actually need to be there and if adding them serves to break the game why do it again wheres the server browser server filter community servers with modded content people need to stop treating this game like the second coming of christ and realize its pretty average when compared to other multiplayer titles and is very bare bones in content still after all this time
gaming,not_removed,thanks man reading it it comes off a little angry and i didnt entirely mean it to be so im just frustrated with what overwatch could be rather than what it currently is
gaming,not_removed,everything about that game was perfect bar the story probably the most metal as fuck game ive played recently i really dont understand why overwatch won
gaming,not_removed,was made first
gaming,not_removed,httpsfilesworfoxnetsungetqoaoglukdldownload
gaming,not_removed,deputy mayor lance shouldnt you be helping the city recuperate from the alien invasion that just went down instead of looking at overwatch
gaming,not_removed,because of all the clothes shes wearing
gaming,not_removed,point to the spot in the picture where you see an actual human woman this is a video game its art you troglodyte you put your own biases over it not ours all those things youre claiming it does is because thats what you see in it art is a reflection of the viewer remember this is a game with an anthropomorphic gorrilla a sentient robot and cyborg ninja but all you can see is oppression of real life women where there are none in the actual game you brought your own bias in next time leave it at the door
gaming,not_removed,fulfilling your sexual urges isnt childish whats childish is thinking that doing so makes one childish a person who needs to insist upon their maturity versus others cannot be mature themselves
gaming,not_removed,your anger proves how little your opinion matters

gaming,not_removed,road hog fat meat
gaming,not_removed,lucio cocky but approachable black dude does brazillian fall under black
gaming,not_removed,forever unclean
gaming,not_removed,symmetra be underrated as hell but she aint no
gaming,not_removed,bloodbornes only flaw is that there isnt dlcs
gaming,not_removed,to be fair i didnt finish witcher until like my try because i would keep getting bored and just stop playing and wanted to finish it for witcher its really not that great a game witcher on the other hand i hold among the best games ive ever played its a completely different beast
gaming,not_removed,alright fine but dont think youre off the hook just yet
gaming,not_removed,its fine there are literally dozens of us
gaming,not_removed,shit i didnt like it until i forced myself through about the first hours and that was on my fourth restart its not for everybody but people will crucify you for disliking it
gaming,not_removed,yeah geralt is far from boring he is one of the most interesting main characters weve had in gaming recently you just didnt play long enough to even see a fraction of the story the first few hours isnt even long enough to get out of the starting area
gaming,not_removed,i agree while i thought the writing and story were super cool the combat bored the hell out of me and things like weapon condition and constant gathering of random shit on the ground turned me off
gaming,not_removed,youre not the only one wasnt a bad game at all but i just didnt enjoy it enough
gaming,not_removed,i didnt like it either honestly there was too much stuff thrown at me too quickly i felt like the tutorial was like heres spells heres weapons heres other stuff and just felt too complex to learn and remember in one session if they had slowly started you off in the wild and said heres x enemy use this weapon to kill it and showed you how to use stuff throughout the game i probably wouldve liked it
gaming,not_removed,yea the beginning of the game doesnt do the rest of it justice imo i got bored before getting through the starting area white orchard times before i finally came back to the game and stuck with it but i am so glad that i did the characters story voice acting world and combat are some of the best i have ever seen in video games
gaming,not_removed,underated indie gem shame a lot more people dont play it underrated are you talking about the same witcher game as everyone else
gaming,not_removed,i play rocket league a lot but still found time to enjoy the witcher
gaming,not_removed,do you know what overhyped means
gaming,not_removed,all of those games are thirdperson
gaming,not_removed,how are any of those games even vaguely first personish edit auto correct
gaming,not_removed,are you actually retarded
gaming,not_removed,where did you get that number from according to an esa study last year pc gamers make up of the gaming demographic
gaming,not_removed,best use of a unicorn
gaming,not_removed,yep great game but it wasnt the only one nominated for things
gaming,not_removed,cause i think everyone agrees that witcher was the best game of
gaming,not_removed,the game awards
gaming,not_removed,the awards are a joke some of the winners have serious issues with the game but still win simply because they were hyped
gaming,not_removed,fair enough youve played more than i have to me it didnt feel that similar i just dont think its fair to call out overwatch as derivative sure it takes ideas from other games but honestly what game doesnt every single game out there is highly derivative of past games in its genre blizzard has always specialized in taking a concept thats been done before but then taking it to the next level with polish and refinement anyways i dont really have a point here just saying my opinion out of curiosity what would you say your goty is
gaming,not_removed,i never said adding characters is game breakingits not it just has to be carefully done and you were just scrutinizing the title for lack of content but now youre saying they shouldnt be adding characters that dont need to be there the characters add a unique twist on gameplay and force the community to develop entirely new strategies several new team comp and strategies enter the meta with every character release the new characters every couple of months are a fantastic way to keep this game fresh and their development is completely worth it also i dont think the game will ever have a single player thats why its but i dont think its been ruled out theres no server browser so what im not sure what you expect from the modding community with this game other than servers filled with naked waifus its not fucking gmod or dayz you dont like the game i get it but it definitely deserves the reception and praise it got whether you like it or not
gaming,not_removed,well currently id say it is a mess had so much fun playing this game but lately i find i spend more time shouting at it than anything the balancing is terrible and the flow of content is ridiculously slow they add a mode which i cant even play with my friend then there is the whole sombra thing i just finished my season placement but think i need a break until they get their act together
gaming,not_removed,the story was just fine angry man murders all the demons doom has never really needed more story than that
gaming,not_removed,the real mvp
gaming,not_removed,totally
gaming,not_removed,its how women are represented a great majority of the time theres no other quality thats mentioned about them its mostly look how hot they are so yes it is a problem when you cant have female game characters not even humans without all people seeing and talking about being their butt or their boobs its a problem
gaming,not_removed,ok
gaming,not_removed,rwincest
gaming,not_removed,dont give up skeleton
gaming,not_removed,mei is thin as the rest of them but wears very thick clothes is one of the httpoverwatchwikiacomwikimeisprays
gaming,not_removed,depends if theyre black or not
gaming,not_removed,dozens big witcher fan but also big arrested development fan
gaming,not_removed,thats actually how i fell in love with dark souls so maybe i just need some more time with it i will admit its a beautiful game visually as well
gaming,not_removed,that last sentence should be a valid point of criticism of course youll start caring about something if you spend enough time with it but if they dont give you a reason to spend that initial growing time with them it just isnt going to happen
gaming,not_removed,but geralt doesnt have ta thus lacks any personality
gaming,not_removed,witchero geraldo wild adventure is an underated gem it was made by a small polish team which consisted of guys who lived in a shack with no electricity they had no money for marketing so brave souls like me and others do our best to remind everyone of this masterpiece in possibly every conversation
gaming,not_removed,that was sarcasm dude the word gem really tips it off
gaming,not_removed,yeah rated by players and critics with awful controls paired with a tiny loot radius a story that drags on and a main character as charismatic as drywall in a game you can beat with buttons all going on at the same time people were digging for reasons to shit on fallout the game is the definition of overhyped
gaming,not_removed,shows how little i care for them i guess
gaming,not_removed,i think you understand what im getting at i gave a list of games that all use the same view and same type of combatenvironmentambiance
gaming,not_removed,its possible he doesnt know what that word means its possible it isnt his first language he is right in saying that people could likely infer his meaning simply from the examples provided but instead of even calling him out on his misuse of a word or even acknowledging the content of his post this is your retort
gaming,not_removed,it wasnt meant to be a representation of the size of various communities just a acknowledgement of the four main systems im hardly trying to diminish pc gamers i only have a pc
gaming,not_removed,lol
gaming,not_removed,i agree its great but apart from best devs i dont think it shouldve won everything it did i was playing through witcher arkham knight and bloodborne all at the same time and i shit you not i had to not play arkham knight or bloodborne for a week before i could play witcher due to the fact that the gameplay was so week compared to those and ive spoken to people who had worse cases of not being able to play witcher due to superior gamesitis
gaming,not_removed,i dont bloodborne was the superior game in my mind
gaming,not_removed,nah i think for me that to goes to fallout bloodborne or assassins creed syndicate for me
gaming,not_removed,nope dark souls
gaming,not_removed,i personally liked mgsv as a standalone game better not as an entry in the mgs series for creating the best stealth game of all time
gaming,not_removed,i love fallout and mgsv
gaming,not_removed,thanks a bit surprised by these resultsnominations not saying that overwatch isnt good but i dont understand how this new game which has a much smaller competitive scene than dota league and csgo won best esports game and its not just the numbers of followers and prize pool but also in terms of balance and patching is the game in such a good state already to make it competitive and challenging in a fair way it seems kinda off besides that seeing music and sound design as the same category is so fucking weird i just cant understand it the only thing in common is that both are perceived through audition but other than that they are completely different things also wondering why single player rpgs are competing with wow mmorpg in the rpg category
gaming,not_removed,games i dont like still won
gaming,not_removed,i would agree however having followed blizzard for years and though i agree with your statement of polishing to the next level in the past when theyve done that theyve pioneered new systems in those genres that changed the paradigm as a whole with overwatch i dont see any shifts in the paradigm of championhero based shooters to me its very safe for a blizzard game thats my takeway at least in no way is it a bad game and it deserves its success i just dont want people to build it up to something it arguably isnt and for my goty from the list of nominees only doom because it practically brought doom and back from the dead doom was in some hot water as a series its a swan song to the shooter genre itself and improves on the gameplay from and while keeping faithful to them both in a way i have yet to see reboots truly do a goty to me has to be a big package of value so i struggle to give multiplayer only games the title of goty think of how much better ow could be if it had a campaign like titanfall which is incredible mind you and is practically tied with doom in my eyesi feel it could be more substantive and hopefully gets to being more in the future was a great year for fps games also shadow warrior doesnt deserve goty but it deserves to be mentioned p sorry i wrote you a book
gaming,not_removed,right i also feel the inclusion of ana and sombra whilst welcome the way blizzard tried to balance things ended up making them both kind of a useless addition to the pre established meta theyre useable but i can think of other heroes id rather have in their place
gaming,not_removed,yeah it didnt bother me honestly because no one really played doom for the story anyway and multiple gun modes had me won over from the start
gaming,not_removed,again point to any part of the game that has an actual living breathing human female being sexually oppressed point to any part of the game that even indicates the thought of a female being sexually oppressed you cant because the thing youre upset about doesnt actually exist even if it did exist were talking about art whats worse is youre actually upset because of the reactions to the art from some of its viewers not the actual art itself youre such a reactionary that youre upset about the reactions do you stand in a museum and complain that people only appreciate david because penis do you hover behind folks looking at the reclining nude and complain that theyre not there to feel the pain modigliani felt at the turn of the century as a poor jew but instead only appreciate the painting because vagina get the fuck over yourself and let people enjoy art for whatever reasons they want
gaming,not_removed,its telling that your only recourse is to devolve into petty insults your dogged insistence on how everyone who likes what you dont is a toddler or neckbeard only betrays your own insecurities about yourself its projection on your part nothing more its telling also you trawled my post history to just repeat the same error he no offend by boobplate i offend by boobplate i call him toddler i feel supererior now
gaming,not_removed,chest ahead
gaming,not_removed,she was thicc in httpimgurcomqikpune though they didnt go for it after all i didnt notice a difference
gaming,not_removed,i almost downvoted but then you explained your tastes in games and tv
gaming,not_removed,yeah its really pretty incredibly vibrant and colorful
gaming,not_removed,no dark souls doesnt change if you dont like the first minutes you wont like the next hours trust me i tried so hard to like it
gaming,not_removed,to be fair it is the installment in a series which itself is the continuation of a book series you wouldnt pick up the harry potter book and complain it doesnt immediately give you a reason to care about harry
gaming,not_removed,i missed it then so much salt in this thread its hard to find the sarcasm
gaming,not_removed,sure it has issues but no game is perfect i get the tiny loot radius thats infuriating but the characters are amazing great is extremely charismatic he is the most charismatic witcher
gaming,not_removed,no i really didnt get what you meant at all mentioning the words first person made things confusing
gaming,not_removed,lots of games have won goty that werent cross platform rdr uncharted and gtasa all won and are all console only being cross platform can actually hurt games obviously it takes a lot of extra work to make a game run on multiple platforms that is work that could have otherwise gone into something else cross platform can also lead to compromise what works best on pc might not work best on xbox etc so a compromise is made that works for both but isnt necessarily the best option for each individually theres also the fact that the decision to go cross platform is mostly based on how much time and money the studio in question has to dump into that effort not the actual quality of the game itself
gaming,not_removed,bloodborne does leave you with that feeling no other game can live up to it for awhile its an amazing game
gaming,not_removed,try jerking it with the other hand now
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,arent awards for games from this year that kind of eliminates dota and csgo
gaming,not_removed,in terms of balance and patching is the game in such a good state already to make it competitive and challenging in a fair way yes
gaming,not_removed,best esports category is fan voted though
gaming,not_removed,if it went by scene size wed have one winner for years and years until that scene waned kind of a pointless award then no thanks
gaming,not_removed,im a huge fan of the doom series and of doom but it was not worthy of goty i think if id had had full control of the multiplayer and the singleplayer from the beginning then maybe it could have been sadly the multiplayer experience and the balance upon release was awful
gaming,not_removed,what ana is probably only second to lucio for skillcaps on healers and can push out far more heals and utility than any of the other healers sombra is a little weak but is starting to find a place as an assassin disrupter but then shes obviously going to have issues until shes established as part of the game and isnt that new character no one can play ana is immensely strong and has had to have nerfs to her ultimate as she offers too much as high heal per minute as mercy without needing to put herself in danger to heal allies better at killing flankers than any of the others with sleep dart as well as the best at shutting enemy ults down and her grenade is super strong for countering a lot of irritating heroes such as mei roadhog lucio the meta is a little bad with stuff like torbjorn symmetra and bastion being very feast or famine but its not unplayable bad
gaming,not_removed,its a problem when its all female game characters are used for all their seen as we dont live in a vacuum as much as youd like and this is a mirror representation of how women are treated and seen in the world youre comparing things that cant be compared using false equivalences doesnt really help your case and for the record im a lesbian so enjoying women is not the problem i do that quite a lot the problem is how its done its using women and female characters in general only for their sex value constantly its degrading
gaming,not_removed,that is so dimorphic omg her shoulders are the bulkiest thing with extra fat on top of the muscle but her waist is thinner than a supermodel
gaming,not_removed,shes not fat at all shes just stacked
gaming,not_removed,it does when you didnt realize you werent supposed to rambo through the graveyard
gaming,not_removed,eh i didnt like it at first it took me a few restarts after leaving it and coming back to it to really get into it
gaming,not_removed,thats not true at all i tried it about times before i pushed through and after a good hour it had me addicted fast forward a couple years later and im the biggest ds fan i know i went on to get and preordered way before release i went from hating the style to being rather good at it as well as loving the series im sure youre going to get downvoted but you shouldnt its just your opinion and i dont mean to start an argument honestly think that given some time it can grow on you although if you dont dig it you dont dig it so no big deal
gaming,not_removed,very good point its actually the primary reason i didnt pick it up i couldnt be bothered to play through two other games to be sure i could hopefully enjoy this new one
gaming,not_removed,sure the game has issues you just agreed that it was overhyped lol the main character being emotionless and fucking boring is written into the game they beat that into your head during the possession quest in the dlc keep pretending like i just made it up
gaming,not_removed,i gave you a list of all similar games if you cant make a parallel from thatwell at this point youre looking for shit to pick out and start an argument because you like arguing
gaming,not_removed,in addition to the one ghostywolf said rdr also wasnt exclusive and neither was both of those game made it to multiple consoles and again everyone is welcome to their own opinion im just saying that unless were talking about pc gamer or xbox magazine or some other platform specific publication i wouldnt want to see an exclusive as goty
gaming,not_removed,but gtasa is on pc
gaming,not_removed,oh shit derp well in that case bloodborne over witcher
gaming,not_removed,the nominees were the following ¯ツ¯ counterstrike global offensive valve valve league of legends riot winner overwatch blizzard street fighter v capcom
gaming,not_removed,not sure if you read the whole comment but i also said and its not just the numbers of followers and prize pool but also and even then if a videogame continues to keep a big following and growing its competitive scene successfully year after year then why would they not deserve to keep winning the award thats not an easy thing to do at all so is this an actual recognition of effort and quality or just what games our judges liked the most new games that are trying to become an esport can have their own category for a fair competition thats why categories like best newcomer exist
gaming,not_removed,sorry you cant see beyond your narrow scope your point of view isnt truth its just your opinion and the world doesnt need to change to fit your limited mindset accept it or dont but youre not the arbiter of how people can enjoy and experience life sorry snowflake
gaming,not_removed,i never said shes fat thick fat i mean wouldnt you have naturally thought stacked as you put it when you hear thick instead of fat
gaming,not_removed,i played without playing the first two thought it was overhyped as fuck
gaming,not_removed,a small print of small mechanical issues doesnt take away from the awesome story gameplay and world i understand that witchers are meant to be emotionless but the game gives you options i dont play it like drywall i understand that you dont like the game but dont shit on the game to try and justify the fact that you dont like a fantastic game
gaming,not_removed,you didnt articulate your meaning clearly but youre absolutely right that it is able to be inferred with very little meaning but this is reddit and because you misspoke the content of your comment holds no meaning and makes you retarded
gaming,not_removed,you argued with yourself when you said you disliked first person games and then listed a bunch of third person action rpgs as an example of first person games that you dont like xd
gaming,not_removed,come on man first person is a fairly clearly defined type of game and none of the ones you mentioned are first person they are all in fact third person i can only understand the words you write not the ones you mean
gaming,not_removed,thats fucking stupid
gaming,not_removed,it wasnt on pc when it won game of the year in it was only available on the playstation it didnt release for pc or xbox until after the award
gaming,not_removed,wow the fact that rocket league wasnt even nominated makes me really disagree with that list
gaming,not_removed,oh yeah my narrow scope of course you seem to be getting pretty triggered by the fact this kind of behavior is demeaning to of the population your opinion will never be tolerated by the people who suffer through it might as well accept that if this is your position disgusted to know enjoying and experience life translates to diminishing women to be nothing but pretty things to look at and nothing else for some people seems like theres not a life in life for people like that
gaming,not_removed,nope i always assumed it was being used to mean fat
gaming,not_removed,terrible movement controls paired with a tiny loot radius which you said yourself was infuriating does take away from the gameplay you keep talking about the story like there wasnt around pointless hours of gameplay after the battle of kaer morhen it was dragging on and made me wish it was over at that point theres only so many interesting options when emotions are stripped from the main character its pretty sad when the best moments a main character has are when hes sitting at a table getting drunk which were his best moments imo lol you asked me if i know what overhyped means i explained and you indirectly agreed with what i said im not shitting on the game i had fun until i didnt anymore and there was still another hours of gameplay after that point then every single person i see on reddit says flawless best game ever and completely overlook its many flaws that is overhyping by definition
gaming,not_removed,devils advocate here i think he meant person as in the story revolves around a protagonist with a set storycharacter like geralt in witcher as opposed to say the dragonborn in skyrim maybe heshe feels like it breaks the immersion to be someone else
gaming,not_removed,the world would be a better place if people attempted to understand what people mean instead of what they say youre arguing with someone youve never met who may not even be a native speaker for literally no reason
gaming,not_removed,two comments in a row im beginning to think you may have an anger problem with your comments so far calm down and enjoy yourself its not a big deal if people disagree
gaming,not_removed,lets agree to disagree i still have a shit ton of fun with the game
gaming,not_removed,open world free roaming isnt for everyone some people just lack imagination
gaming,not_removed,lol thats cute more like boring fetch missions in an overrated game arent for everyone
gaming,not_removed,im not sure you even played it now
gaming,not_removed,with my hands
gaming,not_removed,adding realistic efficient modern warfare tactics in a realsim military game
gaming,not_removed,adding an automatic targeting system to a flying tank in a game with majority pvp missions and no set game mode woah youre right thats genius
gaming,not_removed,it is a realistic system and aa systems also got updates like the target lead for cannons on aa tanks btw previously you could just tap r and it would lock on on everything in front of the plane this needs to go
gaming,not_removed,wait which needs to go old or new system
gaming,not_removed,ability to lock on everything with tap of a button and all seeing radar
gaming,not_removed,o agreed
gaming,not_removed,is it good in your opinion
gaming,not_removed,its ok honestly its got a solid system reminicent of chrono trigger story has its high points kind of on the short side though there are a few sidequests id say get it if jrpgs are your thing otherwise skip it
gaming,not_removed,story has its high points i second this its a solid game and doesnt do much wrong yet isnt anything amazingly special either
gaming,not_removed,no used for a while in various games even if they did care they couldnt tell because it uses the controller as part of the interface so the system thinks its just the controller being used
gaming,not_removed,i was especially looking at getting the do you think its worth the price point
gaming,not_removed,i have one and absolutely yes people will spend on a game without batting an eye on a controller with no question is over but it helps you enjoy games the way you want to i had a xim on and when i bought my i ordered the same day it wont make you a god tier fpser like people assume it gives you an advantage over the average player but there are plenty above average players out there to ruin you still
gaming,not_removed,i agree with nukethor it is a worthwhile investment for anyone who may not be used to controller and has been a pc gamer for years i mostly used it in destiny and a little in black ops over the last year you just have to get used to tweaking the configuration to your liking the profiles they create at xim are very good and the forums are very helpful on their site so i would definitely take advantage of the information they have available there its not going to feel exactly the same as playing on a pc with a kbam but it gets quite close ive run into plenty of other players who use it too while doing random group finding on reddit
gaming,not_removed,so you suck until you use a high damage auto target ult ive got bad news for you
gaming,not_removed,dont forget carball mod for
gaming,not_removed,actually is rocket league before it was cool literally
gaming,not_removed,first thing i thought of when i saw rocket league was httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvlrahtpksznm
gaming,not_removed,rhaloonline also in looking forward to halo forge coming to pc
gaming,not_removed,there was that really good atari game that probably predates all of this i forgot the name but it had some sweet intro music dududun dun dududun dun dun dududun dun dududun dun dun dudufndunudnudunudnudnudundn something something
gaming,not_removed,no one even mentioned this hidden gem in monster truck madness last new years me and some buddies played this for hours since we didnt have any other system but the and a few random games needless to say making a goal was so hard it made me cry also the driving is quite difficult in that game httpsyoutubepitlbpumcc
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,yesssss
gaming,not_removed,i remember an unreal tournament soccer mod atleast i think it was ut so that was before the halo one was cool
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,actually unreal tournament had a pretty sweet mod that allowed this pretty sure that was before this picture was taken
gaming,not_removed,no one remember
gaming,not_removed,there were some soccer maps in counterstrike too i think it was something like kssoccer damn they were so much fun
gaming,not_removed,descent had a mode where you had to fire weapons to move a ball in to the opponents goal that was
gaming,not_removed,the best was the map ukfootie for team fortress classic
gaming,not_removed,super sonic rocket powered battle cars
gaming,not_removed,good old halo
gaming,not_removed,no rocket league before it was cool is the spiritual predecessor ssarpbc super sonic acrobatic rocketpowered battle cars on the for some reason i feel filled with angst upon seeing this post
gaming,not_removed,is buck bumble and its the original rocket league
gaming,not_removed,halo is the inspiration for so many games by that i mean any fps on console that includes an infected mode matchmaking or voice chat
gaming,not_removed,also before it was fun
gaming,not_removed,i had totally forgotten this custom good times
gaming,not_removed,when rocket league came out it brought back so many memories of playing this
gaming,not_removed,weird this was supposed to be rokkitball but it isnt rokkitball
gaming,not_removed,still looks pretty cool to me
gaming,not_removed,im pretty sure counter strike had a mod for this way before
gaming,not_removed,i always viewed rocketball as a rip off of this old free to play of game from the mid httpwwwuniballhqcom
gaming,not_removed,buck bumble did it first
gaming,not_removed,hell yea much better no rng goes where you want it to go
gaming,not_removed,i spent an unhealthy amount of time playing soccer in during the late
gaming,not_removed,this shit was the best
gaming,not_removed,any generic shooter that took place in space halo before it was cool
gaming,not_removed,this isnt yours op this isnt you
gaming,not_removed,i remember making a soccer arena on foundry with and we played with gravity hammers good times
gaming,not_removed,i remember doing it in buck bumble
gaming,not_removed,soccerjam for cs
gaming,not_removed,i wonder if the devs were actually inspired by this
gaming,not_removed,what about that unreal tournament mod
gaming,not_removed,halo when it was cool
gaming,not_removed,ah the rush of nostalgia
gaming,not_removed,i think im the only person who ever played zero gear
gaming,not_removed,ever heard of supersonic acrobatic rocket powered battlecars rocket league is a watered down version of that game
gaming,not_removed,havent seen this post on reddit gaming before
gaming,not_removed,there was a pc game from long ago late called httpsenwikipediaorgwikisubspacevideogame it was like a multiplayer version of asteroids but instead of rocks to shoot at you had other players in ships there were a lot of different pvp modes like all other games but there was one that was like rocket league that was called powerball in powerball you moved the ball by carrying it however you couldnt carry it for more than seconds and if you were carrying it you couldnt shoot so youd pretty much need to be escorted and trade the ball between multiple ships to move it around the map it was a lot of fun
gaming,not_removed,excite bike soccer was the first i ever played of a prerocket league
gaming,not_removed,i remember a multiplayer map for the game codename eagle
gaming,not_removed,you mean supersonic acrobatic rocket powered battle cars
gaming,not_removed,did no one play gadget racers on the
gaming,not_removed,test drive eve of destruction had car soccer
gaming,not_removed,i thought you were just gonna talk about super sonic acrobatic rocket powered battle cars
gaming,not_removed,cool
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,repost
gaming,not_removed,ohh god i fucking miss this makes me feel old though
gaming,not_removed,youre all wrong this was rocket league way way way before those were cool
gaming,not_removed,youre right this does look lame
gaming,not_removed,before it was cool
gaming,not_removed,yeah yeah
gaming,not_removed,isnt that where sarbc plus or minus a few initials got its start i thought i read that somewhere
gaming,not_removed,dont forget soccer
gaming,not_removed,the creators of rocket league psyonix actually made the vehicles for back in the day and pretty much the whole onslaught game mode
gaming,not_removed,you snagged a pocket rocket
gaming,not_removed,fuck i loved carball theyre both ut engine its basically the same game
gaming,not_removed,and unwheel for and
gaming,not_removed,that mod was so much fun i wish rocket league also had rockets to fire at opponents which would work well with their name and everything
gaming,not_removed,and this is proven by the fact that most people dont even realize rocket league is pretty much a sequel
gaming,not_removed,actually this is what you linked was one direction we originally took rl before it became what it is today
gaming,not_removed,literally none of those cars are in sarpbc except the cartoon octane
gaming,not_removed,that is concept art for the sequel to sarpbc not sarpbc itself nothing from that pic made its way into the final game or rather was modified beyond recognition when compared to that pic
gaming,not_removed,why did rocket league become a big success and sarpbc didnt
gaming,not_removed,actually no
gaming,not_removed,spelunky
gaming,not_removed,well that turns this into a shitpost
gaming,not_removed,is that a malf thumbnail
gaming,not_removed,played that on my never got the whole game just the demo but it was fun
gaming,not_removed,i bought this game for dollars on my greatest dollars ever spent they should have never changed the name
gaming,not_removed,actually httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvnmnuatgerom is rocket league before it was cool
gaming,not_removed,the theme song was so great for that game
gaming,not_removed,had the first car soccer game
gaming,not_removed,the only reason i played that game was because it was free on ps plus a long ass time ago i enjoyed that game a surprising amount
gaming,not_removed,i was going to say that httpsenwikipediaorgwikibuckbumble was rocket league before it was cool amusingly the wiki has very little reference to the mini game which was by far the best part of the game
gaming,not_removed,indeed was the first thing i thought as well but maybe thats because we are a bit older
gaming,not_removed,i bet you that the halo forge on pc will lead to the return of the franchise on pc heres hoping im tired of all this hostageware nonsense edit for clarity
gaming,not_removed,that subreddit name makes me think of a mrs doubtfire online fanclub
gaming,not_removed,thank you
gaming,not_removed,rocket league is just a more advanced pong
gaming,not_removed,sounds like youre thinking of httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvxaeefqivnfk on snes the song is the theme from peter gunn
gaming,not_removed,played the shit out of that with friends did you guys ever play king of the hill on that game
gaming,not_removed,yes i finally refound it
gaming,not_removed,sounds alot like excite bike soccer mode when you finally scored it felt so good
gaming,not_removed,now i want the warthog as an xbox one exclusive vehicle i dont even own an but it just seems like a no brainer edit nevermind i guess this already exists
gaming,not_removed,it was definitely an unreal mod psyonix was founded by guys who used to mod ut
gaming,not_removed,i wish people still played tfc 😞
gaming,not_removed,the beatles were the inspiration for so many bands
gaming,not_removed,its not infected but timesplitters had a similar gametype where a flaming monkey would get you and catch you on fire and then youd both have to get the next person this was before halo was out
gaming,not_removed,it wasnt inspired by halo there was already another game made by the same company but with different name rocket league its just a sequel
gaming,not_removed,except halo didnt inspire rocket league at all you know rocket league is a sequel right
gaming,not_removed,i had played this game but never knew wtf it was about
gaming,not_removed,that is what i related rl to as well played the hell out of this game mode
gaming,not_removed,which one iirc there was both unwheel and carball
gaming,not_removed,man i could never find enough people for a lobby on haloball
gaming,not_removed,i second this edit on all the unreal tournament flags in rl they mention that they have deep ties to unreal i think some of psyonix psyonix started the carball mod then they were actually taking part of development for and i dont know if the carball part is true but its too coincidental wiki shows the ut part is true
gaming,not_removed,dont forget fuck your mom
gaming,not_removed,not only that when it came out it was a sequel with less features
gaming,not_removed,ive said this elsewhere but someone got pretty pissed at me while playing and called me a try hard i was actually kinda lit and relaxed and responded ive been playing the game for about years he got more mad saying im stupid cause it was only out months yeah ssarpbc yo its the same damn game with older graphics and more maps
gaming,not_removed,yeah
gaming,not_removed,i feel pretty cool having known and played the original back on the even though it was my friends p
gaming,not_removed,what was wrong with that game it looks really good from that pic how didnt it catch on
gaming,not_removed,yeah youre probably right ive never actually played it just happen to know that it exists and chose a random image from google that looked cool just wanted to share so people can check it out its interesting to see how much yet how little rocket league changed compared to its predecessor especially that ridiculously long name d
gaming,not_removed,zippy and scarab too
gaming,not_removed,yeah youre probably right ive never actually played it just happen to know that it exists and chose a random image from google that looked cool just wanted to share so people can check it out its interesting to see how much yet how little rocket league changed compared to its predecessor especially that ridiculously long name d
gaming,not_removed,one part being a exclusive one part having a kinda stupid name and several parts not having the huge social media pressence
gaming,not_removed,im not exactly sure when rocket league came out practically nobody knew about it until they sent a couple of copies to some big youtubers and then everyone knew about it and wanted it also sarpbc was a exclusive
gaming,not_removed,i think a big part of it was releasing it as a free for ps plus game allowing tons of people who would otherwise have been skeptical play for free
gaming,not_removed,i think it had to do with the open beta release
gaming,not_removed,a couple of reasons first and foremost it was a exclusive with little to no advertising released on the store secondly it was released in this was long before streaming and indie games became cool third ssarpbcs game play was not as refined it was much faster and arcadey that being said the skill cap was much higher for a variety of reasons im not going to get into but the style of play did not lend well to mass appeal in the same vein the lack of dedicated servers like most console games around that time the servers were peer to peer so you had a host though it wasnt game breaking host advantage was very noticeable it was definitely better split screen than online
gaming,not_removed,i wonder how much the name had to do with it rocket league is such a good name
gaming,not_removed,it was free on so many people tried it out and it gained popularity because its fucking awesome
gaming,not_removed,what about car polo from
gaming,not_removed,i was going to say httpimgurcomvajsocf you win
gaming,not_removed,i knew the chap who came up with the concept for wild wheels his name was harry nadler and he was one of the nicest guys ive ever met rip
gaming,not_removed,actually no
gaming,not_removed,apparently we were supposed to get teleporters but it never happened
gaming,not_removed,i remember that also monster truck madness had a soccer game
gaming,not_removed,i think microoft might be realizing that theyre losing out on a lot of money by not releasing a true halo game on pc i wont buy an xbone but ill buy the crap out of a good halo pc game in the meantime however halo online it is
gaming,not_removed,halo is a fuck fest of fun though
gaming,not_removed,halo is fantastic
gaming,not_removed,that was the best game type they had rounds upon rounds of king of the hill
gaming,not_removed,me too well we only had the trial version couldnt you get picked up by a helicopter or something i also remember train tracks for some reason
gaming,not_removed,there is
gaming,not_removed,ahhh there is and it shoots plasma needles out the back for boost
gaming,not_removed,it exists and its brilliant it has needlers on the back as the boosters
gaming,not_removed,the psyonix guys were responsible for some of the original vehicles in and onslaught mode in the mod you are probably thinking of was called carball carball was a different independent modder and subsequent development team there are no ties between carball and psyonix
gaming,not_removed,me too it broke my heart when came out and it was nothing like tfc then fortress forever came out and got no love id love a valvebacked proper tfc successor on the source engine but itll never happen
gaming,not_removed,yes werent they
gaming,not_removed,didnt know about that finally an educated counterpoint to my post
gaming,not_removed,halo was the first big console title to include matchmaking the first to include the infected mode halo as a custom game mode and pioneered fps control schemes and voice communication on console what was false about my statement
gaming,not_removed,did i say that halo was the inspiration for this game
gaming,not_removed,did i say halo inspired rocket league no
gaming,not_removed,it was article that i read found in comment
gaming,not_removed,just like halo
gaming,not_removed,less features how so
gaming,not_removed,but it had very important features that were added
gaming,not_removed,that picture that salemus posted was when we were working on an early version of rocket league and we tried and failed to take it in too serious of a direction it ended up just feeling clunky and it lost a lot of what makes rl fun so we started over and went the funandwacky route you see today
gaming,not_removed,i dont think zippy is in that photo and nor is scarab they are in rl as dlc though arent they
gaming,not_removed,the original kind of sucked in my experience which makes rocket league even more amazing to me no no no we know theres something here we just need to execute better
gaming,not_removed,ive never actually played it go play it
gaming,not_removed,social media as we know it was just getting started when it came out edit some stats to back this up since people dont seem to remember the social media landscape back then httpsenwikipediaorgwikisupersonicacrobaticrocketpoweredbattlecars httpssitesgooglecomatwittercomtwitterpresssitemetrics httpsenwikipediaorgwikitwitchtv
gaming,not_removed,also sarpbc was a exclusive that explains a lot
gaming,not_removed,sarpbc is also a really shit name also the big success of rocket league is probably because of ps
gaming,not_removed,that combined with rl being free for plus members when in launched probably got loads of people playing it
gaming,not_removed,besides that as i recall sarpbc was one of the early games to come out on the playstation store a feature that at the time most console gamers didnt touch and still wouldnt for years to come hell most console gamers still buy a majority of games in physical form but it took sony a lot of work store updates and deals to finally get that digital ball rolling for awhile sarpbc was one of the best games in the store but it doesnt mean much if no one sees it
gaming,not_removed,i didnt know about it until it was free on
gaming,not_removed,i meant return of the franchise to pc sorry ill change it
gaming,not_removed,a true halo game is all of the halo games none of them are bad some are just better than others and reach were the best but the new ones arent too bad
gaming,not_removed,and now im gonna need to grind some more hours in the hope of unlocking it
gaming,not_removed,yeah when the first screen shots of the original that wasnt arcade like got me excited i just love the old mechanics from the game like conc jumps still is my favorite fps of all time mostly because it was the first i got into
gaming,not_removed,timesplitters had an infected mode and it came out in halo very popular and highly rated fps
gaming,not_removed,i forgot we had voip waaaaay before it took off in the business world i remember my mom was dumbfounded by the idea i could talk to my friends over the internet without a phone about six years later shes going on about ciscos new voip meeting platform
gaming,not_removed,no you said it was the inspiration for all games lol actually i think doom was the inspiration for all fps games what we
gaming,not_removed,a few of the psyonix guys were the ones who created the vehicles and onslaught game mode for but none of their team were involved in the mod carball the original developers for carball have no ties or relationship with psyonix its simply that psyonix was able to execute on the concept with new platforms and capitalize on it one or two of the carball developers tried to make a version and was not very successful the original creator of carball did it simply for the create something unreal contest for but handed off development a year or so after that
gaming,not_removed,halo is better than halo
gaming,not_removed,rip halo
gaming,not_removed,sarpbc had a tutorial a singleplayer challenge mode like floorislava onekickgoals etc and more assymetrical levels on the other hand rocket league has more car customization and theyre bringing back some of the old levels now although with vr textures
gaming,not_removed,when it came out it had like stadium when it came out
gaming,not_removed,i meant the pic you posted what is that game
gaming,not_removed,yep
gaming,not_removed,this is the truth actually ssarpbc had a cult following and it was essentially that following that made us realize that the game would be something special if it was just refined more
gaming,not_removed,did it i used to play it constantly and turned it on to show my friends who are now rocket league fans its dated looking and only so not as responsive but otherwise its the exact same game mechanics and gameplay wise admittedly there are more modes and maps in the original
gaming,not_removed,it was a exclusive never had one unless you meant rocket league then yeah i played it its awesome
gaming,not_removed,pair this with steam ingame streaming and native ability to stream makes watchitplayeds so much more accessible than the nearest equivalent during the previous generation
gaming,not_removed,i think it was super popular at first because it was free on and it got a lot of publicity the sub was just filled with rocket league stuff during the beta and i dont think that the pc had a beta version to help with its popularity back then i think i remember seeing lots of gifs from the version on rgaming before it was out but yeah then when it finally came out and was available on both systems at the same time it just kinda exploded i preferred the first game at first it just had more features and wasnt the same repetitive map layouts every time but the updates have made rl much better
gaming,not_removed,sent a couple of copies to some big youtubers and then everyone knew about it and wanted it that explains more
gaming,not_removed,whats shit about supersonic acrobatic rocket powered battle cars
gaming,not_removed,even the developers have admitted this was an issue meanwhile my friends and i would get drunk playing this and challenge each other to say the name quickly dunno why but we found that fun
gaming,not_removed,sarpbc is also a really shit name i remember trying to remember this game before rocket league came out and couldnt remember the name hey what was that game where you play soccer with cars
gaming,not_removed,and overwhelmingly positive reviews on steampc the same week
gaming,not_removed,i think this is what really launched the game into the stratosphere it was huge when it was on psplus that month
gaming,not_removed,its been years and i cant get the highschooler out of me send help
gaming,not_removed,everyone has their opinion i suppose i have logged and i still love it each day
gaming,not_removed,you have to do something specific to unlock it though i dont remember what it was
gaming,not_removed,i didnt know that
gaming,not_removed,parents man no clue about technology
gaming,not_removed,you realize the word all wasnt used in his sentence right he said so many so you are kinda just making up an argument that doesnt exist
gaming,not_removed,it might be better than halo but it gets atomic wedgied by halo was the pinnacle of the game before it got ruined and codified
gaming,not_removed,doesnt have local multiplayer or coop not better
gaming,not_removed,i think that most of the downvotes come from the fact you just admitted that you havent even played the game and really have no valid opinion
gaming,not_removed,i love halo
gaming,not_removed,you shouldnt have mentioned you didnt play it the game most likely has bonus features that arent usedworth using which is almost as bad as not having them
gaming,not_removed,i really like the tronfeel that the lab arenas have though minimalist and snazzy
gaming,not_removed,no it had one stadium in the beta when it officially released it had at least
gaming,not_removed,point i think i got the game maybe a month after it was out word of mouth from a friend
gaming,not_removed,thats the game we released in called supersonic acrobatic rocketpowered battle cars it came out on rocket league is basically a highlypolished version of that game
gaming,not_removed,hope aftershock comes next
gaming,not_removed,imo you guys nailed it thanks for making a great game
gaming,not_removed,any chance of more licensed dlc cars like kitt the general lee batmobile or the mystery machine
gaming,not_removed,whoops yeah thought you meant rl
gaming,not_removed,but rocket league was out in early access like a few months to a year before rocket league released right correct me if im wrong but if im correct then pc was the one with the beta
gaming,not_removed,it wasnt going to sell million copies on if they had sent out a thousand free youtuber copies of the previous game they both explain it
gaming,not_removed,i remember trying to tell my friends about it and they said what the fuck are you talking about i also had to call playstation support about it and although in nicer words he basically said what game are you fucking talking about
gaming,not_removed,win a game with every other vehicle
gaming,not_removed,thank you very much i can understand misquoting people in real life but when you can just scroll up and see what they wrote thats lazy
gaming,not_removed,oh i know i lived halo multiplayer
gaming,not_removed,reach was my favorite halo ever it made halo feel insanely slow
gaming,not_removed,halo was amazing but i think reach was still the best made an abomination with and i never played because of it
gaming,not_removed,imo reach was the pinnacle of the game
gaming,not_removed,i seriously wish it did have those i was speaking in terms of campaignsingle player gameplay i shouldve specified
gaming,not_removed,i do too
gaming,not_removed,he might mean there was only one type of stadium as they were all shaped the same
gaming,not_removed,all the same though supersonic had a bunch of different maps actually different
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,thanks
gaming,not_removed,were always open to that kind of stuff nothing thats announced or anything at this point
gaming,not_removed,they both explain it i never said otherwise
gaming,not_removed,lmao guess its time to stop playing with the octane
gaming,not_removed,yeah i was gutted when the website for our stats changed over and loads of the details were lost
gaming,not_removed,but the armorlock shivers
gaming,not_removed,bungie gave them an amazing franchie with loyal fans and awesome gameplay did everything wrong
gaming,not_removed,ive owned every single halo game since the release of combat evolved in including the abortion that was halo wars on the shelves around my room are the art pieces from every single collectors edition of halo released from day one after halo halo got codified loadouts sprint ads etc whether you like to admit it or not the formula changed drastically after and became like call of duty saying that anyone who makes that assertion must not have played the games shows a remarkable lack of ability to critically analyse the material and how it has changed youre entitled to your opinion but keep your assumptions to yourself
gaming,not_removed,nah i have played its cod in halo form
gaming,not_removed,i know what you were talking about but local coop was make or break it for me halo has never been my favorite fps but the local coop was always really nice
gaming,not_removed,while halo has gotten better since launch it was missing a few key features of previous installments forge being the main one though it has been added into the game since then im not able to say how good it might be
gaming,not_removed,content features
gaming,not_removed,which got patched
gaming,not_removed,i always felt like it added a nice level of understanding people who didnt know about the emp and the end and those who just didnt know how to deal with it its easy to deal with considering youre a sitting duck coming out of it
gaming,not_removed,to be fair halo has changed its formula with each release halo just happened to be the biggest formula change and halo still feels like halo it just has features that have become standard in shooters now is it codified hardly cod isnt the first shooter with sprint or ads if anything halo is the step in the right direction to become the top console shooter again just needs take a page from bungie and stop with this if we give you this you cant have this mentality halo is the best playing of the series in my opinion now just needs to load us with the feature we are used to
gaming,not_removed,including the abortion that was halo wars i stopped reading after that
gaming,not_removed,sprint and mantling i would agree are features ripped straight from call of duty but the comparison is a bit ridiculous its apples and oranges would disagree on ads the ads in the game is the same as it has been in every single other halo just slightly reskinned doesnt effect gameplay at all evidenced by the introduction of the classic br
gaming,not_removed,they did forge in halo the same way and made most of the maps dlc
gaming,not_removed,im not able to say how good it might be its by far the best forge in any halo weve come a long way from halo
gaming,not_removed,i got it and an xbox one a few days ago ive got to say im a much bigger fan of it than i was and think its a step in the right direction but i dont really know it doesnt feel like halo to me it feels like a good triple a shooter maybe its the change in pacing caused by the sprint and maybe its just the odd change here and there but part of me misses halo where halo only lightly adapted the formula and at least in reach it gave you the choice of using the armor abilitiessprint depending on your game mode
gaming,not_removed,which is best in the series is entirely subjective so ill respectfully disagree with you cod isnt the first to use those attributes and i never insinuated that was the case however to ignore the fact that at the time these changes were made cod was the big dog in the yard it was very obvious to me as a player of both games that inspiration was being taken directly from one to the other reach was the beginning of the walk towards codville and its kept on that path since then deviating from the arena formula without loadouts is a fundamental change in the halo experience it upset how the game flowed and it absolutely destroyed the concept of map control being an important aspect of play power weapons powerups and vehicles were the most important things to consider when developing strategies for map control in reach didnt entirely forgo these elements but it perverted them enough so that they werent nearly as important as before as a coordinated team game demanded far more tactical thinking from the players in order to beat the other team i feel that element has been all but lost in more recent iterations of the franchise
gaming,not_removed,good for you mate its an utterly horrible rts that was nothing more than a use of the halo license for a cash grab
gaming,not_removed,i disagree and the fact that it is getting a sequal i think proves people enjoyed it i think youre problem is you hate change something that is unavoidable for either they dont change halo and people complain its the same damn game or they do and people like you complain personally i cant get into halo anymore the pacing is too slow dont have that issue with though
gaming,not_removed,watchdogs is getting a sequel kane lynch got a sequel plenty of poor games get sequels also how can you infer that i hate change when i expressed distaste for the first entry of a new game i like rts games i just didnt like this one even though im a huge fan of the halo universe i think youre just upset that im disagreeing with you its ok we dont have to agree as long as we respect one anothers opinions making assumptions about me just makes you look a little silly
gaming,not_removed,i agree we dont have to agree but it seems even the smallest of changes like aiming down makes you believe its cod which is why i think you hate change it doesnt change the game radically the death time is still long compared to cod it really doesnt make sense how anyone would think its cod i guess you could explain how that makes it cod but youre right opinions are opinions and i liked and being my favorite in terms of campaign also saying we should respect opinions doesnt really work when you call things abortions makes the opinion argument one sided when you think other peoples opinions are shit mate
gaming,not_removed,no me calling it an abortion is an expression of my opinion not a negation of yours just because i used a word you find emotive doesnt mean that im stating my opinion as an objective fact i already explained that in my opinion the inspirations were being lifted from cod and to a lesser extent battlefield thats because they were the dominating forces in the fps market at that time and so it follows logically that these were the games tried to emulate i already said that the deviation from power weapons and powerups being focal points in map control played a big part in how it followed the cod line of thought the inclusion in reach of the invasion game type was an obvious nod to similar game types that were at the time proving so popular in battlefield the first cod game dropped in and had ads ads didnt show up in halo until reach in making cod the most popular game to use the mechanic in the interim year period the class system couldve been coopted from either cod or battlefield as it shares similarities to both i just feel it more closely resembles cods systems
gaming,not_removed,the inspirations were being lifted from cod and to a lesser extent battlefield thats because they were the dominating forces in the fps market at that time and so it follows logically that these were the games tried to emulate because every other video game wasnt already including sprint in their game it seemed more like it was trying to stay modern instead of becoming a relic of the past old games are cool but some of them havent aged well halo would be one of them if it sticks to the original game i already said that the deviation from power weapons and powerups being focal points in map control played a big part in how it followed the cod line of thought so you havent played halo power weapons and power ups are still prominent ads all of these things are just modern day mechanics that are in almost every single game not just cod its a standard at this point getting upset that halo has sprinting or ads is like getting upset that it even had gun because other games had it before halo people want invasion look at rhalo people want all of those game modes cod has a zombies mode yet rhalo had been complaining for a while that infection wasnt in halo yet they dont seem upset that its stealing from cod like i said man its okay to dislike change but dont say oh its cod now i dont like it they are still completely different beasts whether you care to admit that is not really a big deal but having a closed mine isnt cool dude
gaming,not_removed,look ive already given my justifications for why i hold the opinions that i do not only have i not gotten upset i never insinuated features were stolen you seem to not understand the difference between inspiration and theft of intellectual property ive been perfectly courteous to you and been respectful of your opinion i dont get why you seem to be getting your knickers in a twist over it calling me closedminded because i hold an opinion that is different to yours in this case that are superior to and that hw is an abortion is closedminded in and of itself you seem to be of the mindset that everyone who disagrees with you is wrong when were talking about an inherently subjective topic at this point i feel its pointless to continue discussing this with you since you cant be reasonable about other peoples opinions have a nice day dude
gaming,not_removed,team ninja
gaming,not_removed,im sure dead or alive has great breast collision
gaming,not_removed,examples of what im talking about nsfw httpimgurcomaowxen
gaming,not_removed,im on pc sadly but they do have good collision
gaming,not_removed,yes but not well i am a very adept skyrim modder and the havok collision object is the closest thing to this which is buggy as hell sadly l
gaming,not_removed,its using fallout engine sadly this wont allow for what im looking for it just isnt possible with what it is made on without getting too technical in special edition and skyrim both have the skeletons clipping into wall or floor spazzing out that is the very reason the game cant do collision right on breast hair anything the looks promising but its in such obscurity im afraid people will abandon it
gaming,not_removed,its a evil device that makes you believe you can win but in reality youre setup for failure
gaming,not_removed,my bowling ally betrayed me to my worst bowling enemy
gaming,not_removed,if thats what i think it is then your local bowling alley has a goddamn master mind running it
gaming,not_removed,please dont tell me its a vending machine that pushes electronic devices down so you can pick it up at the buttom
gaming,not_removed,guess i shoulda said my local bowling ally has a nintendo switch in stock
gaming,not_removed,what is that thing
gaming,not_removed,isnt there a strategy to winning at these type of games
gaming,not_removed,id straight up get those sennheisers instead cost more than the switch too
gaming,not_removed,just buy a switch box online and say you got it out of this machine
gaming,not_removed,i just wouldve played up to for the opportunity
gaming,not_removed,these machines are evil dont fool yourself into thinking you can win they use them in casinos for this reason
gaming,not_removed,i was hoping no one would notice that error haha
gaming,not_removed,thats exactly what it is gotta put a box in a hole and it drops the prize if you can do it
gaming,not_removed,the strategy is see machine pull your money out dont spend it on this devils thieving machine save your money rinse repeat till you have enough for the item you wanted buy it at a real store
gaming,not_removed,yea use a hammer
gaming,not_removed,you have to use a cheat code and by cheat code i mean crowbar
gaming,not_removed,if its any similar to key master games it should pretty much be basic timing and waiting for the machine to be ready to pay out odds are itll take or so plays before that machine would be ready to payout
gaming,not_removed,well sorta these kinds of machines dont actually have the prize inside of it thats just an empty box for display if you get it you bring it up to the counter and they give you the real thing
gaming,not_removed,your strategy seems all to simple im sure their is a catch
gaming,not_removed,the product isnt in the machine you need to bee discreet learn how to pick locks get good go to machine get someone to watch your back pick lock and and grab what you need get product and get out
gaming,not_removed,well thats an effective way
gaming,not_removed,key master machines use a computerized vertical displacement setting to prevent the key from actually going into the slot and this vd is set by halfmillimeters key master is very commonly set up so that the number of loses required before a win can be allowed is equal to the cost of the most expensive prize so in this case yeah the winlose ratio would be around and thats still a better ratio than the factory default
gaming,not_removed,from what i can see there are catches this requires you to have disposable income you can savespend you will never know how long it could take p you must find a place in which it is in stock but other than that it is a chance of obtaining the item of your choice
gaming,not_removed,music was a bit annoying editing was otherwise good
gaming,not_removed,thx
gaming,not_removed,i am a feminist and i say no those who make such ridiculous claims are typically just looking for attention ususally in seek of famenotoriety or financial gain some truly are loony and buy into the craziness sadly the internet is sort of a double edged sword for feminism in one hand it opened commucations unlike ever before which helps advocacy of the movement on the other hand some people try to hijack successful movements injecting their own ideologies into it for example vegans often try to claim you have to be a vegan to be a real feminist unfortunately those that are trying to hide their real ideologies under the umbrella of feminism and those that are touched in the head tend to also be the loudest and thus get the most attention which makes people think that is what feminism stands for when a majority actually disagrees with such hog wash ms pacman existence isnt sexist she is just a female pac person to say that having female counterparts to male characters is sexist is simply absurd its nothing more than reaching for things to be upset about where would this even end almost every character in a game has traits that reveal their gender in some manner and look similar to the same species male counterparts heck this is pretty much a biological reality very few species have vastly different looking members based on gender given that pacman and ms pacman are also very limited graphically there is not much you could do to set the two apart its not like they could make her look vastly different back then
gaming,not_removed,the original pacman was aimed at women
gaming,not_removed,in some ways yes in the sense of social perception and the role of women but it isnt like super awful in essense a little yes but a little no
gaming,not_removed,thanks for that vegan example i never thought of stuff like that as subgroups in a way coming in from outside and subverting the movement if that makes sense it always seems like its coming from the inside
gaming,not_removed,ok is that sexist
gaming,not_removed,in some ways yes in the sense of social perception and the role of women can you please explain to me how ms pacman somehow represents the role of a woman in any form of way the game is nothing more than a advanced and superior version of pacman a well known and beloved arcade game and here is a female lead taken the place of a established brand
gaming,not_removed,i dont think so i mean i think that his views about women were very simplistic possibly naive but thats not sexism
gaming,not_removed,its like super minimal but she has no existence outside of her male counterpart its not something im losing sleep over but its a little fucked up
gaming,not_removed,the fallout deathclaws where much much more intimidating
gaming,not_removed,the bottom since it has the most contrast nice work
gaming,not_removed,the bottom one realism and detail is where its at
gaming,not_removed,i how the guy goes holy shit that would be exactly my reaction if i managed to pull something off like that
gaming,not_removed,youll be fine previous mass effect games are pretty damn cheap so you could go buy them play them and then be caught up if you wanted too
gaming,not_removed,yes andromeda is very spererate from the original three it shares some lore of species and tools but places actual people the new aliens the new gear all of it will be fresh and there will no doubt be an introduction to everything you will be caught up well and you wont miss out on much the only thing you may miss out on is esster eggs maybe a few refrences to the original trilogy but nothing important
gaming,not_removed,games companies arent in the habit of making a game only for people who have finished their previous titles so im going to say that youre only going to miss out on a few references and characters back stories
gaming,not_removed,whats with this giant walking lizard thing with a shotgun following me around making threatening puns
gaming,not_removed,if they dont explain it in the story then they missed a perfect opportunity for content
gaming,not_removed,points only expire if you dont use your card once every days stop your bullshit stop your shilling and most importantly stop your shitposting
gaming,not_removed,whoa are you talking to the me or to gamestop i was attempting to point out how manipulative this stupid email is when i dont even fucking shop there anymore according to you my points expired over years ago lol did i need to add sarcasm for you
gaming,not_removed,i think youre upset
gaming,not_removed,i work for the company and as a result know our communication methods and pur rewards terms also on top of the points disappearing every year without use if you dont use the account within two years youre removed from our system and all communication stops so stop the bullshit
gaming,not_removed,id say so just convenient that the company starts a major sale and somebody posts something on one of the largest gaming pages online that would spark the average account holder viewer to check their points and possibly go to the store
gaming,not_removed,somebody just accused me of shilling for gamestop how would you feel p
gaming,not_removed,you work for the company mentions a major sale while going after this guy whose side is this guy really on staywoke
gaming,not_removed,wait whos shilling what now either you are wrong about something or i am some anomaly in the system last thing i bought at gs was their exclusive collectors edition oh because you know that shit was late haha
gaming,not_removed,hey its a shitty sale personally i get my games on amazon these days
gaming,not_removed,looks like you just dug a hole under his original location
gaming,not_removed,its a public park are dog walkers being disresectful would yoga enthusiasts be disrespectfull being a vet dousnt mean you can be a douche canoe
gaming,not_removed,seriously all the veterans that the memorial is honoring died so people could indeed play a stupid mobile game freely if they choose at any location
gaming,not_removed,remindme days
gaming,not_removed,veterans park is pretty big for winona standards plenty of room for everyone they passed a ruling on making it off limits last night anyway
gaming,not_removed,it wasnt just a park it was a vietnam memorial
gaming,not_removed,being a vet doesnt make it ok to just be an asshole all the time the video really didnt show enough to have context either way but the old man came at them like that because he knew they were kids and werent gonna do anything
gaming,not_removed,i am a rightwing murica bleeding patriot who gets choked up every time i watch band of brothers or black hawk down or anything of the sort i simply cannot see how you guys are siding with the vet on this one memorials and parks are to be used thats why they exist to remind the citizens who use them of the sacrifice it took so they could go enjoy their life liberty and pursuit of happiness bottom line if they arent pissing on it or vandalizing it who the hell is this jerk to decree what is and isnt acceptable and respectful use i simply dont see an issue with these kids using the memorial at all i hope this guy gets charged for assault and battery and has a court ordered constitution and civics lesson
gaming,not_removed,looks from the news that the pokemon go players are about to be asked to pokemon go away
gaming,not_removed,the vets are irrational assholes the pokemon go players are antagonistic shits no one wins here and stop burping while youre recording its repulsive
gaming,not_removed,what was he a vet of the fucking buffet
gaming,not_removed,incoming omg dey are veterans dey are entitled to do what dey want comments veteran or not if youre an asshole youre an asshole and from the second video the guy posted the veteran flipped the tent no more than a minute after arriving to talk didnt seem very peaceful to me
gaming,not_removed,if youre looking for an atta boy or you were in the right youve come to the wrong place
gaming,not_removed,a bunch of disrespectful people a guy that has fought in battle and you want to sit and be a horrible prick to the man there is several spots to go and sit up a tent but go to a vets monument i love how the guys are sitting at the end saying i wish he would have punched me but every time the guy started coming towards them he would start to walk back fast also that fake out was great the guy in the orange puts up his hands fast and that asshat got punked out so hard
gaming,not_removed,jesus christ go do something productive with your lives people
gaming,not_removed,this is whats wrong with the next generation theyre assholes and im nowhere near the age of the old man i mean hes wrong for tearing the canopy down thats wrong and he should have just let the cops deal with it but what we dont see is what the kids did to provoke him first
gaming,not_removed,bad on both ends youre so into pokemon that you go there to play thats so disrespectful on the other hand he shouldnt have acted like that in the video we cant see what the kids did to provoke him they were probably being smart asses who know
gaming,not_removed,those kids had no intentions of honoring the people that died to protect those freedoms they were there to play video games and only play video games do you not see the hypocrisy in that to scream your freedoms at the people who fought to protect them it was disrespectful but both parties handled the situation poorly
gaming,not_removed,your post is days old
gaming,not_removed,they are honoring them by being free and protecting the freedoms the are allowed those vets would roll over in the graves of americans were being kicked out of damn near any american soil
gaming,not_removed,oki got the notification yesterday
gaming,not_removed,i am helping
gaming,not_removed,you should honestly spend money on an ethernet cable to actually wire your connection i have the basic router verizon supplies on wifi i got like wired i get
gaming,not_removed,spend on a long ass ethernet cable
gaming,not_removed,either get a router with good wireless n support which should give you over or use ethernet ethernet is the best choice as its much more stable than wifi no matter how good the router
gaming,not_removed,whats the fastest your device can connect to dont waste money on a gaming router the air ports are ok but not really worth the extra if you can use a or ac or even just n i would get an ac router the archer is a decent router with a decent price it really depends on your price asus netgear and many others make good wireless ac products products that say gaming on them usually offer less than other products of the same price its a marketing gimmick if you are using a desktop then upgrading your wifi card may be needed if you are using some other gaming device then you should find out what wifi standard it can use the xbone and can both do n but the xbone can use the band most laptops can use a or at least n
gaming,not_removed,maaaan i got a one for like £ they cheap as fuck i dont feel sorry for people that say they cant wire that shit up
gaming,not_removed,ive seen a lot of pics like this recently and im really curious about them does prompto just take random pictures and send them to you or something
gaming,not_removed,he constantly takes pictures of the trip its his special quirk you see all of the current ones every time you camp you can then save them and share them on social media
gaming,not_removed,im so ready
gaming,not_removed,i never asked for this
gaming,not_removed,if only witcher goty edition can rewin the goty award
gaming,not_removed,next youll be telling me peter molyneux is full of shit too
gaming,not_removed,this video is insane and a testament to how toxic the gaming community is
gaming,not_removed,no wonder how much money blizzard spent to get that goty
gaming,not_removed,who cares for awards still
gaming,not_removed,not only overpricing but they cant even get it right
gaming,not_removed,knowing walmart they probably studied which spiderman orientation sold more copies using a blind study and then created a spiderman game orientation policies and procedures manual for their employees to ensure it was packaged in the most profitable manner also knowing walmart some underpaid employee probably put it in the wrong way and said fuck it whats done is done not my job or something similar
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,ncaa id snatch that shit up
gaming,not_removed,for spiderman
gaming,not_removed,i hope this photo is recent
gaming,not_removed,ncaa football
gaming,not_removed,for spiderman on no way id pay that
gaming,not_removed,ncaa football for actually isnt that bad of a price
gaming,not_removed,thatll be please
gaming,not_removed,rnotmyjob
gaming,not_removed,can confirm worked at wm did this to every copy when this game came out
gaming,not_removed,fingers crossed for spider man
gaming,not_removed,current walmart electronics employee ive done it once and never again rofl i catch other people putting it in upside down still though
gaming,not_removed,i didnt even know denard robinson was on ncaa price is about right
gaming,not_removed,theres one done right behind it
gaming,not_removed,up
gaming,not_removed,both theories make sense
gaming,not_removed,the video you linked might be the funniest thing ive seen all day
gaming,not_removed,god that video was fucking awful the intro itself made me sob
gaming,not_removed,as a former employee of walmart i can confirm that the second one is correct
gaming,not_removed,even though its the last ncaa football game id suggest buying the game preowned ncaa basketball though id buy that for almost
gaming,not_removed,if youre being serious the sticker was placed upside down because the worker was lazydidnt give a shit
gaming,not_removed,i took the photo and immediately posted it so
gaming,not_removed,it was definitely the funniest video i saw all day i wish i knew what that editing style was called cause it makes me lose my shit every single time there must be a whole subreddit of these just outside my reach edit im narrowing it down to mlg remix and airhorn remix but nothing of the same quality is really coming up
gaming,not_removed,pretty easy to tell he was joking
gaming,not_removed,looks kinda like a youtube poop if you like those i highly recommend skooks and the fesh pince of blair
gaming,not_removed,going to post this on rfindareddit
gaming,not_removed,its rmontageparodies enjoy edit hmm it looks like there is a lot less of this stuff now but i had a youtube channel for you but even that went a different route now
gaming,not_removed,u guys have space lol
gaming,not_removed,whats your point
gaming,not_removed,consoles are not meant for modding as it is not an open platform go to bethesda website all those scrubs pleading for console mods lol most mods are just more items etc but of the playerbase think itll be textures and sweetfx topkek
gaming,not_removed,your elitism is showing
gaming,not_removed,if elitism means realistic overview of things and actually knowing the facts then im guilty
gaming,not_removed,nah but doing it with a condescending undertone does
gaming,not_removed,okay mate
gaming,not_removed,why cant people just play what they want gamers can play on what ever system they prefer
gaming,not_removed,enjoy getting robbed and holding back games
gaming,not_removed,on march the game will be years old try google next time
gaming,not_removed,stop right there criminal scum
gaming,not_removed,fat faces for all
gaming,not_removed,the remaster we all need
gaming,not_removed,completed the story with a character that had every skill maxed and never went past level love that game
gaming,not_removed,when youre too lazy to update the title on your repost this is the lowest loweffort shit ive ever seen here way to set the bar
gaming,not_removed,i feel like this game will elevate teabagging to a whole new level
gaming,not_removed,if only halo back then had that there would have been even more raging than there already was lol
gaming,not_removed,ive spent half an hour looking at guide videos and still played like trash
gaming,not_removed,i would gladly partake in this experiment
gaming,not_removed,hmm sounds super interesting i may try this tomorrow as its late right now
gaming,not_removed,like the speed cheat in guitar hero oboy oboy
gaming,not_removed,thats what i do when i play rhythm games hatsune miku project diva when i find myself stuck because of a song thats too fast i just play a harderfaster one and then it seems easy
gaming,not_removed,stoner thoughts
gaming,not_removed,looove it im not currenly playing anything but i will try to find a game i know to try it with
gaming,not_removed,yeah honestly how are you supposed to get better if you cant understand half of whats going on becase its playing speed
gaming,not_removed,was that cheat supposed to make the game harder i feel like it made it easier and it got to a point where i couldnt play without it
gaming,not_removed,try watching it autocomplete or perfect run on yt with double speed times for good measure
gaming,not_removed,youre not expected to get better just by that you are actually supposed to try to make out whats happening thats the whole point i avoided spoilers because placebo and stuff going back to regular gameplay you should experience feeling of slow motion if you didnt have the flash away from malph ult sense youre not going to magically get it but since your brain works faster you may just watch it if you have a thought that you should probably do something that could be the first step to forging the connection in your brain your body wont be able to keep up if you try to play osu with that your hand will lag behind and be inaccurate your brain can process the information but the fast movement you demand was never trained
gaming,not_removed,it does it spaces out the notes more so it is easier to descipher quarter notes from eighth notes and such the clearer interpretation means your brain is less confused when you try to hit the notes
gaming,not_removed,brilliant i cant wait love you and your work﻿
gaming,not_removed,im not gavin dunne i just posted his song because i thought people would like to know about it
gaming,not_removed,er okay now what
gaming,not_removed,instructions unclear penis stuck in ceiling fan
gaming,not_removed,yo thanks for trying it out how was it
gaming,not_removed,did you know its a remix of a traditional bulgarian wedding song
gaming,not_removed,yep percival lazare i think it is or is it still just lazare
gaming,not_removed,the band who plays it is called percival and the song is lazare
gaming,not_removed,if your into games alot and you obviously like the witcher check out super bunnyhophe is a gaming journalist on youtube and i love his vids he has ones on the witcher series
gaming,not_removed,ah ok
gaming,not_removed,if you saw someone murder a dozen people and they ask for a hotdog would you say no
gaming,not_removed,overwatch isnt very demanding the main benefit of pc is playing with mouse and high fps im sure its fun either way but for a game like overwatch a screenshot doesnt really show why pc is great
gaming,not_removed,i usually play on pc its awsome but and xbox are good too
gaming,not_removed,check out the alienisolation shots and get back to us
gaming,not_removed,all great no difference
gaming,not_removed,apparently has the best screenshot function thats all i can see at least
gaming,not_removed,my favorite game i play on all platforms
gaming,not_removed,i see a slight difference in graphics
gaming,not_removed,i dont think a picture like this would do much justice in way of determining the best anyway theyre all manipulated ie resized unless the person is really playing in portrait mode for some reason edit or they could be cropped i guess but then id wonder what was up with the images dimensions specifically height
gaming,not_removed,i agree ive never played this game but ive watched youtube videos where folks have spoke so compassionately about this game the story and their hopes for the future of it its truly bizarre yet beautiful maybe its just a good game and thats all that matters
gaming,not_removed,thats because the image quality is so fucking bad this post is dumb because its comparing graphics but the image quality is so bad you cant make out details
gaming,not_removed,i saw quite a few differences and i dont care about this stuff this is really my first time ever speaking of differences in platform here are a few door in the background looks different on all the shadowing on the middle post balcony is either nonexistent or too faint for my eyes to pick up on it for the guns are different colors and look dented under the barrel where the doesnt the grassweeds on the left pc looks smoothed but i dont know if thats intentional or not probably quite a few more differences given that i have color vision issues
gaming,not_removed,if screenshots were not scaled youd immediately see which platform was best people dont want to do a pure comparison though
gaming,not_removed,also the saloon lettering is a lot less readible on the version still youd expect a much larger difference in graphics between the three but i guess the differences are much more noticable in motion
gaming,not_removed,theres always one
gaming,not_removed,they could at least have been scaled to theres no point in reducing the resolution to when all plattforms exceed this value anyway
gaming,not_removed,all it does is hides the fact that the game looks blocky on the worst platform
gaming,not_removed,i mean the fallout game are pretty dystopian but im sure youve played those
gaming,not_removed,it might not be quiiiite what youre looking for but try taking a look at remember me it came out on a while back
gaming,not_removed,half life deus ex not set in the future but bioshock may tread some themes you like
gaming,not_removed,half life dishonored metro are my go to games
gaming,not_removed,is sort of an rpg fantasy dystopian game
gaming,not_removed,satellite reign wasteland doesnt really fit description but bioshock series is a classic
gaming,not_removed,the syndicate fps by starbreeze
gaming,not_removed,this art was created for the game remember me set in a dystopian paris in where did you get this without actually knowing where it came from anyway im sure you guys know about life is strange well the same dev team that made that made remember me
gaming,not_removed,i played mad max recently and quite enjoyed it
gaming,not_removed,half life
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,hard reset is kind of like the picture you posted
gaming,not_removed,yes ive played a bit of fallout put hours into new vegas and im starting on fallout
gaming,not_removed,you know why you say that the artist of this painting works at dontnod who made remember me
gaming,not_removed,ill check this game out thanks
gaming,not_removed,hey youre right paul chadeisson just looked it up cool explains why i immediately thought of it
gaming,not_removed,title spoilers too can you fucking use some common sense next time
gaming,not_removed,while i havent seen john wick im willing to bet hardcore henry beats it as far as feeling like a video game
gaming,not_removed,i didnt really got video game movie vibe from it i mean i get your points but dont really feel like that things are exclusively games tropes it was a well done action movie and those elements kinda correlate to well done action game i would say they were kinda matrixish but without defying physics by much and games took a lot from matrix movies the most gamey part you pointed out is the fact that everyone ignores wick until he starts the fight but that has its basis in the movie almost everyone know who he is people ignore him willingly at least up to the point there is some money at the table anyway loved that little payday reference although it was hard to spot edit although the fact that the people in nyc dont give a single fuck about firefist fights kinda puts them in npcs league so yeah there is that
gaming,not_removed,have you thought about the fact video games are becoming more like movies every day this was inevitable
gaming,not_removed,holy wall of text batman
gaming,not_removed,sure
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,rekt
gaming,not_removed,one of my favorite videos of all time i always laugh watching this
gaming,not_removed,i choose pc pikachu p
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,guess i hacked
gaming,not_removed,i have all three so i choose all
gaming,not_removed,for pokemon the new of course
gaming,not_removed,id love that but unlikely they have never done a full pokemon game on home console its gamefreaks choice not nintendos people forget that
gaming,not_removed,wheres the pc option
gaming,not_removed,i chose switch if anyone was wondering
gaming,not_removed,lol
gaming,not_removed,blazionspring received squirtle
gaming,not_removed,you already have the switch where are you from
gaming,not_removed,what if a pokemon game comes to the switch though 🤔
gaming,not_removed,pc only comes in pokémon yellow silly
gaming,not_removed,squirtle is pretty adorable
gaming,not_removed,well i dont have it physically but its on its way to be delivered to me on friday then i will officially have all
gaming,not_removed,tomorrow i will have a switch and right now i have no next gen consoles lol
gaming,not_removed,rebeccas back awesome
gaming,not_removed,tldr cd project red is awesome
gaming,not_removed,never stop having faith in studios be wary of publishers youre clearly confusing the two
gaming,not_removed,thats just it though isnt it regardless of whether or not its marketing propaganda they still deliver and are good to their players giving away a hard copy of the great soundtrack i remember the feeling i got when i first strolled through skellige on my way to meet up with yen and the music was a genuine part of that experience regular skins and armor sets new quests etc this is all stuff they could have charged for or bundled in with exclusive outlets but they made it available for everyone plus the expansions are worth paying for
gaming,not_removed,this i had a friend say wow i cant believe ea made battlefield me that was dice that made battlefield friend exfriend whos dice
gaming,not_removed,someone should make a petition on changeorg to shut down changeorg
gaming,not_removed,emm will they slap the console exclusive label on the american version of the cover
gaming,not_removed,i am interested generic way to show i am interested in this game
gaming,not_removed,i like it much better the the original niers box art
gaming,not_removed,youd need to read the terms of the store but the place i buy from guarantees either the price you paid or the price it changes to whichever is lowest
gaming,not_removed,fyi i would hold off on buying it
gaming,not_removed,cant wait to play skyrim at
gaming,not_removed,really good for a handheld really shitty for a home console
gaming,not_removed,but can it play angry birds
gaming,not_removed,jesus its come on nintendo wheres the ram hdd display lol
gaming,not_removed,really shitty might be an overstatement but if the switch was a discloaded console like the xbox one and itd be pretty bad cartridge based gives it the advantage of cartridge games basically being their own ram without write capabilities from httpsenwikipediaorgwikiromcartridgeadvantagesanddisadvantages as the rom cartridge is memory mapped into the systems normal address space software stored in the rom can be read like normal memory since the system does not have to transfer data from slower media it allows for nearly instant load time and code execution
gaming,not_removed,minecraft
gaming,not_removed,true but games like skyrim se for say would be like
gaming,not_removed,but why games are cartridges and usually only cost on release granted the games arent anything like desktopconsole games but why would they be if they were on a cartridge
gaming,not_removed,cuase handheld games are always cheaper then console and dont need as much ram and the they is my canadian guess as new releases are here
gaming,not_removed,ah okay i was going off of brand new releases in the us which are usually p so with i was like whattt
gaming,not_removed,the face that i make when i realize there are still dummies giving activision money for this blown out ho of a game series
gaming,not_removed,the face that i make when supply drops were introduced in the first place ftfy
gaming,not_removed,hahaha gosh
gaming,not_removed,shutup
gaming,not_removed,stop with this shit
gaming,not_removed,this actually really annoys me
gaming,not_removed,pretty ironic that you type then instead of than
gaming,not_removed,well theyre not wrong with that
gaming,not_removed,its because this is the version that ray kills tom
gaming,not_removed,derpyfucker is ops steam log in username
gaming,not_removed,now im just picturing some pet sematary level shit
gaming,not_removed,that nothing nekopara is under first person shooter category
gaming,not_removed,idk looks more like a new release then psychological horror to me
gaming,not_removed,lol that means laugh out loud
gaming,not_removed,well imagine if you find out that you arent smarter than a fifth grader sounds pretty horrifying to me
gaming,not_removed,even years old know not to browse psychological horror games
gaming,not_removed,wow someone labelled something as something it is not the fucking height of comedy right there
gaming,not_removed,is that ray from challenge finders your referring to
gaming,not_removed,nice forced meme
gaming,not_removed,great video im not a fan of cod but i know when something made out of it is good also i make little shitty videos on youtube but i know that slow motion with doesnt look good if you want to use slow motion and want it to look good you need or more
gaming,not_removed,i really enjoyed your video also holy shit they did a great job with the remaster i havent seen it since the original
gaming,not_removed,thank you and yes they have done an amazing job you should pick it up if you can
gaming,not_removed,yeah i might have to check it out maybe on pc soon ive been playing lately though its cool
gaming,not_removed,i have also been playing that and have a montage up on my channel with as well lol another great fps
gaming,not_removed,cool ill check it out also
gaming,not_removed,since we are posting top video games ever lists heres mine the legend of zelda ocarina of time final fantasy vi iii chrono trigger the legend of zelda a link to the past chrono cross super metroid super mario world super mario pokemon gold silver the legend of zelda links awakening
gaming,not_removed,elite dangerous
gaming,not_removed,all great games interesting how you can have many favorites in a top in the same game series but hey if its your favorite then its your favorite and i respect it
gaming,not_removed,couldnt get into witcher for some reason i think it was that annoying minute long tutorial and the control was weird to me ill have to try some day im sure itll be real cheap on steam when i get around to it my backlog is in the hundreds over many platforms so yea idk when i will get to anything
gaming,not_removed,nah my favorite games list is way different the legend of zelda ocarina of time final fantasy vi iii the legend of heroes trails in the sky sc persona innocent sin the legend of zelda link to the past chrono trigger the legend of heroes trails in the sky super metroid super mario world shin megami tensei digital devil saga and i have played every game you listed in your top and none of them would make my top or tbh
gaming,not_removed,when i say favorite i mean top games i dont differentiate the two i dont understand what you mean so your first list is the best games you have ever played yet they arent your favorite games i am really confused here so you say these are the best games ever oh but these are my favorites just say that out loud
gaming,not_removed,its two different companies there isnt much you can do about that
gaming,not_removed,i didnt mean it like that i am happy to have horizon since midnight club is absent but when it comes to open world racing games the mc series has always been my fav its weird that i can no longer compare an open world driving game to midnight club because theres not a currentgen release
gaming,not_removed,a violin version
gaming,not_removed,grande trabalho lorde faça por favor sua versão das músicas do donkey kong country de snes uma das melhores trilhas sonoras daquele console
gaming,not_removed,cool stuff
gaming,not_removed,nwah please
gaming,not_removed,i actually had more fun with that one than oblivion or skyrim
gaming,not_removed,its really fun i enjoyed the vague quality to quests you were required to pay more attention to books and conversations to find locations and quests as opposed to just fast travel and a quest maker also the spell creations and potions crafted made for some awesome game mechanic manipulation
gaming,not_removed,only on steamsales
gaming,not_removed,you have chosen well
gaming,not_removed,not saying its not worth it but is that not kinda expensive almost as bad as the old cod games still being close to full price on steam
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,nice i lost my case but i still have my discs for the game got it from a small gamestop or something years ago i havent been able to adjust to the outdated gameplay mechanics though im excited for skywind since itll port the game into skyrim and effectively deal with the issues i couldnt might still give the original a second or third or whatever try though
gaming,not_removed,worth as much money as that if not more definitely one of my favourite games fantastic story and because of the limitations as theres no sprinting or moving fast it takes ages to get somewhere by foot and its well worth the experience also bethesda loved easter eggs so go to ancestral tombs and the sorts to see some pretty great stuff
gaming,not_removed,google morrowind overhaul and run the installer its a full package of mods that really improve the game fix bugs and are all around dope
gaming,not_removed,best memories ever playing this need a remaster asap
gaming,not_removed,if anything belongs on rpatientgamers this is probably it
gaming,not_removed,rip life morrowind is crack cocaine
gaming,not_removed,so
gaming,not_removed,few things map isnt too useful no real compass no location markers so when someone says go east from balmora they usually mean take the eastern road not go directly east until youre in the freakin river when in doubt use the real map they give you saved my hide once or twice trying to find gnisis kicked my ass hitting with your sword is a so your blade skill will be proportional to how often you hit not just your damage morrowind doesnt hold your hand but thats what makes it great siltstriders nuff said if you find the difficulty too much use console commands seriously just bump up your blade skills a bit to compensate if youve played oblivion and skyrim and just cant stand not hitting with your sword as you stab this little slug twenty times ahem also give this a looksie morrowind overhaul mod it does a hell of a lot for your game in the sounds and graphics department seriously it wont look anywhere near the same so much better itsdamn pretty totally worth a look thats the little release trailer heres the dl link from moddb httpwwwmoddbcommodsmorrowindoverhaulsoundsgraphicsdownloadsmorrowindoverhaulsoundsgraphics but finallyhave fun remember its kinda old immerse yourself in it though read the lore try everything go everywhere dont let it hold your hand get a sword and kick some gods down to size be in a play meet a dwarf chat with talos oh yeah hes in there though kind of hidden at the end but you can talk to him stab dagoth ur in the dick get a flaming sword join the morag tong rise through the ranks of one of the houses redoran ftw but telvanni homes look the coolest save a naked nord and see what solstheim looked like in its early days if youve played skyrim prepare for an interesting adventure at what could be seen as the pinnacle of imperial power dammit now im going to install it fuck you op
gaming,not_removed,you just made one of the best gamingrelated decisions have fun it is going to be a journey to me this is the best one of all the elder scroll games ever
gaming,not_removed,id say oblivion is the best
gaming,not_removed,me too
gaming,not_removed,morrowind was so consolized no languages fewer skills world is tiny no mounted movement cant climb removed fast travel cant own a ship cant take out loans and go somewhere else to get out of paying
gaming,not_removed,mixing different spells was great id like to see that again
gaming,not_removed,steam doesnt come with the dope map thatll make you drown in pussy though
gaming,not_removed,morrowind still runs a decent price is actually a great deal if it was brand new
gaming,not_removed,i agree although its basically a relic at this point not that odd for people to pay a little more for physical copies if they wanted just the game they could have purchased it on steam
gaming,not_removed,ahem httpwwwmoddbcommodsmorrowindoverhaulsoundsgraphicsdownloadsmorrowindoverhaulsoundsgraphics trailer nowhere near the same as a remaster butitll fill the void pretty well
gaming,not_removed,sheogoraths story line and world was pretty great for sure i just like the massive world in morrowind and the hacks were just nuts
gaming,not_removed,downvoting an honest opinion wow reddit but i agree i get the complaints that the world is very samey but there was a lot of great stuff in that game its my favorite for sure
gaming,not_removed,fight me in the street you outlander oblivion whole world is the same looking forest towns are all pretty much the same except imperial city most annoying intro
gaming,not_removed,it is smaller but no fast travel made it feel huge to play i know when i got the hacks and could jump over mountains it was awesome
gaming,not_removed,what half of those things arent true and you cant remove something in hindsight
gaming,not_removed,when i figured out how to use the boots of blinding speed by using a magic resistance to counter the blindness a whole new world opened up i literally used levitation almost half the game without cheating
gaming,not_removed,dont know why you got downvoted looked it up for original xbox and it was on amazon
gaming,not_removed,true having a good condition physical copy is awesome
gaming,not_removed,last time i tried this my computer couldnt handle it but i have upgraded since then ill have to give it another shot thanks
gaming,not_removed,yes i never said morrowind was bad at all i havent played it but ive watched many videos and most who say i cant have an opinion on a game i havent played are probably just as quick to whine about games like cod that havent even came out yet no im not saying cod will be amazing
gaming,not_removed,and morrowind is any better you go to a city in morrowind and every building is an exact copy and paste of the previous same goes for their interiors and un important npcs
gaming,not_removed,pretty mad if i had it though i wouldnt sell ops box looks to be in really good condition aswell
gaming,not_removed,and the guide and map are kinda worth it wish i still had my old one
gaming,not_removed,if bethesda decided to make a game with as much depth as morrowind with todays standards it would never be completed ill leave it at that
gaming,not_removed,i hear you a couple multi player games that were great but probably havenot much community now were blackhawk down and mechwarrior great games as well but surely eclipsed by modern equivalents mechwarrior was something special though
gaming,not_removed,you say people can have their own favorite games but then call them ignorant if they have a different opinion than you just because you may not like and it sounds like not have played an earlier game in a series doesnt mean others cant legitimately think its better perhaps someone is influenced by nostalgia but you cant say theyre wrong for their opinion
gaming,not_removed,morrowind is the best its an amazing rpg everything got dumbed down in the later games for more casual players and so many more players could get into them so more money could be made
gaming,not_removed,i cant play console games for that reason first games and console was an
gaming,not_removed,i like fallout and way more than nv or
gaming,not_removed,wish you werent getting down voted to shit you just so well explained why i dont listen to a lot of my friends opinions on games for instance i had to play ocarina of time because its the most favourited game ever it was cute if anything but it totally sucks today oddworld strangers wrath is my favourite but its not a masterpiece anymore
gaming,not_removed,shouldnt you play the game before saying that or do the graphics really bother you that much
gaming,not_removed,you have vivic tel morra balmora ald ruhn ebonheart sayda neen to name a few all towns with their own distinct feel and look the different houses had their own architecture and cultures and capital cities
gaming,not_removed,this proves you know close to zero about morrowind
gaming,not_removed,you can play goty addition on xbox safe to say i am searching for a copy now preferably under bucks though lol
gaming,not_removed,my point exactly a system like spellmaking would have to be giant to fit in with the rest of skyrim
gaming,not_removed,titanfall could be a good successor to mechwarrior kinda has the same idea with the cockpit
gaming,not_removed,no thats not what im saying i said people who base their opinions solely on nostalgia are ignorant and i said many times it may not be the situation with him also referring to many other people as well i never once said this was the case for everyone my point is a lot of people say games are shit now because theyve got worse which isnt always the case
gaming,not_removed,seeing through rosetinted glasses isnt dumbing things down skyrim is still a great game on par with both morrowind and oblivion everyone has their preferences but simply saying the series dumbed down isnt fair it didnt dumb down it changed there is a huge difference for starters in oblivion there were huge forests but only a handful of really memorable locations meanwhile skyrim s world is littered with locations that have a story and reason labyrinthian veitheim towers dragon bridge the guard towers north of riften the ratways the dragon moundsthe snowcovered mountains by windhelm and the icywaters of winterhold and the list goes on and on in oblivion combat was really simple swing and cast spell run swing and cast spell it took ages to kill things on higher difficulty with very little challenge bosses meant almost nothing meanwhile skyrim introduced dual wielding making a difference with one vs two handed weapons adding shouts to unleash powerful abilities to counter your foes and gave us actual flying enemies to fight along with smart ai that will split a group to use bows and melee or keep their distance from you while they summon things battles are intense and interesting all in all skyrim may have had simpler game mechanics and they may have nerfed magic but they also made the world feel alive and all this without mentioning better voice acting the ability to do what you want the moment you enter the world any of the dlc or the thousands of unique quests looking at morrowind through rosetinted glasses isnt going to fix the problems it did have that games like oblivion and skyrim fixed and for the record i have played all three recently too
gaming,not_removed,i completely disagree oblivion had an amazing story its probably in my top and skyrim certainly didnt have a dumbed down story if anything there were dozens more things to do in skyrim more skills more items great dlc much bigger modding potential and community
gaming,not_removed,im not saying this isnt the case im saying its unfair that a person decides whether or not a game is good or bad based on nostalgia a lot of games that were popular years ago were only popular because there was little competition and nothing had been done before now a new game gets announced every week to be fair though fallout are completely different games to their successors
gaming,not_removed,my favorite storylines in games are probably fallout nv or bioshock probably leaving some important ones out i have soo many favorite games and they are both nearly a decade old now im just being real here not once did i say morrowind was bad i bet its an amazing game overall just as if not better than oblivion or skyrim but it has this cult following that dont accept any other opinions whatsoever
gaming,not_removed,can i not have an opinion about a game that i havent played majority of people who whine about my opinion here are probably just as quick to go and shit on games like cod that arent even out yet
gaming,not_removed,yes i forgot every building was noticeably different and the insides had a connection to who lived there and the npcs all had a story to tell they werent just walking text boxes
gaming,not_removed,why not just buy it on pc
gaming,not_removed,thats just one aspect the entire immersion of morrowind is what made it wonderful the actual lack of voice acting made it mandatory to use your imagination with characters the world felt very alien also its not perfect but it was a perfect sequel to the previous es games oblivion was okay still fun but i never really could get that into it despite playing for over hours same with skyrim sure its gorgeous mods blah blah blah but it felt slapped together when it was so easy to break the game
gaming,not_removed,generally popular franchises get watered down content to appeal to a larger audience
gaming,not_removed,a lot of that has to do with better hardware not game mechanics play oblivion and try to craft the same spells you could in morrowind then play skyrim and try to craft any spells at all thats what dumbing things down is
gaming,not_removed,morrowind had skills to skyrims oblivion had story quality is obviously up to each person but i hated being martins errand boy
gaming,not_removed,youre getting a lot of hate but i think you have a solid argument people are so quick to down vote on here than actually strike up a conversation and i think this is a good one personally my favorite game is new vegas i never played fallout and beforehand after a couple of years i decided to try fallout out i enjoyed it for the first few hours but it didnt keep me coming back i obviously appreciate it and even when watching someone else play it can really get into it but it would take a lot for me to grind through it people will obviously always say games are dumbed down nowadays or you just cant play a game that doesnt hold your hand but its not my fault i wasnt gaming too hard when these so called amazing hardcore in depth games were in their prime everyones experience is entirely subjective and nobody should he trying to tell anybody how they can and cannot experience a game fair play for voicing your opinion here man because as always the unpopular one is doomed
gaming,not_removed,no rig got a macbook no dice
gaming,not_removed,whos to say a watered down game is worse than its predecessor give me an example of a game thats been watered down besides fallout that was just a big fuck up
gaming,not_removed,removing a feature is not dumbing it down making spells was op anyways and not being able to make spells fit with lore too unless oblivionmorrowind stopped being rpgs and started being spell crafting simulator removing a feature to enhance rpg elements balance gameplay and for the lore is a change not dumbing anything down popular features get removed from big series all the time marios tanooki suit links fairy net portals rocket turrets etc did removing these features make the game any worse not really in some cases removing then was actually better as the devs got to focus on more important things
gaming,not_removed,fair enough but skyrim confined the skills without leaving anything big out same with oblivion
gaming,not_removed,thanks a lot man appreciate that lol everything i said i stand by majority of the classic games are glorified far too much in this day and age take a game like stalker for example ill probably get shit on again for bringing this up but stalker has a cult that follows it everywhere trying to shove its the best survival game ever made down your throat and anything other than that is wrong if you say anything negative about these games youll get a response like you dont have a clue what your talking about go play fallout now unlike morrowind i have played stalker and to be quite honest the story line was pretty shit i soon realised thats not the reason peopled loved it though they loved the unseen survival aspect of being thrown into an open world and being able to do what ever the fuck you want to do it had never been done before but these people in this thread are getting on as if morrowind was a perfect game which anyone with some common sense knows isnt true the combat is boring its aged really badly it was repetitive and the lack of voiced dialogue is targeted at a very specific audience these guys which again is totally fine
gaming,not_removed,halo and call of duty for starters
gaming,not_removed,skyrim confined the skills without leaving anything big out enchants that arent just constant effects a proper handtohand skill spellmaking a bunch of really neat spell effects levitate mark recall quests giving you actual directions to follow instead of go to x place and demanding that you follow the map marker so on and so forth im not trying to completely bag on skyrim here it does a lot of stuff i love the combat feels a lot more hectic and intense than past games which were fairly static affairs the perk trees are a great concept even if the vanilla trees are super boring in their execution shouts are fun as hell because theyre essentially a bucket of cool lesser powers you get to use all the time i love skyrim to pieces dont get me wrong but trying to say tes game systems havent been simplified over time is like saying water isnt wet some of it is for better mws accuracy mechanic for meleemarksman combat is probably better off gone some of it is for worse see above but it is happening and it just makes me worry for the future fallout continued the trend of stripping rpg mechanics in lieu of action ones and im just sad to see depth go because of stupid reasons like console games cant easily support a complex ui or players dont want to be bogged down with all those numbers i will say that oblivion had the best dlc hands down shivering isles was god damned phenomenal
gaming,not_removed,its all different strokes for different folks man games are evolving every day and sometimes when youre used to the awesome game mechanics we get these days going back years is difficult some people just dont realize that not everyone who plays a video game played a certain game when it was ahead of its time sure morrowind might have been great back in the day that doesnt make it great now people may take that wrong but seriously if nobody had any nostalgia towards it and it wasnt an elder scrolls game and morrowind came out tomorrow i doubt people would be dying to play it it would probably be the laughing stock of the gaming community in this day and age its such a weird form of entertainment nothing evolves like gaming game developers are always trying to find the perfect balance and sometimes they do but not everyone might see it as the perfect balance nobody is right or wrong but my god man you dont deserve to be told what a good game is and that you should appreciate it fuck mario and every good game ever made if thats how you feel someone out there might want a game called paint drying simulator and if its beautiful to them then they got their moneys worth
gaming,not_removed,enlighten me as to why you think halo and cod are watered down what a terrible example to use to prove your point theyre literally the same each year
gaming,not_removed,enchanting is broken as fuck in morrowind though maybe they just didnt want to try to balance it
gaming,not_removed,whos to say a watered down game is worse than its predecessor skyrim leaves out things like spellmaking but makes up for it in crafting and a much larger and diverse world when it comes to how the quests are laid out with the instructions its personal opinion dont get me wrong i loved tough quests like in runescape but it turned out fine most people appreciate the option to fast travel simple things in skyrim like the rest of the world still moving on whilst in dialogue and a much better dialogue overall aswell make things seem a lot more immersive i can remember playing oblivion and although like i said in another post i really like it the dialogue was constantly repeated and the exact same tone over and over npcs were just walking text boxes every npc that wasnt important just existed horse riding the level system dragons dual wielding and again much better combat yes spellmaking was left out but it wasnt much to begin with back then it was an easy system if skyrim had a version of spellmaking to fit in with the rest of the game it would be huge a much bigger feature than what was in morrowind also something that can be solved with mods skyrim is a much more refined game it fixed so much that was wrong with morrowind and oblivion and improved so many aspects as well its a much tidier and fun game to play and with all that said its certainly not simplified when compared to to morrowind its much more complex
gaming,not_removed,couldnt have said it better i dont doubt morrowind was a good game back in the day but by todays standards its not the same game thats why morrowind has under people playing it on steam and skyrim nearly fair play to those people still playing thats what they like and i feel like ive said that about times in this thread its just a shame the feelings arent mutual
gaming,not_removed,enchanting is broken as fuck in skyrim too not quite to the same degree as in morrowind but still the existence of the black star and fiery soul trap goes a long way p
gaming,not_removed,link fishing
gaming,not_removed,what the hell does this have to do with gaming
gaming,not_removed,i fucking love this game
gaming,not_removed,iightweight weight distribution and fun as hell to drive
gaming,not_removed,well there is only one answer to that yes
gaming,not_removed,because ubisoft thats why they love releasing new games everyday but not fixing their old ones
gaming,not_removed,never had a problem with them myself
gaming,not_removed,you would think that they would act on all of the complaints that theyve received
gaming,not_removed,same even the old assassins creed brotherhood
gaming,not_removed,they dont care all they care about is the rolling in
gaming,not_removed,i always thought that was just how their armor was shaped
gaming,not_removed,spacespandex
gaming,not_removed,because science
gaming,not_removed,are you talking about krogan because turians are shaped pretty normally
gaming,not_removed,a wizard does it
gaming,not_removed,pretty shitty random am thought to be honest but im guessing they way they dress is that they just put their fucking clothes on because nothing in the lore suggests that turians are retards satisfied
gaming,not_removed,thats what i thought too i always got the impression they were really skinny but broad and use the big shell for extra protection
gaming,not_removed,yep seems like it krogan too bit their form is a bit smoother i seriously dont know why im giving this so much thought so many years after i played the games
gaming,not_removed,no take a look at this here they have a lot of irregular structures yet all their clothes are form fitting httpmasseffectwikiacomwikiturian
gaming,not_removed,have you looked at how their bodies are shaped vs the costume designs there is no way their clothes makes sense unless its all spandexi stumbled across the mass effect soundtrack on youtube and the question popped in my mind
gaming,not_removed,those three dislikes are those three bokoblins﻿
gaming,not_removed,go be edgy somewhere else
gaming,not_removed,dont know what this looks like on a computer but this post is literally unreadable on mobile
gaming,not_removed,this is a terrible wall of text but i skimmed a bit you complained there is nothing to do in skyrim therefore you are an idiot
gaming,not_removed,this needs a tldr segment or better formatting im not reading all of that
gaming,not_removed,wall of text not even a single paragraph break nopeavi
gaming,not_removed,fuck me include a tldr id be surprised if you put this much effort into your school work
gaming,not_removed,wall of text
gaming,not_removed,you say that gaming sucks now but you only compared three games and you loved one of them moreover you complained about being full of indie games but you dont mention having played any and there are some excellent ones out there sure there are some excellent games on older consoles ill even grant you that for a handful of reasons games tended to be more straightforward on older consoles and were more immediately fun as a result that hardly means the last or current console generation sucks though and there are plenty of great games to vouch for that journey bioshock bioshock infinite the witcher overwatch the mass effect series bastion transistor portal and portal dishonored hotline miami shovel knight shadow warrior undertale and many more games i havent mentioned were excellent and well worth the moneyeffort so bloodborne wasnt your thing and super mario world was pretty bad it wasnt well reviewed and ive played it and can vouch that its not very good thats one bad game and one game thats not your thing out of three games youve played with the third being one you loved thats a pretty even spread and hardly surprising i think that if you just play more games and specifically look to learn about games you might like more your opinion will start to change
gaming,not_removed,well when you start your post with im a teenager so maybe i grew out of gaming it kind of feels like a shitpost to those of us who have been gaming for the past years since we were or you then go on to complain about nothing to do in some of of the games with the widest variety of available content in the entire games industry
gaming,not_removed,i read this and all i take from it is gaming sucks because i dont like these games i got my first nes over years ago own a and xbox one now have no sense of nostalgia for gaming old systems bore me still get excited about new games coming out and am always amazed at the great stories they tell bloodborne was dull that setting and history were fucking amazing nothing to do in skyrim i always have quests because theres too many things that distract me maybe save games for people who actually want to enjoy things
gaming,not_removed,i really think the problem is that your playing the wrong games the games that are popular are not always the best games for the wii u try donkey kong country tropical freeze this game is amazing in my opinion for the xbox one try out tomb raider and rise of the tomb raider for your you could try out crypt of the necrodancer and dont starve both are very good indie games these are just suggestions and they may not be games you like but they are worth trying out also one last thing you own all three consoles and you made a comment about pcs being too expensive if you bought your consoles at full price thats around a dollars i have a computer worth a little over and i play new titles at a resolution just slightly lower than at high to ultra settings pc gaming is not too expensive and you could easily get into it for slightly more than the price of a new console and games are way cheaper just check out the current steam summer sale
gaming,not_removed,i wish i couldnt read it i began to but this is as long as fuck and lost major interest let me sum up what i read i love nostalgia
gaming,not_removed,why cant people have different opinions than you wtf
gaming,not_removed,thats literally the opposite of what he said he said that he doesnt believe hes grown out of gaming which is relevant since hes comparing older consoles favorably to newer ones i dont agree with his post but you totally misread that first line
gaming,not_removed,so hes a internet gaming hipster and that wall is just this sucks that sucks look at this not cool or past thing its what i want to portray oh and where is my pbr tall can man i love it here in portland blah blah
gaming,not_removed,more like i have no fun with the newer consoles like i did with my gamecubedream
gaming,not_removed,thank you for the clarification
gaming,not_removed,yeah i do it too let them learn like i did
gaming,not_removed,the mammoth laying down looks so stressed i imagine hes rocking in the mammothfetal position lol
gaming,not_removed,wait a second does that argonian have raptor claws on his feet sweet mod
gaming,not_removed,shh hes sleeping
gaming,not_removed,did they not update draw distance thats one of my only gripes about this game
gaming,not_removed,i love this area when i originally played this the dragon in that area was glitched and would fly backwards while breathing fire and by the time i got some recording hardware they fixed the glitch
gaming,not_removed,also vs as seen by women
gaming,not_removed,mammoths gonna mammoth
gaming,not_removed,id like to note for the record that this is the original skyrim not the special edition
gaming,not_removed,tell me lies tell me sweet little lies ♫
gaming,not_removed,its actually really sweet the let some bugs in the game this gives the game some character
gaming,not_removed,existential whycantibeincrysis crisis
gaming,not_removed,indeed shoes have become a difficulty however
gaming,not_removed,i think you mean that hes pining for the fjords
gaming,not_removed,this is original skyrim not se but i agree definitely something they should have changed the lod at long distance is atrocious
gaming,not_removed,it just works
gaming,not_removed,it think thats a guy
gaming,not_removed,pining for the fjords
gaming,not_removed,i erect the spine of triggered did you just assume my gender softskin
gaming,not_removed,how you dear to call me softskin you youngster
gaming,not_removed,exclusives are pretty good but so are xboxs if xbox didnt have halo gagged and held for ransom i wouldnt have been so conflicted lots more good games on there are more well received exclusives on the such as several franchises like uncharted and the now franchise the last of us if you have not spoiled this game for yourself dont it is amazing and others the only reason i personally would ever get a xbox one is for two games any halo game killer instinct
gaming,not_removed,playstation is definitely worth getting compared to the trash that is xbox
gaming,not_removed,no pro yes
gaming,not_removed,i would wait for the xbox scorpio im personally a xbox player only ive tried playstation but its never connected to me the only exclusive ive been interested in was the last of uswhich you could watch on youtube this last year for xbox hasnt been pretty for exclusives but the future does look bright the scorpio is supposed to be something amazing that will blow anything out of the water and from what ive been reading xbox has some new exclusives on the way
gaming,not_removed,deffo it has amazing games uncharted series last of us bloodborne
gaming,not_removed,this exactly it all comes down to your preferences with the titles i was gonna buy an xbox for halo but then i got a instead because im personally a jrpg guy than a halo guy more jrpgs on also kingdom hearts i just get my dose of halo from destiny
gaming,not_removed,honestly destiny is still trash
gaming,not_removed,sorry for xbox link psa magazine capacity carries over between revives
gaming,not_removed,because it doesnt sound like it would be fun
gaming,not_removed,is there a big market for playing with tanks in realistic fashion wherein someone drives and someone fires someone loads etc probably not theres reasons why the popular tank games are war thunder and world of tanks etc
gaming,not_removed,this can you imagine trying to coordinate with or so other people and try to drive a tank in wot style game man crew would be even worse switching around so much to make it function well as for a open world battle arena the concept made people sick with the psvr tank game it would have to be implemented differently
gaming,not_removed,im not saying people in a tank im saying one person which controls both the gunner and driver switching between the two at their leisure similar to war thunder with its mechanic if drivergunner hot switching
gaming,not_removed,tell me why i should be feeling this way
gaming,not_removed,agreed
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i mean if youre willing to lose the mods why not just uninstall the game and reinstall just make sure to move your save files to another location before you uninstall then reinstall move save files back to save folder and your back in business kill some muties for me
gaming,not_removed,i had it uninstalled for a long time just reinstalled and removed the mods after
gaming,not_removed,theres the problem some mods replace a few of the files and it seems these took some essentials with them haha
gaming,not_removed,so a reinstall is required
gaming,not_removed,yeah sucks to be you
gaming,not_removed,just verified the game cache got the missing files back
gaming,not_removed,safe
gaming,not_removed,so you got it to work like they said above you need to do a clean install with no traces of mods hope its working fam i pity the man with no fallout in his life
gaming,not_removed,i sure did missed this game survival is so much more fun
gaming,not_removed,terraria bby
gaming,not_removed,dwarf fortress
gaming,not_removed,only thing i enjoy about minecraft is the fact its terraria pretty much is better in every aspect
gaming,not_removed,starbound
gaming,not_removed,i have to say minecraft but terraria is great
gaming,not_removed,if terraria was then i would like it more im just not satisfied with in that type of game honestly i know its not a choice but i liked dragon quest builders i felt like that is what i wanted out of minecraft
gaming,not_removed,starbound
gaming,not_removed,there both cancer
gaming,not_removed,theyre
gaming,not_removed,awesome
gaming,not_removed,where can one get this i must throw money at it
gaming,not_removed,target says on the box there i might have to see if mine has it
gaming,not_removed,oh shiz completely missed that good look gonna trawl the targets near me
gaming,not_removed,dafuq is this shit
gaming,not_removed,holy fuck you deserve fp
gaming,not_removed,it is good to see someone playing counter strike the game is years older than you are thats like me playing a game made in still
gaming,not_removed,drop me your steam in pms cant play for a few hours but ill be on later if you want to play
gaming,not_removed,httpsteamcommunitycomidsleepyjin
gaming,not_removed,when did they add this looks fun
gaming,not_removed,add what infection a few content updates ago ps it is fun a lot of fun
gaming,not_removed,its crazy but fuck it theyve found their niche therell be the devoted train enthusiasts who want to get that one train they really love and this game is catering to that crowd im sure they dont expect the players to buy every piece of dlc but theyll buy the ones they want
gaming,not_removed,for a single player game i dont see a problem with this think about it you are given a skeleton to work with and you pay for the game you want or its like getting a basic hot wheels track and then combining the other ones over time to create a super awesome racing course
gaming,not_removed,it should be said all the dlc carries over to each annual release so you dont have to buy it all every year
gaming,not_removed,not a lot of people like train games but those who do like train games really like train games
gaming,not_removed,accessibility
gaming,not_removed,theyve made a game for a small niche of people that are willing to pay for it its how many mmos get by these days too with a large amount of micro transactions go look at swtor game barely has anyone playing it but many of the people that do will drop every time a new cartel pack comes out
gaming,not_removed,exactly its like buying a model train set and complaining that there is thousands of dollars worth of other trains and props that you can buy theres no need to buy everything only what you want
gaming,not_removed,it also carries over to later editions of the game
gaming,not_removed,thats pretty cool
gaming,not_removed,i just like to say train games train games
gaming,not_removed,thats a smart move on their part thats a great way to endear themselves to their target audience
gaming,not_removed,and how they mysteriously empty your wallets
gaming,not_removed,season passes should work that way too if i buy the season pass for fallout for instance i think i should get all the dlc for fallout too
gaming,not_removed,call up bethesda and offer to buy one for they might be able to work something out for you just have to ask
gaming,not_removed,pt portal
gaming,not_removed,put
gaming,not_removed,oh my idea would have been better silent hills pt demo with portal guns
gaming,not_removed,i highly doubt that they would go with only gigs after getting ripped so hard about such low storage for the past two generations
gaming,not_removed,gigs whoa nelly this is the future
gaming,not_removed,dick station has usb ports 😮
gaming,not_removed,this isnt reality this is nintendo
gaming,not_removed,this makes me very excited
gaming,not_removed,a very nice setup
gaming,not_removed,gawww parent of the year right here
gaming,not_removed,sweet tv stand i use the same one in my office game room
gaming,not_removed,worlds best parent
gaming,not_removed,what a pigsty
gaming,not_removed,sims feels like a much fuller experience
gaming,not_removed,ive played all of them for years and dumped hundreds of hours if not thousands into these games my opinion is to buy the sims its a much better experience than the others
gaming,not_removed,i bought sims last year and i barely play it im planning on buying sims because i like their mods and fan made stuff
gaming,not_removed,why tho
gaming,not_removed,im interested in getting into the sims as well what makes sims better than sims
gaming,not_removed,afaik sims is ruined by microtransactions
gaming,not_removed,theres so much more content and it just works so much better as a base compared to theyre really day and night and while has a much better building experience has everything that always feels lkle its missing in other games eg toddlers
gaming,not_removed,o brought sims with university life expansion thank you
gaming,not_removed,for future purchases i would look at reviews on youtube by lgr lazy game reviews before you do ive never regretted a sims purchase since watching that guys channel happy simming
gaming,not_removed,you might want to try the steam link its a little box like a chrome cast but it can stream any steam game from your main pc
gaming,not_removed,i dont own one myself but im pretty sure a httpallaboutchromecastcomchromecasthowtoguidehowtousechromecasttosharedesktopscreenandaudiototv can do what youre describing
gaming,not_removed,expect some major input lag the best way to do this is with a steam link but its not going to work with all nonsteam games properly
gaming,not_removed,wires are much more reliable honestly actual solution theres probably something out there but i dont know
gaming,not_removed,oh oh i have an answer for you if you run a tv box like the amazon fire tv and own a nvidia gpu you can download an app called moonlight and stream the game from your desk top to your tv that being said an ethernet connection is going to work the best i mentioned the fire tv box and while it does work the input lag through that box is borderline unacceptable the box itseld cant decode video fast enough to feelright but if you spend extra money and buy the nvidia shield you can stream to that box natively without installing another app using the shield tv box i get no more than of input lag vs when i was using the fire tv box hope my expierience helps you edit i see you said wirelessly i just tested that out on the shield and it was still very good
gaming,not_removed,problem is i dont use steam for the most part
gaming,not_removed,what games are you able to stream with the shield do you need the shield hooked up to your tv also if you want to use a controller how does that work
gaming,not_removed,nvidia shield tv assuming youre not an amd user
gaming,not_removed,if you buy a new shield it comes with a controller that you can use its compatible with androidbluetooth so you can use it on mobile games as well you can also have an xbox controller connected wirelessly to your pc and use that if youre in range though you might need to tweak a few files i also believe you can plug a wired xbox controller into the shield and use it that way but im not sure about that i did work on another box so id assume it would work on this one yes the shield hooks up to your tv you can also download kodi and firetvguru and watch almost any tv showmovie you can stream any game from your pc as long as you have a nvidia gpu you may have to add games to a stream list inside the nvidia software if you want to play something off origin etc you can also download and play emulators off of it as well it also includes its own game store with a variety of games some carry over to your steam account some dont so you have to watch that
gaming,not_removed,im sold now just have to sell my body for it any buyers
gaming,not_removed,lol i dont think youll be dissapointed your milage will always vary though depending on your router good luck
gaming,not_removed,ok
gaming,not_removed,well you made a long journey from milan to minsk rochelle rochelle you never stopped hoping now youre in a pinsk rochelle rochelle
gaming,not_removed,roach meet tree roach get stuck in tree
gaming,not_removed,my favourite are the knee high stone walls he cant seem to deal with
gaming,not_removed,sacrifice battlezone dungeon keeper with a stretch and thats just from my experience you can google rts fps hybrids for more parkan for example
gaming,not_removed,savage xr had base building and resource gathering while offering an fps battle system edit also im pretty sure there was one player who would offer commands to the rest of your team that people could follow
gaming,not_removed,yeah i wish theyd put some kind of label on each game to suggest the appropriate ages for playing it and maybe even have clerks id people for ones meant for a mature audience wish such a thing existed
gaming,not_removed,remember that time when she blamed columbine on gaming pepperidge farm remembers
gaming,not_removed,this coming from someone who doesnt know how to secure email
gaming,not_removed,this is from what
gaming,not_removed,then why am i not in the nfl
gaming,not_removed,well i say not blowing your man on a regular basis will cause another woman to do it balls too
gaming,not_removed,to be fair she may not actually feel that way as she likely just repeated it when she noticed it polled well like most of her positions
gaming,not_removed,holy shit she is an idiot
gaming,not_removed,hillary is a threat to free speech
gaming,not_removed,while on the other hand trump wants the govt to have power to shut down parts of the internet meanwhile around the same time httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvvjmegmezyoi sigh yay for special interests trying to use govt power to restrict what they dont like go libertarians i guess ps california did end up passing a videogame restriction law of some description in supreme court found the law unconstitutional so no risk of anything actually happening on that front
gaming,not_removed,gotta love reposting old shit from over a decade ago get over yourself op and stop farming internet points
gaming,not_removed,wtf i hate hillary now everyone knows video games dont cause violence they cause virginity and retarded social skills
gaming,not_removed,look ha hillary said video games are bad ha she sucks right kill her right dae hillary is the worst person in the world xd
gaming,not_removed,i do agree games need to be more regulated but they dont cause violence
gaming,not_removed,shes right as a feminist i have had enough of the sexism caused by this soulless industry gamers exist because we allow it and they will end because we demand it
gaming,not_removed,what is wotmud
gaming,not_removed,classic hillary someone said it her people said it polls well she said it too she probably doesnt even remember saying it because she doesnt believe it or believe anything really shes just an emotionless machine that says whatever will get her votesmoney she might even be a sociopath yes i may have taken that a little too faror did i
gaming,not_removed,people can be held accountable and judged for things they said years after theyve been said just ask my ex
gaming,not_removed,no just an opportunist
gaming,not_removed,she doesnt eat dicks though remember her husband had to go elsewhere to get his dick eaten
gaming,not_removed,reason magazine ran a story including that fact just a couple of months ago i would assume they ran it because it is still relevant
gaming,not_removed,wtf i hate hillary now they cause virginity
gaming,not_removed,then why should they be more regulated
gaming,not_removed,well start building the gulags comrade
gaming,not_removed,were a free online text based mmo thats been operating since its based on the wheel of time book series by robert jordan and we work with his permission i actually posted more info at rwotmudv if it sounds interesting to you or perhaps anyone you know
gaming,not_removed,i think youre pretty spot on
gaming,not_removed,id say you didnt go too far enough
gaming,not_removed,the title suggests its something new though
gaming,not_removed,its not im not a supporter but she hasnt talked about this in years it was a major talking point a decade ago now its just more bullshit to harass her
gaming,not_removed,try getting laid after telling a girl you love wow
gaming,not_removed,give kids bad dreams so they keep their parents awake so they dont get enough sleep so they dont perform optimal on their job wrecking havoc on the global economy but their regulation should be in form of a suggested age which the parents should they wish to dance with devil in the pale moonlight and not listen to can have the means and opportunity to ignore
gaming,not_removed,because games have a rating system for a reason i shouldnt be have to play a game online and hear year olds playing a m mature game
gaming,not_removed,she is running for president yes it is relevant
gaming,not_removed,wow that comes from personal experience i take it my chick loves games as well and our sex life is great so dont see your point
gaming,not_removed,but what is that reason i think parents are very capable of deciding which game they let their kids play dont need no ridiculous rating system for that
gaming,not_removed,yes it does and evidently it fooled multiple peoplethis information is years oldwhy post it edit years
gaming,not_removed,yes it does and evidently it fooled multiple peoplethis information is years oldwhy post it
gaming,not_removed,no it is not politicians are people and change their mind on how they feel about things just like you do she hasnt said a word about it for over a decade at this point it is fear mongering get over yourself
gaming,not_removed,really every superhot chick i now dislikes gamers i mean the average ones and the above average ones dont mind but triple a prime pussy has an innate allergy to call of duty
gaming,not_removed,because she is vying for the most powerful job in us government
gaming,not_removed,at this point it is fear mongering in reference to her political career its always been that way remember the guy who shot up the gay bar she started making comments about if she were president what she would do about terrorism the guy was simply a wack job
gaming,not_removed,we are talking about video games nor terrorism or religious extremism
gaming,not_removed,well that escalated quickly
gaming,not_removed,i need a
gaming,not_removed,i would very much like a monitor
gaming,not_removed,i finally splurged on a rog swift a couple months back it is very noticeable when games are running at fps one of the games i was playing for some reason locked it to oh god the difference was staggering i can never go back i have opened a door i can never again close
gaming,not_removed,d yep man once you try such a smooth experience and you will neveer go back to
gaming,not_removed,i see this and think black man field one why is a black guy the playable character who are they pandering too props to the use of the gas scene tho and that guy stumbling around in front of the character like wtf is going on this is madness
gaming,not_removed,gonna revisit this post in years and complain that its not even s
gaming,not_removed,ive been seeing a lot of witcher posts and makes me wanna jump in but i feel like im missing out on something by not playing and
gaming,not_removed,now they are
gaming,not_removed,if anything video games are all about looking good game play second
gaming,not_removed,remindme years
gaming,not_removed,its fine to skip the first two it stands on its own just fine
gaming,not_removed,you will have a much more rewarding experience if you play the other two the first witcher is quite dated and its mechanics make it hard to get through however witcher is a masterpiece and well worth at least playthroughs id recommend at least playing that one if you dont mind games that are a bit dated if you dont have the time or willpower however the developers made witcher very accessible to new players you could always watch a playthrough of the previous games as well
gaming,not_removed,sure youll miss some background story but the game is really good on its own and you could always google stuff if it feels referency
gaming,not_removed,ive made it about hours into the first game but the mechanics are so dated that its hard not feel like im just timing my clicks as opposed to feeling like youre pulling off interesting combos and counter attacks this is just attack when the indicator is right that said i only made it hours so the combat could change for all i know i plan on finishing at least before i go to but cant decide if i should finish or just say fuck it and watchread info
gaming,not_removed,i could but i always love completing a good story in a game its the sense that the story belongs to you because you went through it may just be a feeling only i get but i enjoy it enough to try and tough out and i cant speak to how plays as i havent even touched it but is pretty dated
gaming,not_removed,no but combat is a big part of it shadow of modor has counter attacks but in witcher you just click and if you click again too soon you drop your combo thats all there is to it in shadow of mordor you can attack jump over their back assassinate dash and much more for abilities so far all there is in witcher is change attack pose and then clickagain
gaming,not_removed,i didnt know about a mod for witcher thats really helpful in fact ive voiced this opinion about the game several times and no ones mentioned it thank you ill look into it when im off work
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,httplostodysseywikiacomwikiathousandyearsofdreamsdreamtriggerlocations clicking on the dream title takes you to a transcript of it you can watch them on youtube too this is such a good game i should play it again
gaming,not_removed,loved the memory sections they were really well done emotive showing the grimness of immortality
gaming,not_removed,so underrated remember the commercial with white rabbit god that was awesome
gaming,not_removed,that was fast thank you so much i should play again too miss them old school rpgs
gaming,not_removed,imo lost odyssey wasnt underrated a lot it was mediocre the things people always like about the game are dreams irrc those are from people outside mistwalker
gaming,not_removed,holy shit
gaming,not_removed,i watched a second video for second of killing
gaming,not_removed,nice
gaming,not_removed,some people care far too much about dying in games
gaming,not_removed,wow that was equal parts uninteresting and simultaneously retarded and weird thank you dont come again
gaming,not_removed,vault boy
gaming,not_removed,gluttony kirby quina sloth snorlax wrath dr wiley lust commander shepherd pride ganondorf envy waluigi greed sonic
gaming,not_removed,fat princess would be your gluttony and luigi is envy
gaming,not_removed,ive been getting a tattoo sleeve over the past year under this theme so far my picks and what i have down are majoras mask wrath vault boy pride wario greed snorlax sloth eve from the binding of isaac lust the last ones i need inked are gluttony which i think will be quina quen i have not came up for a good one for envy yet though luigi did cross my mind
gaming,not_removed,username checks out
gaming,not_removed,lust shep is spot on
gaming,not_removed,liquid snake for envy
gaming,not_removed,what gun is that that you dont ha e to zoom out to fire twice
gaming,not_removed,that meant you were good enough that the game allowed you to keep playing feelsgoodman
gaming,not_removed,no thanks bye
gaming,not_removed,whats wrong with the video it has received dislikes and no likes the fact that you took time out of your day to say no thanks when you could have just ignored it screams to me a problem
gaming,not_removed,requis
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i love faze jev
gaming,not_removed,spawn die is the name of this game thats why iam not playing it
gaming,not_removed,this is like years old lol but funny
gaming,not_removed,faze jev for anyone wondering literally my favorite youtuber he actually just put out a new iteration of his ragetage series
gaming,not_removed,you have only lived for seconds
gaming,not_removed,i know exactly that feeling tho
gaming,not_removed,classic raging from long ago
gaming,not_removed,why wouldnt you link to jevs channel you linked to someone who literally stole his content hes even talked about this before on how sites like reddit and fb keep linking to his stolen content
gaming,not_removed,when does it get to the funny part
gaming,not_removed,the typical cod kiddy rage
gaming,not_removed,the video is seconds
gaming,not_removed,his channel didnt have this
gaming,not_removed,if you were a real person youd understand how funny it is watching people rage when its just a game
gaming,not_removed,the requis part
gaming,not_removed,the game is pushbot ive spent a year of my time making this game and ive yet to make a cent on it but people play it and like it and it warms my cold heart so enjoy play in your browser here httpschweinstudiossepushbot app store here
gaming,not_removed,cool looks like fun
gaming,not_removed,it seemed interesting but it wasnt free cents the game seemed like something i might enjoy but i had to refund it because it lagged really bad on my phone
gaming,not_removed,haha this game is cute
gaming,not_removed,love it
gaming,not_removed,im much worse at this game than your gif led me to believe
gaming,not_removed,this is great its like robot olympic gymnastics hahaha you should share this with rshittyrobots i think theyd love it the robot is essentially shitty not the game
gaming,not_removed,you made this i love this game
gaming,not_removed,great game highly recommend however dont expect you will be able to do what you saw in that gif well not on purpose anyway
gaming,not_removed,if you want to make more revenue i would definitely recommend you monetize it through ads and iap at least at first people are reluctant to spend even on a mobile game they are unfamiliar with this is simply because for every paid game there are dozens of free games that are just as fun in my experience the only paid apps that really get a lot of downloads are the super niche and unique ones or apps produced by big studios or the rare indie app that was most likely free before it became popular people are generally greedy they want something for nothing so you have to entice them with a free trial before you can persuade them to make iaps also with the current layout youre running it should be relatively effortless to toss some sidebar ads into the empty spaces on either side of the game world but the concept and gameplay is definitely good and it could very easily be a cash cow if it takes off and you make the general design a liiiiiitle bit prettier
gaming,not_removed,android httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidseschweinstudiospushbot but its not free there
gaming,not_removed,well i just wasted entirely too much time playing this great job
gaming,not_removed,just bought it on the playstore dont go and make it free now seems like itll be a good timekiller that doesnt ruin my soul like hearthstone
gaming,not_removed,bye bye weekend
gaming,not_removed,where do you live its only free on app store not google play sorry to hear i lagged what phone do you have
gaming,not_removed,thank you
gaming,not_removed,thanks
gaming,not_removed,i did im glad to hear that
gaming,not_removed,dont ruin it
gaming,not_removed,i know all this perfectly well i just really hate ads the goal of the game was never to make money but of course im trying right now because if i can make enough i can make another game instead of working at my day time job i have much statistics now saying that if people play it for free on the web will buy it on mobile unfortunately the margins are really tight some days i break even some i dont over the course of almost a year ive absolutely not made any money im still at a net loss and im not even counting the perhaps hours ive spent making it i just wanted to make a game that i can respect myself and hope that its good enough to spread but spreading is hard and competition is fierce to this day perhaps people have played my game and maps have been played but only apps sold on app store which amounts to miniscule sums when i actively do advertisements and promotions i get people to play it but almost noone finds it and downloads it on the stores id love to go full indie but im scared shitless about it to what if making games stops being fun and amazing thank you for your comments
gaming,not_removed,thanks im glad you liked it d
gaming,not_removed,once you go free on play store there is no going back
gaming,not_removed,not a great one it was probably my phone not your game but if it helps zte running android
gaming,not_removed,im not at all being entitled or anything but why did you make it free on one store and not on the other
gaming,not_removed,because once you go free on play store you cant go back
gaming,not_removed,because once you go free on play store you cant go back
gaming,not_removed,in what way
gaming,not_removed,i guess the production plans were uncharted
gaming,not_removed,it sucks that we have to wait longer for a movie from such a great game series but at least we can hope it will be a little better now that it isnt being rushed as much
gaming,not_removed,not surprising still waiting to hear something about the sly cooper movie its suppose to be releasing in but is quickly coming to an end and we still know precisely dick about the movie besides the teaser they initially released
gaming,not_removed,wow its been in development for years let it die no one cares
gaming,not_removed,i always play through a game once before modding the hell out of it helps me pick mods based on what i want to change in the next play through
gaming,not_removed,not enough mods
gaming,not_removed,ive been really enjoying the ordinator mod for perks definitely makes me feel like im building the kind of character i want
gaming,not_removed,no you installed skyrim that was your first mistake
gaming,not_removed,i dont know any skyrim player that doesnt use mods its unheard of for pc at least
gaming,not_removed,nope youre using the nmm thats like using internet explorer as your browser
gaming,not_removed,could you recommend any more intel gb ram
gaming,not_removed,i play skyrim and i dont use mods there you go
gaming,not_removed,nmm has a clean and nice gui but yeah the c bullshit errors are annoying curse client is a way to overloaded
gaming,not_removed,why alternate start i still started at vanilla
gaming,not_removed,rlo realistic lighting overhaul its a biased opinion
gaming,not_removed,mod organizer is the way to go its really worth it to spend few minutes to learn it
gaming,not_removed,thank you i will give it a try already gametime and didnt even passed the intro
gaming,not_removed,thanks the list looks nice
gaming,not_removed,what are the advantages from mod organizer to nmm
gaming,not_removed,cbbe ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gaming,not_removed,mod organizer keeps your mods in a virtual folder meaning that your skyrim folder stays clean this way when a mod is deleted your skyrim folder always stays intact and you never have to worry about having to reinstall the game when your modding breaks it it saves you from an absolute world of trouble when trying out new things
gaming,not_removed,ok sounds cool can i just switch from nmm to in the middle of a savegame or do i have some steps todo before switching i was sure nnm also works with virtual path
gaming,not_removed,it would be wisest to reinstall skyrim and its mods make sure to delete the folder manually after uninstalling so all nmm mods are gone and if you install the same mods your savegames should still be fine
gaming,not_removed,just asking in case if a savegame gets corrupted will i get i message when trying to load or will my savegame world burn in game glitching to death
gaming,not_removed,if mods are incorrectly installed it should mention that the save uses content that is no longer present id keep your mind open to the possibility of restarting mods have always been a tricky thing but it should work out
gaming,not_removed,tips fedora at blizzard
gaming,not_removed,nice try blizzard you dont fool me
gaming,not_removed,mine was nowhere near this cool but i had a great costumer service experience with them too i bought the demon tyrael skin in heroes when it first dropped but when they changed it into the cartoony nightmare that currently exists i was pissed this was a while ago so i dont remember the exact order of events but i called them and got a manager who was supernice they couldnt refund the skin but they did let me pick a free skin of the same price she was very understanding and a true professional
gaming,not_removed,happy to say ive had the pleasure of rping with blizzards cs wish i had saved it
gaming,not_removed,well they werent helpful at all with me bought my digital edition and was not given my goodies was told to hit up sony word gg i guess
gaming,not_removed,blizzard has the best customer support of any aaa developer right now its amazing
gaming,not_removed,many high moons damnit many high moons
gaming,not_removed,i dont care can we stop wanking off to blizzard already this is the post this week about customer support dont care anymore
gaming,not_removed,back in the day i cybered with a gm in onyxias lair
gaming,not_removed,some of their gms actually respond to you in that manner and its actually quiet cheerful
gaming,not_removed,pft i wish
gaming,not_removed,complaining about participating in optional content next time scroll right passed
gaming,not_removed,i think at some point they tried to start getting all gms to do it but obviously some take to it more naturally than others some just reply on templates
gaming,not_removed,everyones fully entitled to express their opinion
gaming,not_removed,time to git gud
gaming,not_removed,not only fingers for me whole body becomes the ocean
gaming,not_removed,thats a nice box
gaming,not_removed,thats nice i just cant wait til june the for eso morrowwind expansion
gaming,not_removed,ive literally spend hundreds of hours of my life on this game its amazing
gaming,not_removed,this is my childhood game
gaming,not_removed,i remember getting hella far then your gba batteries die
gaming,not_removed,better start hitting up pawn shops they have tons of those and the connections for them
gaming,not_removed,both of those can be hooked up with just a universal dc adaptor and a bog standard malemale rf cable
gaming,not_removed,first lines for an updated alanis morissetts ironic
gaming,not_removed,they only do so much better to leave the fake downs to the assault guys who have rocket guns and antitank grenades id rather pick off the guys trying to kill our assault boys as they move in
gaming,not_removed,every little bit helps and sometimes you can snag an easy multi kill
gaming,not_removed,but whats the finished product gonna look like
gaming,not_removed,cyberpunk
gaming,not_removed,new elder scrolls would be nice
gaming,not_removed,nintendo switch games
gaming,not_removed,awesome footage of games that will not be included in the final release
gaming,not_removed,hopefully destiny
gaming,not_removed,half life
gaming,not_removed,for square enix to show anything worthwile
gaming,not_removed,days gone
gaming,not_removed,scorpio saw a guy post syphon filter reboot and i second that tlou days gone crash halo crackdown new ips nintendo switch stuff
gaming,not_removed,hoping ubisoft hires a bunch of voice actors again to cram in our ears as they show off what promising game they have to demolish
gaming,not_removed,id love a syphon filter reboot
gaming,not_removed,maybe finally get a beyond good and evil reveal or a sequel to rayman i like the side scroller but we havent had a proper rayman game for more than a decade its time to make platform games fun again
gaming,not_removed,hello kitty island adventure the puppy apocalypse i man can dream
gaming,not_removed,hopefully some footage
gaming,not_removed,red dead
gaming,not_removed,the folks over in rcrashbandicoot would kill me if i said anything different death stranding
gaming,not_removed,prerendered trailers that we can then compare with disappointment to the final game also maybe an ori sequel
gaming,not_removed,it would be awesome if nintendo would reveal pokémon diamond and pearl remakes
gaming,not_removed,meh
gaming,not_removed,ah a fellow masochist
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i mean its already been confirmed to release in late theres no point saying that
gaming,not_removed,heh as a half life fan allow me to welcome you to our world
gaming,not_removed,destiny is a great game at this moment in time with millions of great concurrent players why would there not be a destiny
gaming,not_removed,get it because its a team game with objectives snicker
gaming,not_removed,i like the dog in ocarina of time better
gaming,not_removed,i need the gifs feed me
gaming,not_removed,the little white one that follows you round town
gaming,not_removed,yup
gaming,not_removed,almost dozen people are going to be really disappointed
gaming,not_removed,all of the wii u fans are going to have their hearts broken
gaming,not_removed,thats gross
gaming,not_removed,try this the key code for the backtick key you gave matches the one in the above
gaming,not_removed,check if it helps you httpelderscrollswikiacomwikiconsolecommandsskyrimkeys
gaming,not_removed,holy shit lol we need more devs that have pride in their work
gaming,not_removed,path of exile is a fantastic game the micro transactions are pretty damn expensive but at least they started doing mystery crates which is more affordable
gaming,not_removed,how is this game compared to diablo
gaming,not_removed,true
gaming,not_removed,i played for a bit ages ago but havent gotten back into it can you still have a good timeget pretty far without in game purchases
gaming,not_removed,yes nothing is needed although premium and currency stash tabs are useful but you will gain no gameplay advantage by paying
gaming,not_removed,its also changed a whole lost the breach league is pretty crazy and then theres ascendancy which is another kind of fun
gaming,not_removed,sorry in advance for sounding like a dick you spent several hundred dollars on a frame but couldnt keep from foldingunfolding enough to get crease lines cmon why you do dis edit just realized that sometimes the ones in magazines sometimes have creases in them to begin with cuz reasons if thats the case i forgive you and thats a very nice frame
gaming,not_removed,the lines look like shit
gaming,not_removed,it was the one from the magazine so creases were already there also it was only
gaming,not_removed,dont listen to the hate i like it
gaming,not_removed,damn thats cheap ive seen more expensive ones that dont look nearly as good way cool i like the frame and its a bioshock picture that isnt everywhere unique wasnt meaning to hate i just didnt remember that magazine posters do that ill embrace the downvotes though i deserve em
gaming,not_removed,yeah i dont know if there is one around you but i got it done at hobby lobby they have an online coupon for like off the glass and the have an ongoing off custom frames deal on top of that
gaming,not_removed,my girlfriend worked at their competitors and yeah the deals can be awesome sometimes she got me a signed spawn first issue and framed it herself even with the deals it still cost over a hundred thats awesome that you got such a good deal
gaming,not_removed,sounds like you saved yourself about so time to get a real console or some money towards a decent gpu
gaming,not_removed,metallica unforgiven
gaming,not_removed,interpol pda turn on the bright lights is one of my favorite albums and this song is really fun on drums
gaming,not_removed,does this include dlc
gaming,not_removed,i mean hardline had swords
gaming,not_removed,should rate that one up its seems really helpful
gaming,not_removed,horse ahead
gaming,not_removed,hard to ignore a opportunity like this zip
gaming,not_removed,try tongue but hole
gaming,not_removed,ive had more fun in some alpha games than lots of games that were unfinished and released as a complete game its basically like a preorder with a discounted price also you get to give your input to help shape the game and try features as they are released sounds like youre focusing on ones made by shitty devs not alphas that did what the program is designed to be
gaming,not_removed,youre looking at this from the wrong direction early access allows devs to get funding to continue making the game as well as getting important feedback on features and mechanics before its too late to remove or alter them
gaming,not_removed,eh for the most part these games would never be released any other way they wouldnt have the money to be completed not sure what that means but there have been plenty of great games under this label fully functional relatively bug free and with good development even if they dont ever get everything they planned for into the game its pretty easy to sort the good from the bad though so i dont have much pity for people that cant bother to read reviews or even worse preorder
gaming,not_removed,cmon now guys game companies use early access to fund their game so they can finish it with your money i mean just look at killing floor they used that money to make csgo weapon skinsohoh wait
gaming,not_removed,the point is for most of the game to be there or for there to at least be some product ready for the consumer that way early access purchasers are supporting the development by giving some money to the devs to help them finish it it also lets the devs get some early feedback while you get a cheaper game thereve been some fantastic games come out of early access that people have been pleased to be able to support those who dont want to also dont have to think of it like kickstarter
gaming,not_removed,whats the point its so that the companies can milk a few more dollars out of the suckers who fuel these annoying moneygrab tactics
gaming,not_removed,the point is this mindset that hahahaha i got something before you now i can bask in my arrogance of it in reality early release games arent worth it unless it is free
gaming,not_removed,one word sales
gaming,not_removed,its almost like everyone is different and have their own differing opinions than others on the internet were not a hive mind who knew
gaming,not_removed,its better than a preorder because it means theres already a product available
gaming,not_removed,well my current issue is it seems very very few games on early access actually manage to complete themselves the ones i enjoyed that did succeed are starboundwhich is far better post released others completed games which i looked at but didnt buy were darkest dungeonsbut i will admit it seems good and then pixel piratesit was terrible dayz is never going to be complete and ark will likely remain a beta styled mmo what others are out there
gaming,not_removed,id argue with pc patching its never too late to remove alter or change heck the evidence is in literally every steam game from post release evolve ongoing release dota or even small indie releases and successes darkest dungeons you could argue getting early feedback allows these changes to take place earlier but small focus testing or demos should be enough also this is a sad reality but feedback is actually quite rarely taken on board thats why its such a big deal when a dev seems to listen
gaming,not_removed,i agree with your points except plenty of great games when in reality they can be counted on your fingers thats like saying theres plenty of good cakes in mcdonalds yes they have some custard tarts in the mcafe but mate theyre selling burgers and mcdonalds is the last place id go for cake i wouldnt be praising mcdonalds on their cake line and i definately wouldnt praise early access as a successful conduit for plenty of great games
gaming,not_removed,has there been cheaper early access games compared to the full price release and how much is this discount asking as i personally havent seen any and dont know of the price difference
gaming,not_removed,hence the point of reddit hence the point of all discussion to express those opinions and engage in social expressions which clearly amount to differences which isolation cannot bring who knew obviously not you copy and pasting that line doesnt work all the time kid try reading first
gaming,not_removed,id argue with pc patching its never too late to remove alter or change it can be if you make a poor design decision early on and nobody picks up on it it could ruin the game and by the time everyones figured it out the game is like a jenga tower try to take out that one brick and the whole thing collapses
gaming,not_removed,all of them as far as i know generally or so id guess
gaming,not_removed,starboard comes to mind i believe at launch it went up or so
gaming,not_removed,he absolutely looks like he just said cave johnson here
gaming,not_removed,for those who dont know people in this photo are exvalve artistanimator bill fletcher and artist laura dubuk
gaming,not_removed,that aint j k simmons
gaming,not_removed,just a headsup that coffee we gave you earlier had fluorescent calcium in it so we can track the neuronal activity in your brain theres a slight chance the calcium could harden and vitrify your frontal lobe anyway dont stress yourself thinking about it im serious visualizing the scenario while under stress actually triggers the reaction
gaming,not_removed,say goodbye caroline goodbye caroline
gaming,not_removed,heres the picture of them from the game httpstheportalwikicomwikicaroline
gaming,not_removed,the average human male is about percent water far as were concerned thats a little extravagant so if you feel a bit dehydrated in this next test thats normal were gonna hit you with some jet engines and see if we cant get you down to or percent
gaming,not_removed,something about the half life shirt makes me want to laugh
gaming,not_removed,science isnt about why its about why not
gaming,not_removed,everyone has that one gamemoviebook they wish they could forget so they could go back and experience it for the first time again portal is that for me everything about this game was just so phenomenally well done that i would love to be able to go back and experience the whole thing all over again without the preknowledge of how to solve the puzzles i havent touched the game since i first played it in the hopes that i can go back to it in five or ten more years and not remember how to solve everything
gaming,not_removed,is that you linus linustechtips
gaming,not_removed,they say science is built on the the shoulders of giants not here at aperture we do all our science from scratch no hand holding
gaming,not_removed,was in a due diligence meeting for a new fund think midtown manhattan bunch of guys lots of head nodding occasional harrumph and found myself using the phrase legitimate research when describing our investment process i guess i sold it well enough cause just head nods but no harrumph
gaming,not_removed,the good news is we have a new test for you fighting mantis men
gaming,not_removed,well i guess its about time for my annual portal runs
gaming,not_removed,ill be honest were just throwing science at the wall here see what sticks
gaming,not_removed,he looks like an older linus from linustechtips
gaming,not_removed,caroline is just daydreaming about a big dictatorship with a huge robot underground with a mad storyline oh wait
gaming,not_removed,lemons
gaming,not_removed,hey its harry im a sub on yt keep up the good work
gaming,not_removed,am i the only one that sees a little bit of linus sebastian in that guy
gaming,not_removed,is that linuss dad
gaming,not_removed,whoa whoa whoa
gaming,not_removed,looks almost like what i imagined them to be
gaming,not_removed,i thought cave johnson was voices by jk simmons
gaming,not_removed,hey thats pretty good
gaming,not_removed,hmmmm it looks a little bit like a timex watch but not entirely
gaming,not_removed,insert lemons reference that everyone was thinking of
gaming,not_removed,those of you here to help us test the giant mantis men those teats have been discontinued but you can fight a giant army of mantis men pick up a rifle and follow the yellow line youll know when the test starts
gaming,not_removed,portal deserves a movie
gaming,not_removed,was it the orange gu or blue gu that made you fast i need some
gaming,not_removed,so apparently theyre making a new ip in the portal half life universe would be amazing if you play as cave johnson in a prequel to both
gaming,not_removed,wouldnt cave johnson be wearing a aperture labs tshirt i find it hard to believe that hed be wearing anything related to his sworn nemeses black mesa
gaming,not_removed,ok anyone know where to get that shirt a fink mashup shirt is seriously what i need in my life right now
gaming,not_removed,where did he get that shirt
gaming,not_removed,just occurred to me he looks a bit like alan partridge
gaming,not_removed,old man linus
gaming,not_removed,the cake is a lie
gaming,not_removed,phew caroline can have it
gaming,not_removed,who and why wont they look in the same direction
gaming,not_removed,this is not j k simmons
gaming,not_removed,is that linustechtips
gaming,not_removed,to just make this clear to anyone else reading theyre not cosplaying or coincidentally look similar they are actually the original basis for both characters
gaming,not_removed,i think jk simmons performance as cave johnson is honestly one of the best pieces of voice acting i seen in video games the bit that really really stood out to me is in the lemons speech particularly the line do you know who i am cave johnson is angry sure and thats the surface emotion of the speech but his voice cracks a little on this line and you can hear the despair thats underneath you can hear that hes making himself angry to stop himself from crying and thats all basically communicated in a single line just by tone of voice i really respect simmons as an actor i dont think the usual crop of video game voice actors could have pulled it off and i dont think most celebrity actors like game companies sometimes blow their voice budget on would have cared enough to try
gaming,not_removed,my thought exactly i think the op means looks and not actual voice actor
gaming,not_removed,characters likeness was based on this guy jk just did the voice
gaming,not_removed,god when are we getting portal i loved portal and but loved the jokes in portal the most
gaming,not_removed,she is a treasure
gaming,not_removed,resemblance is absolutely uncanny
gaming,not_removed,damn thats pretty spot on
gaming,not_removed,i want that shirt
gaming,not_removed,thank god the number on that shirt wasnt a three or this pic would have initiated a cascading nuclear fusion reaction on reddit
gaming,not_removed,never
gaming,not_removed,i remember almost nothing about that game except for wheatley im fairly positive if i went back and played it now it would be pretty darn close to the first time playing it
gaming,not_removed,guess all those years of socks in sandals finally caught up to him
gaming,not_removed,dont worry youll know when the test starts
gaming,not_removed,thats awesome that actual artists were the models for the chrs theyre the unsung heroes that make games great so this bit of immortality for them in the game is wonderful
gaming,not_removed,they have to be related
gaming,not_removed,he was but this is the
gaming,not_removed,is it because its what the portrait was based on
gaming,not_removed,bill nye but i see the resemblance
gaming,not_removed,linus tony nye for some reason that outfit makes me think tony hawk not entirely sure why
gaming,not_removed,looks like him but man sized
gaming,not_removed,so they arent the voice actors we were bamboozled
gaming,not_removed,cave johnson is angry sure and thats the surface emotion of the speech but his voice cracks a little on this line and you can hear the despair thats underneath you can hear that hes making himself angry to stop himself from crying and thats all basically communicated in a single line just by tone of voice im glad someone else picked up on that because while everyone has been laughing about the lemons line for years ive never seen anyone else mention his voice cracking and betraying his true emotions its impressive that they managed to combine one of the saddest moments in the game with one of the funniest lines
gaming,not_removed,do you know who i am im the guy thats gonna burn your house downwith the lemons
gaming,not_removed,that reminds me a lot of the newest video when i think about it jk simmons has also a career based on differently angry characters
gaming,not_removed,just a couple days ago i was watching a podcast and they were talking about the new spiderman a huge complaint was not using simmons as j jonah jameson because he was such as stunningly perfect actor for the role
gaming,not_removed,i never once caught that voice crack but youre right its there and its really sad the mans terrified to see his life slipping away and powerless to stop it
gaming,not_removed,seconded seriously i geeked out when i heard his voice then was enthralled by his performance
gaming,not_removed,that wizard came from the moon
gaming,not_removed,e picked up on that because while everyone has been laughing about the lemons line for years ive never seen anyone else mention hi that speech has been translated with briser les rotules blow your knees in french i never understood why everyone quotes portal and lemons before
gaming,not_removed,watch whiplash jk simmons is pretty good in that
gaming,not_removed,i love his voice acting and honestly i wish that hed end up in more games
gaming,not_removed,heres the picture
gaming,not_removed,might be the character reference same as how samara from mass effect has a voice actor and a character referenceface model and its weird as fuck to hear her speak httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyobtrnkmyzu
gaming,not_removed,no op means that they were the original character reference they dont look like the characters the characters look like them
gaming,not_removed,likeness for young cave sure old cave has some jk in him
gaming,not_removed,not downvoting you but i dont think anyone could have done a better job in the role simmons owned it through and through
gaming,not_removed,good job yes better job no
gaming,not_removed,that certaintly is an unpopular opinion upvote for your honesty
gaming,not_removed,what makes you say that i havent seen enough of his roles to have even thought that
gaming,not_removed,that would be super interesting to hear
gaming,not_removed,its not an official portal but the lego dimensions portal pack is actually a slight continuation of the story along with a new glados song at the end of the game ☺️
gaming,not_removed,the writer eric quit valve recently
gaming,not_removed,she is a treasure a gem
gaming,not_removed,thanks
gaming,not_removed,because the characters likeness was based on him
gaming,not_removed,because it is literally the two valve employees that caroline and cave johnsons appearances were based on sitting in the valve lunch room it would be difficult for them to not look like themselves
gaming,not_removed,no dude thats commander shepard atourney at law
gaming,not_removed,gotta be honest i dont see bill nye definitely see linus though
gaming,not_removed,black mesa can eat my bankrupt
gaming,not_removed,and voice actors
gaming,not_removed,the whole game has quiet elements of tragedy in it theres so many references to the careless treatment of test subjects without a single hint of empathy you the main character waking up in a moldy bed and almost instantly learning that youre actually brain damaged and all of the others like you are dead the colossal abandoned facilities that make you wonder where all the people went even the outofcontrol potato test lab and the mishmash creations of robot and cube that wheatley tried to produce tell their own sad stories amidst the humour the greatness of the game wasnt limited to just exceptional gameplay and excellent acting and scripting it served it all up in an absolutely unforgettable atmosphere
gaming,not_removed,id heard that line many times out of context havent played portal and just thought it was funny l i found a youtube video that played all of cave johnsons audio bits in chronological order so i finally had context for the lemons speech and it suddenly went from a funny speech from a slightlyoff but driven businessman to a quite sad rage against the dying of the light type speech
gaming,not_removed,i just went back and listened and holy crap
gaming,not_removed,i just listened again and that is a really subtle crack in the voice
gaming,not_removed,damn after reading this i went back and listened to that lemon line on youtube honestly i still dont hear that voice crack youre referring to i get the general tone of his delivery though theres anger that belies an underlying hopelessness and despair just that the whole rant conveys that and not just that particular line it doesnt seem to stand out compared to the rest of the rant
gaming,not_removed,every single role simmons has had involves yelling in some way especially whiplash jesus i dont think i wouldve enjoyed that movie as much as a did no matter how stressful it was if jk simmons hadnt played fletcher
gaming,not_removed,raimis spiderman and really were amazing
gaming,not_removed,if you scroll to the bottom of the cave johnson page you can see the portraits of the character as they age plus a bonus pic of a nixonlike early version of the character httpstheportalwikicomwikicavejohnson instantly made me nostalgic for another playthrough
gaming,not_removed,yea could be the people they used
gaming,not_removed,that man literally cannot stop looking at her chest lol
gaming,not_removed,anyone else notice the nip slip
gaming,not_removed,he plays that type of role pretty well has a few times on his sketch show birthday boys and he actually looks like the role quite a bit dont get me wrong i love cave as is still but he is basically played the same way as jonah jameson
gaming,not_removed,cool thanks ill give it a try
gaming,not_removed,is this for real
gaming,not_removed,welp guess its definitely time to replay it
gaming,not_removed,ii am such a fool 😢
gaming,not_removed,dae think sam lake looks kind of like max payne
gaming,not_removed,wow i feel really dumb all the sudden somehow i didnt realize that thanks
gaming,not_removed,linusnyetips
gaming,not_removed,ikr
gaming,not_removed,bottom half is nat faxon with perfect teeth
gaming,not_removed,and this is his favorite store on the citadel
gaming,not_removed,sir the testing
gaming,not_removed,so she does have the same voice actress as glados
gaming,not_removed,that moment at the end when that piece of ceiling falls away and you realise what you are about to do is one of the most powerful feelings in gaming history
gaming,not_removed,you cant forget that portal takes place in the halflife universe which is full of both obvious and quiet tragedy elements halflife is a lot darker than it looks at least halflife is the combine are pretty fucked up but yeah portal is a masterpiece makes me sad that valve havent been making games lately really hope their three full vr titles end up being just as good
gaming,not_removed,instantly learning that youre actually brain damaged youre not actually braindamaged chell is just stubborn and refuses to talk its part of the humour p
gaming,not_removed,theres an oracle turret that has a few lines that allude to tragedy directly the following is from the halflife wiki prometheus was punished by the gods for giving the gift of knowledge to man he was cast into the bowels of the earth and pecked by birds the oracle turret refers to glados as prometheus who is trapped in a potato by wheatley and thrown into the abandoned sector of the aperture science innovators laboratories in fact if one stands on the platform directly outside the abandoned sectors entrance a massive steel pillar can be seen with the words tartaros painted on it tartarus is the underworld in ancient greek myth which was ruled over by hades relating back to the oracle turrets statement of greek myth
gaming,not_removed,this is really well done i played through the game when i was in grade maybe and none of this stood out to me the game was really well made it made me laugh it challenged me to think through the puzzles and all the characters were funny and likeable looking back tho that game is a masterpiece and valve really did a number for gaming history with the portal series
gaming,not_removed,i just finished that level for the first time two weeks ago didnt know where it would be in the game and reacted the same way the brainstorm of using the portals in that way on that level in combination with that moment made the whole experience worth the money i paid and then carolines goodbye
gaming,not_removed,listen to it and see how stable his voice is until he starts to up the volume the crack youre looking for is at the second mark when he says do you know who i am
gaming,not_removed,when he says do you know who i am his pitch wavers like someone on the verge of tears its subtle but definitely intentional
gaming,not_removed,i dont remember him yelling in i love you man and he was hilarious
gaming,not_removed,his constant looks at her boobs was the second thing i noticed in this video
gaming,not_removed,uhhhno
gaming,not_removed,when
gaming,not_removed,fair enough i was just curious as why
gaming,not_removed,totally plugging our own work here but if you want more portal style gameplay you might like httpsyoutubejwpkpcvyga its a free fulllength storydriven mod for portal available on all new puzzles voices music etc
gaming,not_removed,yep new tests and everything slightly different cause lego and it has like batman and other lego movie characters but glados is a pretty prominent character in the main lego dimensions storyline as well
gaming,not_removed,no
gaming,not_removed,wow i feel really dumb all the sudden i wonder why
gaming,not_removed,linyessciencetips
gaming,not_removed,you must looove testing
gaming,not_removed,my spine shivered when i read your comment its impossible for me to disagree
gaming,not_removed,and you know what its so stupid i mean there was no true cleverness or smartness or sleuthing on my part at all when i shot the moon i mean they basically told you exactly what to do before hand yet when that ceiling fell away i felt like a kindergartner that just tied their shoes for the first time im smart httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvagnsqeuptw
gaming,not_removed,i thought it was pretty obvious how effed was once you see the stalker train
gaming,not_removed,makes me sad that valve havent been making games lately printing money is a hell of a drug theyd probably lose money if they spent resources on making a single player game over using the same resources to keep people buying chests
gaming,not_removed,well you are exposed to some deadly stuff throughout the game so you probably havent led the healthiest lifestyle to put it lightly
gaming,not_removed,that that means he knew he was dying
gaming,not_removed,just stare at her left breast for the whole video
gaming,not_removed,personal preference and all that to be fair i think the writers probably had jk as he was in spiderman in mind when they wrote the character i just think odenkirk would have brought something better to the table
gaming,not_removed,sweet i think i heard of thisi just forgot about it lol thanks i will definitely grab this
gaming,not_removed,and it is excellent challenging levels and good music as well
gaming,not_removed,i know i could of done better
gaming,not_removed,nyenistechtips
gaming,not_removed,oh shit mine did too
gaming,not_removed,heh yeah in fact a couple things you cant actually aim away from a small radius around the moon so you dont have a choice except to look at it either click right or left works for the win doesnt matter which one you left underneath wheatley so hahaha yeah its freaking brilliant at making you feel like you did something super clever meanwhile not giving you any way to fuck it up brilliant
gaming,not_removed,well yeah i said both obvious and quiet tragedy elements that game did both exceptionally hell you see how bad it is long before the stalker train in episode one
gaming,not_removed,true enough but i mean theyve got to be financially solvent enough for money to not be a major issue i think the main thing is the expectation from fans thats involved if were talking about halflife specifically at this point it will never live up to expectations and even worsenobody but valve can make a proper halflife game since their design philosophies are a major part of what made the first two games so unique so giving it to some outside studio and just letting them have free reign on it would be even worse valve would have to have the original developers heavily involved in its production
gaming,not_removed,well maybe lightly is the wrong word
gaming,not_removed,thats the guy whose science knows how to deconstruct people remove their tumors and give them new insides how many times had he endured the painful limits of science just to see another day
gaming,not_removed,well they explicitly said that earlier and guess what ground up moon rocks are pure poison i am deathly ill
gaming,not_removed,i think that is just a paint splotch no way her nipples are that high
gaming,not_removed,i just meant it never seemed subtle even from the very beginning when the metro cops beat you up and essentially let you know youre living in a police state this sucks the next level of these people are evil is the first time you see a head crab come out of a missile and you know that they are ok with not just indiscriminately killing but also zombifying people at this point like mins into the game youre like wtf these guys are pure evil the stalker train is the first part that actually creeped me out though i mean aside for the stalkers themselves being creepy it bothered me knowing that despite this being a game there have been and still are governments that would gladly do something like that if they had the ability to do so i just meant that at no point in the game did it feel like the combine is evil concept was subtle in in i never really got the same feeling toward the government i mean no question i was happy to get revenge on all the enemies that were trying to shoot me but i didnt feel like they were outright evil just like i was fine with the headcrabs and vortiguants they were just trying to eat me or considered me a threat
gaming,not_removed,httpmimgurcomtmadiqp
gaming,not_removed,look again my friend
gaming,not_removed,true enough the stalkers are in fact a pretty fucked up concept to begin with combine synth engineering at its most horrific i remember the first time i encountered one i kind of couldnt process what i was looking at then when episode one came out and i witnessed the train scene i finally understood what they really were reading about them on the wiki just makes it worse the transformation process is pretty gruesome
gaming,not_removed,it was the mics shadow
gaming,not_removed,reminds me of faceoff where they punish people by drying them out at least i think that was faceoff
gaming,not_removed,twas not
gaming,not_removed,lol its more along the lines of amputating the limb extremities and replacing them with crudely bolted on metallic augmentations and removing the entire intestinal tract and putting in a gastric port on their belly for a nutrient solution as a means of feeding them theyre entirely dependent on the combine in order to sustain and essentially have no will of their own theyre basically a man turned in to a machine but in the most crude and brutal way imaginable
gaming,not_removed,httpswwwhumblebundlecomubisoftbundleencore this bundle is totally worth it at the level
gaming,not_removed,rocket league is on sale on amazon at the moment its definitely worth or if you want to get some random stuff with it you could sub to the humble monthly bundle get rocket league immediately for then get a few more games in like days then cancel it

gaming,not_removed,which game mode is this last titan
gaming,not_removed,yes playing the mixtape playlist
gaming,not_removed,yes yes and yes although the first game has aged badly you can buy them in the nathan drake collection on and it will just help to understand the characters in uncharted and it will have more of an emotional impact with it being the ending chapter they are some of the best games from last gen and each one is more remarkable than the last edit they also sell them individually on if you search for them must be recent though i hadnt seen them until a month back
gaming,not_removed,yes you do the uncharted collection is on for around new and even cheaper used all of the games are great so i recommend giving the series a playthrough
gaming,not_removed,id say yes but im a purist for storylines
gaming,not_removed,yep
gaming,not_removed,havent even read your postjust the headline yes its a fantastic story with breathtaking art writing and character development
gaming,not_removed,yes uncharted is the best uncharted there will ever be
gaming,not_removed,thank you friend i will look into the collection which games are you enjoying right now
gaming,not_removed,for all sounds like a great deal thanks
gaming,not_removed,no worries i am loving dishonoured uncharted time no joke forza horizon cod with a sprinkle of gta what about yourself happy belated new year
gaming,not_removed,well i just finished the last of us one of the best games i have played in a long time have been playing some of the campaign and multiplayer lately too was thinking about uncharted which i own but i havent played the others titanfall campaign i have been eager to play too but i also just bought planet coaster so im giving that a go lol happy belated new year to you too

gaming,not_removed,kind of like the vita in the us
gaming,not_removed,as someone who frequents japan this a very poor representation of xbox sections in gaming and electronic stores sure theyre never as large as sonynintendo but theyre usually way bigger than this
gaming,not_removed,donkihotei probably have some if youre okay with second hand
gaming,not_removed,this is an awesome collection really too good high graphics video game
gaming,not_removed,with how xenophobic they are im surprised they even have anything at all
gaming,not_removed,ive always known the xbox didnt sell well in japan but i was wondering how they felt about halo i dont play it much anymore but i know that game is huge in most other parts of the world do they just not care about it there
gaming,not_removed,i have never seen anything so disappointing until i look in the mirror sobs
gaming,not_removed,do people in japan only buy digital copies
gaming,not_removed,most people in japan game in cafes anyway
gaming,not_removed,or anywhere that isnt japan
gaming,not_removed,sad but true
gaming,not_removed,the vitas presence is inverted with the xbones in japan the wii us presence is nonexistant everywhere
gaming,not_removed,as someone who lives in japan this is a very good representation lol no one gives a fuck about xbox here i tried to sell my witcher on xbox a month after release and they said they didnt want it cause no one would buy it they were paying en for the version lol
gaming,not_removed,in tokyoosaka there are largish xbox sections thats true go outside of the big cities though and this is very much representative as someone who lives in japan i live in a city of and one store stocks xbox out of many big electronics stores
gaming,not_removed,people in japan buy sony japanese microsoft american
gaming,not_removed,not sure but if i remember correctly the xbox does terribly in japan
gaming,not_removed,no physical copies of music movies and games are still really popular xbox one just totally bombed and barely anyone has one i think ms have given up most stores dont even have an xbox section so i was pleasantly surprised to see one for about seconds
gaming,not_removed,xbox doesnt do too well in japan stuff like shooters are not quite as big in japan and thats kinda xboxs bread and butter stuff like rpgs and platformers sell better in japan which the sony and nintendo do much more of
gaming,not_removed,not really true its true that most pc gamers play in cafes but theres not a whole lot of pc gamers in japan its growing though pc bangs are more of a thing in south korea than japan japan is predominantly a console market mostly handheld
gaming,not_removed,wii u sold comparable to the in japan actually in fact they had better sales numbers till around last octoberish iirc
gaming,not_removed,it sells around numbers every month or if it was week if i remember correctly its not doing anything at all in japan
gaming,not_removed,bombed in japan ms cant force a store to stock somthing entirely up to the store
gaming,not_removed,why are they still in japan lol
gaming,not_removed,yea outside of the big cities only a handful of people own them im not surprised they dont
gaming,not_removed,they still want japanese games and it would make sense to at least have a japanese presence then even if it might not be much of a presence
gaming,not_removed,

gaming,not_removed,thank you
gaming,not_removed,daily
gaming,not_removed,the whole time i was wondering how it looked from the other guys perspective reddit always comes through
gaming,not_removed,thats only in replays
gaming,not_removed,as soon as i seen him its as soon as i saw him seen is not a word edit apparently im dumb and forgot that seen is actually a word if used correctly doesnt make you any less wrong
gaming,not_removed,do you think it is possible they created a video clip of a future game before it was released
gaming,not_removed,what do you think
gaming,not_removed,thats just your dementia playing tricks on you gramps
gaming,not_removed,im fucking sorry

gaming,not_removed,second intro really
gaming,not_removed,next time no need to wait for reddit just go check karmadecaycom for one of the other reposts of this its the top comment in each post
gaming,not_removed,even if op doesnt
gaming,not_removed,not back in the days of betathat was one of the more common cheats
gaming,not_removed,youre right about the grammar wrong on seens status as a word
gaming,not_removed,seen is a word its the past participle of see youd use it like he had been seen at the establishment before its not used correctly by op but it is a word
gaming,not_removed,here is a gift to you it is the amount of fucks i have to give
gaming,not_removed,they did with this one
gaming,not_removed,i think literally is overused all the time in hilarious ways and that is all his post was missing
gaming,not_removed,are you fucking sorry
gaming,not_removed,the way they did it was unnecessary shes druggy so they couldve just made her discover his secret and od on something from her exs stash wouldve been better writing and more grim in a sense of what the show was trying to deliver
gaming,not_removed,sunrise motherfucker
gaming,not_removed,not true i will
gaming,not_removed,surprise muthafuckka
gaming,not_removed,right my bad seeing seen used wrongly the way op did is one of my biggest pet peeves so i went a bit overboard
gaming,not_removed,suit yourself
gaming,not_removed,i dont know what i expected
gaming,not_removed,you broke space and time now im stuck in a time loop thanks asshole
gaming,not_removed,i was confused gratz for making me feel stupid
gaming,not_removed,took me like clicks to get it nicely done
gaming,not_removed,one of the definitions of literally is literally not literally
gaming,not_removed,yeah and i even read an analysis on reddit once that pointed out how it was physically impossible that trinity killed her and also did his thing with dexter the timing just doesnt work
gaming,not_removed,i agree
gaming,not_removed,advertise motherfucker
gaming,not_removed,baptist motherfucker edit fucking spelled baptise wrong
gaming,not_removed,some tried motherfucker
gaming,not_removed,im here to bargain
gaming,not_removed,hi my name is steve have i answered your call in a timely and efficient manner
gaming,not_removed,therefore one of the definitions of literally is not literally not literally
gaming,not_removed,i thought that at first too timing seemed weird but i could see where they were going both dexter and their son had a traumatic experience
gaming,not_removed,first prize motherfucker
gaming,not_removed,thread dies motherfucker

gaming,not_removed,hahaha i swear im a different person i actually just really wanna see what people want
gaming,not_removed,but who got potg
gaming,not_removed,bastion
gaming,not_removed,so not hanzo for once damn
gaming,not_removed,your dick is small and you should feel small
gaming,not_removed,arent minors allowed on reddit and possibly come to this sub
gaming,not_removed,huh when trolling goes too far
gaming,not_removed,my guess is that this person wanted the ridiculeshame that this sub will certainly provide dont feed the trolls
gaming,not_removed,first of all you need a nsfw tag secondly how did you think this was a good place to post this
gaming,not_removed,i hope you make something really good of this dude i think it has a lot of potential guess he was right
gaming,not_removed,wow that is really interesting reading though the early feedback little did they know
gaming,not_removed,can i get something for being there from the beginning tooyou know when it was actually free
gaming,not_removed,derivative of infiniminer lol
gaming,not_removed,pretty cool to see where it all started i feel like im in a time machine
gaming,not_removed,i remember playing through that super early alpha he put up it was a wild concept for me but i had no idea back then how big it would be it was cool to be a part of it from the very beginning
gaming,not_removed,it is though
gaming,not_removed,well not picking you for the zombie apocalypse
gaming,not_removed,if only you were a little pink dog that lived with old people in the middle of nowhere
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,cant wait for the first case of video game related ptsd
gaming,not_removed,well vr has shown me that i either need to get a bigger place or i have far too much shit
gaming,not_removed,believe it or not this is actually vr porn
gaming,not_removed,scary feet scary feet scary feet the kids awake edit my most popular comment thanks guys
gaming,not_removed,his hand movement and his posture combined made me realize i want a bob ross the painting boss vr game
gaming,not_removed,whats with the titles today ive seen a few posts use the got me like thing
gaming,not_removed,has no one posted the source video yet
gaming,not_removed,i bet it was a flying cockroach
gaming,not_removed,when youre so scared in a vr game that you offer to suck the monsters dick if he leave you alone
gaming,not_removed,this is about to become a blowjob simulator
gaming,not_removed,that cord looks soo dangerous i wonder if it would be better to ad a small hook to the ceiling to keep it above your head level
gaming,not_removed,i remember playing ocarina of time for the first time
gaming,not_removed,which game
gaming,not_removed,do you see your real surroundings or would you smash into the piano for example because you just see an empty room and start to run
gaming,not_removed,that leg movement is making scooby doo look realistic haha
gaming,not_removed,that foot shuffle is amazing xd
gaming,not_removed,stop hammer time
gaming,not_removed,i have those shorts
gaming,not_removed,scaredy feet scaredy feet scaredy feet twins in a bunk bed
gaming,not_removed,congratulations for playing in a relatively open space pretty sure this is a worlds first
gaming,not_removed,the scardy pants dance
gaming,not_removed,this looks pretty amazing
gaming,not_removed,that cord would give me more anxiety
gaming,not_removed,dude gangnam styled it
gaming,not_removed,thats some scoobydoolike panicked movement
gaming,not_removed,because i live in britain and ive got like a armspan i worry i wont be able to play most vr games because ill smash my hands into the walls and ceilings we dont have no damn room in our rooms
gaming,not_removed,i had to make this
gaming,not_removed,i feel you need a whole vr room how much immersion can you get if youre always wearing about bumping into stuff
gaming,not_removed,i see youve found my upstairs neighbor
gaming,not_removed,i feel a warmth moving towards me i fell something touch me its shrek i am so happy
gaming,not_removed,i can see the cord getting violently yanked out by someone like this
gaming,not_removed,watching that dance i can imagine exactly the squealing sound that goes with it
gaming,not_removed,i can imagine some random xylophone sounds when hes dancing around
gaming,not_removed,i saw a few others get downvoted for sharing a similar opinion as me which is a shame this reminds me of when that video of a girl playing vr horror was shaking her wrist violently while playing to emulate fear is it so wrong for some of us to be skeptical could the person who is aware of being filmed be hamming it up a little nobody is denying that vr horror amps the horror emersion exponentially but myself and many others many of us who have used vr and think its pretty cool btw are well aware that of people using vr are still aware that its just a game lets not just downvote anything and everything that goes against the hype train of vr personally i see this video and i think the actor in it looks utterly ridiculous if this was on a stage at we would be ridiculing it to death
gaming,not_removed,oppa gangnam style
gaming,not_removed,this looks so archaic i cant wait to see what people say when we reflect back on current vr in years
gaming,not_removed,there is a perfectly good shelf of books that you just did not want to run into for us selfish redditors man
gaming,not_removed,i would kill for an acoustic piano like his in the background
gaming,not_removed,why am i staring at a static image oh gif instead of video
gaming,not_removed,both my dad and i shuffle our feet like that when we get the shit scared out of us watching a scary movie lol
gaming,not_removed,how long is the cable id be afraid that id knock over my computer jumping around which is something id definitely be doing
gaming,not_removed,that wire is such a trip hazard
gaming,not_removed,then he takes off the headset and sees the wood panelling now thats scary
gaming,not_removed,running man challenge right here only thing thats missing is that music
gaming,not_removed,not enough cord
gaming,not_removed,are vr games really this immersive or are people just overreacting
gaming,not_removed,anyone know any good scary vr games besides a chair in the room
gaming,not_removed,this makes me want to go drop a grand and a half to experience vr now
gaming,not_removed,scooby dooby doooooo
gaming,not_removed,naw that wasnt scary just a sudden ddr encounter
gaming,not_removed,and this is why i will never use vr i get scared too easily well that i get seasick on wet grass
gaming,not_removed,looks like you gave up on life when you got down on your knees was that a mercy plea hahaha
gaming,not_removed,people keep complaining about the cord being so big and in the way but ive never seen a musician trip over their guitar jacks or mic cables and they do tons of stunts around them
gaming,not_removed,the only way im playing vr is with my steel toed boots
gaming,not_removed,walking on hot coals
gaming,not_removed,i wonder how the cliff scene in the black mesa would feel like with vr
gaming,not_removed,this man is practicing to become a raptor
gaming,not_removed,ive never been so scared that i started doing the gangnam style dance
gaming,not_removed,lmao rofl rofl smiley face with tears
gaming,not_removed,god i hope he doesnt go out in that color combination
gaming,not_removed,priceless
gaming,not_removed,for these horror vr things the main thing to do if you can take it is to close your eyes considering nothing can actually touch you yet just closing your eyes negates themother than the sound i know the natural inclination is to not close your eyes its either that or rip off the headset and attack your friends laughing at you
gaming,not_removed,you are the real life fred flintstone
gaming,not_removed,so what game exactly is he playing
gaming,not_removed,i read it as soccer and was wondering what you were doing getting on your knees
gaming,not_removed,upsychoneironaut
gaming,not_removed,you know what would be great in vr alien isolation
gaming,not_removed,reminds me of my cat
gaming,not_removed,before i die i want to see a skit of jim carry possibly as ace ventura using vr probs a htc vive
gaming,not_removed,got me like insert overreaction
gaming,not_removed,remember when we thought playing wii games made us look ridiculous well vr is times that
gaming,not_removed,he was able to afford the vive on the money he saved not updating the basement since
gaming,not_removed,he dead
gaming,not_removed,im guessing this is the brookhaven experiment nothing is scary about this game until you turn around and there are two big running ones right behind you
gaming,not_removed,i was expecting the guy to run into and knock over the bookcase since it was in the posts thumbnail
gaming,not_removed,is this op or someone reposting bc i feel like i know the op
gaming,not_removed,why scared though get in that shit and fuck that zombie til he loves you
gaming,not_removed,this person looks and acts exactly like one of my friends from college and im wondering if its him or not
gaming,not_removed,how long do you guys reckon before we have the first vr casualty when someone falls off a bridge or a cliff we need vr playpens
gaming,not_removed,im more scared of that wire i look forward to vr becoming wireless
gaming,not_removed,if only oculus didnt cost usd here in brazil id be jumping like a little girl just like him
gaming,not_removed,i really wish i could afford one of these
gaming,not_removed,god i sure cant wait to get rid of that horrid wire i wonder if phones will ever become powerful enough to replace a console
gaming,not_removed,scaryfeetscaryfeetscaryfeet kids awake
gaming,not_removed,how is it these guys can afford a fucking vr headset with accessories but not a camera capable of more tham
gaming,not_removed,dont let your girlfriend watch you play scary games
gaming,not_removed,could it be possible for someone to get ptsd from vr gaming
gaming,not_removed,i dont get how a monitor strapped to your face elicits this type of reaction
gaming,not_removed,haha that would so be me
gaming,not_removed,how did nobody died yet turning around with that fucking cable
gaming,not_removed,this looks like a lot of fun but i feel like i would probably break most of my toes on nearby furniture
gaming,not_removed,how most redditors would react
gaming,not_removed,wii
gaming,not_removed,itll be funny if your pants dropped
gaming,not_removed,i would really slike to are what he is seeing
gaming,not_removed,vtmb would make an awesome vr horror game
gaming,not_removed,it´s just a matter of time until we see the first reports of people jumping out of their windows
gaming,not_removed,am i the only one that thought he was gonna get wrapped in the cable and tear his computer down
gaming,not_removed,rrrraaaaggyyyyy
gaming,not_removed,ha ha ha its funny
gaming,not_removed,prison vr
gaming,not_removed,wow vr is getting better and better i can t wait to be in year
gaming,not_removed,im wearing those shorts right now
gaming,not_removed,this is like in scooby doo when they try to run away from something scary but go nowhere
gaming,not_removed,i was expecting the bookcase to be involved
gaming,not_removed,those are some serious tap dancing skills
gaming,not_removed,see as much as i would like to get a vr headset the full room concept just seems incredibly dangerous not everyone has a spare room lying around to empty up and reinforce with wall cushions i would be tricked into running around and getting some kind of whiplash from tripping on the headcord
gaming,not_removed,jambalaya
gaming,not_removed,what game is it
gaming,not_removed,that settles it if this guy gets a fucking vr system so do i
gaming,not_removed,owww what did i do
gaming,not_removed,oculus rift is still garbage and cannot do this not possible on oculus rift
gaming,not_removed,i am a massive little bitch about horror games i have never played one but i must admit there is some masochist desire to try a vr one lets see how many seconds i last p
gaming,not_removed,is there a way for a regular normal person like myself to buy this
gaming,not_removed,he clearly ran out of ammo and then said fuck it take me with you lmao
gaming,not_removed,what a great time to be alive
gaming,not_removed,tfw you are so scared you immediately try to take a penalty for italy
gaming,not_removed,italian penalty taker
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,except they arent scary at all
gaming,not_removed,this is just zaza playing vr fifa
gaming,not_removed,that penalty tho
gaming,not_removed,thats where zaza got his penalty kick from
gaming,not_removed,are the cables a necessitiy
gaming,not_removed,stop linking gif pls just do gifv gif is so wasteful with bandwidth
gaming,not_removed,i can relate
gaming,not_removed,news death on vr continues to be the top cause of death in gamers
gaming,not_removed,basically my neighbour who live upstairs
gaming,not_removed,does anyone know the name of those controllers
gaming,not_removed,when are they going to make these wireless
gaming,not_removed,gifv pls
gaming,not_removed,literally in moms basement lol
gaming,not_removed,ahh the theatrics of knowing you are being filmed
gaming,not_removed,the reality of this picture and the advent of vr is that people are seriously going to be reacting like this to things happening to them in real life once the tragedy comes and we get ready for the draft were going to be seeing alot of these types weve grown the next generation to be soft mortal and looking at this i just see an american soldier good luck
gaming,not_removed,i cant wait until the touch comes out for the rift
gaming,not_removed,youre a manly man arent you
gaming,not_removed,if you want to make it even scarier play naked
gaming,not_removed,so long as that cord is there these are not going to be practical if it were hung from a hook and tensioned wheel that pulls up slack but doesnt have too much resistant as to exert a net force on the user then itd be a better system a loose cord that he could trip over and use to tug the vr set off his face is just bad
gaming,not_removed,are you kidding id pick him first you always need someone slower than you for the zombies to catch
gaming,not_removed,my first thought was that this is not a guy you want in dangerous situations well we were doing well until andy got spooked and started running in place lost three men because of that
gaming,not_removed,id pick this grandpa any day
gaming,not_removed,i got the opposite comment when i played brookhaven i was tactical i was conserving ammo and battery took zero damage the entire playthrough of the demo roommate goes well im definitely bringing you along in the zombie apocalypse ive never felt more touched then i played again and the medium sized dudes overwhelmed me this game can be pretty spook when it wants to be
gaming,not_removed,return the slab
gaming,not_removed,stupid dog you make me look bad
gaming,not_removed,but who will save courage
gaming,not_removed,returrrrrn the slab
gaming,not_removed,uh uh uh uhhhbllblbllbl blibbalibbulhlhlh op
gaming,not_removed,ooga booga ooga
gaming,not_removed,youre not perfect
gaming,not_removed,he looks like he is charging up his scoobydoo run
gaming,not_removed,their flight or flight response thats not much of a choice to be conflicted about
gaming,not_removed,the limbic system is one hell of a drug
gaming,not_removed,i like how he accepts his demise at the end i can almost see the demon sucking out his brain
gaming,not_removed,and blowjob won
gaming,not_removed,do flongs make a flight or flights make a flong im confused
gaming,not_removed,how the hell can someone be so gyroscopic
gaming,not_removed,wtf am i watching
gaming,not_removed,youd be surprised how much leg strength that actually takes
gaming,not_removed,thats actually really impressive
gaming,not_removed,nice
gaming,not_removed,love the hype man
gaming,not_removed,that dancing style would fit nicely with gamelan
gaming,not_removed,he sings the legend of toezan
gaming,not_removed,if anyone ever made bloodborne vr with it in first person that would certainly cause ptsd
gaming,not_removed,specops the line for vr trauma for days
gaming,not_removed,shit pt gave me that i can never leave the bathroom door partly open and if i ever see that i either swan kick that bitch open or go back to my room and try not to shit my pants waiting for some other sucker to peek into the opening
gaming,not_removed,if that actually happens that would be the biggest bitch on earth
gaming,not_removed,i was wondering how long that cord is
gaming,not_removed,it has taught me not to live in an apartment below a vr gamer
gaming,not_removed,if vr gets big i will have nothing in my living room that shit will all go to the garage fuck guests
gaming,not_removed,went to a vive party at my buddys house last week i am already cleaning out my guest room for this and building a rig for it
gaming,not_removed,right i saw this and was immediately envious of the clean carpeted floor space for maximum roomscale
gaming,not_removed,i have a whopping square meters that are mine and i make it work i have to place my table on my couch and move my tv a bit but it just exceeds the minimum area size
gaming,not_removed,that german porn is some crazy stuff
gaming,not_removed,where youre the girl
gaming,not_removed,what the fuck is this i leave you alone with my best friends daughter for minutes and you do this honey its not what it looks like fuck fuck fuck dont go gets on knees oh im not going let me show you both how its really done
gaming,not_removed,i can only hope he was saying ggggggggggggghost the whole time
gaming,not_removed,o man its been a while since i saw this movie
gaming,not_removed,screams
gaming,not_removed,edit wow thanks for the upvotes
gaming,not_removed,scary monsters dont have plaque
gaming,not_removed,well theres tiltbrush as well as multiple graffiti spray paint programs like vivespray and kingspray
gaming,not_removed,its already spreading
gaming,not_removed,the possibilities are endless for sure but they need much better screens before something like that would be enjoyable
gaming,not_removed,yeah it must be at the end when the giant thing comes towards you
gaming,not_removed,summer reddit
gaming,not_removed,mental retardation
gaming,not_removed,seriously reddiquette should be to include the original video link
gaming,not_removed,every video i watch i think about that cord being tripped over
gaming,not_removed,had a vive for about two months now and use it more or less every day atleast once sure the cord is noticable from time to time but it doesnt bother you and not once have i even come close to tripping on it
gaming,not_removed,that has its own disadvantages the cord acts as a counterweight to the vive also a hanging cord wraps around you and your neck rather easily
gaming,not_removed,you would think but your arms would get caught in it much easier than your legs will at least i would think that
gaming,not_removed,ive contemplated this myself but in reality the cord just doesnt really seem to get in the way that much ive never had anyone trip on mine or pull it out of the breakout box etc which is pretty interesting in comparison to the countless times weve tripped over wired console controllers although for the record the only reason the cable is so high off the ground in this picture is because someone else is holding it normally it just falls straight down your back and lays flat on the ground
gaming,not_removed,i would be more concerned about snagging that out of the video card no shitty gimmick game is worth ruining a high end computer
gaming,not_removed,yeah im not too sure whats going on with his cord theyre like feet long maybe he has it tied onto something source have a vive
gaming,not_removed,i dont think i would want to risk the cord going around my neck while im blindfolded from real life running from zombies
gaming,not_removed,i have had my vive for almost months i only had one accident with the cable and that was because i forgot to move my computer chair kit of the play space even my daughter hasnt had am issue and she has spent about in vr
gaming,not_removed,imagine in the future vr headsets will be wireless theyll also be a lot better cant wait
gaming,not_removed,the cord is never really an issue source own a vive
gaming,not_removed,hyrule field as a child as an year old i wasnt prepared for that good thing it took me till i was to get past the water temple or else the well woulda scarred me for life
gaming,not_removed,the original silent hill one play through was enough for teenage me
gaming,not_removed,it was quake for me first time playing a fps when i was
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,a virtual grid pops up if you approach the edge of your play area to remind you not to smash the piano theres also a basic camera you can activate with a doubleclick to see your surroundings
gaming,not_removed,he would smash into things the game layout is designed to have you stay in one place though so you wouldnt run
gaming,not_removed,mc hammer dance sim now that is scary
gaming,not_removed,you get used to it extremely fast the best way i can describe it is like well having super long hair or what i imagine having a tail coming out of your head would be like you sort of get used to it and tend to be able to subconsciously avoid it while focusing on other things
gaming,not_removed,yall better quiet that shit down
gaming,not_removed,youre seriously telling me youve never jumped at some form of media be it a game movie show or book yes you know its a game but it doesnt stop it being scary take valves secret shop demo while i knew it was a game the moment that big monster roars at you i subconsciously found myself leaning back a bit in awe my legs locked in that state where your body is telling you to back away but you wont just because its a game doesnt mean its not scary
gaming,not_removed,movies and books can induce fear so can video games with good immersion amnesia comes to mind this effects are easier to generate with vr similar to scary or violent games that have more effect played in the dark instead of broad daylight with open windows on a summer day
gaming,not_removed,extreme stress can do whats shown in this video some people breakdown so much from fear and anxiety that they have various stages of bluescreen i assume its probably more prevalent with people not exposed to violence though d
gaming,not_removed,i tried the vr once and did something similar to him you have the urge to run from what you see but every step you take forward leads to a step back because you remember that you are hooked up to the wall and computer
gaming,not_removed,i remember playing resident evil late at night with dolby surround for the first time years ago it absolutely scared the shit out of me especially when the dog suddenly jumps through a window behind you the worst is that one body which suddenly bites your leg if you are near enough i absolutely believe it is worse if you actually see it in
gaming,not_removed,i once slammed into a brick wall in a moment of panic when a robot saw me in budget cuts vr and i dived out of the way so i find it very easy to believe im not someone who scares easily but its easy to forget yourself in room scale vr
gaming,not_removed,have you tried a vive once you get in one its actually incredibly immersive and fun theres room for improvement sure but vr is actually at a point now where it works
gaming,not_removed,theyre free on craigslist and kijiji but you would have to pick it up or pay a piano mover
gaming,not_removed,vive about feet or so it also should breakaway if you tug it too hard past that point but honestly you stop consciously noticing it after a few hours
gaming,not_removed,its meters long and comes with a breakout box so the cables get yanked out of the box and not your computer
gaming,not_removed,they are immersive especially for people who dont play videogames
gaming,not_removed,looks like
gaming,not_removed,you should go try the vive then its a bit more than just a monitor strapped to your face
gaming,not_removed,because you subconsiously get used to it
gaming,not_removed,just dont set chaperone past your furniture and youll be fine
gaming,not_removed,the breakout box negates that issue on the rare chance he does
gaming,not_removed,these arent as big of an issue as it seems chaperone keeps you from running into stuffgrid pops up when you get close to the edges of your predesignated cleared playspace and the cable lays low and its not an issue as you get used to it and forget about it
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,dont hate on oculus because of the hardware hate on it because of anti consumerism
gaming,not_removed,go buy outlast you dont even need vr just play it at night with headphones on
gaming,not_removed,the cables that connect the headset to your computer yeah theyre fairly important
gaming,not_removed,no you could strap a laptop to your back a la corridor digital
gaming,not_removed,yes although honestly you barely even notice them ive never even had anyone trip on it etc your mind subconsciously avoids it
gaming,not_removed,as soon as vr porn take off the world will end
gaming,not_removed,the vive controllers dont really got a name just come with the headset
gaming,not_removed,whenever they can get it under latency and add battery packs witgout the added costs
gaming,not_removed,i see someone playing a horror game seeing things they wont see in real life jump out at them what are you trying to say
gaming,not_removed,are you even in the military
gaming,not_removed,you are ridiculous there will almost certainly never be a draft with the advent of drones and someone getting scared a game designed to scare you doesnt make this generation soft you arent even in the military are you
gaming,not_removed,lol youre pretty stupid
gaming,not_removed,get a vive
gaming,not_removed,unfortunately its a necessity at this stage heres a comment i made above to someone else you get used to it extremely fast the best way i can describe it is like well having super long hair or what i imagine having a tail coming out of your head would be like you sort of get used to it and tend to be able to subconsciously avoid it while focusing on other things
gaming,not_removed,ive seen a few setups like that looks like theres going to be a clear indicator of casual versus hardcore vr gamers d
gaming,not_removed,now thats a strategy i can get behind
gaming,not_removed,fuck off shane

gaming,not_removed,it is if neither of the two flights can decide on a direction to fly in

gaming,not_removed,my guess someone reenacting his last dance dance revolution game
gaming,not_removed,a man who is beyond all others skill trying to get someone anyone to challenge his pokémon
gaming,not_removed,and fucking staminaendurance i think id be winded after seconds of doing what shes doing
gaming,not_removed,how much
gaming,not_removed,from the massive dehydration after throwing up so much
gaming,not_removed,it a sony exclusive you can bet your ass from soft will get a fat cheque to do a vr patch before launch
gaming,not_removed,fallout is getting a full official vr version by thatll do it
gaming,not_removed,get off its meme dick that game wasnt good to ptsd worthy at all
gaming,not_removed,vive cord is feet
gaming,not_removed,on the vive its about
gaming,not_removed,the secret is to befriend them to the point of being accepted into their abode then you have access to vr
gaming,not_removed,when the price of vr drops a bit and absolutely fucking explodes i will have nothing in my living room that shit will all go to the garage fuck guests ftfy
gaming,not_removed,how do you guys avoid stepping on the cable can you only really use it with a second person around
gaming,not_removed,they really concentrate on making you feel good
gaming,not_removed,dude what the fuck is wrong with german people
gaming,not_removed,dammit japan
gaming,not_removed,if its lesbian id still do it
gaming,not_removed,im conflicted
gaming,not_removed,this concerns me
gaming,not_removed,like scoob lets get out of here
gaming,not_removed,im thinking you get a canvas and then have some calm serene music and then someone markets it as a streaming game
gaming,not_removed,you sure as hell know it is
gaming,not_removed,especially when op can double up on karma
gaming,not_removed,its like basically not a big deal you stress about it more when youre not wearing it usually youre more concerned with putting your arm through a window
gaming,not_removed,until you play a game where you are the tasmanian devil
gaming,not_removed,its a pretty thick cord stays behind you of the time
gaming,not_removed,luckily there is a breakout box
gaming,not_removed,nah man the wallmasters appear in the forest temple which is early on and those things scared the shit out of me
gaming,not_removed,the bottom of the well shudder
gaming,not_removed,thx added to the list for when i get my vive
gaming,not_removed,neat thank you
gaming,not_removed,not really chaperone would pop up before he did
gaming,not_removed,im now calling all long hair a head tail
gaming,not_removed,ahhh that makes sense why it always seems to be older people freaking out
gaming,not_removed,i could play it in broad daylight surrounded by puppies and i would still cry and pray to the gods i dont believe in xd most horror i have dared played because it was not expected was in the new thief the mental asylum jesus i was not expecting the game to go so deep into horror and i was playing it at so much sobbing and god exists i repent muttering never again playing that level but a small part of me still says you know it was kind of fun to suffer
gaming,not_removed,well i mean they could go wireless it seems like an easy design choice
gaming,not_removed,vive controllers can i use this controllers on a samsung oculus
gaming,not_removed,but what if hes already got a rift
gaming,not_removed,i saw this fan film made of the zombie apocalypse guy shoots his friend in the foot why did you do that i want to live and runs
gaming,not_removed,or in this case ahead of d
gaming,not_removed,no thats a strategy i can get in front of
gaming,not_removed,thats a strategy i can get ahead of
gaming,not_removed,but zombies love giving anal
gaming,not_removed,get in front of ftfy
gaming,not_removed,you mean get in front of
gaming,not_removed,you mean get ahead of
gaming,not_removed,sounds more like a strategy to get in front of
gaming,not_removed,no youre supposed to get in front of him
gaming,not_removed,you should probably be in front of you want to live
gaming,not_removed,now thats a strategy i can get in front of ftfy
gaming,not_removed,the idea is to get in front
gaming,not_removed,you mean in front of
gaming,not_removed,not what i would choose to do
gaming,not_removed,i would stay ahead if i were you far far ahead and away from those zombies gnawing on that guys brain
gaming,not_removed,no you want him to fall behind
gaming,not_removed,pretty sure youd be in front if him if you can run faster
gaming,not_removed,i think getting behind is the opposite of what you want
gaming,not_removed,thats more the kind of strategy that you get ahead of
gaming,not_removed,behind ur not understanding this no bro the whole point is to be in front
gaming,not_removed,yes please do
gaming,not_removed,actually i belive the strategy is to stay ahead
gaming,not_removed,i think this is one you want to stay in front of
gaming,not_removed,or in front
gaming,not_removed,god damn it kevin the idea is for them to be behind you its not a difficult concept
gaming,not_removed,the strategy might work if you get in front of him instead
gaming,not_removed,no no youre supposed to get in front
gaming,not_removed,in front of
gaming,not_removed,thats a strategy i can get in front
gaming,not_removed,best to be in front
gaming,not_removed,not too far behindthats a multilayered joke right there i tell you what
gaming,not_removed,add a comma after strategy and youre on my team
gaming,not_removed,or in front of
gaming,not_removed,its better if you get in front
gaming,not_removed,dont judge me i did what i had to do to save coraland my own selfish ass
gaming,not_removed,mask you sumthing
gaming,not_removed,out of ammo had to melee
gaming,not_removed,try and theres the risk of you also destroying the pc running the thing
gaming,not_removed,watch out for those cia zombies
gaming,not_removed,good to see a classic i grew up with
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,whoa didnt expect a elite reference here
gaming,not_removed,friendship drive charging
gaming,not_removed,its all because of those meddling kids cables ftfy
gaming,not_removed,when in doubt take the cross product
gaming,not_removed,ah the your mother strategy effective
gaming,not_removed,seriously it was one thing to fight it in the dream but underground for a chalice absurdity
gaming,not_removed,she was the best queen naboo ever had and dont you forget it
gaming,not_removed,whats up with the findkinkywomencom overlay on the video thats not the kind of video i would expect to make someone want to go to that site
gaming,not_removed,im tiny rick
gaming,not_removed,damn dude you meme quick
gaming,not_removed,you laugh but youll never know the despair of having lived under an obese person who does in his room at and every day for two years one more month until i find the will to live again edit he also does this thing which im pretty sure is the loose adjustable dumbbells you can buy with the removable end caps and plates where he will run suicides for a minute yeah i know in a apartment room then he will do some curls or something and then drop his dumbbells which will rattle and bang right above me my friends can hear him over teamspeak the first couple of times it happened it woke me up because i thought a gun or grenade had went off
gaming,not_removed,i feel like ive seen this reply to that question about the gif before
gaming,not_removed,every time this gets posted without fail
gaming,not_removed,thats them having rough sex
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,damn the dancers and their masks they look like dudes youd find a in a zelda game
gaming,not_removed,ahhhh yes the sticky ball dance i know it well
gaming,not_removed,i totally assumed it was a dude
gaming,not_removed,a surprising amount
gaming,not_removed,at least
gaming,not_removed,treefiddy
gaming,not_removed,a lot
gaming,not_removed,lol really any souls game in first person would be enough to give me a fucking migraine
gaming,not_removed,as someone who just finished playthrough id be all over that shit
gaming,not_removed,hows the book going
gaming,not_removed,actually
gaming,not_removed,lol pretty much
gaming,not_removed,you dont need a second person demos at stores tend to have someone helping with the cord because the assumption is anyone trying is doing so for the first time when you own one you very quickly get a sense of where the chord is and avoid it naturally
gaming,not_removed,ive demod to about six people and they all forget the cord is there and subconsciously adjust it if necessary
gaming,not_removed,go on get out of here with those puns scat
gaming,not_removed,i dont know why but the delivery of that one line made me laugh harder than damn near any other part of that film and thats saying a lot south park the movie is amazing
gaming,not_removed,this excites me
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,were really in for it now scoob
gaming,not_removed,what kind of calm serene music edit trying to still make mine into a sensible question after you fixed yours
gaming,not_removed,is that speaking from experience i just cant see it being quite so easy with mine
gaming,not_removed,it was the zombies for me the first time you hear that screamespecially at the age of
gaming,not_removed,i love horror and i still havent finished outlast to be fair i havent had the time but that game scares the shit out of me
gaming,not_removed,ehh not really youd still need power so youd be looking at a wearable battery then the requirements for data transfer rate and latency are pretty extreme better than bluetooth or wifi could manage you need latency to stay under about ms or it starts to get unpleasant it will happen but the technology isnt there yet
gaming,not_removed,that would probably put a bit more weight on the headset as well as upping the cost its pretty expensive as it is
gaming,not_removed,i thought the same the first time i put them on but some napkin math shows the bandwidth requirements are around gbps at least a tall order for wireless right now
gaming,not_removed,nah you need the vive to use them because they need the lighthouse stations plus they only sync with the vive pretty sure
gaming,not_removed,you mean the walking dead
gaming,not_removed,which ive always found a bit dumb why not just shoot them in the head so they wont suffer
gaming,not_removed,deep rising did it in not sure if anything did that earlier
gaming,not_removed,coral
gaming,not_removed,sumpin
gaming,not_removed,rubs back of head
gaming,not_removed,it would make sense for the vive to have some sort of a like on xbox controllers
gaming,not_removed,try for the pc
gaming,not_removed,breakout box so the cable just gets yanked out before any devices get any yanking
gaming,not_removed,pc running the thing ha the thing would need to be at least a grand most likely more
gaming,not_removed,just the gfx card to run a vr headset is for the lowest version plus all the other parts of the computer over imo
gaming,not_removed,someone affirm that the pc being referenced here exsists for that price that does well with vr
gaming,not_removed,a good graphics card for that costs about outside of us
gaming,not_removed,my pc has a current game life expectancy of like or years and it was about dollars you might be lowballing
gaming,not_removed,near what you need to run for a good vr setup unfortunately
gaming,not_removed,akuaku
gaming,not_removed,those can be dangerous
gaming,not_removed,sure but that direction would be normal how unfun
gaming,not_removed,nah thats the fight or fight response
gaming,not_removed,praise the old blood fellow hunter
gaming,not_removed,prude
gaming,not_removed,obese person does in his room at and every day for two years what is he eating
gaming,not_removed,you think thats misery i lived under a pound girl who sounded like an elephant in stilettos not knowing how such a tiny frame produced such loud stomping only made it so much more enraging
gaming,not_removed,good on him
gaming,not_removed,you could just politely ask him not to do it that early or to do an outside routine at that time his size has nothing to do with it lithe people can stomp loud as fuck too so dont feel awkward asking
gaming,not_removed,he wont be obese much longer
gaming,not_removed,gotta appreciate the discipline though
gaming,not_removed,theres a video of a upstairs couple they make noise with everything from marbles to books and chains creative noise i think they called it and a service to their neighbors
gaming,not_removed,everyday for two years im pretty sure he isnt obese any more
gaming,not_removed,it was initially the title of the post the first time this was linked it made the front page and now the gif is always replied with that comment
gaming,not_removed,dance in time with the enemy press a button and b button alternatively to dance
gaming,not_removed,are we wrong
gaming,not_removed,dancers hate him
gaming,not_removed,fuck i only have
gaming,not_removed,its like none of you have ever tried vr how are you going to dodge without throwing up if you can tuck and roll a million times with a vr headset on then im dumbfounded
gaming,not_removed,its called demons plague its a zombie apocalypse book but unlike every other one it takes place in a semirealistic version of medieval england instead of a modern military setting when i say semirealistic it means a lowfantasy world where the cities and characters are fictional but the weapons places and technology are authentic or at least plausible within the setting no magic dragons or other fantasy creatures the zombies are heavily inspired by max brooks no runners i also did my best to avoid common tropes for the genre characters are intelligent and learn quickly how to handle the infected and best of all the story focuses on exactly zero children or babies now in digital and paperback
gaming,not_removed,gotcha do you know if the cord can be extended
gaming,not_removed,init that line has stuck with me to point that it is all i can think of whenever the perishing jerry comes up in any context
gaming,not_removed,meant calm sorry
gaming,not_removed,try those guys in windwaker the redead scream in that is bloodcurdling side note how do i embed links
gaming,not_removed,that scary damn i just dont handle horror well i rather laugh than scream but for some reason seeing jesse coxs resident evil vr video i was like i would at least try it which is a new feeling for me again never played a horror game though i did see my cousin play all of eternal darkness
gaming,not_removed,oh my bad that makes sense then i was thinking it was just usb or something
gaming,not_removed,not yet anyway give it time
gaming,not_removed,when and if they do go wireless i think theres going to be a lot of people falling out of windows
gaming,not_removed,thanks for the info mate
gaming,not_removed,thats not quite how it went
gaming,not_removed,zombies start speaking like christopher walken edit name
gaming,not_removed,wont attract as much attention from zombies if they are dead
gaming,not_removed,the longer they continue to fight back the more time you have to escape
gaming,not_removed,it doesthe cable running to the breakout box should take the brunt of any sudden escape attempts
gaming,not_removed,wasnt that the original xbox or am i remembering wrong
gaming,not_removed,not with the new p
gaming,not_removed,you said yank yes im easily entertained
gaming,not_removed,god bless america i just love having no insurance and cardboard walls
gaming,not_removed,that is the lowball number a pc could support vr just not the highest fidelity
gaming,not_removed,this is the type of misinformation that makes people think pc gaming is too expensive to get into
gaming,not_removed,the new costs and they say it can run vr
gaming,not_removed,now with the rx
gaming,not_removed,the graphics card is usually the most expensive piece in my experience once you get that out of the way you should be able to get the other pieces for not much more than
gaming,not_removed,yeah i was pretty sure it would when i first said that but ive only gotten responses saying yeah no check out logicalincrementscom its a great resource for pc price checking
gaming,not_removed,good try amazingly outstandingly terrific is overkill at this point aside from maxing all settings to ultra and a good card for vr costs more like and the starter cards are around
gaming,not_removed,it opens up new horizons for jokes though
gaming,not_removed,fun is relative
gaming,not_removed,my will to live
gaming,not_removed,rather what is he not eating
gaming,not_removed,yes
gaming,not_removed,my sister has been a major clomper since childhood
gaming,not_removed,one of my roommates from forever ago was a loud person everything about her was loud still is shes also an interrupterso annoying her bf lived there too and they talked loud clomped down the halls loud and he was a little hard of hearing from playing in bands his whole life and doing damage to his ears they also fought like cats and dogs when she would laugh it was a spine chilling cackle you could hear from outside of the houseloud like a parrot in heat
gaming,not_removed,ive spoken to him he was very adamant in his intentions to both not stop and not care that i did not appreciate it
gaming,not_removed,times a day every day for years he shouldnt still be fat
gaming,not_removed,as well as every time its posted on facebook imgur or any other website free karma is free karma
gaming,not_removed,i tried playing that minigame without sound never again
gaming,not_removed,im still convinced its a dude
gaming,not_removed,easy just dont make the camera actually roll with your face someone modded dark souls in first person with vr and thats what they did worked great
gaming,not_removed,sounds like my kind of zombie book
gaming,not_removed,i used the lookinside feature on amazon its actually wellwritten im glad i asked
gaming,not_removed,and best of all the story focuses on exactly zero children or babies thank the lord walking dead sucks for this
gaming,not_removed,wicked advertising campaign bro will be buying it when i get home
gaming,not_removed,it can its just kind of a pain its literally just a power cord an hdmi cord and a usb cord they just wrap it in a in cable that goes to a breakout box that then goes about another feet to your pc
gaming,not_removed,not really its not like the cord keeps you from falling out windows uts pretty much just chaperone
gaming,not_removed,theyre more the complaining dead
gaming,not_removed,it kinda did didnt it httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvmfzewxttnbu
gaming,not_removed,what if christopher sat
gaming,not_removed,can confirm mine was a victim of a holopoint accident and were still okay
gaming,not_removed,no the original xbox had those but i believe the wired controllers for the had something similar or maybe the usb port is enough of a quick release on its own
gaming,not_removed,original had it
gaming,not_removed,httpwwwlogicalincrementscomarticlesvrguide pegs a computer with oculus official spec at about however the new rx is about half the price of the gtx and has the same amount of power this drops the price by about
gaming,not_removed,whats an example of a pc that can comfortably handle htc vive games
gaming,not_removed,this is the type of misinformation that makes people think they can play vr games on a pc
gaming,not_removed,i wanna get into it so badly
gaming,not_removed,ftfy is entry level for and the same price right now is and
gaming,not_removed,space
gaming,not_removed,none of my relatives are fun
gaming,not_removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡° clomper
gaming,not_removed,i would have just sent him a noise cushioning mat with a fruits basket maybe invited him over for some healthy dinner
gaming,not_removed,no this seems like his neighbor is an asshole who needs to buy a house or a gym membership
gaming,not_removed,join him for the workout
gaming,not_removed,you tried to be civil tell him it isnt working and crush his will to live
gaming,not_removed,brutal what an ass at least it sounds like yer moving
gaming,not_removed,sounds like asshole and how the fuck do you do for years and continue to be a fat ass
gaming,not_removed,yeah this is a thing in overwatch genji flips when he double jumps but the pov is stabilized
gaming,not_removed,please explain that better than make the camera roll with your face because my face doesnt roll
gaming,not_removed,woah hey ive seen you around everywhere in a reddit way i feel good that you commented on my comment even if i didnt have much to say lol
gaming,not_removed,i dont remember this from the punisher origin story
gaming,not_removed,well yeah i just mean they werent really friends and they both easily could have made it
gaming,not_removed,i have a wired plugged in right now its got one
gaming,not_removed,just makes me feel old when people refer to this as the quick release the had when it originally on the original xbox
gaming,not_removed,also i have one
gaming,not_removed,minimum specs with a amd rx
gaming,not_removed,when will it be released though
gaming,not_removed,is the place
gaming,not_removed,just break your arms
gaming,not_removed,relativity isnt all that fun either
gaming,not_removed,you are a good man and i wish i had thought that instead of just thinking that the bottom guy should just shut up and deal with it which he obviously has
gaming,not_removed,or maybe he doesnt have much money and is making the best of a bad situation
gaming,not_removed,oh yeah thats true too
gaming,not_removed,basically mcrees roll in overwatch
gaming,not_removed,you do a flip and your face stays gyroscopically stable and detaches from your body then reattaches when you finish the roll wow
gaming,not_removed,i would imagine the camera stays steady while the avatar body executes the roll
gaming,not_removed,its dont make the camera roll with your face so when you roll the camera stays stable but the model rolls as it should it works well enough but im not a fan of first person rolling thankfully in bloodborne a lot of dodges are sidesteps rather than rolls
gaming,not_removed,dont spin the camera
gaming,not_removed,coral
gaming,not_removed,why is there a dead man in our living room carrrrl
gaming,not_removed,i know the original had wireless as well but it didnt come with the console because it was coming out mid lifespani think they made a wired controler for people who needed wired for what ever reason
gaming,not_removed,days ago
gaming,not_removed,every fucking thread
gaming,not_removed,knew this would show up somewhere
gaming,not_removed,its still not okay to disrupt someone elses life i understand the difference of opinion is why the issue exists in the first place also why i dont live in apartments anymore i am not chill enough to tolerate living like that
gaming,not_removed,i dont think feeding him will work
gaming,not_removed,not sure why i care but a condo does not at all mean someone will not be above you im sure you have seen where you are moving to so you should know but by definition most condos mean there are either residents above or below you
gaming,not_removed,just like i learned in gymnastics
gaming,not_removed,oh hey how did he get here
gaming,not_removed,when youve got a hankering for hands
gaming,not_removed,its also on the xbox one wired controller
gaming,not_removed,hell just end up guilt exercising harder
gaming,not_removed,how are you getting fucked if its free
gaming,not_removed,at least i dont have to fish for candy in a games pockets every time i play
gaming,not_removed,i think he means but
gaming,not_removed,i play support for the machine guns battlefield logic
gaming,not_removed,because i enjoy winning more than getting kills
gaming,not_removed,nobody expects zenyatta to snipe them in the fucking face nobody
gaming,not_removed,i main support because i wanna win
gaming,not_removed,because no one else wants to be support
gaming,not_removed,dps are a dime a dozen they also usually dont know the encounters very well and just pew pew pew ill always start as a healertank and make a dps character later in the game
gaming,not_removed,partially cos no aim but if i was scared i would turtle up as tank being support is not for pansies we get focused to fuck mostly i find it more interesting watching the hp bars and knowing youre all fucked without me is fun to me even if yall dps motherfuckers dont appreciate it ill still take it up
gaming,not_removed,being able to keep the dps alive while it take out the entire enemy team thats the dream i dont care about who is remembered i care about the win
gaming,not_removed,according to they are all masochistic sluts
gaming,not_removed,honestly i just find it multitudes more fun dps is simple and mechanics focused aim shoot move on healing is far more about team positioning prioritizing specific targets and sometimes protecting myself i prefer the methodical gameplay and i really enjoy being a big backbone of my team you can survive with a mediocre dps its hard to survive with a mediocre healer
gaming,not_removed,you play to win the game
gaming,not_removed,cause i was off getting snacks while everyone was choosing i get back last to choose and theres no healers yet
gaming,not_removed,to offer suppressive fire and mow down entire enemy squads while providing smoke cover to my team aid in the assault without directly taking place if shit gets out of hand you have rounds to solve that problem before you reload giving reinforcements time to arrive
gaming,not_removed,rhealsluts is how reward them for good service and they shall faithfully follow
gaming,not_removed,if i can accomplish more as a support than i could a dps then a dps could accomplish if they took up support why wouldnt i be a support
gaming,not_removed,usually do more damage then any of my dps even though im supptank plus it makes it easier to win so why not
gaming,not_removed,people are bad at healing so i heal im not any kind of tryhard but i do try to do things right and i play the objectives i hate when some kid takes healer then starts dpsing healers are the most important class in almost any game without a healer nobody can do their job without dying
gaming,not_removed,bad at aiming and scared is why i rush in no need to aim at point blank range of the time it just ends up with me dead but that of the time im a hero
gaming,not_removed,theres not much better in overwatch than getting those sweet kds and those heal points with lucio its the best of both worlds
gaming,not_removed,honestly support characters are real mvps i find myself playing tankdps classes exclusively and when i raid id be dead in seconds if it werent for the heals and buffs love goes out to you support players
gaming,not_removed,and theyre the ones you better not piss off or you wont get healed
gaming,not_removed,because the medic is in charge always you live and die at our whim we set the line we form the core of the push our movement dictates yours its the support that pushes people past where they could otherwise be its support that turns defeat into victory damage kills the enemy support wins the game
gaming,not_removed,its been the same way with almost every game dota league overwatch even classes like rook in siege support players choose support because they understand that its essential to win and they arent obsessed with superficial kd ratios or kill streaks if i can go support on dota and constantly heal disable silence debuff disarm give mana buff andor save whilst also maintaining vision of the map and stacking camps for carrys i have played a fuck tonne better than a kd carry who may have just got lucky all game and landed the last hit andor is a hero who is a built killstealer ie zeus ulti necro ulti void chrono treant ult ect same applies imo to overwatch if im the reason that roadhog or soldier stayed alive im a large part of the reason why they were able to get a huge killstreak its a thankless task but every now and then you get someone who actually recognises that your support was more vital than a positive kd and more often than not the person thanking you also has no problem supporting if no one else will i blame cod for creating this culture of if i got the most kills i played the best edit spelling
gaming,not_removed,for the same reason i tank no one else wants to and shit needs to get done
gaming,not_removed,at least theyre honest
gaming,not_removed,theres a lot more to being a healer than many people give credit for especially aimingpositioning
gaming,not_removed,a good support can carry the team as well
gaming,not_removed,i play support characters because i cant trust anyone else to be support its why i always play a healer in mmos im a pretty fucking good healer if i do say so myself but whenever i play another role like tank or dps i seem to get stuck with healers that do not know what they are doing
gaming,not_removed,for me it depends on the game in rainbow six siege great game btw recommend it i quite often like playing characters who help out the team which is important if youre going to win the more information available or protection for the squad the better
gaming,not_removed,i have eyesight issues and love that i can still play this game mercy isnt a problem torb and sym are good because i can still do smart things that kill people any character with slower and bright rounds dva when shes out of mech and mercy works great for this i can start shooting see where the rounds end up and adjust occasionally ill just rein my team through a bottle neck and help that way as a girl with crap eyes im stoked to still be able to make a win happen even if i cant see some of the smallfast stuff
gaming,not_removed,is it unusual for a level bard to be doing most of a partys damage in because thats my bard in one of the dd campaigns i play i have a fighter and a monk in my party that both do like damage on a normal attack but my bard is consistently in double digits
gaming,not_removed,healing has always been my favourite role i always felt like i had control of the entire battle by being a good healer if i fucked up we all died or i manage to res people quickly enough that we end up okay
gaming,not_removed,there are two types of gamers the ones who get all the kills and claim the greatest win over points and their mates who made sure they stay alive while they do it a bit like rocket league theres the guy who centres balls like a dream throughout the game and the guy who pot shots them in as they role towards the goal and then takes all the credit in battlefield you get the guys who just go for kills and you get the guys who actually attempt the objectives i used to win games win hardly any kills by just going for the objective they guys would at my minor kill list completely ignoring the fact that we practically won the game single handedly for them support never get the credit but you would be no where without us we just dont say anything because we know the opposite player will kick off and scream if we take away their glory source i am the guy who centres
gaming,not_removed,why i play lucio i cant aim and i dont have to
gaming,not_removed,for me id rather play dps as well problem is every time i ever have i find myself hyper critical of my support characters maybe i just have shitty luck finding support for my groups or i just dont give enough of a chance but i dont want to fail just because i wanted to play a dps id rather play support well and not fail
gaming,not_removed,when i play lucio i get to do everything mentioned here at the same time checkmate dpses
gaming,not_removed,i just like winning
gaming,not_removed,because you ding dongs keep being shitty deeps and somebody needs to keep you alive
gaming,not_removed,because im not an insecure kid who need to be the killer in a game to give any sense to my life
gaming,not_removed,the golazo is remembered rarely the assist
gaming,not_removed,want to win games
gaming,not_removed,dont go in first therefore dont die
gaming,not_removed,because i get a shitload of assists and love saving people
gaming,not_removed,i actually enjoy helping my teammates i usually play support in overwatch and when i play with my point guard i like getting assists more than scoring
gaming,not_removed,i feel like im more important when doing support it can start to feel like a job though imo dps is easy speaking in mmo terms
gaming,not_removed,i was looking forward to someone who would say i gotta preserve my score and not die
gaming,not_removed,if i dont play support no one on my team would have a healer
gaming,not_removed,because im good at micro managing peoples health and everybody else on the team is a shit medic
gaming,not_removed,because no one will and now we have snipers again god fuck
gaming,not_removed,i love helping other people
gaming,not_removed,playing support in a game like overwatch is very challengingyoure extremely squishy you have no natural escape abilities and youre everyones first target f that ill just tank
gaming,not_removed,this describes all the reasons perfectly i swear even in a video game you shouldnt trust me with a gun
gaming,not_removed,this is what carry exclusive players think but its not reality i play support because most gamers dont have the patience to play anything but carry also this attitude gets you and the whole team killed
gaming,not_removed,i have a constant struggle between being the only healer or being the only one doing damage in most of my games feelsbadman
gaming,not_removed,i actually loved healing in ffxiv i could set up shop in a dungeon run press some macros and watch netflix fun times
gaming,not_removed,pretty much bad at aiming i hate getting potg unless its with torb lol i know it sucks to watch but no one should have to watch me spaz out as i try to fend of symetra and fail
gaming,not_removed,one the one hand good support plays can feel extremely impactful at the right time on the other hand if youre supporting people who cant play for shit then youre shit outta luck
gaming,not_removed,im a generally bad player so i am the decoy i run out front when something seems suss and draw out the bad guys then my team gets the job done and i can run around shouting see im helping
gaming,not_removed,if you are an attacker you lower enemy hp therefore making your teams total hp greater in comparison if youre a healer you increase ally hp causing the same effect in other words if x y then hp to x will change the equation the same as hp to y the difference though is that while x will actively try to prevent you from hp to it y will actively try to make it easier for you to hp to it which results in a lowerpressure easier time for the same effect another thing ive noticed is that healing abilities tend to have a greater magnitude than hurting abilities sometimes this is because a hurting ability even if it has the same base dmg as the healing ability does has to factor in the enemys defense and be reduced
gaming,not_removed,back in the day in wow i preferred healing because being a tank required hard work and being a dps required no responsibility support players are in the middle were lazy but we want to win
gaming,not_removed,because healing gives a shitton of points meaning i can make top on the scoreboard by chilling
gaming,not_removed,i like playing crystal maiden in dota because i can just totally veg out and occasionally press a couple of buttons i like not needing to think
gaming,not_removed,bitch most of my support life relied on getting in front of your sorry ass and taking damage for you dont tell me that i am scared
gaming,not_removed,unless you are a support in killing floor then you just go in with shotguns and murder absolutely everything
gaming,not_removed,how does this person have my name
gaming,not_removed,yes i finally found a role i can actually play
gaming,not_removed,because i want to take a break from doing all those headshots
gaming,not_removed,pretty much this its why i was a soraka main in league its why i play mercy in overwatch though im about five times better at ow than i am at league in overwatch so approximately in league terms and in league after playing for years rofl
gaming,not_removed,because when everyone is playing as a sniper and trying to do lolscopes camping in the arse end of the map instead of capturing points i play support to even it out besides when youre laying suppressive fire down a pinchpoint you can get a shitload of kills
gaming,not_removed,i am making two things sure as a support i am making sure that the people that want to shoot to keep shooting without dying as fast and making sure that we win
gaming,not_removed,my reflexes suck cant really shoot enemies and play fast as fuck thats why just heal and revive people is the best thing to do
gaming,not_removed,why not be both and just play scholar
gaming,not_removed,because making a difference and making others feel invincible and good also having people trust others online even with the constant trolls online is good for all of multiplayerkind
gaming,not_removed,in world of warcraft i used to love playing as a priest since healers arent in abundance i was treated like gold
gaming,not_removed,i am a bishop a cleric of the highest order a priest of the highest faith i cast shields to protect my party i cast buffs to boost their tenacity their strength of will and give them the fleet of foot without me the party will lose morale without me the party will lose their bounty without me the party is doomed to fail i pledge to heal your sorry beat up ass as long as you are not an asshat i will keep you alive and bring you back from the dead i will ensure that you can keep fighting till we reach that wonderful wonderful bounty chest and then after i am a servant of god i channel his miracles through my widespread hands i bestow blessings through my prayer i am a bishop
gaming,not_removed,hi slingerogrady here professional babysitter and mercy main pulls out card
gaming,not_removed,i just play a really aggressive ana gotta get close enough for the grenade to serve double duty
gaming,not_removed,i love support no one could stop my team in battlegrounds when my disc priest was around honestly id love a game where i get to play a totally support role say as an ai in a facility or starship would be sick
gaming,not_removed,i rarely play support but when i actually do its because either a dps player got stuck with it and hes trash so i gotta let him take my spot or no one else is gonna play it so i gotta baby sit all those fuckers i want us to all win and enjoy it so i dont care what i play half the time i just dont go straight to support
gaming,not_removed,i enjoy watching my temporarily contracted minions scurrying around working for me while i sit back and support them and make sure they dont die when they do something completely stupid and thats always a when not if they prefer being called group members or teammates though im okay with that i think it gives them a sense of equality
gaming,not_removed,i actually like being the healer i almost always play the healer
gaming,not_removed,playing support is great because the problem with all team games is how braindead your team is playing support mitigates that problem all you need in league of legends to win as a support is one player on your team who has great mechanics babysit them and its a free win
gaming,not_removed,a wise person once told me you know what your dps is when youre dead your dps is id rather make sure the team actually functions rather than just charging in repeatedly well that i dont have the best reflexes in the world
gaming,not_removed,i like having the ability to restore a dying player to full health or letting them die from calculated neglect
gaming,not_removed,generally in most team games the support character usually has a better understanding of whats going on as a whole in the game they arent tunnel visioned into things like damage dealing a good support player is usually also a good leader they see everything going on because theyre supposed to be hanging back providing support where needed this is why i play support i see a lot of comments dismissing zenyatta as a true support a good zenyatta calls out their discords and therefore is being a leader potentially shifting the entire focus of the team when its needed
gaming,not_removed,its control as dps you can sit back and ask why you died and it will always be because you got stabbed shot or blasted before you could stab shoot or blast them as support there is probably some skill you could have used or you shouldnt rush in as support or maybe your dps went in the cardinal directions while your tank goes rambo im a problem solver i like identifying the problem and considering solutions as dps the solution is to git gud as support it is to get better at the game
gaming,not_removed,or french
gaming,not_removed,almost hrs of just mercy
gaming,not_removed,is life
gaming,not_removed,lmg ftw
gaming,not_removed,i play support to iritate the other team nothing is more frustrating and tense than being suppressed while having no idea where its coming from
gaming,not_removed,ganz hmg for life
gaming,not_removed,especially battlefield i remember myself and a friend had a class with an extended mag rounds with a blood and holo scope we used to sit at the end of the corridors on operation metro in and just rake in the suppression assists
gaming,not_removed,this plus being more sought aftereasy to find groups in rpgs and i generally find straight damage rolls boring even in fps games
gaming,not_removed,ding ding ding winning is the best
gaming,not_removed,nobody likes to play support yet everyone likes to win rucks
gaming,not_removed,depends in overwatch playing with random people if i dont heal it seems like our healer is retarded and barely heals if i do heal then our dps can live forever but never shoot the broad side of a barn its a crapshoot usually ends up best just being a character that can heal myself and kill like roadhog or soldier
gaming,not_removed,yup id rather be the dude shooting other dudes in their dude faces but id also rather win as the healy dude than die a bunch and lose as another shooty dude on my team
gaming,not_removed,not everyone likes to play support but everyone likes to win
gaming,not_removed,you have been banned from rbattlefield
gaming,not_removed,you cant win and get kills at the same time people have to die eventually to reach the objectives
gaming,not_removed,then go carry
gaming,not_removed,that is a mindset i will never understand edit okay obviously im not against anyone who wants to play support that would be silly my tone was basically a joke
gaming,not_removed,death is whimsical today
gaming,not_removed,people play support if they have bad aim people play zenyatta if they have very fucking good aim
gaming,not_removed,and yet i find his balls in my face constantly
gaming,not_removed,attacking genji with a charged shot he tries to deflect finish him off with a kick
gaming,not_removed,im getting good at taking down pharah as zen nobody expects the offensive zenny nobody
gaming,not_removed,similarly nobody expects to get point blank tutututd by an
gaming,not_removed,i have not played overwatch but i did medic i like winning but i also love ballistic arc weapons and can snipe with them grenade launcher a or the syringe gun killed many a scout looking to take me out from healing a demoman always surprised them
gaming,not_removed,harmony bitch
gaming,not_removed,im just happy almost all current games have some sort of healing recognition via scoreend of round medal now i play healer in most games i play be it mmo moba or fps one instance of those end of game stats stands out particularly the battlefield beta i was an assault medic sorry dont remember if they changed that in a player conquer map i was following the largest push on our team pretty much every time shooting healing reviving etc as one does this support mg guy gets super pissed i didnt run out and res him in the middle of a grenade field at one of the points spends the next min shit talking me about how i should uninstall etc to the whole server just ignore it all and do my thing we win end of round and i get top medic in healing and revives i just say hey doucheguyusername sup and he leaves the server seconds later so thank you modern online games for support love with tools to prove idiots wrong it does a lot for our morale
gaming,not_removed,racking
gaming,not_removed,whacking
gaming,not_removed,too bad my teammates never save me back no matter how many times i call for help over voice chat
gaming,not_removed,mvp material
gaming,not_removed,thats how i ended up being a support main
gaming,not_removed,not to mention windwalker in jesus
gaming,not_removed,not to mention shadow priest has been killer this expansion
gaming,not_removed,i get revived in battlefield only to be killed immediately by the same person bandaids without addressing the cause
gaming,not_removed,my team hell yeah we got em all enemy mercy flies from behind a wall enemy mercy helden sterben nicht my team aw fuck
gaming,not_removed,in overwatch if i play anything but mercy i think t my self i could have healed you you would have lived im sorry i just cant shake that feeling off
gaming,not_removed,strange most of my teams go out of their way to avoid mercy
gaming,not_removed,this is why you stop healing the more aggresively unnapreciative ones so they die repeatedly and get kicked off the team
gaming,not_removed,cant be a skittish tank though but a skittish support might be more likely to evade an ambush
gaming,not_removed,shoutout to rhealsluts nsfw
gaming,not_removed,i tried playing medic in because i thought it would be easier just spray your medigun to everyone and win but in the end getting to actually heal the damn players that need it with them constantly running away and shuffling in front of each other is just as frustrating as trying to hit the enemy in the end i settled for demoman because its hard to land hits but its so satisfying when you can land bombs in a row and completely demolish the enemy team
gaming,not_removed,yes meciocre dps means that the fight will take longer mediocre healer means that you will either die or be close to dying
gaming,not_removed,yes i tried explaining to my friends how dps feels so simple like i can just turn my brain off and shoot things but healing is more complicated they didnt really get it
gaming,not_removed,when in doubt use moar dakka when in fear use moar dakka when in the drivers seat use moar dakka but make sure you do your fucking job before you use moar dakka
gaming,not_removed,so i agree with your comment and all but your formatting is aids
gaming,not_removed,your formatting needs aides
gaming,not_removed,healing with lucio lul
gaming,not_removed,i did that so much in wow you attack like a retard fine you die
gaming,not_removed,we arent marksmen we are startegists
gaming,not_removed,while the dps players are also bad at aiming but will never admit it
gaming,not_removed,now you know how they feel when supported by you
gaming,not_removed,i feel the same way i wont trust someone random with the healer class when i know i can player healer well im current replaying old wow content with a friend who is very good at wow running all the dungeons with players instead of the recommended and were wrecking everything im the healer and hes the tankdps and every pull has the potential to be a clutch moment because of our man squad but i heal him through and he keeps me from pulling aggro so much fun
gaming,not_removed,not to mention jackal being a real nuisance to roamers i find more people staying around the objective these days to be safe from jackal tracking and thus picking more objectivefocused ops
gaming,not_removed,whats noteworthy about that i thought that all my teammates have eyesight issues s
gaming,not_removed,bards in dd are sick when played right and iirc monks get op at a higher level
gaming,not_removed,damage kills enemies support wins the game
gaming,not_removed,problem is you have to know when to let people die to teach them a lesson and when not to if you save them all the time by going in overdrive then they will just keep playing shit
gaming,not_removed,depends on the game i cant imagine playing support in a fps but love doing it in mmos mmos are all about interesting combat mechanics anyways and support has more mechanics most of the time
gaming,not_removed,mercy main btw
gaming,not_removed,also i enjoy the game more if no one rage even if i lose having no support is the first step of making teenage minded gamers rage
gaming,not_removed,for the life of me i cant play effectively any tanks except maybe roadhog grappling hook life
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,try looking at the trail of bullets
gaming,not_removed,my god yes just switched to the lewis gun suppresive from the bar to get the chauchat and the amount of snipers ive been able to kill or mark pin down while my team moves has increased exponentially
gaming,not_removed,i find healers to be generally boring passive in fps except ana in overwatch she is one of the few healers that has really drawn me in much more engaging imo then again she was basically mccree disguised as a support guess its just a personal thing as to which is more enjoyable but ive always found support roles to be more passive yeah you have to not die and manage your team but the way its done is so boring ana has this rare quality that made her feel so different from the other supports in the game
gaming,not_removed,having fun winning
gaming,not_removed,supports often have a low ceiling so for most players wherever they are will often perform better on support once they get used to it but on a lot of other roles there is much less restrictions and uncapped ceiling allows you to constantly improve and takeover games the problem is nobody can just wake up one day and be good takes a lot of loses and learning whereas support just not fuck up but the long term payoff is ability to carry your team
gaming,not_removed,is that the name of the bastion announcer
gaming,not_removed,thats why ana before the nerf was the best you were basically a mccreesupport shit was so fun
gaming,not_removed,best voice pack
gaming,not_removed,imagine you are playing chess do you play to just take as many buttons as you can from your opponent or do you want to make a checkmate
gaming,not_removed,personally i think its fine to have this opinion but i guess most would disagree people have fun doing different things and this guy just wants to frag whats wrong with that
gaming,not_removed,winning with teamplay is even funnier than having kills and losing anyways
gaming,not_removed,i have really good aim and find myself almost having to go damage because the team simply needs reliable dps but i like being support and it always bothers me when people say its really easy as dps i hunt support as support i stay alive and in both roles i can say a mercy who can zip around and dodge pharah rockets is a hell of a pain in the ass i love a mercy who cant fly and i love one who forgets she has a gun i always get a kick blasting people down with it when i play her and anna is an dps forced supports wet dream with her healing cancellation burst heals and occasional support damage as others are topped off all that being said if the team damage is good ill play support all day because when the teams are relatively even in the end it comes down to how the supports play be it anna canceling an enemy heal on the push or mercy being miss unkillable into the clutch res or the zenyatta mark target of doom thats where the games get decided honorable mentions to gold damage rheinhardt berserker plays
gaming,not_removed,i just hold down the fire button and hope it kinda works but yeah i dont have very fucking good aim and i like him
gaming,not_removed,people also play zenyatta when theyve never played any healer but are being forced in to the role then they dont heal anyone
gaming,not_removed,deflect blocks melee attacks
gaming,not_removed,zen is more dps than healer just like lucio is more of speed booster than a healer
gaming,not_removed,the w is silent
gaming,not_removed,found the genji main
gaming,not_removed,you need new teammates bro
gaming,not_removed,thats why whenever i play support smite i expect a suicide mission
gaming,not_removed,but never really the mvppotgetc i wish games put in more ways to get the mvp status when supporting except for that really really clutch heal that gave you the win
gaming,not_removed,lucio main ftw
gaming,not_removed,i always got last pick on lol ranked for or seasons default got placed support since i started playing it serous went from like bronze to plat a good support is the difference in most gamesand i dont mind people carrying me
gaming,not_removed,hunters i either get paired with one or faceoff against one
gaming,not_removed,i havent played wow in ages but i had a lot of fun as a shadow priest back then you mightve had to put a bit more effort in than a raw healbot to be useful in a raid setting but it was awesome
gaming,not_removed,man when has spriest been bad
gaming,not_removed,thats why i toss gas the rez
gaming,not_removed,thats a difference between a good and bad support though not a problem with supports in general
gaming,not_removed,sometimes we have to ignore you in order to save you its tough love
gaming,not_removed,what sr do you play at
gaming,not_removed,experience tranquility ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gaming,not_removed,i recall the expectation in being that you call for a medic and get away from the battle while you seek each other out i never ran into the heat of battle as a medic because it was basically suicide
gaming,not_removed,yeah but dps is also about positioning having proper target priority depending on the hero you choose soldier and genji have different roles zed and anivia have different roles and targets to go after its the point of a team game every piece has its place dps tanks and healers are all just as equally important and then theres ana who does everything
gaming,not_removed,play mccree and then tell me the above statement again
gaming,not_removed,yeah it gave me butt cancer
gaming,not_removed,sleep deprivation
gaming,not_removed,so many times my sister ran as a white mage in and so many people didnt get healed lol
gaming,not_removed,i dont see jackal in ranked much anymore but if i see a squad maining him i start using echo i search for the enemies on the yokai while my mate goes for the flank all i have to do is bottleneck them for him which is really easy to do
gaming,not_removed,dps supports wins games
gaming,not_removed,roadhog rides
gaming,not_removed,this is very true when playing pve dungeons i let dps die for ages and just sat there healing tank sometimes to be an asshat fun times
gaming,not_removed,overwatch does support classes right for an fps
gaming,not_removed,back when i found playing a healer would get me in a pug faster than dps anyone can play dps stangely in rift cueing as support tank and healer can change spec easily lately i get in groups quicker playing support than i do as tankhealer fyi in rift support class offers offhealing some dps and usually debuffsbuffing best support class tends to be bard
gaming,not_removed,now i have bullets in my eyes
gaming,not_removed,mind bullets kyle
gaming,not_removed,i usually play a healer class because that is my playstyle i love the clutch moments where my whole teamparty is losing health rapidly and i can save them by popping my limited use aoe heal or when someone dies to use my limited use battle res to get them back immediately people frequently ask me why i play healer same reason as why you dont play healer its not your playstyle i feel you need more strategy as a healer than dps and i feel im better at figuring out strategies on the spot than the average person dps seems boring to me always spamming the same rotation and nothing else tank i have never tried because its too daunting the whole raid or party relies on you and if you fail the raid has a big chance to wipe so i have a lot of respect for those that can tank well because you guys save healers from pulling aggro because of their heals and on top of that the face of the opponents during pvp when they get killed by the healer is priceless druid class in older wow is so op and i love it
gaming,not_removed,it seems almost everyone goes dps so theres a shortage of tankshealers its not that everybody goes dps its that dps is the catchall group for people that cant heal or tank there are just as few dps builds as there are healers its just all the shitty players pass themselves off as dps as well
gaming,not_removed,have you tried zenyatta yet hes even more active in that you spend of the time moving the heal from ally to ally and of the time shooting stuff hes basically a with no damage falloff
gaming,not_removed,having fun winning
gaming,not_removed,do you think this is some kind of game based around fun no we play to win
gaming,not_removed,stay out of ranked
gaming,not_removed,having fun while winning having fun while not winning
gaming,not_removed,winning having fun jk
gaming,not_removed,you think losing is fun
gaming,not_removed,winning fun having fun having lots of fun besides if theres anything better than killing your opponents its denying their kills and making their lives miserable
gaming,not_removed,i know she was my main
gaming,not_removed,shit was so fun shit was so overpowered ftfy
gaming,not_removed,buttons
gaming,not_removed,its a fair point but a very different mentality to me and presumably the guy youre replying to i just like to play but supporting sometimes feels more like im just spectating i like winning but id rather lose than win while feeling like a spectator i do accept that other people might enjoy supporting though keep it up as we need you guys
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,me too man zens my favorite character and im bad at all of them so i just main who i enjoy
gaming,not_removed,should be invisible
gaming,not_removed,httpgrammaristcomusagerackwrack
gaming,not_removed,gonna need a verifiable source on that short source that contradicts your claim httpwwwdictionarycombrowsewracking long source that contradicts your claim httpswwwmerriamwebstercomwordsatplayrackvswrack
gaming,not_removed,well youre wrong you antinazi nazi
gaming,not_removed,it is always rack unless you are being figurative then you can use wrack wrack is related to old english wraec misery and wrecan to punish the points were racking up fast i had to wrack my brain to remember her name
gaming,not_removed,i wish i could play genji im just a lowly support
gaming,not_removed,or maybe he shouldnt need so much help personally i hate when mercy mains say that i only got bubbles all game from you zarya its like you want me to die if youre mercy and youre consistently in so deep you need a bubble you probably should rethink your playstyle
gaming,not_removed,when theres a bunch of knuckleheads just running and gunning a good support is what carries the team
gaming,not_removed,role in vanilla backup dps no one seriously main specced this outside of pvp role in bc mana batteries raids honestly felt empty without one role in wrath gods why play anything else then i stopped playing¯ ツ ¯
gaming,not_removed,replaying some older wow expansions and i can safely tell you never ive been wrecked by shadow priests multiple times in multiple expansions
gaming,not_removed,currently but ive been bouncing anywhere from this season
gaming,not_removed,yeah but on public servers most people just kinda run around without any real strategy
gaming,not_removed,overwatch is a different beast you can do decent damage with healers i was talking more in the mmo sense but yes dps tank and healer are important but you can survive in mmos with only a tank and healer dps is there to speed up the killing
gaming,not_removed,by no means am i saying hes hard to counter i play a lot of casual because thats just what my friends play so i see a lot of poor teamwork most of the time ive noticed a trend in people not roaming as much or simply not picking roamers since jackals widespread use i tend to play frost and valk so jackal is no problem for me since all killhungry players are predictable
gaming,not_removed,tank i have never tried because its too daunting the whole raid or party relies on you and if you fail the raid has a big chance to wipe used to play a tank on wow and riding that edge was a rush sure when everything goes wrong everyone blames you but when you control the fight just right you feel like a god also grouping was better zero wait time though the flip side of that is when you hit the lfg button you damn well had better already have all your shit sorted cause you arent going to have time while you are in the queue
gaming,not_removed,i played healer in swtor but i felt like i was under way too much pressure to keep my team alive in group dungeons if we wiped it felt like my fault i stopped doing group stuff cos i didnt enjoy the stress and in subsequent mmos ive avoided playing as a healer
gaming,not_removed,i played druid healer for a top teir raid group in wow for burning crusade and wraith of the lich king i would do raids all the time mans in the morning with my friends and mans at night with our a team i got so good at the dynamics that i only cared about being top healing dps on the charts so during fights that i got bored with i would throw on my hots and stand in the aoe i would never die and i knew what i could and couldnt survive i also would never jeopardize the raid everyone would be damn you so much higher healing dps than everyone else until the day my best friend in rl called me out told everyone during a raid you know why he top healer look at him in the aoe healing himself
gaming,not_removed,i played druid healer for a top teir raid group in wow for burning crusade and wraith of the lich king i would do raids all the time mans in the morning with my friends and mans at night with our a team i got so good at the dynamics that i only cared about being top healing dps on the charts so during fights that i got bored with i would throw on my hots and stand in the aoe i would never die and i knew what i could and couldnt survive i also would never jeopardize the raid everyone would be damn you so much higher healing dps than everyone else until the day my best friend in rl called me out told everyone during a raid you know why he top healer look at him in the aoe healing himself
gaming,not_removed,yeah but hes just sort of one dimensional and you dont have to worry about cd management at all i mean hes definitely fun just not on anas level of engagement imo cd management is why i find tracer genji and ana so fun
gaming,not_removed,having win funning
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,this is why ive never played a rankedcompetitive match in any game dota is the biggest example close to hours and never touched ranked though youd think you were playing ranked with how much people can rage on an unranked match lmao
gaming,not_removed,recently started learning c it makes me feel so nerdy that that gave me a chuckle haha
gaming,not_removed,winning is better than losing but fun is mostly independent of winning or losing
gaming,not_removed,one in the same
gaming,not_removed,i meant pieces
gaming,not_removed,you know the horse button the cross button the tower button the ball on top of a pole button and so on
gaming,not_removed,sorry i dont speak perfect english and dont know every single word not a native english speaker translator gave me chess buttons as pieces on the board
gaming,not_removed,you shouldnt feel like a spectator unless you arent doing anything
gaming,not_removed,play overwatch if you feel like youre spectating as support then youre doing something wrong
gaming,not_removed,it is if you squint real hard
gaming,not_removed,its so tilting sometimes adc goes and v turret dives then types report support now follow we are the forgotten heros of gaming
gaming,not_removed,¯ツ¯
gaming,not_removed,haha i stopped there as well my lock was green with envy or maybe he was just green with being an orc im not sure
gaming,not_removed,i felt the same as the healer having the group rely on me to win felt great i just liked healing though i was probably my guilds best or second best healer depending on the fight id essentially soloheal there was a second healer but their heals were always below the shadow priests i assume no one checked the heal charts they just assumed we were both doing well if everyone lived
gaming,not_removed,pvp seems so much better for support if you heal people are glad you exist and the only expectation for a tank is to get stuck guarding a node sometimes tanking in pve seems dumb to me though open a target of target window on the big baddie guardshield that person taunt when somebody else has a minor fuck up and get blamed when that happens too often or in pvp you can just be a wrecking ball just causing chaos fucking huttball its been years since i played
gaming,not_removed,i found the lack of cd management makes him so active you can make split second decisions every decision to each his own though i just thought you might like him
gaming,not_removed,this man truly understands
gaming,not_removed,i find less toxicity in ranked games than in normal games in lol rocket league overwatch the only exception might be fifa i got tons of toxicity in csgo but i m bad at it and dont invest time in it so it might be because of the elo
gaming,not_removed,some of us have rather full days and get maybe an hour and a half to do something we want at the end of the day usually while cleaning or doing laundry on the side thats maybe two games it raises the stakes for that game whatever the mode then on top of that you invariably get assholes playing for fun that wont surrender almost certain losses they helped create by trying something newdifferentjust dicking around in the junglepermafarming lane while we lose matchups mid for fun so youre stuck burning away that precious time you dont feel like giving a game then play a bot match
gaming,not_removed,oh oka hey wait a minute
gaming,not_removed,da duq
gaming,not_removed,no i dont mind them being called buttons it makes sense
gaming,not_removed,maybe spectator isnt quite the right word but it definitely feels like im not really playing it kind of feels more like being a facilitator for other peoples fun not playing myself
gaming,not_removed,ive posted this elsewhere but its relevant here too maybe spectator isnt quite the right word but it definitely feels like im not really playing it kind of feels more like being a facilitator for other peoples fun not playing myself
gaming,not_removed,i like to mess with them by allowing to almost die and then heal them back up so theyd appreciate my presence more though i remember how in hots with tyrande i solo took one lane and destroyed the core because other team members were doing i dont even know what though it was still in beta and most of them didnt really knew how to play at least i hope that was the case and not that they just suck so yeah tell me again how support is useless p
gaming,not_removed,oh yeah i do dont get me wrong
gaming,not_removed,that guy wins
gaming,not_removed,mobas are games you play to remind yourself how miserable you can be youre not supposed to enjoy it youre supposed be angry
gaming,not_removed,what this time i said it right havent i
gaming,not_removed,i really think that if you feel like that in overwatch youre not playing good support
gaming,not_removed,i dont think you get what i mean im not saying that support classes sit around doing nothing they do plenty of buffing healing debuffing positioning etc its just that for me these are aspects of games which are necessary but not fun i much prefer shooting people which brings me back to the original point the person at the top of this subthread was saying that they enjoy winning more than getting kills i just play shooters to shoot people winning is nice but id rather lose and have fun than win by doing tasks i consider boring
gaming,not_removed,munches popcorn maybe apologise for your mistake
gaming,not_removed,and my point is if all youre doing as support is healing people youre not playing support right all of the supports in ow can and should take a very active playing and shooting role many people playing mercy dont do this but the good ones do personally i want to win all of the classes are as fun as you make them theres a reason ow doesnt show everyone a kd scoreboard because kills dont win games to be honest you could have just said you enjoy getting frags over winning and we wouldnt have had this thread i actually find reaper and soldier to be the most boring possible heros in the game
gaming,not_removed,to be honest you could have just said you enjoy getting frags over winning and we wouldnt have had this thread um i did your replying to that message is what started this thread everything else in this thread has been me clarifying this point and you going on about overwatch
gaming,not_removed,skyrim witcher
gaming,not_removed,it really depends on your game style preference civilization is one game it basically coined the phrase just one more turn and that was hours ago each game is different with random world generation difficulty changes scenarios and you can even change game length but you might not like turn based games rimworld is a fairly new and popular colony management game you start the game with a minimal amount of people and resources and have to build to surviveescape the plant you have crashed on real time instead of turn based and you have to deal with random eventsattacksetc you could also look into rts games plenty of those around pick a flavour of scifi fantasy modern or what have you and go from there do the story campaign skirmish with ai or do multiplayer online what about sports games your typical fifa nhl nba nfl etc pick your favourite team and take them through a season or start in a low team and work your way up or rpg type games those can be all sorts from turn based battles real time battles to fpsstyle rpgs think mass effect fallout skyrim etc which focus more on the story side of things its a hard question to answer there are many games out there of varying types and it all comes down to what you personally like
gaming,not_removed,ark survival evolved you wont need another game for at least a year that is all
gaming,not_removed,minecraft can get really addicting when you let that imaginative mind of yours take over the controls no pun intended
gaming,not_removed,kerbal space program if your into nasa missions
gaming,not_removed,witcher and remastered
gaming,not_removed,i would suggest overwatch you can master a character and move onto another one and it feels like a different game its very fun and highly polished
gaming,not_removed,put like into skyrim and ran out of builds to play lol never picked up witcher
gaming,not_removed,thanks for the comment story games are kind of washed up for me skyrim and fallout i both dropped hours into and decided i had enough for what they offered mods as well sports games i enjoy to a certain point i enjoy them with friends and family but when it comes to something i can comfortably play by myselfwith others it doesnt really hit that g spot for me turn based games are alright for me ive played some hearthstone in my day but nothing other than that in terms of turn based gaming enless you count yugioh as a kid i know it usually comes down to what i personally like but at this moment in my gaming life i honestly dont know what i like anymore i just want a game that i can play and have fun in even if it means im raging at the screen just want to drop hours in to it and keep my attention for more than an hour
gaming,not_removed,i dropped so many hours in minecraft hunger games and raid servers like years ago lol
gaming,not_removed,skyrim and fallout are both fairly open games yes there is a story but you can ignore it if you want mass effect is different in that it is a story that you follow with fighting and decisions along the way the first game is a bit dated now but certainly cheap and maybe worth a look the gameplay does improve with each release civilization is a different kind of turn based game its both that and cityunit management civ v should be fairly cheap by now id recommend giving that a go instead of shelling out for the new civ vi i forgot to mention simulation games racing air combat etc not typically my game so cant recommend many there good luck hope something sparks an interest for you
gaming,not_removed,thanks for the help really means a lot
gaming,not_removed,hmm
gaming,not_removed,i havent seen one of these kid trolling videos since stop trying to to revive something that is dead and unfunny
gaming,not_removed,too many controls for a controller same reasons as starcraft
gaming,not_removed,no idea
gaming,not_removed,i imagine its too advanced for the both in terms of cpu and controls
gaming,not_removed,once keyboard and mouse become standard equipment for owners and there is a large base of console players willing to buy rts games i could see it happening but not a moment before then
gaming,not_removed,starcraft was on the im just saying its possible
gaming,not_removed,i didnt mean to type like that it just came out that way when i pressed submit it was in all caps which i also couldnt understand
gaming,not_removed,standard as in what the supports both its up to the dev to include support for their game
gaming,not_removed,but that was made specifically for the not for pc and ported over they made the whole game based off the control scheme and i just dont see how it would work also total war is more complicated than starcraft anyways
gaming,not_removed,its just a joke relax
gaming,not_removed,i was just saying that starcraft was on consoles thats all
gaming,not_removed,devil may cry is definitely more in line with bayonetta than dmc
gaming,not_removed,devil may cry is a superb game is more stand alone then dmc as it introducing nero a new playable character the game plays more like devil may cry which is one of the top voted game in the series i would recommend devil may cry as it is one of my all time favorite games happy hunting
gaming,not_removed,save them to the cloud on
gaming,not_removed,no because they do not want modding and save tampering to happen on the xbox one like it did on the
gaming,not_removed,nope i dont like that how they did that either because muh achievements we cant have people modding save files or anything even though theres valid reasons like games not coming with cheat codes or anything anymore
gaming,not_removed,the maniacs in the mailbox
gaming,not_removed,theres something creepy about the fact that hes on all fours i like it ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
gaming,not_removed,this is actually a pretty cool stop my favorite stop is my local retro game stop location its called the last game store located in halifax nova scotia it doubles as a pokestop and gym and the owner of the shop was so into the pokestop idea he hooked up charging stations for people and even hooked up free wifi for when the power is on in the shop
gaming,not_removed,how is this not spongebox mailpants
gaming,not_removed,is there a way to submit possible pokéstops in more rural areas its sometimes hard to find any so a submit form of sorts would be nice for gamers outside large cities edit found the suggestions for new portalspokéstops is currently halted
gaming,not_removed,so you like delivering mail
gaming,not_removed,my favorite in my area is three small statues of a koala a panda and a gorilla on a playground guess they were desperate for landmarks
gaming,not_removed,i saw one like that on my trip to dc outside of the air space museum yeah
gaming,not_removed,one is my favorite
gaming,not_removed,we have a pokestop naimed heavy load and its a picture of a statues ballz tru story
gaming,not_removed,dont you have an essay to write
gaming,not_removed,we have this really modern looking children playground called medieval torture device
gaming,not_removed,i have one in my area that is the mellow mushroom man statue the rest are churches
gaming,not_removed,is this in dc
gaming,not_removed,httpsslimgmnklqo not far from rockefeller center in new york city sorry for potato quality it is an older picture that i took
gaming,not_removed,right next to my office
gaming,not_removed,is this is orlando florida if so i have a picture of me next to it lol
gaming,not_removed,and i thought i had the only spongebob pokestop httpiimgurcomvlxsscqjpg
gaming,not_removed,poor guy looks like hes got a bullet lodged in his head
gaming,not_removed,who lives in the mailbox under the street
gaming,not_removed,i like how the battery is almost dead i can identify
gaming,not_removed,i remember seeing that in nyc
gaming,not_removed,my favorite is the american flag mural down the street that happens to leave out its a mural painted on the wall of my goto greasy little liquor store i once saw a grown man steal porn there he stuffed a few magazines under his shirt and sprinted out the door the owner ran out to yell fuck you piece of shit then came back to finish ringing up my stuff
gaming,not_removed,what i wanna know is who was able to actually do that isnt painting a mailbox technically defamation of federalstate property
gaming,not_removed,theres one in a town in my area of a memorial of a guy named robert paulsen the pokestops name is his name is robert paulsen it must be left over from the ingress days because i think its pretty weird to have a fight club reference in a pokemon game
gaming,not_removed,charge your phone
gaming,not_removed,there is one in dc too
gaming,not_removed,nice dallas
gaming,not_removed,wait wait there is another one of these there is one on st and in nyc it is right where i walk every day ill see if i can snag a pic of it later but thats kinda cool
gaming,not_removed,dallas tx
gaming,not_removed,hey thats dallas
gaming,not_removed,its across the street from where jfk was assassinated in dallas
gaming,not_removed,no this is patrick
gaming,not_removed,theres one in times square too
gaming,not_removed,people making pokestops like this are the reason we cant make them in rural towns anymore theres a year old church and an even older statue in my town that would be great but you guys picked spongebob mailpants instead
gaming,not_removed,are there people assigning the pokéstops or theyre randomly picked from google maps edit why downvoted it was a genuine question how did this question piss off people
gaming,not_removed,i found the pokes top but the mailbox wasnt there anymore
gaming,not_removed,theres a similar pokestop near me its a bin thats shaped like a giant penguin thing is though its not been there for at least years but the pokestop remains lol
gaming,not_removed,hey i saw that in nyc but i couldnt find the mailbox lol
gaming,not_removed,theres one at a cemetery near me where you get to spin a statue of jesus in a circle i swear thats what keeps me playing
gaming,not_removed,theres a pokes top just called spongebob in budapest that i saw last night i was super confused
gaming,not_removed,wheres spongebob weed pants
gaming,not_removed,classic
gaming,not_removed,spongebox come on guys
gaming,not_removed,my favorite is the zanzibar strip club in downtown toronto its labeled as neon sign or something
gaming,not_removed,spongebox
gaming,not_removed,ohhhhhhhhh who lives on the corner and delivers your mail
gaming,not_removed,chicago
gaming,not_removed,kirkwood missouri has a mailbox just like this thats a
gaming,not_removed,i hope you have a charger on you
gaming,not_removed,super game super game
gaming,not_removed,i showed my girlfriend and she frantically tried spinning it
gaming,not_removed,weeewoooweeewoooweeewooo
gaming,not_removed,hes just standing there menacingly
gaming,not_removed,person spongebob why do you have extra legs spongebob oh these dont mind these ahehehehheheheheh person what are you doing spongebob stop noooooooo
gaming,not_removed,having a pokestop with free wifi at a retro game store has to be so good for that guys business
gaming,not_removed,it puts bread on the table
gaming,not_removed,it certainly helps to hatch a ton of eggs when you walk all day anyway
gaming,not_removed,in my town theres a gym on a statuefountain of otters its pretty cool and its probably my favourite gym i once caught a magikarp that was splashing in there theres also a gym on a statue of a naked lady
gaming,not_removed,i found this one while taking a trip to dallas but thats interesting maybe there is several spongebob mailpants across the country lol
gaming,not_removed,is it bad i tryed to swipe this out of reflex
gaming,not_removed,yep came down to check it out for a few days figured why not do some pokemon hunting while im here too
gaming,not_removed,as far as i known they took over all the locations from their other game ingress there players themselves could suggest locations so to answer you question it was made by the players manually including the photos and descriptions and not randomly picked from a map database or google streetview what was a portal there became a pokéstop in pokémon go including the photo and description but it seems there is currently no way to suggest new locations neither in ingress nor pokémon go
gaming,not_removed,please tell me its called binguin
gaming,not_removed,you replied to him you dont have to tag him
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,it has helped the owner gain a lot of extra traffic thats for sure i think it has helped with sales as well but im not sure to what extent because there is clear crowds that dont buy things but i think a good amount still try to spend money at the local business
gaming,not_removed,rye or pumpernickel
gaming,not_removed,theres one at navy pier in chicago too
gaming,not_removed,there was one just off times square in new york definitely multiple and it looks like they all have the exact same namephoto too
gaming,not_removed,theres one in times square at least the pokestop is i couldnt find the actual box just stayed there for a week came to say ive seen it too
gaming,not_removed,theres one of these in the postal museum in dc right across the street from union station
gaming,not_removed,there are there is one n boston by the aquarium
gaming,not_removed,pretty sure there is one in orlando too i know i have seen that as a portal in my ingress days
gaming,not_removed,ours is a gym here in torrance
gaming,not_removed,i wonder why they removed it theres nothing there anymore just the stop
gaming,not_removed,nah its just called percy penguin missed opportunity there
gaming,not_removed,free lure with purchase of
gaming,not_removed,dont you have an essay to write
gaming,not_removed,really ive never noticed what is it by
gaming,not_removed,also one at the farmers market in los angeles
gaming,not_removed,it is in times square
gaming,not_removed,you know where the busses go its across the streetish my memory sucks i just know there was a spongeboob mailbox over there
gaming,not_removed,across the street from the fountain by the bubba gump the pokestop has the spongebob mailbox but i didnt see the actual mailbox anywhere
gaming,not_removed,yep i have seen this one
gaming,not_removed,square yep checks out
gaming,not_removed,cool thanks ill see if i can find it next time
gaming,not_removed,oh ok ill see if i can spot it next time i go
gaming,not_removed,is it the people who are unwilling to accept that people will spend their own money however they damn well please without being constantly told not to get over it lol edit and you are a fine example of it too with ark in your game library
gaming,not_removed,you have bought rust shut the hell up
gaming,not_removed,to be fair the beta of for honor was not bad
gaming,not_removed,you spent money on ark and rust i cant take you seriously
gaming,not_removed,soooo as a nonfps gamer i feel like i may be not getting a joke of some kind here
gaming,not_removed,why are they wtf kind of price is that
gaming,not_removed,gg preorderers gg
gaming,not_removed,afaik for honor is a good game whats the deal also to the people shitting on ark ark is a great game thats delivered more than a lot of other ea titles did and theyll continue to deliver
gaming,not_removed,and you are a fine example of it too with ark in your game library and rust
gaming,not_removed,its more that both highlighted games are ubisoft games that havent been released yet ubisoft games tend to be notoriously bad on release but these are in the top sellers list meaning that a lot of people have preordered them anyway
gaming,not_removed,ubihate bandwagon
gaming,not_removed,ye bie
gaming,not_removed,yes id say its worse
gaming,not_removed,ah gotcha
gaming,not_removed,probably
gaming,not_removed,too bad they dont make them at all
gaming,not_removed,what would these sell for now i can imagine you could make a pretty penny just recreating them and putting them on etsy or something
gaming,not_removed,the fallout hardback guidebook looks exactly like the one on the left i never realised thats where they got the design from
gaming,not_removed,i wish i was into pc gaming way back then i didnt get to play them until about or when the hype for was in full swing even though they were dated i just couldnt get enough
gaming,not_removed,i love it
gaming,not_removed,i miss instruction booklets too the original starcraft booklet has amazing black and white drawings by one of the main creators metzen iirc
gaming,not_removed,yeah got the one from first fallout contains pretty handy tips how to survive the apocalypse
gaming,not_removed,i dont have mine anymore i miss them
gaming,not_removed,i have a whole collection from past games and you can see the change in guidesinstruction books over the years in it sad pc games especially used to be huge affairs some of you youngsters will have to take our word for it but let me describe to you the pc game would come in a box approximately the same size as a box of cereala little fattershorter but about that size inside it was mostly empty space save a square for the cd case and then the room for things like these guidesinstructions books and the little stuff they would just include not as part of some special edition just because things like maps posters small pointless miniatures two of my favorite games have the coolest extras alpha centauri included a bigim talking thick book that was essentially a compendium full of actual scientific data on alpha centauriwhat was known at the time combined with game lore short stories etc neverwinter nights included what was essentailly a dumbed downquick start version of a complete dnd rulebook huge thick explaining spells rolls stats the whole yards there have been other awesome ones but those remain my fave
gaming,not_removed,i miss things like this starcraft and mech warrior had great booklets that came with them
gaming,not_removed,flotation homes and seaweed
gaming,not_removed,still have my starfleet command booklet love it
gaming,not_removed,had a nice one too
gaming,not_removed,knowing the internet you could probably sell both of those for each
gaming,not_removed,you said hard
gaming,not_removed,the original games still overshadow the reboots that had such attention to detail and forethought i also love how they evolved the wasteland between and including characters like thandi
gaming,not_removed,memories the original age of empires was another favorite they had a detailed history of all the civilizations that you can play as
gaming,not_removed,sold
gaming,not_removed,are you years old
gaming,not_removed,hard dicks haha
gaming,not_removed,my love for terry grows every time i see a video thanks for the smiles
gaming,not_removed,they look like a really happy family well anyways im off to spank my kids for touching my pc
gaming,not_removed,i hope they httpsiimgurcomhsrubxnhjpg and stream it
gaming,not_removed,i really hope they reference terrys pc gaming in the new season of brooklyn
gaming,not_removed,you know im not saying anything that others arent already saying but i love this guy more each time i see him i think its the same reason i respect the rock so much the dude is rich famous pretty much the definition of manliness and has every reason to be full of himself instead hes humble friendly earnest and he doesnt take himself too seriously definitely going to watch the twitch
gaming,not_removed,i hope they do the extralives gaming marathon they would bring in so many donations
gaming,not_removed,twitch name
gaming,not_removed,aint the screen to close to the person playing the game
gaming,not_removed,terry is awesome will definitely tune in to see him and his son
gaming,not_removed,camacho for prez of uhmerica
gaming,not_removed,oh sweet jesus i can just imagine the twitch chat already its going to be a sea of trihard
gaming,not_removed,love me some terry crewes as well lol
gaming,not_removed,a genuinely good guy
gaming,not_removed,im so scared that his twitch channel would get huge and would invite trolls his son seems like such a happy kid
gaming,not_removed,terry crews is effortlessly cool and happy all the fucking timei want to be terry
gaming,not_removed,his and his sons smiles are contagious
gaming,not_removed,he sounds like such a cool person
gaming,not_removed,httpsimgflipcomsmemecaptainpicardfacepalmjpg
gaming,not_removed,wait why isnt his son swole as all fuck
gaming,not_removed,god damn it i hate my family
gaming,not_removed,terry crews is one of the only celebrities that i would be legitimately sad if i saw anything happen to him i really enjoy seeing things like this happen
gaming,not_removed,even his sons got the same infectious smile this was really cool to watch
gaming,not_removed,have you seen psycho dad
gaming,not_removed,i would rather they streamed it though
gaming,not_removed,holy fucking shit the terry crews character looks just like him holy fucking shit
gaming,not_removed,lol
gaming,not_removed,no matter how much i want to hate the rock i dont i mean im not a fan but he seems aight
gaming,not_removed,tinyterry s
gaming,not_removed,bump
gaming,not_removed,actually it will literally be months old on october
gaming,not_removed,scary terry smash that follow button bitch
gaming,not_removed,i would have thought that would be taken already
gaming,not_removed,there has been no update since except for upgraded monitors and going to sli just hope he updates and follows through with the strim
gaming,not_removed,that is not borderlands that is the tech demo they showed
gaming,not_removed,i wasnt prepared to be this hard this early in the morning
gaming,not_removed,more tiny tina please
gaming,not_removed,lets hope it sucks less than presequel
gaming,not_removed,what youre about to see is not a videogame
gaming,not_removed,its a tech demo pre alpha state pre game state game
gaming,not_removed,except if its ea then itd be like pregame state dlc p
gaming,not_removed,luckily it isnt
gaming,not_removed,well im reallyreallyreally hoping andromeda is going to turn out just fine
gaming,not_removed,while its a great picture we shouldnt pretend things that arent true courtesy of uzgoodz and to quote a post from there thanks to utehvolcanic a less honest redditor would probably title this check out this painting my gf made of my skyrim character
gaming,not_removed,holy crap that looks familiar
gaming,not_removed,this exact picture was posted by someone else earlier saying he took this picture with his phone to send to a friend and it came out looking like a painting sooo this is pretty awkward for you
gaming,not_removed,lightly armored means light on your feet smart
gaming,not_removed,repost
gaming,not_removed,very cool picture but curious whats with the blade fingers have i not come across these yet mind you im only level
gaming,not_removed,now get her to do one of your wwe character the one that everyone does with disproportionate features
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,not even close
gaming,not_removed,marry her
gaming,not_removed,screenshot and apply filters painting
gaming,not_removed,the hero reddit needs but doesnt deserve
gaming,not_removed,it was a social experiment
gaming,not_removed,its called a social expirament 😂😂😜
gaming,not_removed,theyre not fingers its just part of the elven chest armor they help to protect your knees from arrows
gaming,not_removed,not real bruv sorry to burst your bubble
gaming,not_removed,just a prank bro like the thousands of other karma whores who do this right
gaming,not_removed,no worries pal just repost it with absolutely no changes after a day passes and youll rake in that free rgaming style karma
gaming,not_removed,dude no dont be immature stop watching cancerous youtube channels too
gaming,not_removed,its called a fail and you should feck off
gaming,not_removed,your bad
gaming,not_removed,i used to be an adventurer
gaming,not_removed,then i took armor and protected my knee from arrows
gaming,not_removed,thanks
gaming,not_removed,is that just another way of saying you own a wrench
gaming,not_removed,how juvenile is this i cracked though
gaming,not_removed,what the fuck
gaming,not_removed,best part was the lady shooing him away
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,drugs are bad mmmkay
gaming,not_removed,hey its fire flower season you dont want some green clothed punk ruining a good crop
gaming,not_removed,ive been playtesting on the for about a month and its been a very sturdy controller i havent noticed any wear on the controllers analog sticks httpimgurcomjxldunm
gaming,not_removed,was hoping hed be bald and taller dont really see much of a resemblance other than a few high kicks
gaming,not_removed,i heard they based him off a similarly undefeated but long retired cage fighter name iron fist
gaming,not_removed,yeah capcom took a lot of artistic license when they made him
gaming,not_removed,thats interesting where did you you hear this from
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,not sure how i feel about it being years later that seems like too long
gaming,not_removed,hmmm so if asari live for years then it should be possible to run into not only liara but her shepards cavalcade of little asaris too excellent
gaming,not_removed,years since not since mass effect
gaming,not_removed,why not make it years into the future so the asari characters are still alive right
gaming,not_removed,thats pretty cool i like that theyre not really making a sequel just another game in the canon universe
gaming,not_removed,in other words all choices dont matter except that of which to pass on this game or buy at launch full game will likely run to id wager plus those multiplayer microtrans dont forget thoe
gaming,not_removed,i really hope they go deeeeeep into every race in the galaxy i want to be able to play as any race as well
gaming,not_removed,thats what i thought but the article seems to convey that it was years from so i went by it thanks for clarifying though
gaming,not_removed,yup sometimes i feel that even halo might do well with this treatment after all its getting a bit stale in my opinion but anyway aslong as the story and characters are good ill play it lets hope that this one strikes the right chords
gaming,not_removed,its new to me man
gaming,not_removed,i ate chips or fries in a bar once id finished ignis chimed in with ive come up with a new recipe
gaming,not_removed,every damn time
gaming,not_removed,this is one of the recurring moments that drives me up the wall when every thing stops and i have to watch him do this if it was every recipes or so it wouldnt bother me but every fucking time
gaming,not_removed,more tired of his warning me to not drive at night every time i attempt to
gaming,not_removed,he makes me so mad when we are out exploring and i hear thats it then the camera pans over to him and its about a new recipe lol
gaming,not_removed,oh yeah well how bout him just glancing at someones dish theyre eating and coming up with the recipe scumbag i think not
gaming,not_removed,id be fine with it if he didnt say recipe in the most annoying way ever in any game actually id be fine if ignis would just be quiet for the whole game his voice just grates rant over
gaming,not_removed,i love his voice
gaming,not_removed,lol i love how he says it its so goofy
gaming,not_removed,youre getting downvoted but i completely agree about how he says recipe
gaming,not_removed,goddamn you thats my favorite song on there and i havent been able to crack global yet a very close regional though
gaming,not_removed,im confused you realize that the games are free but you can buy booster packs gold etc right
gaming,not_removed,going by the number of fuckwits whove posted it without actually clicking the damn things no youre not
gaming,not_removed,not at all its obvious that games have to survive on content that is optional but priced this is a great method to advertise the game and some of the pay content at the same time due to the sale
gaming,not_removed,exactly op is a moron just like the other identical posts of this
gaming,not_removed,theres a sale on content for games thats really easy to understand
gaming,not_removed,gta san andreas

gaming,not_removed,i walk through the desert with a horse with no name
gaming,not_removed,thats how it always went in my group others would buy the doors while i horded my sheckles for the box
gaming,not_removed,i somewhat disagree while games may not be as creative as they used to theres still a ton of fantastic games out there
gaming,not_removed,i preferred degeneration x
gaming,not_removed,what pokemon
gaming,not_removed,what on earth is generation five and six generation of what
gaming,not_removed,i lold
gaming,not_removed,consoles
gaming,not_removed,im pretty excited to see what yooka laylee is like sonic mania also looks good
gaming,not_removed,the long dark its an apocalyptic game thats not very mainstream but its so beautiful and cool
gaming,not_removed,bad rats
gaming,not_removed,this is the first steam sale i didnt buy nothing it lost its cool factor idk i guess i still have a backlog
gaming,not_removed,dying light
gaming,not_removed,couldve been worse you couldve gotten mostly harmless and lemming award
gaming,not_removed,i always expected a game like no mans sky to fail from overambition making a game with the sort of scale is an ambitious project even for major aaa studios should anyone be surprised that hello games studio of devs wasnt able to pull it off
gaming,not_removed,im sad for the devs of this game while i personally never had any interest in this game i know the devs were supercommitted and pretty transparent about what was going on the whole time even through delays they told people what to expect and people started filling in the details with what they wanted and everyones now disappointed that it didnt reach those expectations now the devs are getting screwed on fan reception even though they are delivering what they said they would
gaming,not_removed,surprise surprise after destiny i learned the hard way to never buy into the hype again
gaming,not_removed,no game can meet the expectations of gamers these days until we have affordable quantum computing and real life graphics there will always be complaints
gaming,not_removed,well duh ive been telling people for ages star citizen too cancel your preorders
gaming,not_removed,thats funny im interested in it at a much lower price but for i know im not getting my moneys worth out of it obviously my own gaming preferenceexpectation
gaming,not_removed,unlike most people i still think itll be really good maybe im trying to cling to anything thatll make the game good but i really wasnt too hyped for it based on what was given the guy who started this had great positives theres most likely going to be a day one patch and this was just hope the pc version works im also not disappointed by the hours of gameplay to the center thats if you rush it there are skyrim speed runs that are less than minutes and thats for the story which nms doesnt have then theres the rest of the world to explore in which i happily invested a total of hours on all platforms this game has a whole universe
gaming,not_removed,shills aside everyone with half a brain and anyone with a complete brain would know this game is shitty and not enjoyable in its current state and the idea as a whole just doesnt work
gaming,not_removed,i dont think its a matter of pulling it off i think the entire thing is this has been talked about for so long that it just overly hyped it up
gaming,not_removed,the biggest tell would be how they have failed to just release a demo or beta and kept things quiet
gaming,not_removed,even then therell be complaints at least its the vocal minority i would imagine most people who enjoy the game just keep quiet and enjoy it to themselves
gaming,not_removed,mostly this i carefully followed no mans sky for the past year hoping itll be good but definitely not believing itll be the ultimate game to end all games the leak because it was genuine and unedited was the first thing to get me excited about it not disappointed because it didnt meet outlandish criteria x and y it finally showed what the game is and can be not what us outside observers have to interpret into the devs cryptic descriptions the skyrim analogy is apt its one of the things i immediately thought of as well you dont even need to go to speedruns for the argument skyrim sucks if you just do the main quest and possibly discover one of the broken things about smithingenchanting along the way my other thought was minecraft procedurally generated endless mining and upgradingcrafting to do but minecraft also has an endgame or several by now afaik not played it in years is getting quickly to the enderdragon or that underwater thingy quickly a crap time to be had in minecraft is it all players do all day long no they really have gone a bit mad over there i still want it to be good and hoping the pc version is up to par until then ill continue to read snippets among the madness which from outside is ultimately amusing too
gaming,not_removed,its probably a decent enough game just the hype train pushed everyones expectations way too high
gaming,not_removed,and its completely the devs fault they kept people in a dark for no reason only released bits and pieces that didnt tell anybody anything and talked about their game like its the second comming of jesus christ serves them right im glad that random people and twitch streamers are leaking the gameplay before the release people should be able to know that this is just another busywork sandbox not a revolutionary experience
gaming,not_removed,this is blatantly false hahaha there were plenty interviews and game play sessions that gave overview of all the features available in the game the problem is the community who projected their expectations as to what the game was if you actually looked at this guys comments btw you would see that it delivers in everything the developers promised it would but people who have expectations that this is going to have amazing combat or dog fighting will be let down he said it delivers in immersion visuals and most importantly exploration

gaming,not_removed,ill be getting a later this year so thanks for the info
gaming,not_removed,k ill get that played some nv before and it was a blast
gaming,not_removed,get a xl youll thank me when you get it a normal is just ridiculously small
gaming,not_removed,i am getting a xl so yeah good
gaming,not_removed,an xbox one
gaming,not_removed,buy
gaming,not_removed,no need for an xbox one for me atm because i got a pc pc has been getting a lot of games why i got an over an i might buy the someday but now is not that time for me
gaming,not_removed,i got a but only games i got more on the way
gaming,not_removed,want to elaborate
gaming,not_removed,yeah i dont get it
gaming,not_removed,i have no experience with the mp portion of the game but for the sp portion its absolutely worth that price i got it for a couple months back on xbl and thoroughly enjoyed the campaign
gaming,not_removed,on pc populations arent great and its inferior in most ways to
gaming,not_removed,the multiplayer is fun pretty much same as battlefield four minus tanks and other military related vehicles more of a cops and robbers than a usa vs china still a lot of fun there are some really good levels in the multiplayer the single player is also fun
gaming,not_removed,its good for a laugh but not much else
gaming,not_removed,whats your budget for the laptop
gaming,not_removed,i bought a good asus for casual gaming and for school warranty and everything cost about a grand i wasnt originally going to spend that much but i figured i wouldnt have to upgrade for a while if i did
gaming,not_removed,if you want to max out graphics make sure youll get something with a good gpu graphics card and enough ram laptops with those specs are typically heavier than the typical notebook asus msi are good companies to take a look at
gaming,not_removed,i have a macbook pro with dual boot my company has the byod policy so at work i boot on macos and at home i boot on windows for some gaming its a bit annoying but i didnt pay for the laptop anyways this is an option these casual games run fine on medium without dedicated graphics cards you just need a good gen with a good amount of ram youll be good i guess
gaming,not_removed,im not sure about laptop graphic cards but this seems pretty decent although not sure about the more common manufactures like this is toshiba general cpu intel® core™ processor cache up to operating system windows screen size ips fhd widescreen with led backlit display nit resolution x screen aspect ratio memory storage solid state drive ssd graphics nvidia® geforce® gtx graphics optical disc drive dvdrwsupermulti drive audio combined stereo headphonemic jack sound premium harmankardon® speakers webcam hd webcam with dual array microphones cortana optimized not purchasing this one just thought id see if the graphics card was good enough as the rest seem good enough
gaming,not_removed,rsuggestalaptop will really help
gaming,not_removed,havent decided tbh but i dont particularly want a proper gaming laptop seems though thats my pcs job
gaming,not_removed,thanks ill look into asus
gaming,not_removed,yeah pc is for that stuff mainly just want to be able to game whilst sitting outside with the family so just something that can run the game well maybe on medium settings may push to high though thanks for the company suggestions
gaming,not_removed,thanks yeah not really a fan of mac but thanks for listing what i should be looking out for
gaming,not_removed,thank you so much wasnt sure where to look
gaming,not_removed,i dont like sand its coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere so how about we blow it the fuck up
gaming,not_removed,wow are you going to be releasing this for download anytime soon how much would you charge for it
gaming,not_removed,you two should team up
gaming,not_removed,now correct me if im wrong but it looks like the mirv shot just creates more of the same object which create more of the same with no cut off point i kinda want to see the next seconds if it just craps on your computer with explosionssecond
gaming,not_removed,now kiss
gaming,not_removed,purdy cluster boom me likey
gaming,not_removed,destructible environment please
gaming,not_removed,now if only the sand turned into a lake of molten glass
gaming,not_removed,those explosions are pretty
gaming,not_removed,that explosion makes me want another scorched earth
gaming,not_removed,the cluster bomb that never stops clustering genius
gaming,not_removed,what ever that tank is firing i want a case
gaming,not_removed,this is fine everything is fine
gaming,not_removed,essentially make that tanks online game with the massive variety of shots but in this play style and id but it
gaming,not_removed,indie tank games so hot right now
gaming,not_removed,a realtime scorched earth
gaming,not_removed,you and that other dude should team up you have graphics and effects sorted pretty well but your gameplay seems a bit rudimentary that other guy has gameplay down but he has almost no graphical effects as of yet
gaming,not_removed,then you get even smaller sand
gaming,not_removed,hoping to submit it to steam greenlight later this month just finishing off some maps and game modes and fixing some bugs price wise i have no idea probably under though
gaming,not_removed,i think last guy was on unity and this guy is on the unreal engine
gaming,not_removed,tank tag team think about it
gaming,not_removed,yeah the number was increasing exponentially my computer didnt last for another seconds haha
gaming,not_removed,fuck yes seconded
gaming,not_removed,uh yes dirt pile as a defensive weapon would be sweet or trapping the other in a crator and than dropping bouncy stuff in
gaming,not_removed,sandier sand

gaming,not_removed,i currently have it at but its not a set limit im still finding a balance between performance and good game play etc
gaming,not_removed,hoping to submit it to steam greenlight later this month
gaming,not_removed,you are correct there havent got a website up yet but im hoping to sort that out in the next few days
gaming,not_removed,well excusssssssssssssse me
gaming,not_removed,we know
gaming,not_removed,so basically loz themed heman
gaming,not_removed,and it was terrible they made link out to be a narcissistic jerk with an awful catch phrase the mario bros cartoon was decent though
gaming,not_removed,you know we had reasons to forget about it
gaming,not_removed,my boy
gaming,not_removed,princess
gaming,not_removed,i just want to remind everyone there was the cdi games
gaming,not_removed,dont frame them play them
gaming,not_removed,uo renaissance brings a tear to my eye
gaming,not_removed,oh the humanity and all the astronauts
gaming,not_removed,no games for me today looks at labtop labtop boots up game
gaming,not_removed,it probably also breaks down if you look at it for too long i bought an alienware laptop years ago worst decision of my life
gaming,not_removed,since i dont know who shodan is probably not
gaming,not_removed,shodan has been overshadowed by glados as the famous ai villain these days really so no i wouldnt say so at all ss being old as fuck doesnt help much
gaming,not_removed,only with the older generations really after all there hasnt been a new system shock in years now
gaming,not_removed,id call sniper wolf from the metal gear series a better villain tbh but thats cos sniper wolf is awesome
gaming,not_removed,best villains sure famous no
gaming,not_removed,no games that are older than system shock have villains more famous than shodan bowser is a villain every gamer and many nongamers knows who bowser is
gaming,not_removed,who
gaming,not_removed,you can call him that but youd be wrong
gaming,not_removed,we cant
gaming,not_removed,dracula from castlevania
gaming,not_removed,anyone who is looking for a subreddit to find news information on dead rising well having level headed discussions about the dead rising series check out runofficialdeadrising if by level headed you mean saying youre right and everyone else is wrong all the time then yes that is exactly what people will find from a sub ran by you you had to make your own sub because you just piss on people at rdeadrising where people enjoy talking about the game until you ruin it
gaming,not_removed,neither its simply action
gaming,not_removed,im a gamer i go to many gaming subs i cant stop seeing his posts lol
gaming,not_removed,honestly the way mobile games work you can only make so many actions per an allotted time unless you pay for more or you must wait long periods of time for actions to complete unless you pay
gaming,not_removed,all of cod
gaming,not_removed,when the dlc offers only cosmetics
gaming,not_removed,battlefield is just as bad destiny is worse
gaming,not_removed,surely thats the best kind because it means you dont have to pay to play more of the game
gaming,not_removed,what thats the best kind of dlc
gaming,not_removed,that must have taken some time to complete
gaming,not_removed,glad im not the only one who does this
gaming,not_removed,yes
gaming,not_removed,hopefully they get the servers right this time online was a shit show of dcs and lag on the first
gaming,not_removed,and hopefully the return of dumplin and his fuckbox as well
gaming,not_removed,sooner than expected and it looks so smooth
gaming,not_removed,stop i dont think anyone cares let alone it being post worthy
gaming,not_removed,this assumes youtube wont fuck him with a great subscriber purge again maybe an even bigger one this time
gaming,not_removed,you think youtube will survive the internet blacklist scheduled next year
gaming,not_removed,hopefully
gaming,not_removed,i dont know i dont care ive never watched this dude
gaming,not_removed,i personally think pewdiepie is a douche and southpark confirmed that
gaming,not_removed,why is this on rgaming
gaming,not_removed,agreed why the fuck do people care about these people
gaming,not_removed,i think it will
gaming,not_removed,well because pewdiepie is arguably the most influential gamer who has ever lived whether you like him or hate him he paved the way for thousands of people imagine if you were to think when youtube first started that a gamer would have over million subscribers himself its some fascinating stuff
gaming,not_removed,ideally it would be a firm at the beginning of but i would be satisfied if it were
gaming,not_removed,paved the way wtf are you talking about there were numerous people who started doing game review and gaming videos long before pewdiepie even existed avgn pat the nes punk to name a few hes so annoying screaming text on the screen flashing people act like him and markiplier are so goddamn funny and entertainingnewsflash they are not
gaming,not_removed,i dont think ive ever watched one video of his you might like him and thats cool man but plz stop overy crediting for an industry that was well on its way before this guy
gaming,not_removed,no he is just loved by children or manchildren people with half a brain dont give a fuck about youtube stars
gaming,not_removed,print publication existed well before this guy and thats what i credit for making the industry legit gamepro ps magazine game informer pc gaming nintendo magazine foundations like the gdc are the real contributors this is a guy on youtube
gaming,not_removed,tbh im not really a fan of his either but how many gamers came after him and are now able to make a living because of his influence he certainly isnt a gift to the gaming community or is considered a competitive level gamer but he made it conceivable for an average guy who likes playing games occasionally to make a really good living from doing so that in itself is respectable imo what other gamers are breaking into the actual mainstream the dude is getting invited to legit talk showsas a gamer has that ever been done before
gaming,not_removed,permanent night time zombie survival would be so cool looting all the insides of the buildings some good enemy mods would make it crazy fun
gaming,not_removed,blew up two cars at once while sandwiched in the middle guess i had no place to go but down
gaming,not_removed,unfortunately her natural crosshair and minimap served no use
gaming,not_removed,my battlefield has also been like this for a while i havent bothered reinstalling it anyone have a clue why it did this im on xbone
gaming,not_removed,toggle on and off the weapon dof setting it will fix it
gaming,not_removed,someone in the comments had a fix to toggle on and off the weapon dofnot dog stupid autocorrect setting and it will fix
gaming,not_removed,classics like sonic streets of rage new stuff bastion civilization
gaming,not_removed,anything from fallout

gaming,not_removed,no man its rngaben
gaming,not_removed,you see killed by maga i see more winning
gaming,not_removed,i dont always speak but when i do die die die
gaming,not_removed,made a meme with a friend thought id share it and see if it catches on there is a blank in there too for others to go at it too if they want
gaming,not_removed,its a joke on how edgy reaper is lots of characters actually jest about how hard hes trying to be edgy interactions between reaper and other heroes soldier well you sure take to this bad guy thing easily dont ya reaper and you sure know how to play boy scout reaper poor winston has to hide away so he doesnt scare the children winston i dont even think children are afraid of you
gaming,not_removed,httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermedgelord
gaming,not_removed,actually i think i used httpwwwurbandictionarycomdefinephptermedgy exactly how i meant along with that im pretty sure op meant it the same way
gaming,not_removed,you dont have to get your panties in a twist just cus reaper is your waifu httpswwwredditcomrdrayken
gaming,not_removed,we get it you vape
gaming,not_removed,what the fuck was the point of that
gaming,not_removed,i had more fun collecting and singing the shanty songs than the main plot
gaming,not_removed,i hated most of the story missions i bought this game to be a pirate not to follow people like a detective
gaming,not_removed,the last ac i played
gaming,not_removed,shall i get them out the way if ubisoft made a pirates game it would be amazing just take the game play from this and use it oh man this just brings back memories of sid meyers pirates even the dancing was great i just skipped the boring game play and just sailed around for hours le sea shanties okay all done good see you next time acbf is posted
gaming,not_removed,i like the message at the end of the game though where bobbie sings the parting glass and edward looks over and sees all the friends hes lost in his quest for money not all died as a result of his greed though t would have made for a better narrative if they had but it was touching all the same
gaming,not_removed,why is the rum always gone
gaming,not_removed,i loved the ship battles if ubisoft took that part and made a pirate game with raiding ports etc id preorder it as soon as i possibly could
gaming,not_removed,god i love this game but it broke my heart i sunk about hours into my first game game save corrupted another on a new game and bam corrupted again hours into the third and yet another crash and corruption almost put my fist through the monitor i was so mad uninstalled it there and then and havent touched it since
gaming,not_removed,is this game worth playing through for someone who loves pirate stuff but hasnt been interested in ac franchise since ac brotherhood does it work as a standalone game
gaming,not_removed,this is the only open world game that i ever leave her johnny leave her
gaming,not_removed,goddamn i really loved the ship parts of this game if they fleshed it out a bit more id totally buy a game based around this
gaming,not_removed,i completed about didnt bother taking down those goliath gigantic ships except one i think only some collectables were remaining
gaming,not_removed,this game was at its best when it was a pirate game and at its worst when it tried to be an ac game
gaming,not_removed,best game ever
gaming,not_removed,do me johnnie walker do
gaming,not_removed,by far and away the best ac game i have ever played it got me to sink money into unity which i didnt really care for
gaming,not_removed,they should cut the future animus part out the series retcon that shit who cares about it it is about as welcome as commercial breaks in a movie
gaming,not_removed,i liked this game when i was on the boat
gaming,not_removed,what year is it
gaming,not_removed,mah ship was fucking tank
gaming,not_removed,just rum fuck that waste of time
gaming,not_removed,if you guys like this check out blackwake team based pirate game
gaming,not_removed,were homeward bound to liverpool town goodbye fare thee well goodbye fare thee well
gaming,not_removed,the problem i had with the game is that it is the best pirate simulator i have played that gets interrupted by some bullshit in the future they could have just made this a standalone pirate game and left out the normal assassins creed future parts and the game would have been better imo i just want to loot some ships and catch some whales without breaking the immersion and learning about the day to day of a video game developer or whatever that plot was
gaming,not_removed,o bennie riley o bennie riley
gaming,not_removed,the assassin missions were pretty tragic but i enjoyed the pirate stuff with blackbeard and whatnot however when youre stranded on the island thats a piss take
gaming,not_removed,yea the following was pretty stupid this is more of a pirate game than an ac game and thats why it was so fun also sea shanties ftw
gaming,not_removed,the only ac i finished playing
gaming,not_removed,the only ac i played
gaming,not_removed,youre not wrong walter youre just an asshole
gaming,not_removed,assassins creed black flag
gaming,not_removed,the best ac game
gaming,not_removed,😢
gaming,not_removed,he chose a book for reading
gaming,not_removed,id love that sid meiers pirates on occasion manages to scratch that itch i have for a great pirate game but i really want one that is basically assassins creed black flag but just focused on the piracy mechanics raiding ships upgrading and getting new ships ports exploring for aztecincanmayan treasure capturing towns for whoever you happen to be working for at the time
gaming,not_removed,we shall battle the downvotes riseriseriiiiiiiise
gaming,not_removed,take a look at naval action
gaming,not_removed,pirate stuff is awesome you have to do some boring assassin missions but i loved the rest of it
gaming,not_removed,definitely it doesnt require you to have played previous ones the bigger story is just an afterthought theres only like one city and its tiny the game focuses almost entirely on the pirating
gaming,not_removed,i spent vastly more time sailing the seas and being a pirate than i did anything else it was only meant to be a small part of the game but ended up being legit better than almost every other stand alone pirate game ive ever played
gaming,not_removed,brotherhood was the first i played i liked it
gaming,not_removed,me neither but thats just because the story missions are boring as fuck
gaming,not_removed,those legendary ships were the best part of the naval battles really worth doing
gaming,not_removed,ubisoft should just make a pure pirate game
gaming,not_removed,left out the normal assassins creed future parts dunno if other people feel the same but ive never liked those parts in any ac just felt like some weird plot that had been shoehorned in to make the dull subject of historical assassins s more dynamic dgaf about future dude his great great great great grandpappy is wayyyyy cooler
gaming,not_removed,the only ac worth replaying
gaming,not_removed,its worth going back for and imo especially with the level of difficulty on some bosses in the original still never finished the final boss
gaming,not_removed,dont diss
gaming,not_removed,i liked revelations better but to each his own
gaming,not_removed,i was sort of interested through brotherhood and then by revelations i stopped giving a shit about desmondoutside the animus stuff
gaming,not_removed,in the first assasins creed it was not too bad but as the series goes on and they improve the gameplay and story of the history side of the plot the future aspect just gets worse and worse each time i go back to the scooby gang i groan since i usually had a game plan on what to do next and i totally forget what they were when i go back in time
gaming,not_removed,i am the walrus
gaming,not_removed,third best in my opinion i liked brotherhood only slightly more
gaming,not_removed,this comment needs more rum
gaming,not_removed,fantastic looking game even when you go from high to low graphics on pc there is very little changes love all the specular on batmans suit when it rains especially mixed with the wind creasing the cape at high speeds
gaming,not_removed,just been tackling the final mission think iv basically completed the character showcase im constantly amazed at the graphics even still so good the fact theyre that detailed even whilst grappling with a dozen guys is crazy oh and the batmobile those paint scratches and the accumulating dirt
gaming,not_removed,oh how i love this series
gaming,not_removed,first this is an incredible stupid idea second try borderlands
gaming,not_removed,timesplitters
gaming,not_removed,the companies who own the fictional characters to make the game would have to agree to let a game developing company make it which probably wouldnt happen cause they would be competing also the game developing companies are often owned by entertainment companies so lets say disney owns star wars and viacom owns game of thrones as cool as luke fighting jon snow would be the two parent companies disney and viacom each own or have stake in different game developing companies so it wouldnt be good business for them to make the game disney will let a game company make games that feature a lot of disney characters like kingdom hearts or nintendo and the mario kart games which feature characters nintendo owns occasionally crossover games get made like dc marvel but they are pretty rare and are usually very idk the word genre specific like comic books just examples reddit be thou merciful
gaming,not_removed,skyrim with too many mods
gaming,not_removed,sounds like you should go to school and make a dope all experience inclusive game
gaming,not_removed,the only way this would work is it it was blatantly parody i could see this being a lot of fun but too many licensing issues would plague anything official
gaming,not_removed,star citizen
gaming,not_removed,be thou merciful he he though yea i think competition plays a role in mainstream success getting everyone to agree is harder than it looks
gaming,not_removed,mobile gaming has always been relevant but playing candy crush casually does not compare to playing battlefield one just because you play some casual phone puzzle game doesnt mean your a gamer
gaming,not_removed,oc
gaming,not_removed,seems like you needed more requisition points spartan
gaming,not_removed,spinbot
gaming,not_removed,lol thats great made me chuckle
gaming,not_removed,rgamephysics
gaming,not_removed,evasive maneuvers
gaming,not_removed,i busted out laughing those physics combined with a lucky shot at the end just lolz
gaming,not_removed,the best part about this is the auto aim trying to keep up
gaming,not_removed,you cant tell me what to do ill show you by preordering the disney princess sleepover games and its season pass
gaming,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvjpwycjypswo
gaming,not_removed,the second stage was easier for me because they were less aggresive together
gaming,not_removed,adding desperate for friends in the title really makes me feel sorry for you
gaming,not_removed,dang man go outside get involved in some local after school programs in your town
gaming,not_removed,so add me
gaming,not_removed,its am bro fuck ima go outside for

gaming,not_removed,i just dont want to repurchase it for the unless you convince me its worth it i obviously want to but have no reason to
gaming,not_removed,its only am man wtf why the hell would i be asleep lol
gaming,not_removed,tbh if your happy with your its fine the only benefits of the would be higher quality graphics and i expect a busier multiplayer but then again i might be mistaken
gaming,not_removed,because people usually have school or work in the morning and go to bed at regular times
gaming,not_removed,meh i just started playing gta online and noticed everyone had crews lol idk i guess its good that i have it for the to test the water and not get buyers guilt if i was to purchase for the
gaming,not_removed,it was saturday
gaming,not_removed,youll probably have better luck at the dbd sub and theres a thread on the steam community for the game to help edit i already got my key but it seems i was still able to help you
gaming,not_removed,thanks buddy it worked d
gaming,not_removed,simulator
gaming,not_removed,sky target its a retro arcade game loved it as a kid still do
gaming,not_removed,war thunder is great but you gotta sink a literal fuckload of time into it
gaming,not_removed,try any of the sturmovik franchise they are great games
gaming,not_removed,war thunder is good sim free to play on steam for modern stuff there is digital combat simulator and its proper hardcore with clickable switches in cockpit etc
gaming,not_removed,depends of what you want really if youre looking for arcade games i cant help you except mention war thunder if youre looking for something more serious theres digital combat simulator sturmovik and falcon bms
gaming,not_removed,oh ok were heading that direction cool
gaming,not_removed,why am i not surprised that this is actually a thing
gaming,not_removed,or money you could just throw money at it instead of time
gaming,not_removed,bastion or torbjorn tbh torbjorn is worse hes not even looking at the action most of the time
gaming,not_removed,wow you really must have put a lot of thought into this image macro op
gaming,not_removed,my experience with overwatch is non existent because those twats at blizzard didnt release a linux port
gaming,not_removed,yeah cause his dumb turret does all the work
gaming,not_removed,blizzard games normally run well under wine itll probably have an ideal config posted in a few weeks
gaming,not_removed,but new versions of direct x like the one that overwatch uses dont work well under wine overwatchs current rating at the wine appdb is garbage
gaming,not_removed,huh blizz finally moved away from opengl
gaming,not_removed,nice q
gaming,not_removed,you fucking just made me download something you fucking fuck
gaming,not_removed,what
gaming,not_removed,takes a drink you fucking just made me download something you fucking fuck
gaming,not_removed,ill hit you with my favorites from all the consoles ive owned love to hear yours too gameboy color pokémon gold i remember trading my hooh to my older brothers friend for a noctowl i thought because ash had one in the anime it was better nintendo super smash bros hands down ive played a billion hours of this it seems most of it recently in college gameboy advanced donkey kong adventures this was my go to for every vacation hundreds of hours in the middle seat of my familys van was spent on this game and its the first game i remember fully completing playstation ssx tricky great soundtrack and characters i hated playing against my sister who would never do tricks she would just race down the mountain avoiding everything while id be doing the worm face first into an object xbox halo so many split screen battles full of trash talk during sleepovers playing capture the flag on coagulation i also remember every square inch of zanzibar and ascension nintendo ds lite pokémon platinum this master piece got me back into pokémon intensely i watched you tubers like xenon and mefestofel all day and played showdown with the most basic smogon sets losing most of the time my favorite poke game of all time due to the physicalspecial split xbox gears of war loved horde the campaign and multiplayer so much my favorite gears game easily thanks to many hours in middle school on live felt like a god when i got seriously achievement nintendo xl pokémon y i played through it once and enjoyed it but i never really use my i bought it for smash and was disappointed so id be happy to hear some recommendations on any solid titles pc heroes of might and magic possibly my favorite game of all time i was never even that good i just just felt like it was a pokémon game taking place in a lord of the rings fantasy world so i absolutely loved it i still have the physical copy of the game just no computer capable of playing it so recently ive been play heroes which is also a fantastic game
gaming,not_removed,last of uswitcher
gaming,not_removed,persona golden
gaming,not_removed,for the past couple of months its definitely been overwatch
gaming,not_removed,diablo
gaming,not_removed,assassins creed with all dlc makes the game more wholesome
gaming,not_removed,fallout
gaming,not_removed,legend of zelda majoras mask
gaming,not_removed,destiny
gaming,not_removed,binding of isaac rebirth
gaming,not_removed,super metroid
gaming,not_removed,assasins creed i remember getting the game on christmas after it was all i talked about for months lol come to think of it i was like my parents never shouldve bought me it haha anyways that game blew me away the first time the story of a game completely engrossed me i remember playing all day and until like in the morning
gaming,not_removed,journey
gaming,not_removed,resident evil
gaming,not_removed,either bioshock arkham city or witcher
gaming,not_removed,final fantasy easy
gaming,not_removed,ocarina of time
gaming,not_removed,final fantasy
gaming,not_removed,bioshock
gaming,not_removed,persona golden
gaming,not_removed,the world ends with you
gaming,not_removed,dae le popular game
gaming,not_removed,nice
gaming,not_removed,isnt a weird age to play ac though but i agree was good it was the only ac game ive ever finished
gaming,not_removed,final fantasy great story also fallout and the original starcraft and brood war halo reach is really good too if you know the lore of the halo franchise that is for the ds there is the fire emblem games as for the vita i think you can get crisis core both of which are very story driven i hope this helps
gaming,not_removed,the entire zero escape series is extremely good they are escape the room games mixed with a visual novel so they are super story based and super well done
gaming,not_removed,witcher best
gaming,not_removed,spec ops the line
gaming,not_removed,virtues last reward is on both and vita and is one of my favorite games of all time the game is hugely plot focused and spoilers would ruin a lot of what makes it great and the plot gets pretty complicated with lots of game theory and other sciency concepts like schrodingers cat prisoners dilemma etc the game is technically a sequel to for original ds but you dont have to play first if you dont want to a lot of people might say otherwise but i started with vlr before and liked it just fine the game is rated pretty highly but its kind of a niche game that not a lot of people have played
gaming,not_removed,mass effect series
gaming,not_removed,im doing the various endings for right now dunno if i should grind every ending or just watch them on online great game btw
gaming,not_removed,always heard people say its one of the best games ever made and i never played it maybe i should give it a try
gaming,not_removed,most of the endings are made to be clues for the real endings with some backstory to them so its not as important to get them unlike to sequels vlr and ztd which makes the various ending not as tedious
gaming,not_removed,all three games are pretty dang great second one was meh i was planning on playing through the first one quickly before i moved onto the second but i actually ended up liking it better than the second and wish i spent more time on it witcher is definitely the best of the series and the dlcs are soo worth it witcher was the best of the games but its well worth it to play all of them
gaming,not_removed,happy thoughts no
gaming,not_removed,i mean ive killed for less
gaming,not_removed,no game sucks
gaming,not_removed,no physical editions suck
gaming,not_removed,open beta started almost a month ago visit at rparagon the game is amazing
gaming,not_removed,sweet bxr combo
gaming,not_removed,what if this actually was the evolution of free will and the ai kills him because he saw too much
gaming,not_removed,when gta devs update the game to make it more realistic for current day
gaming,not_removed,were they gang banging in there
gaming,not_removed,repost check same shitty comments that were made last time it was posted check guy in the comments salty about said repost check classic rgaming post
gaming,not_removed,tenpenny equivalentstenpenny equivalents everywhere
gaming,not_removed,the version of pulp fiction where bruce willis fails to save marcellus wallace
gaming,not_removed,well this is awkward
gaming,not_removed,at least he didnt arrest you nothing worse than loosing all the amo
gaming,not_removed,hey look a repost for karma reposts in lul
gaming,not_removed,the hardy boys really are in a jam
gaming,not_removed,bring out the gimp
gaming,not_removed,this liquor store is closed not saying the response was logical but but it does answer why you got star
gaming,not_removed,i think they were more pissed about your terrible choice in work attire that coat man deserves a shotgun to the face
gaming,not_removed,httpiimgurcomxujhlgif
gaming,not_removed,that bald cop that shoots him looks like appsros rage cop from neebs gaming
gaming,not_removed,maybe you shouldnt walk around openly carrying military grade infinite power flashlights
gaming,not_removed,repost
gaming,not_removed,i wonder if thats something that was programmed as an easter egg or something or just a bug
gaming,not_removed,that two piece was flawless
gaming,not_removed,why bother with that with a shotty
gaming,not_removed,doesnt look like anything to me
gaming,not_removed,aww shit i need a gun now
gaming,not_removed,one of those things that should be a bad joke because it is as fucking wrong as it is true
gaming,not_removed,no they where not
gaming,not_removed,and someone reminding us about it check
gaming,not_removed,its not a repost if ive never seen it before
gaming,not_removed,im just unsure what the goal is here people who know its a repost will scroll by and its not like you are being clever or original so whats the point just to try and make people feel shitty big man
gaming,not_removed,fifty of me and this town would be okay
gaming,not_removed,oh look you are getting down voted for the truth
gaming,not_removed,flashlight is a weapon he pointed a weapon at the far cop
gaming,not_removed,freeze all motor functions
gaming,not_removed,sounds like something a synth would say
gaming,not_removed,you have insulted my friends my family and my lifestyle i shall report you to the authorities
gaming,not_removed,because they thought your car looked similiar to a suspects despite it being a different make model type and color not to mention youre an asian woman and theyre looking for a black male but hey reasons
gaming,not_removed,weres youre proof
gaming,not_removed,or so they claim
gaming,not_removed,that would be the guy being salty you see metahumor
gaming,not_removed,not so much truth as it is that some people havent gotten a chance to see this and dont mind the whining about reposting gets annoying if you dont like it just downvote and move on and if we havent seen it well upvote because we enjoyed it
gaming,not_removed,oh well its the internet
gaming,not_removed,you mean like maybe you can swing the flashlight like a baton seems to me a lame rule to apply to flashlights if you illuminate a cop with the flashlight he will observe this as a threat and kill you i dont know if you can point in gta but fists are weapons what if i just look at someone while in possession of hands that guy is armed he literally has arms fire
gaming,not_removed,he smokes michelles dick
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,this is gta you can kill npcs from hit to the head with the flashlight or almost any melee weapon if you even beep your horn at a cop they will shoot you logic flys out the window with gta
gaming,not_removed,sweet
gaming,not_removed,i gave it a try tonight its a fine game but not for me too many automatic weapons too much running around like nuts spawn points are too close together maps too small super class upgrades probably great for most people but i was hoping theyd return to their bf roots
gaming,not_removed,im really enjoying it i think most people have certain distastes toward the game in one way or another
gaming,not_removed,i hear a lot of complaints that its just a reskinned battlefront which in my opinion isnt really a bad thing battlefront while desolate in content was still enjoyable so far the only things i see that are very much the same is the hud and some menus and such the gameplay is pretty fun the sound is very nice and of course the graphics are very nice looking i think the game from what ive played so far could be very good if they go about it well and give it a good amount of content
gaming,not_removed,cue memories of playing crucible on destiny against a shotgun melee combo
gaming,not_removed,this my friends is called multitasking
gaming,not_removed,more like flashbacks
gaming,not_removed,and everyone else thats in a secure or high sensitive location
gaming,not_removed,well pokemon doesnt even show up on military bases in the us unless you use a incense or a lure
gaming,not_removed,no one can play any app that using gps like pogo or ingress in a military base
gaming,not_removed,israelrest of world right about now
gaming,not_removed,apparently the game isnt as friendly as we thought not to be confused with apparently most people are more stupid than we had realized
gaming,not_removed,those jews need to get those sticks out of their asses
gaming,not_removed,this doesnt belong in rgaming
gaming,not_removed,its not secure till you catch all the pokémon
gaming,not_removed,i have been told by atleast people gps gaming apps like ingress and pokemon go are not allowed on base im not sure about running apps and watches
gaming,not_removed,its not that were not allowed its that no pokemon appear at all on base
gaming,not_removed,i think he meant that playing any app which has access to sensitive information on a military base is prohibited and discouraged because of obvious security risks not to mention why the fuck would you be playing a fucking video game while on duty what is this fucking starship troopers
gaming,not_removed,soyoure saying there are absolutely no areas whatsoever for any reason within a military base that could possibly be compromised from an errant picture taken at the wrong timeso i can go in as a civilian and have access to literally every part of the base in israel edit playing on duty also youre saying there is no problem with that
gaming,not_removed,that is exactly what you said zero risk if i recall
gaming,not_removed,uhh no one was debating about whether you could play it or not just really whether or not it was appropriate to do so you obviously dont know much about the israeli military they are pretty one of the most strict most welldisciplined group of armed forces in the world and playing a video game while on duty is essentially one of the most dangerous things they can do
gaming,not_removed,this is so it might as well come with a walkman and a baywatch edition surfboard
gaming,not_removed,what year volvo is that my first real car was a volvo gl door
gaming,not_removed,harambe loved volvos
gaming,not_removed,httpmimgurcomhlnpboor my first thought immediately
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,more likely the repairman hired a cheap graphic designer who ripped off a game the repairmans never heard of
gaming,not_removed,inspired
gaming,not_removed,the fallout guy is in the style of some pretty standard printers character clip art from the
gaming,not_removed,the perspective on that drill is really pissing me off
gaming,not_removed,duvall wa
gaming,not_removed,nice choice going with dewalt driver
gaming,not_removed,hey look its raul
gaming,not_removed,the nick cage version
gaming,not_removed,he also reminds me of walter white
gaming,not_removed,his business should be called mr handy
gaming,not_removed,lawsuit intensifies
gaming,not_removed,thats nothing if nintendo hasnt gotten on in the years since i saw this i would be very surprised
gaming,not_removed,copy paste
gaming,not_removed,welcome to the world of fiverr and
gaming,not_removed,seemingly cheap photoshop too unlike the hair the mustache does not have a black highlight likely just googled mustache went a bit down the list to not look suspect or cheap and just pasted it there
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,todd howard made it himself for his friend who is a repairman in his spare time thats why its not extremely high quality he even secretly hid his initials in the repairmans name by reversing them as ht
gaming,not_removed,they must be a small company this poster may have given them some serious legal troubles though
gaming,not_removed,given that its a pretty clear derivative work then yes
gaming,not_removed,the fallout guy at least you didnt say the fallout boy
gaming,not_removed,and the cycle continues
gaming,not_removed,didnt you know the monopoly guy is totally a fallout ripoff
gaming,not_removed,you can understand now why the shitty graphic designer stole the character all he designed was a pen tool traced drill
gaming,not_removed,a little internet sleuthing the name and the few digits of the phone number we see suggests a company in indiana
gaming,not_removed,this looks more like a sign shop special to me its just the right amount of unpolished
gaming,not_removed,i kind of hope so it makes me cringe whenever i see tacky reuse of other peoples trademarks
gaming,not_removed,the great thing about contracting is that you can fold overnight and be back in business the very next day under a different name the best thing is that all of those first installments that your customers gave you you can keep those without ever coming back to finish the work because technically your company doesnt exist anymore if bethesda gives him trouble he can fold repaint the van and put a super mario bros inspired logo on the side instead for his new company this also works well because as us diehard fans know mario is a plumber by trade so lots of exist on the internet
gaming,not_removed,hes called the pip boy you scrubs
gaming,not_removed,yeah that drill is fucked
gaming,not_removed,i think it is technically legal since it doesnt look like the original one same issue with that game flappy bird if the dev just changed the colors of the pipe to purple it would have been completely legal edit typos
gaming,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiderivativework
gaming,not_removed,as i understand it the basic general principle is if out of people recognize it from its former use it is considered copyright infringement im not sure out of people would recognize the vault boy the way they might a superman symbol for example
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,got stepped on by a deathclaw
gaming,not_removed,with games its even worse because only gamers can really tell when a game is a clone or an inspired work seriously look up some game copy lawsuits the ways they determine whether it is breaking copyright are pathetic
gaming,not_removed,looks like a very obvious httpsenwikipediaorgwikiderivativework
gaming,not_removed,a friend of mine started his own game store a while back and he had sammity sam on his business card he was contacted about months later with a lawsuit to remove it or pay to keep it
gaming,not_removed,thats what i thought until i looked at them side by side and realized its litterally a copy of the picture slightly altered mostly colors and themustache but everything else is identical barring the drill for the thumbs up httpwwwfalloutfactscomothermeaningofvaultboythumbsupjpg you could trace it off the original and add a mustache theyre definitely in trouble of bethesda feels like getting rid of that logo
gaming,not_removed,to my understanding there needs to be a change to avoid copyright so the given examples pass
gaming,not_removed,lol no
gaming,not_removed,its a tracing of the pip boy doing the thumbs up dude anyone can see that they just colored it in differently and gave it a mustache
gaming,not_removed,who is sammity sam every time i google it it just shows me yosemite sam
gaming,not_removed,does the sammity sam on the card look exactly like the on that it was based on
gaming,not_removed,that doesnt sound even remotely right
gaming,not_removed,yo sammity sam
gaming,not_removed,bone app the teeth
gaming,not_removed,yes
gaming,not_removed,uhhh someone needs to learn what game breaking usually means in regards to glitches
gaming,not_removed,infinite exp glitch i dont understand edit makes sense i was downvoted for not understanding the video reddit title says game breaking glitch youtube title says infinite exp and caps glitch the video is just endless dialogue but yeah okay
gaming,not_removed,monitors
gaming,not_removed,hope you cracked open a window cuz what you described sounds great and all but things will start to heat up real quick if you catch my drift not to mention all of the body odor and gas being released
gaming,not_removed,haha you guys came together in the dark immature humour never gets old
gaming,not_removed,may i ask why you guys are playing
gaming,not_removed,youre absolutely right man
gaming,not_removed,and about a quarter of buddha
gaming,not_removed,damn you guys are good haha overwatch witcher spotify just cause total war rome skyrim and fifa
gaming,not_removed,i couldnt agree more this needs to come back no more reclusive hiding away in your room by yourself with your headset on cheers friend
gaming,not_removed,yeah too bad most companies no longer want to support split screen theyd rather sell copies and have you and your friend play at your own houses over voice chat
gaming,not_removed,haha rekt
gaming,not_removed,im guessing left to right doom just cause spotify witcher fifa skyrim
gaming,not_removed,looks like a total war game maybe warhammer
gaming,not_removed,he asked why not what
gaming,not_removed,aim for the bushes
gaming,not_removed,what an escalator feels like after eating an edible
gaming,not_removed,how unrealistic didnt even need to jump just before hitting the ground
gaming,not_removed,wasnt this just posted like two days ago
gaming,not_removed,if not standsonsomething falling true
gaming,not_removed,shameless repost in potato quality classic rgaming
gaming,not_removed,am i just not seeing the license to kill girl in every port connection here
gaming,not_removed,i feel that ive seen this before
gaming,not_removed,i could just hear the music as he was going down da da dada daaa da da
gaming,not_removed,and now i can die at ease knowing ive seen it all
gaming,not_removed,makes an impossible shot and then ends up in a grassy knoll too much coincidence if this occurred on november
gaming,not_removed,tis but a scratch
gaming,not_removed,whats the video version of a jpg

gaming,not_removed,physics bitch
gaming,not_removed,you see ivan if you are stand on solid ground always fall of height is of no concern
gaming,not_removed,could you stop reposting this shit every day please
gaming,not_removed,james bond theme plays in the background
gaming,not_removed,i love reposting its such an easy way to get likes
gaming,not_removed,falling turn camera around this is fine
gaming,not_removed,stupid reposts
gaming,not_removed,battle of reposts
gaming,not_removed,more of terminator then james bond

gaming,not_removed,this is one of my favorite quotes
gaming,not_removed,escalators cant eat stuff ya big goof
gaming,not_removed,as a kid i felt thats all you need to do during a plane crash those stupids
gaming,not_removed,yes and days before that
gaming,not_removed,youd be surprised by how many games use this logic its kind of annoying
gaming,not_removed,link the original post
gaming,not_removed,you didits a repost from like days ago
gaming,not_removed,shit
gaming,not_removed,tell that to my last pair of shoes
gaming,not_removed,the real me irl is in the comments
gaming,not_removed,youve become addicted to peanut butter
gaming,not_removed,asphyxiation is the only skill boost i get
gaming,not_removed,isnt this just rpgs in general or am i missing something beyond the pretty generic rpg stats
gaming,not_removed,but will it cure my wicked case of the rads
gaming,not_removed,is this caffeinated peanut butter why
gaming,not_removed,what kind of pb has caffeine
gaming,not_removed,couldnt that be pretty much any rpg
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,thats probably a reference to dnd
gaming,not_removed,the product i didnt know i wanted until now
gaming,not_removed,thats awesome
gaming,not_removed,its manufactured in the commonwealth
gaming,not_removed,op pb
gaming,not_removed,holy shit is that caffeinated peanut butter
gaming,not_removed,yooooo where did you buy that peanut butter
gaming,not_removed,youre gonna be amped af with caffeine per serving thats like cups of coffee
gaming,not_removed,caffeinated peanut butter where do i get some
gaming,not_removed,of caffeine in peanut butter what the fuck
gaming,not_removed,those stats only apply if used as a suppository
gaming,not_removed,fallout is the only game where food items give stat buffs
gaming,not_removed,to luck worst peanut butter ever
gaming,not_removed,you are now suffering from withdrawal
gaming,not_removed,cant say its never happened
gaming,not_removed,some people pay good money to be asphyxiated
gaming,not_removed,a similar font all caps and the same abbreviations plus the stats come in the right order
gaming,not_removed,i couldnt see anything beyond the stat buff comparison they could be referencing rpgs in general but fallout is very mainstream so broader audiences identify with it i suppose
gaming,not_removed,its called steem and its just another way to get your fix
gaming,not_removed,theyre listed in the special order
gaming,not_removed,ehh most rpgs i can think of off the top of my head use constitution rather than endurance
gaming,not_removed,yeah but luck and endurance are not core dnd stats
gaming,not_removed,that barely gets me to functional
gaming,not_removed,to those specific stats abbreviated in that specific way yes
gaming,not_removed,high luck is good in fallout
gaming,not_removed,your penalty strength decreased accuracy occasional cazador poison sounds revamped decibels
gaming,not_removed,usually they want to limit it to or asphyxiation
gaming,not_removed,also similar values though abnormally high for most stat items in fallout is still a long shot away from rpgs that have stats ranging in the rather than the scale fallout uses
gaming,not_removed,i was skeptical until the order part alright rabbit you convinced me
gaming,not_removed,it could still be just about any rpg dark souls has the same stats in the same order as well in fact pretty much every rpg has those same stats in that same order because of dnd and other classic roleplaying games tabletop rpgs utilized basic stat systems for decades before video games even existed as arcade cabinets
gaming,not_removed,yes but endurance is not a fallout stat its just general rpg
gaming,not_removed,it could even be a dd reference food items giving stat buffs is a pretty big thing in edition
gaming,not_removed,why not just take tablets at that point
gaming,not_removed,endurance is very commmon
gaming,not_removed,it even has it in the fallout special order missing perception charisma and agility also the same abbreviation style
gaming,not_removed,different amounts for different people i guess i go with caffeine pills instead of drinking coffee so i dont fuck up my teeth and usually ill feel it more but i gotta take breaks over the weekend or my tolerence could get crazy and theyre not as effective anymore some people get addicted and literally take mg a day and they hate it
gaming,not_removed,wow til that fallout is the only game to have a number and then a bold abbreviation for strength agility ect
gaming,not_removed,would you buy the peanut butter that had high stats or low stats case closed
gaming,not_removed,most rpgs only use high stats for later tier gear beginning items are typically under i wouldn consider peanut butter a low tier item so it seems fitting then again i also thinking concluding theyre a fan of fallout is quite a jump even if it is in the special order those are all stats commonly found in rpgs very cool nevertheless
gaming,not_removed,but it is fallout stat
gaming,not_removed,uh you httpfalloutwikiacomwikiendurance about that
gaming,not_removed,dnd doesnt have endurance as one of the core stats neither is luckat least in
gaming,not_removed,why not just set up an intravenous caffeine drip at that point
gaming,not_removed,it is not in order if it is missing stuff
gaming,not_removed,oh wow im retarded guess its been that long since ive played
gaming,not_removed,afaik neither had or and i highly doubt that earlier editions had them
gaming,not_removed,you cant think of any downsides to having an iv anytime you want caffeine
gaming,not_removed,by what logic things can be put in alphabetical order without having all of the letters
gaming,not_removed,maybe it just doesnt affect those stats
gaming,not_removed,no youre just special
gaming,not_removed,no but you dont see a point in consuming caffeine through peanut butter but by that logic why bother drinking coffee if you can just take some tablets right
gaming,not_removed,spcial ftfy
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,well the point of drinking coffee would be that it tastes good id think if all you want is caffeine why not take tablets
gaming,not_removed,that was horrible to watch trashed the crane too
gaming,not_removed,ouch
gaming,not_removed,are they worth downloading is a weird question worth implies a question as to whether the cost is worth the benefit theyre free though the cost is the seconds it takes to click them in the store and download them it takes very little to be worth that
gaming,not_removed,theyre not free its like saying netflix is free
gaming,not_removed,ps plus free games have been shit for the best part of a year so the answer is probably no
gaming,not_removed,theyre not freeif i dont pay the money i dont get access
gaming,not_removed,heres the list in case you too are an antisocial weirdo and dont want a stranger in your face for five minutes on a sunday afternoon drawn to death lovers in a dangerous spacetime invizimals the lost kingdom alien rage – extended edition second ninja ps vita crossbuy with curses n chaos ps vita crossbuy on curses n chaos looks alright
gaming,not_removed,this is one thing xbox one has over games with gold is infinitely better on a monthly basis over the years weve been given games like tomb raider definitive edition volgarr the viking ryse valiant hearts borderlands evolve deluxe edition project cars and a whole mess of others that are full on gems for free
gaming,not_removed,yeah struck me as odd too i usually play them for at least a little bit just because
gaming,not_removed,unless you add the non financial cost of expanding your library which makes it messier
gaming,not_removed,im not exactly sure that i would call all of these screenshots photorealistic but there is definitely some cool stylized potential desktop wallpaper here
gaming,not_removed,are you saying these are all made using lbp if so its come on a long way since i last played it
gaming,not_removed,didnt know how much i needed this good work
gaming,not_removed,wow never saw anything like this from littlebigplanet
gaming,not_removed,never go full ffxv
gaming,not_removed,sounds like champions of norrath on the
gaming,not_removed,baldurs gate dark alliance
gaming,not_removed,if no one here does try rtipofmytongue
gaming,not_removed,also rtipofmystick not sure if that ones retro only though

gaming,not_removed,yes but only as a bonus stage you had to beat the car up to get a higher score
gaming,not_removed,this all derives from nick bostrom the actual paper httpwwwsimulationargumentcomsimulationhtml abtract this paper argues that at least one of the following propositions is true the human species is very likely to go extinct before reaching a posthuman stage any posthuman civilization is extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their evolutionary history or variations thereof we are almost certainly living in a computer simulation it follows that the belief that there is a significant chance that we will one day become posthumans who run ancestorsimulations is false unless we are currently living in a simulation a number of other consequences of this result are also discussed note bostrom is not committed to the view that we are in a computer simulation possilbly the best place to dive into why musks position is at odds with bostroms is in the
gaming,not_removed,apple counts as a game dev company
gaming,not_removed,sega you liked that we dont make it anymore
gaming,not_removed,konami we have no idea wtf were doing anymore
gaming,not_removed,from software the testers said the game was too hard so we made it harder
gaming,not_removed,i wonder what blizzard would say
gaming,not_removed,hello games bye bye gaming community capcom no need to buy our dlc its already on the disc ea our sports games added back features that was removed so you can waste again
gaming,not_removed,activision support is dope tho
gaming,not_removed,i dont really understand why rockstar would be telling their customers fuck you they create god tier video games for their fans they focus of giving their best effort in every aspect of their projects maybe less for the online though lol

gaming,not_removed,what are the good big devspublishers we should be supporting obviously bethesda as someone else pointed out but if theres a game that looks interesting and the devspublishers arent shitheels that might tip me over into buying it
gaming,not_removed,i dunno ive really enjoyed the last few aaa titles from apple and the free dlc was icing on the cake
gaming,not_removed,rockstar is more like yes those are penises
gaming,not_removed,konami we will bastardize all that you love by putting all of our efforts into creating premium quality high definition trailers for our pachinko machines
gaming,not_removed,do yall of you know that moment in school when you could write a paged analysis but page is enough thats the same shit
gaming,not_removed,this is seriously old and a bit outdated now
gaming,not_removed,the message for rockstar games could also go for hello games
gaming,not_removed,epic games you know what we will let you create the game and we will watch paragon we know you guys want something but we need to make some other stuff before we start working on that fortnite soon

gaming,not_removed,httpsenwikipediaorgwikiapplepippin well they did made a console
gaming,not_removed,could be capcom as well
gaming,not_removed,konami we fired our most useful developer because he wanted to put his name on our games
gaming,not_removed,what the fuck is a kojima
gaming,not_removed,fuck metal gear solid fuck hideo kojima fuck silent hills and fuck you
gaming,not_removed,from software adjusted the effect of patches to work as intended efficiently in the partial category
gaming,not_removed,we win
gaming,not_removed,needs to be where squareenix is
gaming,not_removed,basically the same as apple
gaming,not_removed,coowned by activision basically the same
gaming,not_removed,blizzard come buy our cosmetics that change your character ever so slightly
gaming,not_removed,were sorry for diablo
gaming,not_removed,capcom no need to download our dlc its already on the disc you still gota pay though
gaming,not_removed,from what i heard their customer support is utter crap and theyve been terrible at handling cheaters in gta online on the pc also when i played every update seemed to break the game one way or another
gaming,not_removed,shark cards no dlc for singleplayer gtav
gaming,not_removed,one word micropayments
gaming,not_removed,i think it should say some day well release agent they announced that thing for
gaming,not_removed,give us more money for stuff that is actually good maybe
gaming,not_removed,niantic r
gaming,not_removed,nekki the more you play our games the more it will broke bethesda too the fuckups and glitches just stack as it goes on i once had a friend who had a dead dragon follow her around from town to town amazing bethesda
gaming,not_removed,but fallout sucked and isnt a real rpg hrs on record
gaming,not_removed,good guy bethesda you wouldnt say that if you knew what they and zenimax did to obsidian and other small studios
gaming,not_removed,it would just be hello games and empty underneath they just went quiet to spend all the cash
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,omg how awesome is this i cant believe how many of you i fucked
gaming,not_removed,cant really blame them but some companies are huge scumbags in their business practicies
gaming,not_removed,both cdpr and epic games seem pretty good and care about their gamescommunity paragons developers are one of the most active i have ever seen in any game
gaming,not_removed,well square and blizzard are still pretty good but a lot of those others really depends on the teams doing the game itself we shouldnt be supporting specific devs we should be supporting any dev when they make a good decision and shunning them when they make rather bad ones
gaming,not_removed,i wont say anything about bethesdas games but bethesdas publisher zenimax is probably one of the most evil companies and no one knows about it they do hostile takeovers of companies they completely screwed over obsidian studios during the making of fallout nv and almost put them out of business and then there is the whole carmack thing with vr and them claiming they own the right to vr becuase he thought of it in our company so its ours
gaming,not_removed,i dont know games are an almost irrelevantly small part of the company anyway
gaming,not_removed,its here like every other week ive just taken to ignoring it
gaming,not_removed,restricting content and making them only accessable by purcahising said content means they are passiveaggrisvely making you buy them
gaming,not_removed,touche id never heard of that one until now guess it was a resounding success
gaming,not_removed,megaman battle network
gaming,not_removed,megaman legends and megaman universe
gaming,not_removed,given the declining japanese gaming market this could basically be of japanese developerspublishers
gaming,not_removed,his games
gaming,not_removed,konami remember this game you loved now its a pachinko machine
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,i think kojima went over board with the phantom pain which was excellent in my opinion but seeing his name every time you start a mission is absurdly pretentious
gaming,not_removed,well wasnt he putting his name literally everywhere in the games though i heard it was getting to the point where it was actually somewhat intrusiveannoying that guy has ego problems
gaming,not_removed,really
gaming,not_removed,it really sucks his name is nowhere to be found in the game
gaming,not_removed,or you know because he slept with the higher ups wife but i guess that isnt fuck konami is it rofl people really hate reason the truth
gaming,not_removed,except i am pretty sure activsion was smart about it they give money to blizzard to make anything they want to make even more money
gaming,not_removed,why diablo wasnt bad
gaming,not_removed,i dont see how thats a fuck you theyre just slightly incompetent
gaming,not_removed,do people seriously not realize the shark cars is optional do people seriously not realize gtav online offers a monumental amount to do over just about any other usual online game no sp dlc i can understand but im hardly upset when gtav offers more than all other gtas already to begin with
gaming,not_removed,sounds like someone is being a bit greedy
gaming,not_removed,then dont buy them its really really really easy
gaming,not_removed,micropayment are just the way videogames are going just accept it you buy the album you go see the band live then they want you to buy a shirt deal with it
gaming,not_removed,i took it as fucking shark cards and no red dead for pc lol
gaming,not_removed,once i played vector i played it a lot that the currency goes and some of the alphabet in the menu are gone now i played shadow fight there are some point where one of my ribbon from my armor get attached to a great warhammer when i was in shoguns chapter i hope it doesnt end just like vector
gaming,not_removed,that was a common bug that almost everyone got in skyrim theres a mod that fixes it
gaming,not_removed,tbh they just have a problem with putting enough interesting quests in their games skyrim and fallout both use particular features as crutches to fill out their content in skyrim its dungeons and in fallout its the settlement mechanic what theyre really lacking is a good variety of interesting and unique content oblivion and fallout for example had worse combat than the more recent bethesda titles but the quest objectives were far more interesting than go here and kill these guys a good example being oblivions dark brotherhood questline almost every mission had some kind of twist to it where you actually had to use your brain to complete the bonus requirement and they were all unique and interesting compare that to skyrim where practically every quest involves fighting the same generic draugr in repetitive dungeons
gaming,not_removed,obsidian made a buggy game called new vegas it was very linear despite having an open world you couldnt do quest steps out of order characters are detailed in monologues rather than actions this dude has a good write up on new vegas thats only about the gameplay and story the small studio youre referring to human head games lost the rights to develop prey rumors say bethesda softworks wanted to buy them they had a contract that only allowed them to work on prey and other games if they were not the primary developer and bethesda softworks ruined the game on purpose the ign article about it has a claim that bethesda softworks wanted human head studios because they and a bunch of other studios knew idtech which makes no sense since they had already bought id software bethesda softworks said the game sucked human head studios wont say why it was cancelled human head studios assumed that bethesda would continue publishing the worst party games ever made its no coincidence this all came to a head in the same year brink came out somebody at bethesda or zenimax decided to stop publishing shitty games from parties and human head studios was the first casualty of that decision
gaming,not_removed,yeah no theyre not holding you by gun point
gaming,not_removed,declining japanese gaming market capcom makes a huge chunk of change in japan just from monster hunter
gaming,not_removed,anyone who honestly believes konami owns the mgs series is severely deluded thats kojima through and through
gaming,not_removed,also all the people that worked on it
gaming,not_removed,konami had planned to cut him before phantom pain it was their mistake for letting him finish mgsv
gaming,not_removed,not just his name his face even missions that revolved around rescuing him things like godjima his ego def got massive towards the midway point of the series
gaming,not_removed,you know thats a joke right he didnt sleep with anyones wife and its hilarious youre gullible enough to believe that without doing any research
gaming,not_removed,it was terrible at launch it got fixed though
gaming,not_removed,two words auction house
gaming,not_removed,didnt say it was i played the shit out of it but its no secret it didnt meet the standard set by diablo blizzard sacrificed deep rich role playing for accessibility and production value like i said i enjoyed it alot but it could have been so much more
gaming,not_removed,i think people are holding to a principle when they are upset with devs its not directly relevant whether one user buys shark cards and unlocks everything its indirectly relevant however the principle of a company choosing this as their profit model is what upsets gamers rockstar us d to be for the most part willing to use creativity and well made products to draw profit now they are just using the same silly old model as everyone else they used to be better thats the argument anyway
gaming,not_removed,if you mean me id gladly pay for singleplayer dlc if you mean the devs definitely
gaming,not_removed,it doesnt work that way when other people spend thats why rockstar continues to release free content for gta online which is very expensive via ingame currency encouraging microtransactions
gaming,not_removed,sadly she was playing on console p didnt bother her too much it made her laugh if anything
gaming,not_removed,this i just couldnt finish skyrim sure it looked nice but it really felt like i had everything to do but no reason to do it on one side and boring uninteresting quests on the other like the storyline is interesting at some points but the gaps between those times filled with boring uninteresting tasks was too much also the dragons were such a big letdown
gaming,not_removed,buggy is bethesdas subtitle and despite what that one guy that can write a blog said many people consider nv to be vastly superior than its zenimaxbethesdas mo to do this thing pay people to make their game once its almost finished cut them off from pay using their contracts loop holes and start fucking them over hard later try to buy them at a cheap price they did this to obsidian to human head and to many more nv was still a succesful game despite of what everyone can say about its quality yet obsidian had to use crowdfounding for their next game because bethesda fucked them over oh heres an open letter from another studio that worked for them
gaming,not_removed,they put the ending of mass effect behind a pay wall the ending not of the game the series
gaming,not_removed,you clearly dont know what passiveagressive means
gaming,not_removed,the video game market in japan hit a year low in and then fell percent last year mobile and handheld gaming is pretty popular but home console games are not of the top games sold in japan last year were games and the sold almost twice the hardware as the next system theres a reason konami has all but exited the console gaming market and their latest game is basically shilling to western obsession with zombie games or why resident evil has become more and more of an action game and now has had terrible shooter offshoots theyre attempting to appeal more to western audiences the major popularity of a few handheld games doesnt say anything about the market overall
gaming,not_removed,he created the series while working for konami with konami money that is literally the definition of konami owning something
gaming,not_removed,and then he threw it away to sleep with some guys wife shows how much he cares lol do people forget that he slept with one of his bosses wife they dont close stuidios for no reason
gaming,not_removed,somebody did this as a joke in fallout
gaming,not_removed,it isnt a joke though game stuidios dont close for no reason you have to fuck up really really badly and he did people believe all the other bullshit leaks but not the one that actually makes sense maybe you should actually do research
gaming,not_removed,i enjoyed it alot if i was blizz i wouldnt be sorry for making a game that was fun enough to play the shit out of they made a game that was fun mission accomplished
gaming,not_removed,they spent over on a campaign that took me over hours to beat playing at a steady pace i just dont think theyre too eager to push out a half assed dlc storyline yet how do you know they arent finishing up an expansion as we speak
gaming,not_removed,ehh i prefer the new content for gta online being free than having a cost like dlc tbh
gaming,not_removed,ok so what the actual game made over you can still just as easy not buy micrtranacions and not whine about them
gaming,not_removed,not my fault they suck
gaming,not_removed,no im just saying it was something that was common and harmless really
gaming,not_removed,open world games are just a let down most of the time they make the story so generic that it unfortunately loses interest they fill the world with places but they feel hollow like a movie set the only game to sucessfully break those problems has been the witcher imo and that was mainly due to a well developed character and plot
gaming,not_removed,and you dont know what make means apparently
gaming,not_removed,no but it does show where they are investing and developing console gaming has never been super big in japan partially due to the price of the content and the fact that japanese people come to gather much more socially than the west does
gaming,not_removed,then they can do it without him right oh wait they cant
gaming,not_removed,itd be nice if they were but youd think theyd maybe tell someone about that
gaming,not_removed,hours what on earth are you smoking gtav was nowhere near that long
gaming,not_removed,i cant deny that its nice to get content for free especially when a hacker dumped million on me once so i dont have to grind out money however if people werent buying shark cards they wouldnt be making free dlc essentially its a business model where its free content sustained by a minority of individuals with disposable income or sometimes addiction issues as these models do unfortunately take advantage of certain vulnerable people
gaming,not_removed,read my above comment again and youll get your answer
gaming,not_removed,kojima is responsible for it konami owns it big difference
gaming,not_removed,sure they can this survive was made to just put something out to be like hey were not done with games well see a real in a few years with a proper development behind it
gaming,not_removed,they dont even tell people about their games until a month before they come out lol
gaming,not_removed,there are collectibles etc so they increase the length edit at least i think he counts them to be a part of the campaign
gaming,not_removed,and it will suckmgs was konami owned but it was kojimas project
gaming,not_removed,that would be hilarious if u could actually do that lol
gaming,not_removed,totally agreed intuitive right lol
gaming,not_removed,man does look amazing
gaming,not_removed,missing the part where they stick side by side and form a line in the air
gaming,not_removed,absolutely loved the game but looking back arguably the worst wall building mechanic in a aaa ever
gaming,not_removed,obligatory comment love how were at the point in graphical evolution where im looking for details in pictures like these and trying to figure out if its the game with mods or a photo
gaming,not_removed,op where was this taken i honestly feel like ive been there before
gaming,not_removed,lol wtf
gaming,not_removed,in northern california
gaming,not_removed,yeeeeeeees pretty sure ive passed by this
gaming,not_removed,suprise mothafucka
gaming,not_removed,seriously fuck aa guns man i know you can avoid them but when you have that one guy who swears to different divine beings that his life is now dedicated to taking you down it just gets extremely bothersome
gaming,not_removed,i think id love this game but i feel the learning curve would be way to steep and id quit before getting this good
gaming,not_removed,i know this is multiplayer but i died like times trying to pass the blimp mission in the story hard difficulty i got so salty man was completely tilted
gaming,not_removed,when he is falling the castle looks like a face too face to face on face
gaming,not_removed,parachutes werent even used in still love the game p
gaming,not_removed,small fries mothafucka
gaming,not_removed,im usually that guy im also the guy who spots every motherfucker i see i wish more people would spot
gaming,not_removed,nah its not that hard
gaming,not_removed,its not tough being positioned right over the pesky aa gun attacking you is luck deploying your parachute late enough that he doesnt see you is good timing i prefer to sneak up from behind and knife them a few times myself
gaming,not_removed,i got it days ago and im level its my first time playing a game like it on pc and ive managed at least a kd every time i play
gaming,not_removed,nah battlefield is good for that you can have fun in a million ways
gaming,not_removed,easier than the previous battlefields flying heli in bad company felt badass and hard compared to and now no such things to worry about in
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,all rise mothafucka
gaming,not_removed,i logged in just to tell you you are double wrong because you didnt even read your source no such device was considered appropriate for aviators and crews to fixed wing aircraft
gaming,not_removed,sun rise mothafucka
gaming,not_removed,you better log in again to tell me you made a mistake in the source which i read and read again so i can directly copy paste it says it was not until that parachutes became available to fixed wing aircrew and then only in the german and austrohungarian air services right above german air service pilots screenshot httpiimgurcompfjrzlapng maybe you should read the whole source instead of downvoting me
gaming,not_removed,as in the last six months of the war
gaming,not_removed,you better log in again to tell me you made a mistake you were wrong and mistakenly quoted a source you mocked me for not reading thoroughly the last months of the war is a substantial amount of time and saw a lot of use if you actually had read the source like i did youd see a large list of names of pilots who used parachutes uffz max bauer ltn ernst baumgartel ltn julius bender carl berr gefr kurt blumener ltn herbert boy bramme flg siegfried braun ltn franz buchner helmut dilthey otto esswein friedrich fritz friedrichs vfw otto fruhner ltn hilmar glocklen ltn gutsche hansen albert haussman ltn hans jebens erich kampfe ltn wilhelm kolbach olt erich lowenhardt ltn emil mayer vfw friedrich megerle werner meyer gustav nolte hans pippart ltn josef raesch ltn adolf reinau ltn fritz rumey ltn wilhelm sainte monte ltn robert schmidt max schnell ltn helmut steinbrecher ltn stier ernst udet ltn paul vogel vfw weimar ltn alfred wenz ltn joachim von winterfeld ltn heinrich zempel and thats just the german pilotscopilots there are austrohungarian pilots as well with a documented case of using a parachute in action you cant salvage this
gaming,not_removed,awesome shot bro
gaming,not_removed,cheers
gaming,not_removed,thats some dexters laboratory shit
gaming,not_removed,does it actually move cuz how did that tiny girl move it if not
gaming,not_removed,that jedi has a very small schwartz
gaming,not_removed,doesnt dva lay down inside it though
gaming,not_removed,fkn finally a complete dva cosplay
gaming,not_removed,i would
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,holy shit that is insane
gaming,not_removed,i feel like it would have been easier to design it so she lays down inside it thats how it is in the game anyway
gaming,not_removed,when i saw her there was a huge crowd you must have caught her right at the start
gaming,not_removed,lights camera action xd
gaming,not_removed,most impressive
gaming,not_removed,can she even walk i want to see how she got around
gaming,not_removed,doesnt she actually lay down in the mech instead of sitting as in her legs are inside the thing
gaming,not_removed,its actually a good one instead of just a chick buying a spandex suit on amazon
gaming,not_removed,not enough simple skin tight bodysuit with zero other details cant even see booty s
gaming,not_removed,marieclaude bourbonais did something similar for her rachnera cosplay built a giant spiderbody thing to sit on it was epic
gaming,not_removed,darpa should give whoever made that a call
gaming,not_removed,thats not how she sits in the mech
gaming,not_removed,pft not even accurate dva doesnt sit in her mech
gaming,not_removed,lazy cosplay i say lazy because the girl aspect is literally just buy the bodysuit and the mech is halfassed as hell really disappointing considering they actually decided to attempt it and go that far with materials and effort to not put in the liiiiiiiiiiittle extra it would have taken to go from shabby cardboard gundam look to holy shit thats impressive edit since this is gonna be downvoted for honesty and offending a bunch of fuckbois waifu on top of what i said its also not the best dva cosplay ever
gaming,not_removed,sure thats a dude
gaming,not_removed,ive been playing too much pspro and vr this picture looks totally digital to me ik its not bc it would have been called out already edit relax it looked normal the next day i was stoned on my first look
gaming,not_removed,ooo what does this button do
gaming,not_removed,the more i think about it the more i believe that dexters lab was a shining example of american animation and wholesome messages here is this nerdy ass kid with every fucking clue about how harsh the world is just not giving a fuck and doing his thing dexter had his emotional shit together even protected his sister from his nerdy frenemy
gaming,not_removed,someone brought it over and she sat in it the only part of it that moved were the guns when she moved the joysticks
gaming,not_removed,if it moves shed be selling this to darpa
gaming,not_removed,i mean a idea would be to have fake front legs and jane your real legs be in the mech legs but she would have to have long legs which may mess up how the rest of her body looks
gaming,not_removed,i came here to say exactly this
gaming,not_removed,schwantz edit oh ya spaceballs edit schwantz is slang for penis in german
gaming,not_removed,exactly i bet that mech doesnt even fly cosplay
gaming,not_removed,she leans forward in a weird halfsquat
gaming,not_removed,all ive ever seen is a dva skinned body suit it feels so lazy to me
gaming,not_removed,angle
gaming,not_removed,i caught her on my way out of the con around the crowd probably came around the time the merch floor closed
gaming,not_removed,guns are the only thing that move the rest of the mech is stationary
gaming,not_removed,ah yeah saw her at anime expo in la last year was pretty damn cool imo
gaming,not_removed,metal gear it cant be
gaming,not_removed,even if its not the best dva cosplay this post just makes you look like a jerk this person obviously put time and effort into this and you saying all of that is unnecessary people arent upvoting this because a bunch of fuckbois think shes their waifu they are upvoting it because it looks cool and its unique im not offended by what you said either its just fucking rude and inconsiderate
gaming,not_removed,bro she built a fucking mech that right there is more work than of cosplayers put into their costumes
gaming,not_removed,i dont like it either but im not going to trash talk it because im too poor and lazy to her efforts so unless you have something better just move on
gaming,not_removed,lol yeah this looks like a day in daddys garage at most
gaming,not_removed,i dont even play overwatch and still think youre an overreacting child
gaming,not_removed,nothing nothing you only see air
gaming,not_removed,button buttonwhoooos got thaa button
gaming,not_removed,allah akbar
gaming,not_removed,also him not wanting deedee in his lab was really more for her protection he didnt exactly enjoy fixing things but you could tell it didnt particularly bother him either deedee could have gotten seriously hurt messing around with some of dexters stuff
gaming,not_removed,still amazing
gaming,not_removed,literally unplayable
gaming,not_removed,the only part that moved man youre hard to impress
gaming,not_removed,is it even cosplay at that point or just an interactive statue
gaming,not_removed,where was this also they moved
gaming,not_removed,k have a point
gaming,not_removed,i see your schwantz is as big as mine
gaming,not_removed,
gaming,not_removed,no shes on her belly feet up like a teenager on the phone
gaming,not_removed,i know right just buy the suit get some make up copy cats everywhere
gaming,not_removed,most cosplayers arent gonna have engineering degrees required to make the mech and if they do they certainly cant afford to make it
gaming,not_removed,ive seen like three that are literally a cardboard box not sure how much better that is
gaming,not_removed,how did she walk
gaming,not_removed,best part about adulting is knowing when and when not to say something right
gaming,not_removed,its not rude or inconsiderate its an accurate assessment its definitely not cool and unique given you can see dvas a day get posted here and yes a very proportionately large number of people upvoting it are doing so exactly because girl i didnt say it was unnecessary i said it was lazy its the equivalent of writing a heartfelt letter postmarking it stamping it sealing it and then throwing it out in the rain instead of putting it in the mailbox it makes the entire thing feel like it was done for attention by someone who probably has little to no interest in the actual character reference regardless its an opinion an opinion that goes against the grain obviously but isnt based in ignorance or malice just perspective
gaming,not_removed,it does not look cool and unique oh wait opinions can differ
gaming,not_removed,hey bro im poor too want to start a club
gaming,not_removed,boooomm oops i guess i shouldnt touch
gaming,not_removed,dont be silly i love you very much
gaming,not_removed,great now that song is stuck in my headagain singing intensifies
gaming,not_removed,and if you read snafu comics it ultimately did end up seriously hurting her
gaming,not_removed,whenever anyone asks we can put a man on the moon but we cant its because the worlds greatest minds are cos playing
gaming,not_removed,ameizing
gaming,not_removed,literally unwalkable
gaming,not_removed,i didnt take that as unimpressed just a statement of fact
gaming,not_removed,still cosplay imo as she is dressed as a character that gets in a mech then gets into a statue mech
gaming,not_removed,this was outside in front of the convention center at wondercon
gaming,not_removed,sigh unzips
gaming,not_removed,i see some real potential for some here
gaming,not_removed,enhance that
gaming,not_removed,that looks like the most uncomfortable way to pilot a mech all her weight in on her chest which would constrict breathing her head is positioned the lowest meaning that all her blood would flood to her brain her neck is craned back at an extreme angle which would result in make strain
gaming,not_removed,thats my favorite pose for girls bless their hearts
gaming,not_removed,i laughed
gaming,not_removed,theres a difference between stating an opinion and being blatantly rude cool is an opinion ill give you that but unique implies there are not many like it and that is a fact you dont see someone build a mech everyday so because of that people find it interesting on the note of it being lazy you can say its lazy but lazy would be not building a mech to go with the costume or saying that youre going to build one and then not building one your frame of reference just seems off to everyone and you came at this from and angle of attack thats why people dont like what you said
gaming,not_removed,this would be a verrrry popular club
gaming,not_removed,dee dee stay out of my laboratory
gaming,not_removed,jesus christ i remember this
gaming,not_removed,what happens
gaming,not_removed,name of comic on there im on mobile and the website isnt mobile friendly
gaming,not_removed,uh yeah about that
gaming,not_removed,i dont even play the game and i have no interest in anime porn but ive accidentally seen more porn for this game than any other game ever rule cant even explain that shit
gaming,not_removed,you say that but it allows you to handle g forces better multiple fighters designed shortly after had variants where the pilots would lay down instead of sit
gaming,not_removed,it doesnt matter shes probably going to die within a few minutes anyway
gaming,not_removed,yeah you sound like a creeper
gaming,not_removed,its unique only in the sense that there is indeed technically only one of this persons it is not unique in the sense that there are not many like it five seconds on google can illustrate that or different takes on it in the first page all much better than this chair welded to a metal stand with some aluminum foil wrapped over cardboard and spraypainted pink bullshit that op posted also it wasnt an attack on the cosplayer it was criticism that was accurate i dont care that people dont like what i said thats why i provoked them of the downvotes that comment got were because i called people fuckbois which they are and said they were gonna downvote it to shit because i dared to say anything besides praise for their waifu idol the downvotes are literally the proof and i love it honestly if this is the future of cosplay and the community around it im done i dont want to spend hundreds of hours and dollars on it knowing someone can ebay a skinsuit and slap a halfassed mech together knowing theyre going to have droves of children rush to defend them at the first sign of criticism
gaming,not_removed,even a lot of somewhat wealthy people believe they are poor so were gonna have a pretty large club
gaming,not_removed,it is actually i your arch nemesis mandark huh ha ha ha
gaming,not_removed,spoiler
gaming,not_removed,its the powerpuff girls comic there should be a mobile site for it i just checked it and was able to find it easily
gaming,not_removed,butts
gaming,not_removed,iirc it was a combination of sexy characters and blizzard loosing their minds about overwatch porn and trying to ban it so as is the nature if the internet people just made ten times more and now its sort of a whole sub genre
gaming,not_removed,well its actually fucking popular and characters have personalities
gaming,not_removed,wut i want to see proof if true like this would be cool but i wanna know im not being bamboozled i change my jet fantasies
gaming,not_removed,that wasnt very nice
gaming,not_removed,also this pic httpimgurcomaenhbh if its wrong for me to find that cute i dont want to be right cheers mate
gaming,not_removed,its not really that youre being rude you just havent given any reason for anyone to care about what you say because you havent really said anything interesting or productive of course people are going to focus on you insulting them and being overly critical especially when nothing you say is constructive or particularly well thought out just a bunch of bias opinions that you seem to treat as gospel and edgy assumptions that just make you seem bitter for no particular reason hope this helps shed light on why you have a hard time communicating with people have a nice day
gaming,not_removed,omellete du fromage
gaming,not_removed,i understand why but that doesnt explain why
gaming,not_removed,wait i didnt hear about this ban thing what happened why did they try to ban it
gaming,not_removed,personalities yeah i can see two of them
gaming,not_removed,im sure its a fantastic game but i mean its excessive
gaming,not_removed,a quick google search wound up with this httpsenwikipediaorgwikipronepositionpilotsandtheproneposition
gaming,not_removed,yes you have a problem the fact that you felt you needed to find a picture and post it to justify your weirdness shows this
gaming,not_removed,the one thing over anything else that will stick with me for the rest of my life
gaming,not_removed,applause
gaming,not_removed,butts
gaming,not_removed,they claimed it was due to copyright which is reasonable but of course one can connect the dots and realize that porn is probably ly not what they want to come to peoples minds when they think of overwatch heres some more info httpswwwpcgamesncomoverwatchblizzardaretakingdownoverwatchporn
gaming,not_removed,it says it never became mainstream cuz its too hard to control the aircraft lying prone darn it looked so cool in my mind too
gaming,not_removed,which problem is it that i have exactly weirdness is subjective if it doesnt float your boat thats fine but you dont need to attack others for what they like
gaming,not_removed,butt why
gaming,not_removed,id imagine launching yourself out would be hard as well haha
gaming,not_removed,now you are really beginning to creep me out a normal person would have said a stranger on the internet thinks he knows me and let it be but you keep feeling the need to justify yourself which makes it look like you indeed do feel that you have a problem the bless their hearts put the nail in the coffin they are humans just like men theres no need to bless there hearts unless you see them as in fact different or a piece of meat to a wild tiger i dunno man the post had creeper vibe all over it for me at least
gaming,not_removed,buttcause
gaming,not_removed,you see thats the fighters last hurrah it launches the pilot out like a muscle at the enemy if it goes down i hear its a pain to clean blood off of a dome midflight
gaming,not_removed,you seem to creep out easily you should get that looked into from my experience the ones pointing the finger at others proclaiming they are creeps sinners bad people be wary of those people are usually the ones who have the issue they are trying to pin on someone else its like those politicians and christian preachers who condemn gays to no end only to be revealed later that they are also gay ive no doubt my statements have gotten you all riled up putting nail after nail in whatever coffin youve constructed in your head its ok man youll be ok
gaming,not_removed,dude like i said before i dont care what you or anyone else thinks on the internet who dont know me i simply called out a creepy ass statement that you made im done commenting on your issue and am blocking u because it keeps coming up new message on my app and i dont have the time to justify creeper actions every time you feel you need to justify yourself get help take care
gaming,not_removed,lol now youre just repeating what i wrote as the great john rambo once said they drew first blood
gaming,not_removed,realistic xddddd
gaming,not_removed,good guy cop steals the car and shoots a person just to immediately get back out
gaming,not_removed,if you havent already you should try the lspdfr mod it lets you be the cop and go on calls pull people over and make arrests its a pretty cool twist to gta this cop though no fucks were given here
gaming,not_removed,rodney king rodney king rodney king rodney king rodney king rodney king
gaming,not_removed,accurate representation of us police
gaming,not_removed,it depends on the screen itself
gaming,not_removed,the looks depends on the screen tn vs ips panels frame rate colour reproduction etc but if youre using it for gaming especially if with a pc i recommend a monitor for its generally lower input lag
gaming,not_removed,since you want it for both pc and xbox a tv most monitors are only better when youre using dvi but you want to use hdmi so just get a tv tv is more versatile anyway
gaming,not_removed,pokemon was never released on the nes what youre seeing in this video is fan made
gaming,not_removed,theres no pokemon for nes
gaming,not_removed,i understand this the people who made it are a chinese company that does ports and homebrews for the nes
gaming,not_removed,totally aware of this
