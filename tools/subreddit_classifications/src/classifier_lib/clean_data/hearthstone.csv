hearthstone,removed,vaper leper v
hearthstone,removed,yeah this iceblock roaring torch and naturalize coldlight are pretty much the best already had someone add me to call me a faggot after they lost to it
hearthstone,removed,come to think of it there is no right play the paladin can summon dudes and clear everything every turn so hell win a drawnout game no matter what i was thinking gosh just play two or three minions to tease out the equality and then youll have the board next turn because this is clearly a serious competitive brawl for like me
hearthstone,removed,lol i bet your black
hearthstone,removed,ok if youre gonna protect this nig idk what to say to you
hearthstone,removed,everyone and everything is caricatured and mocked on twitch chat when they see a black guy people use a kind of racist angle because its the easiest path there is if he wasnt black it would be something else reading quickly through the interview it seems the interviewers are more offended than he actually is thats typical of progressives being offended in the place of actually targeted people and trying to dramatize things to try and satisfy their never ending hunger for control and censorship and sadly the only illustration of that racism is it was bad repeated multiple times with no actual examples that would allow people to judge for themselves if that was actually racism and it was that bad so we have to take the words of easily offended people for it
hearthstone,removed,trihard
hearthstone,removed,i like to eat bananas you know its true im terrencem who are you
hearthstone,removed,but his point is that you do it in different ways thats why the labeling shouldnt be too broad
hearthstone,removed,kibler is hot too id fuck him
hearthstone,removed,we dont live in a racist society anymore ahahahahahahaha this is the most bullshit response i have ever seen kid i get it you are sheltered have little life experience and dont understand much about the world but this ridiculous fucking racist apologetics is a joke they can choose not to be offended by those comments and see them for the trolling attempt they really are just like they choose not to get offended when their friend banter about their race if a thousand people are screaming racist bullshit its on the black dude to take it like a joke its no different than his friends joking around with it obviously it is the targets responsibility to be totally okay with a mob of people attacking him for his skin color because they are only just joking about him being inferior sure this horde of people never does this to people who look like them but the darkies just need to chill twitch chat where people are mocked for being fat being a girl being black short asian having a bad posture a different haircut looking like a nerd and for almost anything i noticed there was a race and gender left off that list man twitch chat sure is egalitarian in its hatred and targeting i mean it makes fun of people for anything you guys and i think weve moved to a point where we can mock each others race look we can all totally mock each other for this i basically listed all the mockable races black women gay any of those are all totally mocked equally and i dont think i left anything out so its all okay
hearthstone,removed,cool story bro and what exactly does that say it just says that people cant even voice their own opinion anymore because precious feelings have become more important than essential freedoms and liberty homosexuality is in fact not normal the definition of the word normal explains it already homosexuals are the minority in any given society and thus they arent the norm hence even biologically it is abnormal because if it were only for homosexuals we would have gone extinct already not to mention that tolerating and treating a person respectful doesnt exclude disagreeing with that person and that persons lifechoices tolerating accepting but hey rather defend the backlash of people who are willingly taking away freedoms and liberties of all of us who cares about these most people dont use them anyway
hearthstone,removed,your mother would burn in hell your deck is shit wo cards a little dicksucker cp all your family would burn in hell
hearthstone,removed,one more trihard and im out

hearthstone,removed,hey ghostofdrusepth we are glad to hear that you liked this brawl honestly we had no idea how much people would like this we were concerned that people would dislike the fact that most games end on turn but so far most of the feedback has been positive

hearthstone,removed,so how about arena rewards though
hearthstone,removed,the same dumbfuck that thought making a bunch of zoo cards would be balanced fucking moron broke the game

hearthstone,removed,in fact maybe even change charge to that hell if you want to not kill the burst from certain charge minions do it like shadowverse and have both rush can attack minions the turn it is summoned and the current form of charge shadowverse is a game very similar to hearthstone that kripp introduced me to mainly through the promise of free packs no rhailcorporate

hearthstone,removed,is your mouth a trashcan because everything coming out is pure garbage
hearthstone,removed,your friend screwed you over big time just like gvg the packs will no longer be sold for each expansion you want to at least open to packs so you can at the very least have every common on that patch and to of the rares packs will also on average get you legendary and ensure you at least epics as a free to play player who does not buy packs with money you want to be farming this packs when it is ongoing in arena when the pack is removed from store if you want these cards you will have to pay full dust value for each one which is a horrible deal even more horrible if it is some common that would have easily been in a pack
hearthstone,removed,reno has always been the rich mans fall back whats the point of having golden legendaries when you have no viable deck to play them in reno solved that problem for them while it is fustrating know that they dont know every game just like you have as many losses when they pull out reno they in turn have just as many losses where reno will never drawn
hearthstone,removed,wait what most of my decks only win if i have the coin lol you are forgetting you also get extra card if i go first i always run out of steam

hearthstone,removed,because this subreddit is a fucking cesspool full of little whiny babies
hearthstone,removed,found the virgin
hearthstone,removed,i think the hearthstone community is anyways going to attract cynical neckbeards who have no social skills and will be a complete dick to the devs because they dont like one or two elements to the game i say this because if youve ever been to a mtg tournament or event you know exactly the kind of person i mean and they are the worst they think very highly of their intelligence and refuse to believe that they could ever be wrong about something i just really dont want that kind of douchebag floating around this community and you have to call it out when you see it
hearthstone,removed,thats impossible half of all large gaming boards consist of contrarian fedora lickers who at the first sign of criticizing their corporate love affairs will scream circlejerk toxic wahhhh stop complaining

hearthstone,removed,who gives a crap what chakki has to say
hearthstone,removed,not really out of context lying or cheating to make yourself look better or your country look better is totally relevant if this had happened in na that team or player would be getting set on fire right now i am also pretty sure the tournament would have stepped in to try and make it right but in china and on the chinese boards fuck no they jump straight to the na crying about chinas great play side does anyone really think it is coincidence that the first instance of cheating or seriously bad sportsmanship in hearthstone is at a chinese tournament probably the most popular comment in these threads has been guess i wont watch chinese tournaments again and they wont care in china all that runs through their head is that they won a tournament and therefore are superior cheat how can you cheat it is a computer based card game china
hearthstone,removed,hunter was not bad you are bad from karazhan up until msog hunter was the most used deck in tournaments see it helps to pay attention to tournaments and actual statistics so you dont say stupid things based on your own poor performance at low ranks
hearthstone,removed,china has cheated at every single international lan tournament held in china in this is an ongoing thing for fucks sake they cheated at theyve been doing it back since days look up jimmy monitor smasher ho this isnt new to gaming chinese lans are always filled with massive amounts of cheating
hearthstone,removed,if the chinese players had wanted to cheat lvge would have used volcanic potion instead of ice block in the game renomage vs jadedruid to get more turns to get more direct damage spells and the match would be over then in the whole match all the na players except cydonia didnt play well and made many errors they just wouldnt like to reflect why they performed so terribly and turn to blame chinese counterparts they are just cowards and cn hs wont welcome them any more
hearthstone,removed,zoolock is quickly becoming one of my favorite decks its just so positive and generous practically costs nothing at all at dust you drop him on the board and that chill ass motherfucker gives you a bunch of minions to use later in the game you get these adorable little can ping things but usually are too harmless to be removed but more than the zl is just so positive it comes on the board like your soul shall be mine and im like yeah bb i do want to eat a soul lets do this shit and when he attacks hes like suffer and im like yeah suffer he doesnt say some bullshit macho shit like i will destroy you hes just like your soul shall suffer and it looks so happy i mean this is an orc dude literally brought to power by fel he understands his life is a temporary demonic gift and the dude is just fucking loving it i mean look at his face hes just so happy i am literally never sad when guldan is on board idk if hes gonna make it into the metagame or not but for now he or she a pretty chill dude
hearthstone,removed,toyota pogchamp
hearthstone,removed,cn are always up to no good whether it be sports or esports they always need to cheat what a disgrace of a tournament and a blemish to the hearthstone scene
hearthstone,removed,ive gotten the big winner reward times guessing im close to i have never tried to climb but once i forgot to concede and got to rank in a session i play at least of my games with a quest login reroll logout unless quests i really should uninstall but what if i want to play
hearthstone,removed,hearthstone doesnt even register on my value system its a free game
hearthstone,removed,rat is a bad play won are chineseand china is also known for cheatingdirectly quoted from a comment here wtf how did you know that have you ever been to china were excited and the player might hear some noise have you ever confirmed if it is possible to receive clear messages from casters with the headphones conclusion this player cheated purposefully nice logic of course they cheated because us never lose not possible for them to beat us team without cheating after all youve got the american jesus overwhelming millions every day have a nice day you
hearthstone,removed,╮￣￣╭ ￣￣ ￣￣ ・・ oo ⊙⊙ ⊙▂⊙
hearthstone,removed,this brawl made me hard
hearthstone,removed,it will sound a bit harsh but rank doesnt prove anything as this clearly shows
hearthstone,removed,im sorry but fucking lol there is no fucking way you climbed with that deck no sunfury or argus and a nonsensical medivh utter rank detritus
hearthstone,removed,i think patches is a shitty card you could play a pirate deck without him and the change have no impact in your winrate
hearthstone,removed,its not cheating youre in china you have no voice there
hearthstone,removed,i do not believe a word of course he says that he was conflicted and that dirty rat was a viable option but it was not not in a million years not a play any hs pro would ever make in that situation he cheated the home admins allowed it and that is all there is to it
hearthstone,removed,statement from chinese production company listen these headsets are the best theres no way anyone could hear anything statement from chinese player i could totally hear everything what i hear definitely affected my decision making but i didnt cheat and no one explicitly told me which plays to make lol
hearthstone,removed,salty na complaining
hearthstone,removed,eu is a scammerbe careful
hearthstone,removed,chinese culture is pretty foreign to the west so i always look at these sort of things with a bit of bias due to past cheating controversies i mean we all know in general the chinese dont care about copyright or ip as they create tons of knock off products it can be viewed by the west as a culture of cheating but the thing that i found really sort of fascinating is it doesnt seem like they are ashamed of cheating it only seems they feel bad if they are caught cheating so the actual act of being caught is the problem not the cheating itself it just makes it a bit more hard for me to trust them that being said just because the culture is that way doesnt mean individuals dont have their own integrity have to give credit to the player for admitting that he heard things and it altered his play pretty shameful for the tournament to claim that the headphones were enough when you can see and hear chakki yell at them for their comments that altered the play hopefully in the future they do a better job of isolating players
hearthstone,removed,thanks for making this thread really adds a lot to the discussion of course your opinion is much too important to be posted as a comment in one of the hundreds of threads that already exist regarding the current meta
hearthstone,removed,follow cora on twitter songbirdhs join her discord at httpsdiscordggnrvzqwt
hearthstone,removed,youre mistaken he is a much bigger cheater than that i had the misfortune of having to know him through being employed by draftmagic he cheated constantly it was essentially pathological hes one of those types of players who think that competition is about winning and any steps taken to win are okay like cheating is part of competing and it is only wrong if you get caught i absolutely played the game often i was in the tournament scene for nearly two decades im not exaggerating when i say the third most brazen cheater ive witnessed with my own eyes
hearthstone,removed,thats not what the player said at all its basically what he said he said he can hear them thats all that matters youre nitpicking for the sake of being argumentative i cant even imagine how sad your life must be
hearthstone,removed,people have different opinions on the amount of mediocre stream plays from famous streamers on the sub and thats fine but i think we can all agree that it totally sucks to have a stream highlight on the front page for a few days to be replaced by the official version of the same clip a few days later i get that we want content creators to get views but that doesnt change the fact that it makes the sub objectively far worse for everyone viewing it if the mods were remotely competent theyd be doing something about this
hearthstone,removed,tldr
hearthstone,removed,except that the heal means that the opponent has to trade into it instead of ignoring it i understand that youre in the dumpster ranks where these decks just go face but theyd trade into a vanilla as well
hearthstone,removed,do you not know the difference between a lie and white lie because your ignorance is clearly showing
hearthstone,removed,aww and you are just such an adorable lovable troll pinches your cheeks
hearthstone,removed,pats the trolls head aww whatever makes you happy go click on need in wow for raid loot you dont need

hearthstone,removed,lol
hearthstone,removed,this video is minutes long come on no one could tolerate minutes of that annoying woman unless they were fucking her
hearthstone,removed,justification what is there to justify some people just dont want to deal with the pressure of playing ranked why does anyone need to justify playing their preferred game mode
hearthstone,removed,the word is have
hearthstone,removed,id like for you to revisit your comment where you tried to chastise me for supposedly just insisting that i am right without any proof your comment you just made is you doing literally the exact same thing im quite done with you youre a pathetic hypocrite who has shown no respect for grammar proper vocabulary or any sort of decency at all id wish you a good life but from what ive seen of you you dont deserve one
hearthstone,removed,
hearthstone,removed,much better than all of yours it would seem nerdrage
hearthstone,removed,are you crazy thatd be way to confusing for new players
hearthstone,removed,if youre a little bitch and bad words trigger you then dont add people in game its that simple
hearthstone,removed,its not a classic case its just a regular case dumbass
hearthstone,removed,im just trying to get it out thereyou guys cant seriously not be bored of hearthstone yetthis game actually has depth and less rng you should at least try it for an houryour missing out
hearthstone,removed,found the midrange shaman
hearthstone,removed,i dont get why people play aggro decks its the most boring shit to play and to play against hurr durr all i do is play small minions and go face xd im good xd might aswell not play the game its fucking pathetic
hearthstone,removed,serious question whats the point in playing aggro decks tho other than ranking up fast which doesnt even matter because you will drop down to garbage tier ranks because you are unable to play any deck that requires atleast one working braincell
hearthstone,removed,yea control decks arent fun to play against either but you still have a chance to win unless you are a degenerate and play aggro warrior or any type of shaman in which case you deserve to get a brain tumor so you finally have sonething in your head thats actually working
hearthstone,removed,i fully agree with you that zoo takes skill to play minon placement and so on but you cant be serious when you tell me its hard to play tunnel trogg on turn totem golem on turn and so on and so on and then finish by playing bloodlust or doomhammer rockbiter or any other retarded shit also aggro warrior all you have to do is get a weapong and keep buffing it and hit face with your overwhelming board i know how salty i sound but i only play rogue and i can insta concede on turn one even if i hard mulligan for swap ooze backstab and whatnot just tired of all those timmies that tryhard with cancer decks
hearthstone,removed,waaahhh the only thing that i think when playing hearthstone is me go face me dont need to trade seriously though what kind of reasoning is that heh i keep losing to those fast decks huh maybe i should start playing them aswell hmmm i dont know though i love playing priestrogue hmm but oh well im gonna play soemthing that isnt fun for anything to show of my sick rank xdddddd since you obviously are a virgin you might aswell go rape some girls because the goodlooking guy me keeps stealing all the girls you like and you suck and dont know how to adjust
hearthstone,removed,there is no technology for that tbh

hearthstone,removed,congratulations blizzard you reduced the class list from priest to pally rogue hope your balancing sucks less ass this time around clowns
hearthstone,removed,c u r r e n t y e a r u r r e n t y e a r
hearthstone,removed,i know you didnt those are two different examples about why youre bad really then go and make your own topic if your so smart oh wait you are just a troll here to parrot the opinion of your favour streamer and shit on anything unless they tell fuck off kid only thing bad here is your presence
hearthstone,removed,do you actually care or are you just being a furrynecked meme boy for the karma because rogue is fine just not a tier standard deck
hearthstone,removed,have you ever played a fucking stealth minion before try playing that fucking panther see what happens whoops dies to arcane missiles whoops dies to spell power maelstrom whoops whoops oh no whoops and that has twice the health this pile of garbage does so you can take your stealth and you can shove it waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay down your bumhole and i mean aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaalll the way down until you can feel it in your little pisser
hearthstone,removed,lol calm down dude no no ah ah ah ah no if my opponent wants to waste a spell killing measly minion they will because youre a fucking rogue and you have nothing better to waste a fucking aoe on they have three other aoes sitting in their ballsack they dont give a damn theyre developing tempo youre losing it and now you lost the whole game because you have no god damn come back mechanic not a single one fucking get that through your skull
hearthstone,removed,͡° ͜ʖ ͡°

hearthstone,removed,if youre comparing cthun to jade golems you are legitimately retarded
hearthstone,removed,ok
hearthstone,removed,one question hike how did the devs expect us to react to this im honestly buffled did they really think this is funny and wont get all remaining rogue mains downwards mad i doubt that but sadly that means they either did it just to piss us off or they have no clue what theyre doing really annoyed by this approach i just hope in months team will finally admit they had no idea what to do with rogue and will try to fix their failure next expansion
hearthstone,removed,the same reason your mother drank while pregnant sometimes mistakes are made
hearthstone,removed,shes dead anyway so

hearthstone,removed,unzips do you wanna take this inside
hearthstone,removed,what i think is retarded about balance is the insane power creep of mana cards there used to be a time where a crocolisk and raptor turn was the aggressive play now you got freaking dragons for pirates that summon patches for also the freaking minion for cut the fucking mana minions
hearthstone,removed,if your mom didnt give up on you why should i with hearthstone
hearthstone,removed,missed bm wisp feelsbadman
hearthstone,removed,you sir are an idiot
hearthstone,removed,of all the hearthstone highlights streamers have on a daily basis is a probability really worth posting to reddit
hearthstone,removed,cry more please
hearthstone,removed,lol dead failed subreddits for side projects you assume im an asshole yet you dont know the first thing about me you obviously looked up my post history and saw one other post on this subject and assumed i was running around telling everyone complaining to fuck off then based on that post and this came to the conclusion that i am an asshole and ranted about it its not a biased attitude its simply stating the facts this is a game people are not entitled to anything and coming out in troves to complain about not getting a pack this week is childish almost as childish as you making a judgement about my entire personality based on comments
hearthstone,removed,kys

hearthstone,removed,this deck is broken as fuck and the people who are playin it are faggots
hearthstone,removed,cry baby
hearthstone,removed,implying hearthstone is really entertaining to watch watch the top hs streamers name one regulated chat pwny massan and athene doesnt count mrdestructoid hs streams are alive because of the chat deal with it
hearthstone,removed,trihard
hearthstone,removed,they both look the same to me
hearthstone,removed,i am absolutely shocked
hearthstone,removed,
hearthstone,removed,hate speech is about context not about the persons intent you can hatefully tell me i have really bad shoes but its never going to be hate speech let me preface this i think suicide is selfish and shitty i dont want to romanticise suicide so my friend jokingly called his brother faggot and later on his brother who believed he should be ashamed of who he was killed himself thats an example of how hate speech has more hatred than what the speaker might imply due to the cultural context
hearthstone,removed,the stream starts and so my spam begins it shall not end until i am banned i shall fear no mod sub to no streamer i shall live and die in the chat for i am the value in the bomber i am the bm in the lethal i am the salt in the defeat i pledge my keyboard to the chat for this stream and all the streams to come
hearthstone,removed,no there isnt any true racism or sexism
hearthstone,removed,heres another quote from reynad

hearthstone,removed,when you start that fire dont get niggardly with the faggots
hearthstone,removed,fuck you too asshole
hearthstone,removed,kripp makes the imo very persuasive point that as the card pool grows ever larger in arena it becomes essentially ever more important what cards you are even offered in the draft with respect to how well you are likely to do against other players since the draft is basically rng for experienced players there is little to no skill involved in drafting for curve and utility etc the actual importance of playing out games becomes secondary to it
hearthstone,removed,lol classic reynad i have upvotes so im vote botting so much of a persecution complex maybe instead of me having a giant bot net to upvote my criticism of poorly made content people just think your editing quality is poor but feel free to ask the mods or admins to check me for vote rigging i have nothing to hide

hearthstone,removed,ureynad has to call out vs because everyones starting to realize that ts editorial staff is garbage and he needs a reason to justify why people should still read his clearly unedited unrefined and statistically unsound opinion list
hearthstone,removed,hey guys are you sure this post isnt being vote brigaded reynads pretty sure that any criticisms of his meta snapshot
hearthstone,removed,cant wait to downvote reynads inevidable response to this lol d also his fanboys hes going to know the wrath of reddit soon d
hearthstone,removed,its just that the technology isnt there yet once it catches up you can expect all the nagging share prompts you can hope for
hearthstone,removed,its a very accurate description of this little shit to be honest why people even likewatch this shitty human piece of garbage is beyond me

hearthstone,removed,trihard
hearthstone,removed,people take twitch chat too serious people who seriously gets angry at twitch chat needs to better understand what twitch chat is people will make fun of whatever is going on and try to be edgy and trigger people with the hearthstone incident people jumped on the easiest trigger which was spamming trihard but while the overweight dude was playing earlier people were spamming about his weight people watching dont know the people on the broadcasts in rl so they go for the easiest trigger they can determine by looking at a person for seconds if someone has a stutter twitch chat will jump on that angle if you are overweight twitch chat will jump on that angle if you are visually nervous twitch chat will jump on that angle if you are black twitch chat will jump on that angle if you are asian twitch chat will jump on that angle if you are female twitch chat will jump on that angle if you have acne twitch chat will jump on that angle etc etc welcome to the twitch chat where many people try to be the biggest asshole and as edgy as they can most of the people spamming and are now being called racist probably arent even racist they are just assholes so what twitch has isnt a racist problem nor sexist problem it just has a easy accessible chat system where people can be dicks to other people twitch has an asshole problem
hearthstone,removed,thanks for the advice btw i dont have a rag or saron so i worked in a few more spells and kept the emperor
hearthstone,removed,ive read reddit threads for real games for a long time but when i saw how many people here actually think theres any skill whatsoever involved in the game i did have to register my shock like i said outside your little circle here its pretty common knowledge that the person who wins is the person who draws the best cards
hearthstone,removed,fuck all black people hope the burn in hell сука блять
hearthstone,removed,well the alternative is feeding the trolls
hearthstone,removed,because he is wrong twitch chat shits on anyone if it wants doesnt matter be it girl black person or fat also typing trihard in chat doesnt mean you are racist its way to react to things happening on stream if they see asian they type minglee if they see black trihard girl heyguys it is unusual and because of this it takes attention of chat if streams abd chat would be black they would type something for every white person they see because this is unusual situation
hearthstone,removed,really who gives a shit people look so hard for things to complain and get angry about what matters is that they finally want to do something about it although personally i dont think theres a lot that can be done
hearthstone,removed,he

hearthstone,removed,viable adjective vi·a·ble ˈvīəbəl capable of being done or used capable of succeeding httpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionaryviable yeah id say its plenty viable it just isnt optimal
hearthstone,removed,no its shit just like you are
hearthstone,removed,how do retards upvote this blow my mind
hearthstone,removed,i miss handlock it was better than the retard aggro meta
hearthstone,removed,look up the book nerd psychology if you are having fun playing aggro it is because you think winning is fun this is actually a symptom of a mental disorder i highly encourage you to pick up the book and read why
hearthstone,removed,who cares wins is nothing i get consistently

hearthstone,removed,there is if youre fucking wasted god that guy is an idiot
hearthstone,removed,are you serious did you read a single thing in the post no murloc aggro priest shouldnt be a viable deck but midrange decks like paladin dragon priest etc should be at least somewhat viable relative to the best midrange deck right now midrange shaman and dragon warrior are so far beyond these decks theyre not even worth attempting to play why do classes have the only viable early minions in the game seriously why do you bother replying with bullshit like this without even reading the post you contribute absolutely nothing to the discussion with your shitty opinion
hearthstone,removed,yeah a deck that takes the top of practically all tournaments is pretty fair s i dont know in which meta circles you play but mtgo online right now is unplayable just look at random mtgo tournaments looks fun and balanced or an pros opinion about bant coco if blizzard would print something like coco or reflector mage in hs this sub would self destruct
hearthstone,removed,i have for a long time been wondering where the most retarded portion of the hearthstone player base resided and then i found this subforum can you shut the fuck up about mana hex it shadow word it polymorph it humiliate it theres tons of removal that you can use to destroy that thing thats literally why you have removal to deal with threats

hearthstone,removed,thrall was actually a man from minnesota who cuckolded the then ceo of blizzard in the early days of warcraft ever since that day blizzard personnel has been secretly masturbating to thralls doomhammer it was only until after the release of hearthstone and the lgbt movement that blizzard developers could express themselves more freely so now we have this iteration of shaman that we know and secretly love
hearthstone,removed,aont worry ive been botting day past years so i have enough cards already too bad the game is in such a dogshit state that i havent played manually more than matches past two seasons bot agro shamans up to rank and then i just have it farm golden portraits and sell those alts thank you for your kind words but its all good
hearthstone,removed,
hearthstone,removed,can someone translate what he said into good engrish
hearthstone,removed,he patched things with rania and getting snu snu again
hearthstone,removed,i dont think its really a unicorn counter more than a ive played this matchup a shitton and know how to do it obviously with a fair amount of luck combined i was playing the from hoej but swapped out corruption for rag as i rarely found the card too useful and needed some sort of finisher
hearthstone,removed,youre you are
hearthstone,removed,the sellers account mentioned on this thread was not rage blocked – he is not banned from the marketplace imagine you were a company and someone was bragging that they put up an invalid product on your website – you expect the company not to react at all we want to check out this particular sellers account – because right now he does not sound like the type of seller that we want on our marketplace we cant just ignore his attempt to put up an invalid product as for the verifications – we have the sellers address id and we know exactly who he is so the fact that he keeps saying we have no verifications is unfortunately just a lie the only way we could prove that to you guys would be to show you his documents – which of course we have no intention of ever doing it works like this – this was a seller who checked out on our marketplace for a long time he was not one of the sellers that triggered our radar he sold valid products customers did not complain everything worked so our security systems let him put that key up but the key did not stay up for long he did not cheat our system lets say somehow that code stayed up even if someone then bought it that buyer would complain as the code would have been fake and that is why we block sellers payouts for a specific amount of time after purchase– to ensure our customers are not getting screwed over we are speaking to this seller right now to figure everything out – but we cant be expected not to react in a case like this

hearthstone,removed,fcking stop overpowered onedrops not my company
hearthstone,removed,what was it like being in a coma for the past year was it hard to get readjusted i assume figuring out that shaman has been overpowered for forever is pretty low on your list of priorities so i understand your confusion
hearthstone,removed,they are spreading more confusion the dates are actually still
hearthstone,removed,you are not the sharpest tool in the shed
hearthstone,removed,thank you guys for being so communicative fucking reddit knows nothing poor brodie pants team take all my money and semen plz i hate reading huge walls of text from this dev team that have no substance you mentioned percentages and the ever repeating mantras that you keep spouting nothing concrete just soon and the announcement of an announcement that will announce an announcement end of the month so another entire season of shit shamanstone curvestone everything on our radarstone
hearthstone,removed,this is not good ubbrode end of this monthhow convienent its an entire month the new announcement will coincide with icc xpac announcement changes will happen a week before icc release yet the meta stays the same for the next months regardless this post is smoke and mirrors embrace the digital card game you puppet
hearthstone,removed,nope youre delusional if you actually think blizzard is reliant on the reddit community do you think a capable company like blizzard that has many wonderful and succesful games out there is just missmanaging the game out of sheer incompetence no their design choices have primarly the majority of the playerbase in mind which are mostly kids that love to play some shiny cards or casual players that like to play a lil on the go on their phone we could all stop playing and it would barely be a hot drop on the bucket
hearthstone,removed,omg i dont care just do something anything
hearthstone,removed,more month of this bullshit
hearthstone,removed,sighhhhhhhhhh
hearthstone,removed,this is ridiculous end of the month only winrate yeah against decks that are soooo heavily teched against it its ridiculous that its winrate is still that high for the love of god stop stalling and nerf already
hearthstone,removed,what i said was still relevant to your response if you lack the intellectual capacity to connect the dots thats on you
hearthstone,removed,if na
hearthstone,removed,tldr fuck off reddit shamans not that great play counters u noobs cuz were not nerfing jack shit got another month posted unironically on groundhog day which the ladder increasingly resembles
hearthstone,removed,but league often fixes things in the wrong way
hearthstone,removed,piss off if you are too dense to understand what a user solution is and how what people are doing is not a solution but just complaining thats on you dimwit
hearthstone,removed,im not gonna speak for hearthstones health but patches can be really really important for the health of a game and all this reminds me of an even more serious time blizzard just waiting for the meta to balance itself hearthstone at its smallest was bigger than heroes of the storm ever was but refusing to impactfully patch hots during the infamous stun meta was the nail in the coffin of the game ever having a chance to at least become more than a shadow in the shadow of dota instead of being just another smiteparagonbattlebornbtier moba and this is coming from me one of oceanias like eleven remaining hots players not to mention state of the competitive scene here id really hate hearthstones playerbase to suffer in any more measurable way because of lack of action to address the games issuesbut it wouldnt be the first time and lets not forget for the nonwow players here blizzard have been industryinfamous for their balance patches for over a decade regardless of which game it is the numbers may say shaman is technically still in a healthy spot and maybe it is but all i know is the pirate package drove me and others away from the game to the point where i dont even watch kibler or days streams anymore because why fucking bother i dont think a mass exodus is nigh or its as bad as some others do but hey we were told not to worry about heroes of the storm toountil the day when suddenly unranked queues were taking minutes and putting us on servers in other countries for months because matchmaker literally couldnt find players on our hemisphere of the planet

hearthstone,removed,s p a g h e t t i p a g h e t t i
hearthstone,removed,this took a lot of effort knowing that the community would rather choke on blizzard cock than to consider the validity of dissenting posts this game has been declining for a long time every new expansion there is a deck that is way better than any other deck i got to rank with secret hunter when i previously couldnt break it has nothing to do with skill imbalanced decks just never get nerfed until blizzard wants more money so you either grind with shit decks or you play the overpowered deck and make the ladder boring as fuck
hearthstone,removed,if you still dont get it i am not going to keep repeating it my guess is you just refuse to admit youre wrong because i refuse to believe that anyone is a dense as youre pretending to be

hearthstone,removed,wait unless they changed something recently amazon never charged you for canceling prime if you didnt have it from my experience it was just canceled as soon as the day trial was up im guessing its pretty clear in the tos to cancel the free trial since so many companies have been hit with class actions for doing the exact same thing
hearthstone,removed,maybe you cant think straight when you have so many dicks going in your mouth they are coming out of your ears
hearthstone,removed,you made the same mistake twice which means that it wasnt a mistake on your part but rather a lack of learning hit the books kid and i sincerely hope english isnt your native tongue
hearthstone,removed,huh i was saying when i used my trial in the past it canceled automatically and i was not charged for another month followed by saying unless amazon changed their policy i dont see a need for a psa lastly if its not obvious reoccurring fee i was just mentioning how illegal that actually is im not sure what got the nerds so angry i was just mentioning this for the people who dont have prime already
hearthstone,removed,i mean it was like months ago so i was curious if it changed for trials i dont skim read and i know their current policy on reoccurring memberships for prime at least as far as trials go i did not read this one but if it merits a psa than im not the one skim reading

hearthstone,removed,so murloc paladins yeah nope not a thing not in the game and ill go on record to say theyre definitely not a thing in lore either even though im only a lorestalkerstalker so screw it lets talk something spooky so did anyone notice how in a reflection on deloras night jumpscare if you head the wrong wa oh screw it that game gets remade more often than call of duty does and writes itself into a deeper corner with each iteration trying to pretend there is still any cohesion and worse yet forwards implication hints in a former game that combine with a later game into a theory you couldve put together from the start if you had combined them properly a game theory between titles other than i like your money please give me more of it so spooky murlocs those do exist i mean did you see those coldlight things modeled straight from the deep sea in other words my damn nightmares they terrify me and so should they terrify you if you think about the implications of giving one of those things nearhuman intelligence and the ability to survive in what is honestly not even that deep water so they could probably come ashore and oh god their teeth are literal feet long see i manage with the sea being a terrible place because most things that are still in there probably just dont have the will to come out and eat me until said things grew feet and walked out of the sea once more thanks for that blizzard whats worse is a healthy case of arachnophobia or as i like to call it acompletelyreasonableattitudeagainstbeastsmanyofwhichcouldliterallyparalyseyouwithpoisonuntilyousuffocateandyourbodyfeedsmillionsofspiderlingsandifyoureluckyyoudiebeforethen its a mouthful yes still theres fighting for survival and then theres evolution towards cruelty hardly any other animal save for maybe livehost parasites look them up youre welcome has specifically evolved a method of killing not set towards being effective as much as using as few resources as possible having you suffer for the longest possible time they serve no purpose and that some people go as far as to tolerate their presence is beyond me if we cede animals awareness emotional states even then it is only logical that they too possess a sense of pain to protect themselves from harm right if we admit that animals feel suffering then why are these walking torture devices tolerated and you know whats worst there are arachnoids that live in the sea unemzal your turn to talk about the time murlocs definitely did encounter the light and i am totally wrong about everything

hearthstone,removed,your sense of entitlement is astounding
hearthstone,removed,esdde
hearthstone,removed,rewarded fuck off say that to the duplicates out of packs i received you are entitled and thats the only problem here
hearthstone,removed,yea aka compensation for terrible fucking rates go pick up your participation trophy at the gift shop kiddo
hearthstone,removed,seeing how i am buying a burger without bacon and they offer bacon if i want yeah its free
hearthstone,removed,he didnt use logic and math thats not the average dust per pack we received dumbass it was much lower since the pool of available cards was abysmal
hearthstone,removed,youre getting a better deal now stop fucking bitching holy shit
hearthstone,removed,eu cucks lul eu cucks lul
hearthstone,removed,correct not sure exactly how young but judging by his english i would say quite young indeed
hearthstone,removed,maybe no you are entitled to nothing just as we arent the only reason we were compensated is because we beta tested a bug for you cucks
hearthstone,removed,so you dont feel like you were compensated fairly for the packs which had nothing to do with you or your server not to mention you are ignorant of the fact that your eu account cannot play against my na account if we get more packs for a bug we exclusively experienced it affects your server in no way aside from the fact you get less dopamine rushes grow up the server timings suck sure but you arent their primary market nor is launching regional servers straight forward stop bitching about regional releases and start understanding why they would be like that clearly they dont fucking hate you or they would just force you to use na servers or even worse region lock the main game and just say fuck europe feel free to downvote me for not sharing your moronic opinion that blizzard hates you
hearthstone,removed,complaining about mmr even though the season just ended talking about how an all removal deck isnt effective at controling the board claiming youre using your health as resource but still going low enough that you can easily be bursted down etc all little things but fairly common knowledge my other problem with your post is you didnt give any useful suggestions you just regurgitated the same stuff this sub has for the last months
hearthstone,removed,hes bad at both easy
hearthstone,removed,sub to rfinesseboys fam
hearthstone,removed,cant wait for your next whiny shitpost in minutes
hearthstone,removed,oh fuck off
hearthstone,removed,i wouldnt care i dont expect handouts from blizzard sorry kiddo didnt know schooling was poor in canada but the fact you make blanket statements like on your side of the world is absolutely detremental to your argument fuck off you are useless

hearthstone,removed,you definitely are the poster child for the type of naivety blizzard counts on i guarantee you if you really think back to the last times you lost a battle out of was because you didnt have the card you needed when you needed it

hearthstone,removed,this twat like all the other idiots at that competition was a popularity contest based on how many tickets or how many muppets supported him game play has absolutely nothing to do with a game that a computer formulates in advance how any deck formulation is played out then it controls that formulation even more in game by providing more iwin cards from a not so random choice that had already more or less pre selected its champions prior to that match up as any cards played illogically target whatever the not so random computer decides everybody must think that twat had real skills at choosing a deck because that was all he did his gameplay was generic to that pre selected approach there was no skill in it he literally couldnt play anything else i suppose this community of idiots jerking each other off while eating each others dookies thought he is ace no just another absurdly pretentious twat having been gifted a carrot to suck as it get all this forums of dookie craving jerksters spending even more at play this rigged game he has no skill no none whatsoever when the computer decided his approach away from any probability and mathematical odds because it chucked him more or less nothing to win with when it was formulated prior on how that match would be played out i actually pity the fools on this topic thinking there as anything else in this game buying into game where the commentators are as equally stupid commentating that hey guys would you look at how the computer has granted him his choice of cards will he win oh no the computer has pre selected the opponents counter omg omg its really heating up now when the cards are dropping on how that computer preprogrammed their approach the user has simply generically dropped them according to how they set out their deck using no skill in how they logically played out their turn can feel the tension omg omg its game over the computer has chosen its winner and statistically it was based on a popularity contest because that will promote more investment when more people are following this person and more tickets were sold for their match we could almost pity this load of complete and utter retards we could argue about any other game because they have skill this game starcraft overwatch etc etc this game absolutely doesnt after choosing a deck it is generic on how it will be played out because that computer has rigged its results and game play
hearthstone,removed,bravo care inače sam pisao o tvojim radovima i na popularnom srpskom portalu ja vodim esports sekciju tamo
hearthstone,removed,oh look its this shill again still hoping for blizzard to mail you some vouchers for card packs if you vehemently defend their every move
hearthstone,removed,i have had since the beta years ago broke up with the girlfriend yesterday so its going back on my wall would appreciate a code
hearthstone,removed,preachy shill i really couldnt care less find another hobby instead of patrolling reddit all day long
hearthstone,removed,please kill yourself
hearthstone,removed,i got iam looking for someone on eu with qu€st battletags in m€ssages
hearthstone,removed,thijs twat like all the other idiots at that competition was a popularity contest based on how many tickets or how many donks supported him his game play had absolutely nothing to do with a game that a computer formulates in advance how any deck formulation is played out then it controls that formulation even more in game by providing more iwin cards from a not so random choice a choice that had already more or less pre selected its champions prior to that match up as any cards played illogically do whatever else the not so random computer decides everybody must think thjis twat had real skills at choosing his deck because that was all he did his game play was generic to the preselected approach there was no other skill it he literally couldnt play anything else he had to play the cards as they came up i suppose this community of idiots jerking each other off while eating each others dookies thought he is so awesome ace no he is not he is just another absurdly pretentious twat having been gifted a carrot to suck on because it gets all this forum of dookie craving jerksters spending even more money generating demand profit and time at playing at this rigged game he has no skill no none whatsoever because that computer decided his approach away from any probability and any mathematical based odds because it chucked him more or less nothing to win with when it was formulated prior on how that match would have been played out prior only an idiot would lose from the computer gift horses i actually pity the fools on this topic thinking there is anything else in this game buying into game where the commentators are as equally stupid commentating that hey guys would you look at how the computer has granted him his choice of cards will he win oh no the computer has preselected the opponents counter omg omg its really heating up now when the cards are dropping forgetting that computer preprogrammed their approach from any decks built up the user has simply generically dropped any cards according too how they set out their deck using no skill in how they logically played out their turn can you feel the tension omg omg its game over the computer has chosen its winner and statistically it was based on a popularity contest because that will promote even more investment when more people are following this person because more ridiculously priced tickets were sold for their match play you payed the donk we can almost pity the load of complete and utter retards on this forum thinking this game has anything else in it no pity they are good little customers buying into this games feces and they will never be at that preselected event we can argue about any other game played because they have skill games like starcraft overwatch are based on a user using skill formulating their own approach and game play the computer has little to no control this game absolutely doesnt have any skill after choosing a deck it is generic on how every game will be played out because that computer has rigged its results and game play those results and game play have absolutely nothing to do with probability or even the odds it is simply a computer setting out a preformulated approach prior to match up how much is rigged everything in this game is rigged the opponent you are fixed against they can be anybody better massively outside of your level or decks ability hey guys mr golden legend is fighting you at rank what golden legend cost more than a normal legend i havent got and it will just provide multiple matches of a class you might struggle against the cards you open from a packet watch at how they dont gain a legend or watch on how when you get a card type the next packet opened will have that same card type now when never will you get that same card again the way the computer decides on how your formulation will play out hey guys it has forced my start but i am using varied deck and it has given me an and a after the exchange yet my opponent was a face killer using some zoo deck the way the computer decides what you will be provided with when it is provided and what is ressed and what your minions attack this was all based on whatever ratio it decided prior to any matching can the user win having that assumed element of control defying any probable rigged outcome it was generic on what they dropped and when they dropped it they wouldnt logically have played any other way so screw you then it will later just disconnect them from this game if they will win insuring their loss it is even more sickening than that when you considered what is at stake here in this game it has taken another epic games fanbase rigging their investment from it this is promoted to all ages to get them spending even more what regulations did this game actually had it hasnt verified its algorithms and it hasnt protected its users investment they constantly get disconnected for no real reason except to force a loss but those algorithms arent based on math because they are rigged into preselecting a ratio an opponent how any cards attack what they grant how they grant it when they grant it these rely on the computer over the users input and how that formulation will play out all of this was done in advance which is why there is no real odds or probability in game the computer simply decides on everything meaning it is rigged not random if it was random thijs twat wouldnt be legend rank every month because nobody else is when using his decks selections it is the same as most online gambling algorithms used the house wins by taking your investment promoting more investment because the less you win the more you will spend and the harder it is to beat the more you try too beat when there is money at stake you will spend more money and if you win just enough you will become addicted when that game is granting a reward rigging your purchase now easily provides its pros with a higher rake back or that house because they promote more spending when they are streaming their wins guaranteeing your investment this is done even more from dailies that are tailored to the individual because everybody gets different quests the type of cards opened in a packet what each individual gains are uniquely tailored to each player although really it is just manipulating the odds based on algorithm that has already formulated how any match plays out controlling every aspect of each game played a game that is relying entirely on a computer the purpose of that was creating more investment by its donks this game and its devs shouldnt have allowed this atrocity there is a special place for them a game that cannot play as a card game because it cannot be played with cards when it is rigged by the computer there is no way to replicate this game on cards immediately that should have told you that this game stinks and that it hasnt got any skill the user was simply a patsy used in rigging more investment back into this product
hearthstone,removed,i might have not organized my original post as well as i would have liked but yes youre rightparticularly about the part that streamers now routinely show their inhome webcam view as a part of their stream whats interesting is that youre seeing threads and comments pop up all the time on this reddit that read similar to dude hates the game yet he streams day after day because he has to all this guy does is rag on the game yet he streams hours a day and on and on im not a big watcher of streams nor do i stream myself but the similarities between the two professions particularly the part of forcing yourself to stream whether or not you like what youre doing at the moment caught me as an interesting point of discussion regarding the similarities between the two professions additionally in another way the two professions seem to be similar is that the barrier to entry is very low this is probably why any time that i browse any other hearthstone resource aside from reddit and sometimes including reddit you see all the selfpromotion from hearthstone players who are trying to make it big via streaming while they sit at rank with little content to provide
hearthstone,removed,its just as logical as the claims your making no its you being a hypocrite asking for evidence and then providing none for your own claims reread what i complained about there is really no point in trying to address anything you bring up because you just goalpost shift and perform mental gymnastics to avoid admitting you are wrongand then continue to try and pull every dumb thought out of your ass and hope something sticks the difference between the posts is like night and day acknowledge that putting a price tag on the brawl has nothing to do with the qualityskill level of the player and we can move on to the next point
hearthstone,removed,just traded a tyrande code for st€m ıtems he commented on my profile in spanish so if someone from the latino countries could tell me what he said it would be nice d im tyrandetrade in st€m too dd me for the most reliable trde for tyrande trades in the last days
hearthstone,removed,yo tengo tyrande code s willing trd€ st€m gm€s or ıtems csgό skıns or whatever or pypl friend me on st€m username turkeyfox sorry to have to type like that gotta get around the filters you know how it is
hearthstone,removed,i voted for amnesiac love the tears from the thjis fangays
hearthstone,removed,what is wrong with you are you blind are you stupid yes you are and you are such a dumb age you believe in fables easily manipulated into spending watch a film like runner runner if you think the random gaming gods have any fair play they dont because it is driving your purchase and rigging your investment random means rigged and when a preprogrammed computer is controlling everything that is random it is only because it has been rigged the algorithms are no different on this game this game is no different too a slot machine it has no probability or math because all it has done is preselected in advance exactly how your choice of deck will approach every match this generic to how you will lay your cards and all you did was selected that deck a deck that no matter what you select it can be beaten by every other deck selected because it relies on a computer rigging that luck or what approach is granted if that isnt controlled what isnt open your eyes you dumb smeg
hearthstone,removed,it is reality you thought your random game wouldnt soon be manipulated even more by corporate greed what is the average users investment into this product the average user is spending an average of about on this game you tell me they are just going to let that randomly game no they have made a bot server connecting the majority of every player to formulated bots rigging their ratio and ranks they were doing it regardless when there was no probability employed this was decided prematch up a champion is producing how much more investment the price of watching that champion was forget about any decks that then gets everybody even more into this game to also get acclaim that hey made them into a little moron like the rest of every moron playing this game you would think these world class players would beat something because that is the odds right i mean they beat everybody else getting there no it is freaking rigged by a computer favoring which draws and that was probably based on popularity and tickets sold
hearthstone,removed,if i am your hero what does that make you it turns you into a sheep easily influenced into what ends obviously with this game it was just so easy manipulating into you spending because that was the purpose of its design it has a huge inventory of cards that you wont collect them all for never and then they will just bring out more that also have a monetary cost using so many different packets again making sure you wont acquire any of the best of them for never the classes werent balanced because you need one to smash you with easier so the cards were made to be used by everybody with super epic class abilities that hey maybe they just shouldnt be using the same cards when they extra powerful the cards themselves werent formulated to turn or a user selecting out their approach because why do we want to draw this game out when we can just kill you in arent they then also generating bitcoins as well from all the hours you spend playing it never getting anywhere because to break into that little club of is favored on what they have decided
hearthstone,removed,doesnt matter could still write mana its not like he didnt have resources to rape
hearthstone,removed,and rip his grammar
hearthstone,removed,the only people i regularly warned for are swag and teemoskins where you can find dozens of people who said they got stolen of their you should be thankful for me for doing that since i prevented that for a lot of people
hearthstone,removed,shut up faggot no one asked you anything
hearthstone,removed,dont like it dont watch it fuck off somewhere else
hearthstone,removed,i cant even begin to wrap my mind around that logic no one plays deathwing expecting to win no one plays faceless behemoth expecting to win no one plays mind control expecting to win just because you are using the maximum mana costs available shouldnt equate into rng that can decide games but hey if yogg fucked each player exactly one game apiece who the fuck cares right
hearthstone,removed,dude there are only two of them so its either of them and not any your english makes me want to cut myself

hearthstone,removed,i deleted them so i could get the skid mark of a comment chain taken off if youd like to trace back to reddit before i deleted them and show it off go right ahead it wasnt a sound defeat it was me being tired of your frankly bullshit you were shown to be a hypocrite and you had no comment for that did you
hearthstone,removed,no idea what your talking about but who ever is in charge aint gonna be patcheing shit any time soon all goes down the drain blizzart wont patch op shit and tempostorm is dead stupid rexnad eloise just dont have no tits game could have been a commercial sucsess for everyone but blizzart squandered it hard
hearthstone,removed,i have to disagree with you here a celebrity isnt recording and broadcasting their personal life recording it and broadcasting it for them without their permission is of course wrong however streamers do not have the luxury of broadcasting to everyone except the person theyre playing at the moment there is no way to pick and choose i dont think its right to stream snipe you should use the information within any particular match to win it but equating stream sniping to paparazzi is ridiculous
hearthstone,removed,shut up mr mayhem yes i have and its a breeze when its not gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman after gold shaman its people who are actually good at the game

hearthstone,removed,hahahahahaha you have lost your fucking marbles son
hearthstone,removed,you act like people are advocating for lynchings its x thumbnail of a black guys face that some people in some twitch chats decide to post when a monkey sound is heard that is not terrifying you might not find it funny at all but if that truly terrifies you then you have a serious issue also people that get irrationally upset by twitch emotes are exactly the reason why the people who post those emotes do it
hearthstone,removed,quit this shitty low quality game forever and never look back
hearthstone,removed,these really are my favorites posts theyre so clearly misinformed and biased please never stop posting such high quality well thought out posts youre a treasure
hearthstone,removed,nothing fun about emoteing every single game unless ur a child

hearthstone,removed,na add me if you need help with friend quests
hearthstone,removed,but im a mistake so yeah ftfy
hearthstone,removed,wow unbelievable you know what else is unbelievable these insane deals on league of angels for the chinese new year we are having a marketplace sale up to off on the entire shop use my referral to claim this limited offer
hearthstone,removed,i find it strange that hearthstone redefined online ccgs yet the imitators are treated as the really admirable ones i think shadowverse is pretty cool but too flawed to really feel great for example the fact that anything in your deck that gets its flavor from evolving becomes just vanilla stats once you run out of your two or three evolves and the fact that some of your board slots can be filled up by nonfunctional persistent effect cards that are permanently in place and you have no way to remove the community seems to view this as a feature get good at not wasting slots but thats just an excuse for a flaw i like the art although as an anime fan i feel it is a little too genericlooking and little too inconsistent between anime style and westernlooking fantasy art another thing that i think shadowverse doesnt do all that well is make the cards feel like substantial objects that you want to collect this is something hearthstone does very well
hearthstone,removed,nice fagt
hearthstone,removed,unnerf yogg you fucktards i hope you all die fucckkkk yououuuuuuuu
hearthstone,removed,i actually want you to fucking die you piece of shit
hearthstone,removed,sickest play of the day

hearthstone,removed,you cant really say which is better you can only say which you prefer can i just say that hearthstone is a bastardized casualized version of mtg for people with no tcg experience and shadowverse is a casualized bastardized version of hearthstone both are just terrible games compared to actually skilled tcgs they are just phone apptier of complexity both are just glorified grind simulators for aggro decks
hearthstone,removed,not sure sometimes it happens my daddy thought i was a natural blower but actually i am way better when taken from behind

hearthstone,removed,hehehe if you think that a complex long running discussion in the hearthstone community is just a new player who doesnt understand the game complaining about a card because youve had some disagreements with me you seem to be the immature misinformed new player here go watch some videos
hearthstone,removed,this guy is a hack he comments on recorded games if you watch him regularly you will see impossible calls like this on the regular
hearthstone,removed,calling blizzard out on their own dick sucking sub risky move the retards are already out ready to jump on some blizz cock
hearthstone,removed,sounds mad
hearthstone,removed,racist
hearthstone,removed,begger
hearthstone,removed,people understand sarcasm your just shit at it
hearthstone,removed,i am not bad at the game i opened dust in my rank this month
hearthstone,removed,look at the usernames promoting this shit hmm where are they from
hearthstone,removed,i complain about the lack of averages manipulated by a computer and not matching fairly starting is worse than not starting because the opponent has a greater selection and a coin to lay the same turn early
hearthstone,removed,thank you for the much better games selection magic is awesome absolutely incomparable thanks i will give them a try
hearthstone,removed,not when you are hunter getting nothing to drop on a card selection
hearthstone,removed,funny dota isnt blizzard anymore because blizzard only make crap now yea a nub would complain of grammar ironic
hearthstone,removed,i am wondering why it has its sub when it is freemium cancer that has a heap of shills promoting it
hearthstone,removed,that is absolute nonsense listen to the point i raised instead of trolling your lack of worth perhaps you are that shill it figures on start you gain a card computer generated selection these can be outside of you ability to play a starting turn from the start and then by the time you can play a turn because you deck for example contains and average of drops and it only selected higher drops and after the exchange you had nothing to produce on any turns with and by the time you could play a turn you are dead in as little a turn as turn learn to read what was wrote and stop accusing other people of your own lack of comprehension
hearthstone,removed,not at all i adore magic i dont adore a shill driven exploitive game a game made by monkeys who dont speak english the grammar on most cards is abhorrently designed for exploiting each card away from fair play instead of balancing a fair game the mechanics are redundant they are based almost entirely on computer prompted luck and it doesnt matter the users ability because they still reply on a computer prompting rock paper scissors and the design has allowed better hp or selection to that users why isnt obvious to it pyramid scheme that is designed to take your money giving nothing in return you need to spend to compete so that guarantees a profit from an unregulated game
hearthstone,removed,pay some shill for what giving shit mechanics oh you paid them why for thats dead before you can play a turn
hearthstone,removed,yes you can
hearthstone,removed,all the shills come out to play it figures and the rest are too stupid to be anything other than sheep
hearthstone,removed,yep and now it isnt even based from bnet unless you playing that rubbish version because it is steam only
hearthstone,removed,you can get golden epic and golden rare and normal rare go too hell
hearthstone,removed,hey shill nobody enjoys it just some dumb shills invested into it they have their precious legends and so they promote it because if a few dumb kids but into it it makes money easy scheme that requires you to spend it has lost all balance and all formulation because it never had any mechanics outside of an exploit designed to shill you money lifeless cancerous game the product of a dying brand still exploiting warcraft only churning out crap today the new diablo was rubbish the new starcraft was rubbish nothing like former models that disney film make me vomit the same as wows pandas made for year olds i stopped playing after it after wotlk because it had nothing left in at all i blame the night elves freaking paladins and it only got worse than they stopped all my fun in the bgs with experience until today it only tries to get the little weiners playing
hearthstone,removed,you are full of shit i got dust upon opening my rank ago i got a rare flare i got epic warlock demon dmg to the lock i got a pirate deckhand
hearthstone,removed,nonsense if you get nothing to drop and have a limited selection only offering your higher drops and the turn drawn it give more higher drops tell me what good was a smaller selection shudda up my averages i have already suggested i have a range with the most cards for turn yet what happens when i am starting times and gaining nothing to play in those starting turns and i am dead before i can play a turn the game should have had the cards selected into hotkeys it hasnt it should have provide a user selection on start it should have had more hp it shouldnt have allowed legends to be selected by ordinary minions it shouldnt have had ress sick minions casting before they can play it should have done a lot more things to balance it play some cards are just pointless
hearthstone,removed,yes i know as with all of warcraftstarcraft bnet fan made running through bnet now dota a much better game plays through steam what didnt you understand
hearthstone,removed,nonsense
hearthstone,removed,fuck off i opened boxes with my rank i told you what was in my boxes i have no idea why you are a turd why are you a turd you are just a turd because that is whatyourlifelessworld is a toilet now go away and get some rank to get nicer golds instead of sniffing butts using that toilet
hearthstone,removed,begger
hearthstone,removed,they were nice to me when was that wrote they have updated like screw you for daily gold i got a golden flare it is a rare hunter card for the second month i also got a golden epic demon i got standard deckhand and also some dust
hearthstone,removed,piss off you attack me with goading down votes calling me a liar then you wish me a good day after trolling your feces go back to your toilet have a shit day like your lifeless computer generated world
hearthstone,removed,what you have nothing you are a stupid little troll linking some article written before any recent updates i dont know why i had what i have i just did have what i said i did all you have done is be a maggot like your year old name suggest attack anyboidy saying anything about this precious piece of feces your a gollum a completely useless moron blizzard has made it money from or perhaps you are that dumb shill
hearthstone,removed,i am a hunter asshole yes if my cards fall and i can lay some minions in the dps race it is great stop trolling irrelevant nonsense away from the point if you got only higher drops what can you play against that shaman hunter getting there drops or even that lock you are dead in turn a mage can do this from non start and a shaman by turn a paladin will also rape you by early turns
hearthstone,removed,i got a flare this month the same as last month i got a golden epic pit lord demon i got a deckhand some being a year old turd
hearthstone,removed,please go away whahaha i am going to tell mommy on you for everybody sake who has low esteem you need a nappy change all you have done is goad to further attack me by calling me as many names you have no human decency you belong away from the rest of humanity i have gotten annoyed because youre so utterly stupid all you have done is attack calling me a liar and everything else because your heap of shit monkey made cancerous game with its exploitive shill mechanics is the highlight of your pathetic life i never asked too talk to you and i would probably be arrested if we met god forbid that happens as i would never want to meet a disgusting person like yourself a walking sewer
hearthstone,removed,i said fuck off back to where you came from and that clearly isnt somewhere nice i dont even want too guess because nobody reasonable communicates by calling people a liar and shouting troll for making a heading you came in here trolling like the rest of these butt fairies craaling up peoples shit eating up blizzards vomit as the shill your milk money making crap freemiums and worse games today i havent got on my username and now you are repeating me like that dumb stupid chimp proving your age
hearthstone,removed,please get fact rights dont stutter breathe first but it must be hard with your natural slur this douche has created another username too attack me twice as much
hearthstone,removed,listen fuck off if you have three cards and you get a drop a drop and an drop it provides you with an drop then a drop then a drop what are you going to fucking do just shud up i dont care about shill videos mage has mana wyrm he use coin put second mana wyrm he cast freeze he cast freeze and icelance missile he cast fireball what happened there
hearthstone,removed,i am not trolling i didnt come into this thread acting like you have i havent said anything incorrect
hearthstone,removed,ok
hearthstone,removed,woot how has somebody gained dust on rank made rank
hearthstone,removed,what have i said wrong please enlighten me dota ran on bnet now it doesnt the game isnt fair if a coinflip isnt flipping that coin the game itself is a stinking atrocity prove from the users here playing it hardly any of them have been reasonable or tolerant there is an exception there was a single person who i thanked for their advice they were reasonable and offered a helpful suggestion to the error presented thank god their is humanity on this planet the rest have only attacked down voting goading being absolutely unreasonable calling me every name you are one of those people the world and humanity is simply better off without attack first ask question later never fully comprehending anything else no i am not correct for making a sub stating this games abundant errors did it threaten your payroll or perhaps you are just generally intolerant to criticism so when anybody says anything about your precious gollum it goads your own insanity
hearthstone,removed,exactly so you are because when you created the account time has stopped and thats why you troll the hearthstone forums for worth psychologically i was always speaking to somebody mentally impaired
hearthstone,removed,i said you are a gutter i said you are intolerant vile shit stain on humanity i dont care about your pathetic medals at this monkey made game proven for your monkey made comment haha you are a clown come and get me i am waiting monkey
hearthstone,removed,what a fucking pedo i heard this guy touches year old girls look at that moustache
hearthstone,removed,never lucky

hearthstone,removed,rhowneatisthat
hearthstone,removed,yeah you can tell blizzard failing by pulling tens of millions of dollars monthly on hearthstone and being one of the most prolific video game businesses in the world i am not putting any words in your mouth you specifically stated what needs to happen is a constant casual flow of information they have to learn to communicate with us in a casual way and we have to learn that not everything they tell us is going to happen exactly how they originally planned it thats something that happens in a healthy relationship so that should probably be the goal rather than just keeping everything secret for fear of a misunderstanding so what words have i put in your mouth all i have reiterated is your claim that blizzard needs to constantly update us on what theyre doing and no how does that match any definition of irony have i ever claimed i am being nice that you owe me anything does any of my argument hinge at all on me not being rude or condescending

couldnt empty a boot of excrement were the instructions on the heel you are a canker a sore that wont go away i would rather kiss a lawyer than be seen with you try to edit your responses of unnecessary material before attempting to impress us with your insight the evidence that you are a nincompoop will still be available to readers but they will be able to access it more rapidly you snailskulled little rabbit would that a hawk pick you up drive its beak into your brain and upon finding it rancid set you loose to fly briefly before spattering the ocean rocks with the frothy pink shame of your ignoble blood may you choke on the queasy convulsing nausea of your own trite foolish beliefs you are weary stale flat and unprofitable you are grimy squalid nasty and profane you are foul and disgusting youre a fool an ignoramus and what meaning do you expect your delusional selfimportant statements of unknowing inexperienced opinion to have to us who think and reason what fantasy do you hold that you would believe that your tinyfisted tantrums would have more weight than that of a leprous desert rat spinning rabidly in a circle waiting for the bite of the snake you are a waste of flesh you have no rhythm you are ridiculous and obnoxious you are the moral equivalent of a leech you are a living emptiness a meaningless void you are sour and senile you are a disease you puerile

different dimension of stupid you are transstupid stupid metastupid some pure essence of a stupid so uncontaminated by anything else as to be beyond the laws of physics that we know im sorry i cant go on this is an epiphany of stupid for me after this you may not hear from me again for a while i dont have enough strength left to deride your ignorant questions and halfbaked comments about unimportant trivia or any of the rest of this drivel duh i mean really stringing together a bunch of insults among a load of babbling was hardly effective true these are rudimentary skills that many of us normal people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering but we sometimes forget that there are challenged persons in this world who find these things more difficult if i had known that this was your case then i would have never read your post it just wouldnt have been right sort of like parking in a handicap space i wish you the best of luck in the emotional and social struggles that seem to be placing such a demand on you youre an idiot a moron of the highest order youre so stupid its a wonder and a pity you can remember to breath intelligent ideas bounce off your head as if it were coated with teflon creative thoughts take alternate transportation in order to avoid even being in the same state as you if you had an original thought it would die of loneliness before the hour was out on an intelligence scale of to corresponding to the highest attainable iq youre rating is so far into negative numbers that one would need to travel into another quantum reality in order to even catch a distant glimpse of it your personality is that of a rabid chihuahua intent on destroying its own tail your powers of observation are akin to those of the bird that keeps slamming into the picture window trying to get that other bird it keeps seeing you are walking talking proof that you dont have to be sentient to survive and that barnum was thinking of you when he uttered his immortal phrase regarding the birth of a sucker you are at varying times tedious boring and even occasionally earth shatteringly hilarious in your idiocy routinely childish moronic pathetic wretched disgusting and pitiful you are wholly without any redeeming social grace or value if god ever decides to give the planet an enema youd better run like the wind because anywhere you stand is a suitable place for the insertion there is no animal so disgusting so vile that it deserves comparison to you for even the lowest dirtiest most parasitic member of the animal kingdom fills an ecological niche you fill no niche to call you a parasite would be injurious and defamatory to the thousands of honest parasitic species you are worse than vermin for vermin do not pretend to be what it is not you are truly human garbage you are a fraudulent lying predatory charlatan you are of less worth than a burntout light bulb you will forever live in shame you have nothing to say and godwins law does not apply when writing about you you are the antimidas for all that you touch becomes valueless and unusable mothers gather their children close when you appear you are an aberration a corruption and a boil that needs to be lanced you are a poison in need of being vomited you are a tooth so rotten it infects the whole body you are sperm that should have been captured in a condom and flushed down a toilet i dont like you i dont like anybody who has as little respect for others as you do go away you swine youre a putrescent mass a walking vomit you are a spineless little worm deserving nothing but the profoundest contempt you are a jerk a cad and a weasel your life is a monument to stupidity you are a stench a revulsion a big suck on a sour lemon you are a curdled staggering mutant dwarf smeared richly with the effluvia and offal accompanying your alleged birth into this world meaningful to no one abandoned by the pukedrooling giggling beasts that sired you and then killed themselves in recognition of what they had done i will never get over the embarrassment of belonging to the same species as you you are a monster an ogre a malformity i wretch at the very thought of you you have all the appeal of a paper cut lepers avoid you you are vile worthless less than nothing you are a weed a fungus and the dregs of this earth and did i mention you smell monkeys look down on you even sheep wont have sex with you you are unreservedly pathetic starved for attention and lost in a land that reality forgot you are a waste of flesh on a good day youre a halfwit you are deficient in all that lends character you have the personality of wallpaper you are dank and filthy you are asinine and benighted you are the source of all unpleasantness you spread misery and sorrow wherever you go you are a fiend and a coward and you have bad breath you are degenerate noxious and depraved i feel debased just for knowing you exist i despise everything about you and i wish you would go away i cannot believe how incredibly stupid you are the only thing worse than your logic is your manners maybe later in life after you have learned to read write study spell and count you will have more success true these are rudimentary skills that many of us normal people take for granted that everyone has an easy time of mastering it just wouldnt have been right sort of like parking

hearthstone,removed,its simple actually nearly all the people who play this game are mouthbreathing morons who think that they are badasses because they can play rush decks and thus smother creativity in its crib they would do the world a favor if they just simply slit their throats let me rephrase this because of hs lacks absolutely all complexity compared to duelyst or mtg it attracts the biggest playerbase of inbred braindamaged year olds team also doesnt help by refusing to improve their game and releasing lazy and unimaginative design like carrion grub or flamewreathed faceless which are honestly just sad cards they refuse to take advantage of their card game and make actually good stuff which requirest thinking but even if they did it wouldnt see play because in hs the agressor is always in a better position and taunt is just a bad mechanic a pale shadow compared to block the game will never improve because of bad design and creative laziness

hearthstone,removed,another generic comment which doesnt actually illustrate intelligence
hearthstone,removed,your other comment was quite clearly meant to offend him you absolute condescending imbecile just because he shut your mouth with an argument you cant respond to doesnt mean you can just say lel u mad bro and that makes you right

hearthstone,removed,thanks
hearthstone,removed,it is obvoius that you dont understand what you are saying you little troll just because i am right doesnt mean you can just leave the discussion in the way you do tell me exactly where blizz is making moneywith tavern brawl except for heroic brawl put in some statistics and everything so your outlandish claim might have some credibility fucking troll
hearthstone,removed,will you scrubs ever learn stop posting about this fetal alcohol syndrome looking fool hes idiot he shouldnt ever be put on any pedestal to begin with and youre just flat wasting your time
hearthstone,removed,you remind me of the guy that recently kidnapped and abused a man live on facebook because the guy was a trump supporter ffs grow up show some class and good sportsmanship losing to something you dont like isnt the end of the world and your behavior affects all of us for better or worse
hearthstone,removed,leeroy jenkins created a strategy that revolved around trying to defeat your opponent in one turn without requiring any cards on the board fighting for board control and battles between minions make an overall game of hearthstone more fun and compelling but taking damage in one turn is not particularly fun or interactive
hearthstone,removed,thats because this subreddits rules are written by idiots
hearthstone,removed,so how does it feel being so wrong
hearthstone,removed,you were totally wrong
hearthstone,removed,eu looking for friend who can share quest i can also help with the spectating quests or any how possible
hearthstone,removed,youd be right if those decks played the same way against it when people queue up against a hunter they expect agro so they play with that in mind and as far as healing goes yeah that is a bit of a weakness of the deck thats a limitation of the hunter class though not much i can do about that it seems to do alright against pirates though as long as i can draw my early game board control like quickshot powershot or explosive trap ive been looking at adding an abomination to help with the matchup as well
hearthstone,removed,can you link me relevant useful content note a streamer making a play or seeing rng does not count

hearthstone,removed,jesus christ this is embarrassing how can you even type this stupid shit
hearthstone,removed,when will you retire so that we can finally enjoy this game
hearthstone,removed,yeah and it shows team is just winging it and doesnt have a clue what it is actually doing or better put they lack any real vision
hearthstone,removed,how is ben brode still lead designer does blizzard monitor his nonesense at all its not even his decisions in the games design that makes him seem unfit his points are so silly i dont know why hes even posting here hes making blizzard look bad practically this entire thread is against him and his blatantly childish examples he needs to respond with better answers if he is going to respond at all but if i were him i wouldnt know where to begin defending these moot game design decisions there is no reason why a card cant lose a strength but not be compensated at all for it if ancient of lore was mana we still wouldnt use it but mana really we wouldnt want to lose the soul of the card or anything
hearthstone,removed,its pretty embarrassing to watch how balancing is done in this game i dont know a single other game where it is handled this way its even more embarrassing because blizzard has other game where it is handled pretty well
hearthstone,removed,what did you expect from someone called
hearthstone,removed,theres a on reddit or at least there was before he got his account suspended who plays hearthstone and i guess a suspension means he can basically just read reddit without doing much else so hi uwesleyvincent
hearthstone,removed,shut up hoe
hearthstone,removed,the balance in hearthstone is completely retarded i wonder if there is actually a balance team or they just slap on numbers on cards aggro got worse and worse after naxx yet blizzard continues to print aggro decks with more power each and every expansion now we got to a point where losing a game on turn is a normal thing and i absolutely hate it i prefer a game where you have to weigh risks and make an educated guess on what is the best play but i guess im the only one who likes a game like that it seems
hearthstone,removed,you seem to not be familiar with nigerlease herculese
hearthstone,removed,its a quote from jango me and my friends just labelled it on this mtg card pls dont kill me
hearthstone,removed,i remember at the same time voice lines were found for tyrande there were voice lines found for miev shadowsong i dont remember her name exactly
hearthstone,removed,googled shadowverse came up with this fucking sold
hearthstone,removed,what shocks me is that shadowverse got a quarter of that its huge
hearthstone,removed,looks like shadowverse is doing well im going to check it out do they have any new player specials
hearthstone,removed,uporkton never buys the reddit gold
hearthstone,removed,haha a woman on reddit
hearthstone,removed,that takes such a little amount of thought skill and planning you mean like pirate warrior where its literally a coin flip on whether they get a good draw and you get the cards you need hmm heres an idea maybe you like playing against pirate warrior because dragon priest beats it renolock is far stronger than jade druid and dragon priest is far more cancer just shut the fuck up
hearthstone,removed,lorewalker
hearthstone,removed,yup which is why your delusional attempt at one is working for you since you are ignoring the evidence that only the resulting weapon was being discussed wow you are stupid
hearthstone,removed,ok the resulting weapon is the same is that all were allowed to say according to you no you can say what you want but you cant say i said something i didnt which you are
hearthstone,removed,you seem to be getting confused here the irony its more that there are other factors at play that make fiery war axe better than rogue hero power and deadly poison which was not something i was talking about all i said was weapon weapon its you muppets that derailed it into the shitfest you are still trying to peddle as fact stop trying to put text in my posts none of what you are saying is relevant as which is better was never part of the discussion got that good now actually fuck off
hearthstone,removed,how did i do any of that you talking about manacosts or other factors is irrelevant only thing that was said by me is that fwa is the same as deadly and hero power and it is nothing else end of discussion yet you persisted in bring up irrelevance manacosts which one is better and then attempted to argue something that was never mentioned are you even reading any of this to yourself yes hence i am trying to help you dumbarse by explaining it to you repeatedly however this is the last time you are too stupid
hearthstone,removed,when you play fwa what do you get when you play hero power and deadly poison what do you get do you get the same thing yes i am calling you stupid why because you are being fucking stupid
hearthstone,removed,uh huh so given evidence there are peoplecompanies willing to manipulate rng you dismiss it and then go full on fanboy ive yet to see this from blizzard if rational thinking makes me a fanboy so be it i prefer this to being a conspiracy nut thank you very much the gadgetzan rng fuck up favoring multiclass cards totally didnt happen at all nope nope right dude of course it did happen but it was corrected almost immediately and as you said it was a fuck up not some calculated manipulation so what even is your fucking problem here

hearthstone,removed,i dont understand anything so ill accuse people of trolling ill make it really reeeeally simple for you moron packs give dust they only give cards in order to get dust you must disenchant cards packs do not have an average dust value of anything because they only contain cards which you in most cases will never be crafting or using

hearthstone,removed,it seems youve got a decent amount of people backing you up so i just want to speak to the counter ive played tons of online games and i absolutely love that hearthstone doesnt allow me to directly communicate with my opponent i get the benefit of knowing im playing against a real person without having to deal with fuck u fag that deck is trash ill fkn kill ur family sure its a stereotype but online gamers who use the communication features of games are fucking awful human beings and im so glad i dont have that to turn me off of a game i genuinely like playing

hearthstone,removed,ben brode is an utter sociopath no mentally sane person with empathy for other human beings could straight up lie to millions of gamers without even being sorry he is cutthroat and would do anything to get ahead in the game dev world he will lie manipulate and abuse anyone he can just so he has the chance to get a tiny bit ahead in the world all signs point towards him being a complete lunatic never been married no kids lead designer of a succesful videogame designer positions have a higher than average chance to be worked by sociopaths unknown past probably jewish exgf has a restraining order against him
hearthstone,removed,i called him a moron because he is wrong apparently you are a moron too but dont take my word for it heres a link that uses data to verify my point over the course of tracked games zoo is unfavored in the matchup the main reason is that zoo literally cant do enough damage to kill the warrior im sorry but regardless of whether or not you think im smart the data doesnt lie but feel free to keep living in whatever alternate reality that you prefer
hearthstone,removed,wow people still play this piece of shit game
hearthstone,removed,because they cause a significant amount of damage for companies like blizzard i dont think you realize what downtimes mean for multibillion companies like activision blizzard thats no joke and goes way beyond you couldnt play a childrens card game lul it means less than for someone whos struggling for money it didnt ruin them the sentence should be the same as if he ddosed a small site because rich shouldnt have better treatment than poor

hearthstone,removed,i hope he chokes and everybody else playing this rigged game there is no skill in this game at all watch and look at how the computer choose every aspect of this game it has already preselected that formulation before anybody has sat down choosing exactly how every card sequence would go so what have you done this is massively away from any math try it place of your cards as lets say a now watch when with cards remaining no card hang how has those reno players always got reno it selects exactly how your cards will attack and where they attack away from any math how is ragnoros hitting your hero through minions on the board because it has already rigged its result but you dumb monkeys have bought into it to make spot the white guy championships richer white faces in stinks and he only got there because the dailies are rigged he kept getting the max while everybody else got the minimum because those are rigged to the individual his packets opened more legends than everybody else who nothing that is rigged top the individual he got there because where everybody else is connecting into the bot server hearthstone has a bot server folks with bots designed to make everybody else ratio balance out to a win loss except for spot the white guy he think he has skills at a computer rigging its play every stinking part of hearthstone is rigged then the stupid people rigging it couldnt even balance the classes out they couldnt even make selective cards so you have real op class using the same shit as everybody else plus there op ness leading to massive imbalance then you have the stinking filthy cheats deliberately cheating and disconnecting players from this unplayable game why would blizzard not fix its servers because it probably them killing your connection that relogs instantly after your match loss the guy is freaking turd like every other turd playing a game designed to rob them
hearthstone,removed,
hearthstone,removed,at least your son hanged himself in the bathroom of a gas station but thijs rogue deck can never be undone
hearthstone,removed,learn your retarded op imbalanced class hey guys its the priest it steals minions why it is already using every minion already and has really cheap dragon minions just to make it more op really cheap minions that give legendary minions it then fully clears the board with a massive aoe arsenal and it has plenty of those then it resses minions to full health cheap for nothing it draws on additional cards easy it buffs minions super easy into ridiculous over powered minions to make it even more op then it heals and it can also attack with the same hero ability who ever designed the priest should have been made to bite the curb
hearthstone,removed,it a generic walnut responding why do you not considered that in order to make a balanced skilled game it should rely on user input like the user selecting their starting approach to make a game balanced means if a priest can aoe everything to death that your max attack minion holy bombed or circle of healing as it gets deathwing from a curator so should every other class importantly the way to make balanced calsses would have been limiting which creatures they can select and not robbing ressing buffing so op the priest can kill by turn folks its bots do this frequently simply from mega buffing a minion off a coin start
hearthstone,removed,fucking bonobo
hearthstone,removed,where else am i going to shout at it subreddit is an open discussion not a support group for idiots this game was made by monkey for monkeys look at the inequality at the world event out of pull the other one we know why that is the white guy make a game it thinks will have value and fairplay then guess where later makes the cheats and hacks this game was more malicious than that it is use the same useless gambling algorithms where math and probability have nothing to do with the odds it was simply rigged from the get go insuring its lack of approach and formulation to rig its results and keep everybody else struggling i dare you take a legend rank cards deck a deck proven by youtube of being legend rank of or whatever and then try hitting legend rank with it i bet you wont why is that because that legend has already been rigged there is no skill in this game you might as well just let the computer play your turns after setting them a deck how do you achieve when it is giving the same ratio because maybe you will get so really cool cards to play with eventually it is no good if they wont draw and when they do you will just get the game disconnecting you regardless to make you lose everybody who made this game should be put in arena to give them a sense of balance a game that has no genre it is not a boardcard game because it cannot play on a board or on the cards it promotes because it is a game that has been rigged by a computer more downvotes thijs is a twat yea i sponsored him to because there might be packets of unplayable shit in it but i hope he chokes
hearthstone,removed,yo tengo tyrande code s willing trd€ st€m gm€s or ıtems csgό skıns or whatever or pypl friend me on st€m username turkeyfox sorry to have to type like that gotta get around the filters you know how it is
hearthstone,removed,there is you are absolutely blind the daily quests are rigged to the individual why is that the packets of cards are rigged as in what they opened this is recorded to the individual your match is rigged on how it selects what it selects what it resses how resses how it attacks then it is rigged further where this game has a bot server this game has the most disconnections error out of any game on the planet and it has the most hacks out of any game on this planet you are just some dumb cur who believe in random luck are you insane there is no probability then is proven frequently throughout your gaming experience like in that example of ragnoros firing at you through a board of seven minions reno always being reno when they need reno hang on when i play reno wheres wallie this approach wasnt based on probability opr math rather an algorithm formulating its approach prior to your match up so if that has been rigged what hasnt you dumb curr of course it was a conspiracy when everything has been rigged why wouldnt it be so kind computer is gonna later make you win take that legend rank deck i did last month the sep legend rank and guess what i could even break rank with it hang on i have invested so much money into this game getting those cards then i cant even get the same legend rank not only that this game is forcibly disconnecting me making me lose even more where it hasnt protected my investment the majority of the people i am playing are all bots there approach has been preprogrammed that mage with mana wyrms in their entire deck has always drawn on start hang on really now it babbling books but you catch my drift and he still playing reno by turn although now he has got an extra flamestrike and extra frostbolt no freaking math
hearthstone,removed,the word is sponsor doughnut perhaps you should look at the promotion which also uses the word sponsor bumba clot go crawl up somebody elses shit this one is so dumb he didnt look at the promotion
hearthstone,removed,look its the bluelatern but no its not green thats not clever and so he needs a smack for being a rip off clone which culture does that and probably also needs a nappy change when wearing those pants inside out so what still a common troll despite of the inherent eyes or those contacts thats why it was color blind go back to dork school geek
hearthstone,removed,two tyrande cod€s onlyy dollrs
hearthstone,removed,the word blizzard used was sponsor a champion in its promotion because all the money that has been ripped of all of the rest of its fan base has gone to a choice of white guys and i picked well one from europe that was called this twat i might get so card but then i might not then it takes it all the data and now it crowns it winner based on ratings because computers are just so good at rigging things the promotion you sponsored was watching that twats progress through an absurdly priced ticket no thank you all i was doing was watching a computer and some really stupid commentators get really excited about how the computer took this twats selection and might provide them with a win but this twat wasnt doing much winning anyhow if this twat won i might get some really useless cards that if i open will mean i might not get a legend because it will reset the other packets that i have been opening timers
hearthstone,removed,that emo kid looks and talks like an idiot i couldnt care less if he loses
hearthstone,removed,lol how dare i its just as logical as the claims your making gold is more affordable than gold wow you know numbers that are smaller than good for you if the starting price was gold then gold seems like a huge discount comparatively its just the shock factor of gold right out of the gate that people were upset with obviously if you go from a free game mode to a entrance fee mode people will be upset theres just no way around that theyve just added the new quests also that make it much easier for people to complete them and get gold more affordable less upset people not no upset people if you dont think reddit wouldnt have still been in an uproar at gold youre naive probably because the rewards would have been skewed much more highly towards more wins as compared to the current ratios sure i dont have any numbers to back this up but the way theyve currently skewed the rewards at the current price point leads me to believe that at a gold price point you would not have won a single pack until your or win people who play brawl also play arena and ladder sure i play those game modes also from time to time ill also play brawls more or less frequently depending on which brawl it is and if i can more easily complete quests in the brawl but lets not pretend that tavern brawl is the game mode team should be catering to and working on with the utmost priority look at how theyve treated arena over the years the top priority for team has been and always will be constructed and any implementation of improved constructed formats should always take precedent show me the perspective i should be seeing i like constructed i hate any tavern brawl that is just an rng clown fiesta such as randomonium the webspinner ones or the shifter zerus ones
hearthstone,removed,you know nothing about me if i can take sep the very first internet hit for my class having about dedicated google and you tube videos showing its manipulated legend rank acquiring all of the same cards but not even get rank i am bad at this game are you insane yes you are youre an octorokhero whatever that is its probably something i flushed down the bog for being constipated occcctork argghh flush there thats a better hero if i am not getting rank legend with that legend rank deck it is because nobody else the whole thing was stinking con rigging everybodys investment so they go hey i want to be rank legend as well lets go and buy these cards now why doesnt it make them legend because it already has its tourney selection hearthstone is not a card game it cannot be played on cards because it relies on a malicious computer rigging its luck a card game requires skill take your own advice and play a card game
hearthstone,removed,looking for tyrande code have quest in gratitude
hearthstone,removed,karma is something to be so proud i dont how anybody with that obvious inability has made any karma wait let me guess it was from eating ass thats why he has brought out the gimp because he has taken which movie and turned it into a typo and because that spelling is so flawed he thinks he is trying to be like the good shepherd or something what a clot no wonder he has a generic disposition where he thinks trolling is legal and based on karma gamerscore freaking idiot but thank you for proving at how easy it is too rig something

hearthstone,removed,i dont feel listened to on this subject i liked being about to do quests by trying to win with the decks that i wanted to play whenever i said so i was downvoted so that my posts werent visible i was not only not listened to i was votecensored yes i know thats how reddit works but its galling to have those who got what they want talk about being listened to after having had ones own opinion on the matter hidden by downvotes this means that you can no longer complete quests by trying out the decks that you want to try out or by playing the modes that you want to play in manner that you would normally play them instead for a lot of them you have to make special decks and play games with the special decks just for the purpose of completing the quest its almost as if instead of one win five tavern brawls quest we now have fifteen win five tavern brawls quests it also means completing quests will often be a separate activity and a separate amount of time spent from the game activities we already choose to do on the plus side it should make casual mode pretty varied and less competitive but right now i dont think this change is a positive one overall

hearthstone,removed,i am someone who played shaman through all its days of being mediocre i hate the current aggro shaman domination i like midrange play i like having a toolkit deck that reacts weirdly to different situations after tunnel trogg turned shaman into an aggro class i saw in maelstrom portal and spirit claws the first new shaman cards i actually love since classic so i built a spelldamage focused deck with a shit ton of oneofs then filed it down via experimentation until i had something more refined this deck contains two each of maelstrom portal and spirit claws and a single evolved kobold that actually wins me slightly more games than it loses and it has zero tunnel troggs earth shock lightning bolt rockbiter spirit claws bloodmage thalnos flametongue maelstrom portal healing wave hex lightning storm tuskarr totemic evolved kobold flamewreathed faceless azure drake doomhammer emperor thaurissan fire ele thing from below alakir ive been having a lot of fun and winning well at mediocre ranks climbed from rank to rank while only losing four times the thing this deck needs the most is for bloodmage thalnos not to be legendary he is absolutely precious to activate your spirit claws and improve your aoes maelstrom portal is sometimes but not always fine as just a singletarget ping that gives you a tiny body its like a shiv that enables your flametongue totems i end up toteming a lot in the early game praying for spell damage but i often manage to win even when i lose those rolls thing from below makes up for those games where im begging to draw thalnos but dont earth shock is pretty good these days what with barnes and granny usually i finish with a rockbiteralakir or doomhammer burst so the deck isnt that subversive but having an early game that consists of removal and then switching to face damage midgame is exactly the sort of game i like to play and the occasional game thats won with a surprise superspelldamagelightningbolt combo is amazing

hearthstone,removed,is there a problem when you list the ten classes in order there will be always be a class that is tenth its impossible for there not to be a tenth class so in a way if you call it a problem then theres always a problem and its not fixable because theres always a bottom class so in that respect not really its just a matter of which class
hearthstone,removed,the only reason i play it is because there are no alternatives what if i told you httpslegendsbethesdanetlocaleen what if i also told you that as a hs player since closed beta this alternative completely blows hearthstone out of the water and makes me never want to play it again after seeing how much better things could be check it out you might be pleasantly surprised or not ymmv as with all things me personally so done with hearthstone
hearthstone,removed,made a new throwaway to post this comment i feel the same way you do about just about everything youve said in this post and as a result i strongly encourage you to check out httpslegendsbethesdanetlocaleen and give it a chance i have switched to it from hearthstone and ive never been so in love with a card game not even hearthstone and ive played since closed beta not even yugioh which i played as a teenager the game is incredible and the potential it has is even higher plus they actually balance cards hope this helps fill a hole left by hearthstone recently for you as it has for me

hearthstone,removed,its obvious look an anduin blond hair blue eyes the class name is priest a religious name theyre purifying the game just like hitler purified the jews
hearthstone,removed,i created an open letter that was inspired the new card everyone talks about purify link the point of this petition is not only about the card itself or priest being a terrible class right now but about not listening to the community about possible solutions and feedback help share and support i will create an offical thread help sharing the information please

hearthstone,removed,yea but ostkaka is gay
hearthstone,removed,its simple actually nearly all the people who play this game are mouthbreathing morons who think that they are badasses because they can play rush decks and thus smother creativity in its crib they would do the world a favor if they just simply slit their throats let me rephrase this because of hs lacks absolutely all complexity compared to duelyst or mtg it attracts the biggest playerbase of inbred braindamaged year olds team also doesnt help by refusing to improve their game and releasing lazy and unimaginative design like carrion grub or flamewreathed faceless which are honestly just sad cards they refuse to take advantage of their card game and make actually good stuff which requirest thinking but even if they did it wouldnt see play because in hs the agressor is always in a better position and taunt is just a bad mechanic a pale shadow compared to block the game will never improve because of bad design and creative laziness

hearthstone,removed,alright asshole i put effort into giving you a thoughtful response that would help you overcome your painfully obvious lack of social skills but you completely fucking ignored everything i said and just kept puking out the same pointless rant you should feel bad but your clear lack of empathy tells me you wont you go right on ahead typing up your oneman battle against blizzard only i suggest you double down on your selfostracization i think ill go do something more productive like banging my head against various walls to test their thickness
hearthstone,removed,add me
hearthstone,removed,hearthstone seems to be a decent and fun way to make them learn additionsubtraction abilities not to mention some logic just be sure to always be around when hes playing since theres some people who arent very nice out there
hearthstone,removed,i know you kids think being a troll means telling the truth about the game being luck i dont know why it scares you so much that the truth might hit the public like ive said it is ok to spend hours of time playing a game of luckits how vegas was built as for why i keep coming backwhy do you why does anyone im sure its the same reason to discuss a game we all enjoy
hearthstone,removed,i think i did nail down the reason for some of your fear of the fact that the game is mostly luck you make a lot of mistakes when playing the game youre not very good and thats embarrassing maybe im just guessing because for pros mistakes are few if any it all comes down to having the cards you need to win when you need them its not a difficult concept you have the cards you need when you need them your opponent doesnt so you win or viceversa its as simple as that to the people on here who actually have talent i guess my conversations are more for you instead of these other guys i guarantee the last out of games you lost it was because you didnt draw that one card you needed when you needed it
hearthstone,removed,thanks for doing that again as always its appreciated but his math doesnt hold up
hearthstone,removed,heck yeah
hearthstone,removed,again your no work copy and paste contribution is always appreciated but no one builds their own decks everyone gets them online everyone who has skill at least above rank i would say makes the best plays with what they havebut if you dont get a board clear when your opponent has minions or if you dont get a reno when your deck is built behind the concept of healing yourself youre going to lose out of times you might do some thinking on all that before you automatically go and copy someones post that doesnt hold up
hearthstone,removed,no actually the mods are getting lazy im still here but no one wants to talk much when they know im letting out the secret that the game is mostly luck
hearthstone,removed,i listened to what you said it just doesnt hold up
hearthstone,removed,kinda racist to imply chinese are better than na
hearthstone,removed,youre fucking retarded if that comparison makes any srnse
hearthstone,removed,this is not whether it gives you an advantage or not you dumb fuck it obviously does point is you can do this without the software so why even make it illegal
hearthstone,removed,lying scumbag detected
hearthstone,removed,d
hearthstone,removed,this na hate is just complete bullshit fuck off bitch when has she won anything
hearthstone,removed,yeah aldor and uldaman are useless against board flood which is what does this deck in the most i have enough beefy shit to deal with other things mana isnt that much of a threat so long as i dont have a completely clean board if i can trade attack into it i follow up with blackwing corruptor or hammer of wrath with regards to pyro i simply dont carry that many spells to activate it im trying to rely on battlecry and deathrattle effects more than spells with this deck because spells generally dont leave a body behind and right now i need all the bodies i can get the reason i kept nefarian is because hes the most likely chance to produce a lategame removal since he always gives you spells it also helps outlast cw havent felt the need to run bgh as i run rend blackhand as my cthun counter also is better at dealing with certain legendaries such as ysera and antonidas the mana cost just isnt worth it anymore when i already have a deck built partially around dragon synergies anyway plus the body immediately threatens and acts as a retard magnet for removal that they then are unable to use on the likes of tirion or sylvanas im actually going to take out blessing of kings to fit the drake back in drake gives you the extra attack and x number of health that will generally be more than if played on curve and can be played on an empty board unlike kings

hearthstone,removed,there is actually a reason why rank gets almost nothing the grind is too long and blizzard doesnt want just of people getting massive rewards rank is a good stopping point for each month as causal players

hearthstone,removed,id rather not that guys music is garbage id rather continue taking chemo methotrexate and bleed out of my asshole for the rest of my life than have to listen to another kanye west song thanks for the offer though listening to people try and rhyme about themselves andor money is about twothree times as trashy as jerry springer but i guess thats what appeals to the lowest common denominator
hearthstone,removed,nah im getting downvotes because i called the little ones favourite singer a gay fish its ok i feel bad for them really i shouldnt be dicking them around like that its not their fault they dont know any better theres countless rnb and rap artists that are perfectly respectable from run dmc to frank ocean to but hey we all make mistakes
hearthstone,removed,not shaming anyone but kanye fans do like to take offence extraordinarily easily as youre showing here so ill just go wipe some blood and go on with my day knowing i dont have to support a gay fish feels good man imma put some frank ocean on now

hearthstone,removed,i have listened to enough kanye to know to be able to make such a statement otherwise why the frick would i make such a statement without first experiencing what im talking about im using it as a descriptive example to show my distaste and draw paralleles with what one might consider trash to another its solid entertainment i never said liking things like jerry springer and that caliber of entertainment is bad i simply stated that such a caliber exists and the lowest common denominator seems to enjoy it doesnt make it better or worse than other things just pointing out the fanbase
hearthstone,removed,and here folks we have a typical kanye fan the yo white suburban male

hearthstone,removed,against what deck zooboard centric creature decks of the time burn decks outlast and its you draw cards you have forgotten torch to make more fireballs you have antonidas are you really so dense you dont know how the deck works
hearthstone,removed,lol thanks d but anyway fuck you
hearthstone,removed,selling tyrande code for € or equal amount in any other currency to paypal pm
hearthstone,removed,quality nitpicking its a huge point you moron a zoo deck relies on tempo and board control if they have to spend that many bodies or buffs just to remove one taunt it weakens there position considerably any minion or buff spent on soggoth is free health for the warrior and the fact that theyll spend a whole turn trying to remove it means the warrior gets another turn to play one of their superior late game threats which the depleted zoo player will now need to deal with on their turn it can be a game changer tbh but i guess you think they are getting good value blowing all those resources on a single taunt minion

hearthstone,removed,i dont need to keep proving youre a cheat over and over again i did it once you can reply further to the stock response and explain the improbable heres my stock response to all the private messages im getting about this back when i started the spreadsheet it was mainly to see if the claims of various streamers about their averages were truthful shadybunny used to advertise a average over runs ofc of those were in vods that had expired of the runs that i had access to i came up with an average of and i was calculating his average the same as he was using his coaching coop and solo runs shady ofc disputed my callout of his stated average shadys reasoning was that the runs i didnt have access to accounted for the average which meant that for runs he averaged as i stated and which he didnt dispute but for runs i didnt have access to he was averaging thats not impossible but its unlikely as hell esp given that only one streamer hafu has ever averaged above on the rolling and that was very briefly and just barely above so shady must have been superhuman during those runs the best that has ever been and will ever be at hearthstone arena i find that improbable to say the least shady was a god at arena until i started tracking him and then he became human again convenient

hearthstone,removed,this is especially the case because kripparrian has told me that this guy is a stalkerpsychopath of his and his original motive to start this spreadsheet was to make kripp look bad this guy has apparently made bomb threats on airports whenever kripp was going to travel to them to harass him i was generally supportive of this post until this point these are pretty serious allegations if kripp actually has evidence of him doing this he should report him to the police
hearthstone,removed,this guy has apparently made bomb threats on airports whenever kripp was going to travel to them to harass him thats quite an accusation to make without any real evidence not that i hereby say youre lying i just want some proof maybe ukripparrian can backup some of these statements
hearthstone,removed,i came into this thread on the side of spreadsheet guy but after reading his own words in ops screenshot where he puts words in your mouth with zero proof and after reading your response this spreadsheet guy really sounds like a bully i think its easy for people to support somebody who says theyre trying to prove the validity of streamers selfreported arena averages and who puts a lot of work into collecting stats that many people want to see but whats stopping this guy from pushing his personal agenda on the stats whats stopping him from doing more nefarious things such as taking bribes financial or otherwise from streamers to manipulate their stats if more streamers come forward with issues theyve had with the spreadsheet guy i think his support could vanish although i will say i doubt the validity of kripps claims he has a serious problem with thinking that everybody in the world is out to get him everybody is a sniper people draft amazing arena decks and try hard to queue into kripp etc etc he would need some serious proof to make his claims about the bomb threats believable ultimately i think the only fix that would satisfy everyone would be blizzardreported stats in which the player can choose whether to track an arena run before it starts but blizzard will never implement something like that
hearthstone,removed,đẹp quá đi
hearthstone,removed,mindblast
hearthstone,removed,in general its great to have any kind of leaderboard for the competitive scene blizzard should do one with their ruleset to have a standard no pun intended each ruleset has ups and downs but at least we have a ruleset for instance people who dont want to trihard for ladder dont appear on the top legend list neither where are kripp and all the others if you dont care about your winrate then just dont care the problem of the current leaderboard is some streamer disagree with the ruleset because they appear worse than in another ruleset they dont want every arena run to count if you have a bad ladder day you can erase it the next day but in the current arena leaderboard this performance sticks like forever some streamers run exclusively top arena classes to boost their average other people find it unfair because they take the tougher road by playing all the classes one leaderboard ruleset could be monthly arena leaderboard like in ladder best of june only arena runs in june are counting so every one can decide if they trihard or have fun this season diversity every class has to be run at least once to be on the list amnesia the worst run of every class doesnt count towards the leaderboard if streamer has more than run of this class problem too similar to the current leaderboard because they feel like every run counts or make it a challenge like the in the best performance of every class is counting in this season so best points are wins out of wins its a race for who is getting the most wins with every class problem players who do like runsmonth have a much better chance than someone who only makes runs i dont think you can establish a good community ruleset if the big streamers hafu kripp ratsmah adwcta merps shadybunny etc dont agree on one because streamer x will always take the shortcut and just play his arena games and says the leaderboard is shit and i play only this class all the time now etc
hearthstone,removed,nothing wrong with the spreadsheet i honestly enjoy the updates what is wrong is that guys attitude ive noticed he is pretty hostile towards most streamers especially kripp and shady and excluding notably hafu i doubt he is biasing the stats or anything but it makes me roll my eyes everytime i read his posts can someone tldr me the ratsmah thread please
hearthstone,removed,the original post
hearthstone,removed,the easiest fastest and generally the best fix would be to throw away your mac and get a pc
hearthstone,removed,i trust ratsmah but one should not just take his word as proof id really like proof for accusations like i dont work for this arena spreadsheet guy the fact that he thinks he can send me threatening messages about deleting a vod off of my channel scares the hell out of me this is especially the case because kripparrian has told me that this guy is a stalkerpsychopath of his and his original motive to start this spreadsheet was to make kripp look bad this guy has apparently made bomb threats on airports whenever kripp was going to travel to them to harass him
hearthstone,removed,mrdestructiod
hearthstone,removed,nothing is inherently wrong in him tracking the stats of streamers what stats mean depends on how you interpret them and streamers should be open towards possible criticism hopefully constructive about their play however i can see many possible issues with the stats provided here and the spreadsheet guy no easy way to verify the stats are real do we know if the compiler of the stats has lied to us and made up some of the stats i suppose if someone credible did a recount we could be more sure are the stats being manipulated what arena runs are included which ones are not notably ratsmah and shadybunny claim that some of their coop runs are being counted whilst some are not the ideals of spreadsheet guy you can see spreadsheet guy believes very strongly in having the right to information and is very accusatory of any who do anything to hide information from him or manipulate his spreadsheet he has decided his method of stat collection is correct and other methods notably streamers including certain runs and not including certain runs to be wrong but who is he to decide what stats presented are most accurate overall i certainly appreciate the work done behind the spreadsheet however we cannot be sure of its authenticity the spreadsheet seems to be alienating himself quickly from the streamers and it would certainly be interesting to see if kripp confirms what ratsmah said however we must also consider the possibility that the culture of streaming has caused some of these streamers to possibly lie themselves personally in the end i have to trust the faces of hearthstone a lot more than this unknown redditor

hearthstone,removed,blizzard explained this already you mean they put a post online where of their players will never see it that is not a valid explanation of a card you can not have one sentence do two entirely different things within a card game its inaccurate its lazy its confusing and saying but they had a reddit post up does not magically forgive or magically resolve the issue with this cards text when it absolutely should be written on the card i know its the internet and all but i still find it hard to believe ignorant people will actually reinforce lazy behavior like this
hearthstone,removed,just give blade flurry back it is ironic how blizzard took it away because aoe shouldnt be part of rogues identity yet that is the exact moment where rogue arguably lost any semblance of identity it had

hearthstone,removed,so it might not make the goal hes trying something different and it might fail if he succeeds hell be a genius who found a way to make a big tournament without being at the mercy of the sponsors he wouldnt be the first seeing that other companies have already done similar stuff but he would be the first significant effort in hearthstone however now that hes not gaining the traction he hoped he was wrong to try because hes changing things to a tournament format he technically owns this being in a thread where some players are already scared they wont be included before its even certain itll be funded and happening geez give amaz some slack
hearthstone,removed,you are free to use it in that way however one should consider that initial dissent might lead to a downvote train hindering any real progress in a much needed discussion

hearthstone,removed,your whole argument is there are niche situations that kobold would be good in oh did i say that could you quote me i never actually made an argument i only pointed out that your logic was terrible this is unarguable fact still waiting for you to post evidence of you being constantly high legend or these statistics you spoke of also the burden is on you to prove lol youre an idiot i made claims i pointed out your fallacies thats all you claimed to have statistics backing you up you claimed that your rank was relevant and refuse to post proof im sure we wont see either of those things from you though because youre utterly pathetic

hearthstone,removed,this reminds me of the good old days when you could see warriors dropping naked frothings and patrons as soon as they had the mana knowing that you should save frothingpatron for a combo is what separates new players from intermediate players realizing that there is a correct time to play naked frothingpatron and knowing when is what separates intermediate players from experts your comment shows where you fall on the spectrum

hearthstone,removed,hearthstone in lul
hearthstone,removed,also no need to ask stupid questions but you still did it
hearthstone,removed,yup thats how i spend my time inbetween turns on hearthstone however being so dumb you overlooked the fact that your insult says just as much about you as youre trying to say about me thank you for proving my point
hearthstone,removed,so you are saying that based on the fact that random events occurred rng must be broken
hearthstone,removed,i love that there is allready the stupid but its a mana card babyrage justification
hearthstone,removed,yshaarj is the one true winner in the old god battle lets break it down all old gods are mana to summon but nzoth is cthun is and yoggsaron is only yshaarj is a beefy out of the gate so he is clearly the strongest of the old gods yes cthun can be pushed above but thats part of his weakness see below nzoth revives dr minions yogg casts spells random spells and cthun gets boosted by his servants however if you barely meet those conditions then those gods are underpowered for mana yshaarj again can come out of the gate fully powered without any help beforehand finally it should be noted that yshaarj can summon the other lesser gods through his power and totally negate their battlecries this infers that he has dominion over the other puny gods and all must bow before him praise be to almighty yshaarj and may you embrace your rage that it shall fuel his everlasting reign
hearthstone,removed,this is such a bullshit explanation its shocking people dont like the card because it sucks to lose to when you are decisively winning and that happens quite often these days it happens an insane number of times the card is very popular so you see a lot of it and it cannot be played around at all it involves less skill than any other card in the game by far its a card that you play when youre losing so the only options are that it wins you the game prolongs the game to give you a chance to win from an otherwise losing position or you still lose anyway so theres no drawback to playing it if you actually use it in the right scenario it upends the entire reason to play a game which is the progression of a competition by essentially uprooting everything that happened in the previous minutes of play so not only has it ruined a ton of ladder matches but as this gentlemans comment seems to whitewash entirely it has ruined any semblance of enjoyable hearthstone tournament play so now both watching and playing hearthstone has come down to an rng fiesta when you consider yogg in the context of a game that also has barnes tuskarr flame jugglerfiery batother early game ping minions the shaman hero power and the numerous cards that generate random cards it basically leads to a game which involves little to no ability for counterplay on pro and amateur levels

hearthstone,removed,try contacting ben brode on twitter his a nice guy maybe he can help you out
hearthstone,removed,christ you are such an idiot
hearthstone,removed,thats the reply fan boys give however after seeing the hearthstone tournament and seeing that old gods booster pack was superior in rng come backs compare to planned well thought out game play this game confirmed the devs have no idea what the fuck they are doing not only that the mere fact that once a deck has been made that has a powerful rating of being reliable and using shaman as example not only is it boring and repetitive but we are already at the point that not only can we recognize but we can figure out and count the cards to win the game once a game has counting card method in it its not really competitive so yeah continue on defending a joke of a game make more excuses for the devs that will post videos on how upset they are and displeased on the cards they make are an issue for multiple reasons theres more people agreeing with me than your poor excuse
hearthstone,removed,i dont mind rng but its quite obvious what cards caters to which class that benefits not only that hunters got screwed again with the new expansion not surprised but at this point no one really cares on the games health
hearthstone,removed,even if you are not your responses remind me of a filthy casual so in either case not to be taken seriously

hearthstone,removed,but i dont think discover is frustrating i would argue that having less cards to choose from discover makes it more frustrating the current discover has few cards to pick from choosing out of cards is in my opinion better then choosing out of because out of is more likely to get the answer you want soyou get more frustrated getting an answer than when you dont i dont believe you have the iq level to be worth conversing with anymore were done here and youre blocked

hearthstone,removed,i literally created an account to add that i have played against deerjason on a few occasions in tournaments and hes a huge douchebag he ropes he cries and complains and bms its bad seeing him do it on the big stages of hs but its worse for small tournaments where you have to add this pricks btag and let him verbally assault you for the entire conquest match because he needs the mental edge apparently fuck him hes the bad apple that gets emulated all too often on the ladder

hearthstone,removed,impact probably felt he was being badass in the moment but must have realized right after what an immature idiot he looks like now bit like last month when i was chilling in my room eating pizza hut and watching gamecatt stream an arena on twitch making her laugh with my jokes and feeling like a boss when my older sister and her friends came in the house and she just looked at me and shook her head and my brothers such a slob im worried hell still be living here when hes if he doesnt have a heart attack by then id gone from feeling like mr cool to a loser in seconds and white hot with rage i waited till they were all watching tv in the living room when i stormed in whipped down my sweats and instajacked a monster load all over the tv screen and turned and still erect screamed could an unhealthy slob have shot that much cum pointing at my sisters friends i could fuck all of you at once and never go soft im a fucking legend and not just in hearthstone after my parents found out and i had to retell the incident to horrified looking psychiatrists i didnt feel like such a boss anymore
hearthstone,removed,no i cant understand why impacts pissed you must be fucking brainless
hearthstone,removed,to him its an objective fact that the tournament is more important than her silly fucking graduation who cares about graduations anyway its really ridicilous
hearthstone,removed,well thats because you have no clue about what objective means but thats okay weve all been years old passive agressive uneducated and bicurious about things no worries
hearthstone,removed,his parents are the definition of bad parents in that case pretty much the definition of everything wrong when it comes to parenting if they really put preassure on him to be there for some silly graduation

hearthstone,removed,are you indecisiveeasily bored or just piss a lot of people off
hearthstone,removed,batstone did not prove that at all the fact that you think that shows how little you know about the game players were encouraged to try fun decks because that was the point of the tournament there was no prize money another factor that encourages more fun decks who won superjj that brought aggro because it was the most optimal option
hearthstone,removed,ill make it super easy for you because i know you need it moron batstone proved that if given a choice many would pick slower and more methodical decks not superjj genius batstone did not prove that because it was a tournament with no prize pool and players were encouraged to pick slower decks in a real tournament you will see plenty of aggro youre welcome for dropping the knowledge on you
hearthstone,removed,spiral add me if you need help with friend quests online now
hearthstone,removed,i cant save you from your low iq sorry
hearthstone,removed,you think aliens pick your deck in a tournament no the player does therefore the player has a choice you have absolutely given the choice to pick shitty decks is it hard to understand maybe for you

hearthstone,removed,yes the win quests just add to hypercompetitiveness and a stressful anxietyridden gaming experience
hearthstone,removed,my god you must be fucking retarded omg i played against priests and they both used emotes dae play against priests that emote
hearthstone,removed,no it is not difficult you are a dolt unless the information you are given somehow is indicative of the actual gender of the subject in question then the gender of a random subject is the gender of a sibling younger or older has zero impact on the gender of the subject
hearthstone,removed,so you want to win every game makes sense hahahaha ridiculous grow a pair and stop being such a sore loser its not that difficult youre the problem not the quest system
hearthstone,removed,aka theyre little bitches
hearthstone,removed,yeah i dont think professional football basketball players would watch and make fun of amateur players who does not have to be good at all just watching and commenting about it wont make you better players either i want see how genius you are why dont you share your battletags here
hearthstone,removed,wow this info has changed my life dramatically why do people share such shitty info cuz they know how to get upvotes
hearthstone,removed,octnoir clearly seriously fuck comments like yours
hearthstone,removed,friend you are stupid too you dont explain anything you just wrote armor had more benefits so what the fuck will make the game unbalanced priest will not start with hp it will just have chance to reach or restore to hp if it plays spells etc
hearthstone,removed,is it only me who says that in this stupid subreddit piss off man can you tell me a tournament winning priest deck overpowered priest will be much more overpowered in your humble opinion
hearthstone,removed,i have a hard time following your logic since you have to say something but you dont always have anything worthwhile to add mostly insults accusations and assumptions considering how wordy you can be i think its pretty telling that you clam up and resort to responding to half of a sentence with one sentence of your own im getting bored with this pissing contest so good day and have a merry christmas next time you decide to try and shit talk at least have the self respect to stick with what you know you tart
hearthstone,removed,i dont think you mean petabytes thats gb and no phone has ever been released with that much storage as far as i know not even my gaming pc has that much storage
hearthstone,removed,obviously fake for a youtube video where he reacts to things like a lot of the other funny stuff he does so wackily while he plays xd
hearthstone,removed,it also counters the gay ancient one deck people are using
hearthstone,removed,the viewbot culls happened and he pretended he was just losing viewers due to switching to other games was a clever cover story for him really
hearthstone,removed,wow is that him the real thomassn thats it he did it he officially called a streamer out for making a misplay while tipsy on christmas i for one will never ever watch such a terrible retarded player ever again im sure the tournament officials are emailing forsen right at this moment to tell him to return all the tournament money dude
hearthstone,removed,fun for who hopefully you fucking die over the holidays asshole
hearthstone,removed,youre an idiot
hearthstone,removed,add me na will be able to help you with gold quest cheers
hearthstone,removed,no i think that grinding out quests is a chore but thats because of the must win clause i tried out the malygos druid list to clear some druid quests straight losses later its a bit like miracle rogue takes some skill and experience to pilot i gave up and ground out the quests in other classes more quests not being win dependant would go a long way towards fixing it keep the win quests because they have a higher reward but kill all of the win with x or y classes quests heres some alternative frivolous quests that could replace them win a pack in arena draw your whole deck play consecutive drops on five straight turns of the game play x creatures from a tribe murlocsbeastsdragons etc deal damage to your opponent with weapons play creatures with tauntdivine shieldwindfurybattlecrydeathrattlecharge etc draw cards in a turn reach turn three times as class x play five legendaries in a game heal yourself for or heal for play cards that werent in your decklist this game destroy armour of the opponent plus some wonky winning quests win on turn win with no cards in hand go up a level on ladder
hearthstone,removed,portals galore
hearthstone,removed,youre a fucking idiot and its hilarious how you have no idea what the difference between cards like warsong and cards like knife juggler and the differences between their nerfs youre also an idiot if you think brode is really going to listen to someone on reddit rather than the paid game design experts fuck off kid lol
hearthstone,removed,k then youre a dumb ass
hearthstone,removed,xd you seem mad i can say whatever i want dont care what i make me look like and ill probably keep playing hs so sorry to soften your internet argument boner xd fuck off kid stop caring about shit that doesnt matter i posted one link i dont recall an angry whine i fucked your mom

hearthstone,removed,wow dude you started this argument based on a title and one link go suck a dick dude stop being so self important and dickish just because you feel the need to defend your shitty little card game leave me alone dick mouth fuck off
hearthstone,removed,google dunning kruger effect you are the textbook definition of that
hearthstone,removed,well if i am guilty of misreading i didnt watch the vod im sorry but you are definitely guilty of misreading and misinterpreting what ive said in your haste to correct my apparently misguided and misinformed opinions in fact we agree on most of our points but you seem to either have misread what ive said or misintepreted it which could definitely be my fault i said he cant say he carried the team wise when he hired them i know he paid their salary and they didnt earn him near what he paid them but he knew what their skills were and he gave them a contract a salary they werent worth what he paid for them but he hired them all its his team he made the decisions he made a business and he bought assets and then he says the assets didnt give him a good roi thats what i was saying but somehow you said i misinterpreted that and then corrected me we agree that a pro team isnt viable esp now with all players having to qualify but amaz was running at a loss with these players from the start and took so long to cut the cord in a business its simple money goes out and money goes in dont spend when you can spend dont buy players for a team if they arent gonna pay for themselves if they are your friends as i said before at least dont keep them on and say icarried you you hired them if they dont perform you have some culpability if i hire a chef to make money for me its very difficult if there are no great restaurants around he has to earn his keep from just cooking for me then but thats not worth itbut i shouldve known theres nowhere he can earn a salary near me i think he was being excessively lavish which runs up costs he admitted to giving salaries based on turning on the faucet my problem is that he was basically living on the edge he was relying far too much on hopeful incomehis reserves and relying on sponsorships like to continue giving them the same money day in day out you got to plan for the future be able to cope with losses in sponsorship adverse events if you can a rainy day fund if you will he assumed the money that was pouring in would keep pouring in and any losses would be mitigated by the increase in popularity of his stable it wasnt hearthstone isnt going to get a big boost in viewers i said that yeah hearthstone has some revenue streams for tourney players its not enough only a streamer can make income regularly but amaz as a business owner and streamer and player shouldve known this before he decided to hold on to or players who were at the time largely unknown as streamers and buying world champions on bigger salaries making huge tournaments etc etc he took far too long to respond to the losses he was accruing my reference on poker was poker income as a player as amaz has been very successful and made a lot of money in poker according to a drunk firebat who kept talking about it to sodapoppinforsen not to poker streamers poker for nonstreamerspeople with endorsements is very very quickly dying rake hikes are coming in and not just in the way you think edges are being removed games are becoming quicker less edges and paying out more of the field imagine you take rake of and then pay of the field basically everyone loses thats what there moving towards of online players are going to be losers soon ive paid about k in rake or something ridiculous after i bought in for i only played a few months and have quit for a long time now and have odd in my account paying out more of the field basically ensures the money of bad playersfish goes aroundback to the company instead of being shared between decentgood players and the company combine that with rake hikes and pretty much noone can win combine that with people realizing that and stopping playingand youre in a situation where player numbers are now rapidly dropping and players are very very angry youre clearly misinformed when you read others comments i suggest you read them fully before you decide to reply i literally agree with you on every point bar maybe you thinking its okay to spend on a tournament when the next biggest bar the hwc is like the viewers would still come in droves for that and yet youve managed to basically call me a cocky misinformed idiot who shouldnt give advice to others whilstadopting a cocky tone whilst giving advice to othersand misreadinginterpreting what they said originally
hearthstone,removed,oh but because of those huge rng swings he provides of the time its problematic you know what fuck you i keep using this damn example cabalists tome ice lance x frostbolt in hand means you suddenly have a fucking undeserved lethal that completely ignores your opponents board and which was impossible to play around beyond simply having more health no single other card in the game wouldve won you the game yeah you mightve been able to stabilize but thats not what were talking about just because yogg is the most extreme example of an undeserved win does not mean its the only one worth addressing any scenario where you come back from losing because of an rng card is a problem balancecompetitivewise i dont understand how someone can find yogg not fun and wacky but theyre perfectly okay with again their opponent rnging a wacky answer that lets them win like i dont get the difference just because the impact is smaller even if you still lose youre okay with that rng swing that wouldve had you win had they not gotten specifically what they needed why exactly is it a deserved win to pull off a combo akin to combo druid with again cabalists tome or say ethereal conjuror or burgle thoughtsteal etc im not saying these cards arent fun or balanced in the sense that they dont dominate the meta im saying unbalanced in terms of the way people cant seem to shut the fuck up about how undeserved rng wins are a guy who thoughtsteals cards that gives him lethal over you that got the exact cards he needed basically the kind of scenario where youd feel like you were quoting kripp to beat you as surprising as this may seem did not deserve his lethal i dont give a fuck what the scenario is a great story for one player is a crushing loss or defeat for the other player i respect the fun aspect of rng and i love yogg even though i dont have one myself but i still am unable to fathom why its okay to solely judge one card with swingy rng when so many others are just as impossible to play around affect as few situations in some cases less but on the whole the amount of cards with smaller effects make up a larger portion of games changed than those changed by yogg and mean that the person who wins probably didnt deserve that win burglingthoughtstealing two eviscerates for damage when your opponent has a board and no other cards wouldve helped you at the moment is not a deserved win on your part its fucking bullshit rng that should not make you the better player than your opponent whether on ladder or at the fucking hearthstone world championships
hearthstone,removed,hi i have quest and i want to trade it im playing on na sserver if u want to trade add me
hearthstone,removed,frodan is full of shit the game is shit enough that the good thing that can come out of it is streaming and making bank of streaming thats about it and its not streamers or players fault its blizzards

hearthstone,removed,gee let me put this link for new players on a subreddit full of veteran players haha such a good idea
hearthstone,removed,who gives a fuck about professional coin flippers and their drama
hearthstone,removed,you literally used the reddit quote formatting which means nothing its not the same as quotation marks i never claimed its what was actually said
hearthstone,removed,only on reddit would truth be considered edgy
hearthstone,removed,let me guess have some luck on draws get auctioneer on turn coinprep conceal draw whole deck now slightly use your brain to get vancleef or qa sap whatever your opponent has in the way finally leeroy cold blood
hearthstone,removed,sorry missed one conclusion in your guide how to smack your opponents face and minimizing broad interaction that is how the receiving end perceive of course you think this is a deep deck crush or smash hard decision
hearthstone,removed,youre worng im done with this
hearthstone,removed,lol china wont invite them to see so many errors they made reynoodle is just a coward and hasbeen who cant afford to lose ironically reynad accepted an interview during the tournament in china and expressed his desire to do business in china but now his words has enraged many chinese hearthstone fans and guys like who was even unable to win a single game wont be considered once more at all in fact both players cant hear the casters clearly due to the headphones they could only hear there being some sound in that direction if chakki had gadgetzan auctioneer or questing adventurer in hand the casters might yell as well lvge could not judge the possible results of using dirty rat only by the sound so the influence of sound from casters should not be the main excuse of losers
hearthstone,removed,y so slow you are i am annoyed of waiting for you all the time either end it or keep your pace up motherfucker
hearthstone,removed,minor text fixes
hearthstone,removed,since we are on the topic of meta we are number one memes heres
hearthstone,removed,so in other words the matches are rigged so basically blizzard is promoting and encouraging people to use cancer decks that anyone can net deck and the goal is to reach rank or higher up to legend rank and you are matched with different people if your entire history is composed of net decking there is no way the program can tell and basically people just wait a week or more in time line for elitist players that love bragging rights on their own stream to generate money to share these deck secrets and then those players then continue to play the game without harming their entire rating system log well this is the very same bull shit that happens in wow arena rating during seasons and even top players do this so they can be qualified to tournaments its an exploit system if you ask me
hearthstone,removed,oh it was viable it had always been but still you would tend to die before it was useful since naxx the minions have been game swinging mostly i think and maexxna doesnt do that as fast as loatheb or boom did it wasnt that maexxna wasnt good her effect is pretty op but rather you would have other op stuff instead

hearthstone,removed,ಠಠ
hearthstone,removed,omg are you kidding me such fucking stupidity from half these players and to people talking about spell power not being obvious when searching for lethal it is human nature to look at what can win you the game the first thing hes supposed to do is look on the board oh he has a wrath of air totem what does that do hm then he thinks about the obvious faceless po and his brain should have added things up but no he chooses to reaffirm why noone takes pro gamers and twitch streamers seriously by resorting to omg are you kidding me why the hell do people keep saying this is there a clown in front of you tell a joke or something also it looks like hes playing renolock the fact that hes rank and yet missed lethal like this whilst keeping what should have been one of his win conditions till fatigue makes me think that renolock isnt as skill intensive as people keep trying to make it out

hearthstone,removed,i think poker pros win a lot more consistently than hs pros dont quote me on that tho ucuntato
hearthstone,removed,to make hearthstone a compelling competitive game sure to make hearthstone more profitable probably not im not sure why the devs have stuck to their guns in making the game feel like playing a slot machine surely they know something i dont about running a successful card game they are not dumb they know what hearthstone is it took years of planning and designing to get it to this point they are fine with it
hearthstone,removed,i think they missed an opportunity with ofra haza
hearthstone,removed,nothing more nothing less enjoy
hearthstone,removed,read the card text dumbass
hearthstone,removed,i died
hearthstone,removed,at least i have a life not to dig thru ppls posts cause im a loser irl that wants to win an internet conversation oh wait thats you hahahahaha
hearthstone,removed,your mother is leaking
hearthstone,removed,some guy wants to prove that are abusing
hearthstone,removed,ofc fuck these fukers
hearthstone,removed,and i posted this to blow off some steamnot to have some dickhead reply in an attempt to be pretentious and analytical as if they no one else gets frustrated with the shit that goes on in this game tell me how much time do you invest in hearthstone do you make legend frequently how do you avoid tilting are you obese
hearthstone,removed,well his current deck has top tier legendaries epics a peacekeeper and keepers of uldaman and only cards ironforge riflemen and validated doomsayer that arent at least decent besides the warrior run last night i also think hes done roguepallymage for all his wins whats really impressive is his drafts and class choices hes getting legendaries and sick removal cards almost every draft kripp himself said his win percentage is around this current streak is just blizzard padding his rng or something to thank him for keeping hs streams alive during overwatch launch
hearthstone,removed,i mean if you watch i do i like kripp stream for the salt which is why he whines so much youd know that hes playing and misplaying just like always as he says himself ive played arena games you dont just get tons better overnight after spending tens of thousands of hours playing already kripps certainly not a bad player but arena strategy isnt hard either he follows the tier list plays for max tempo and tries to trade up while avoiding common answers anyone with hours in the game should be as good as kripp but this streak wins in drafts and likely an with this unreal paladin draft is purely based on an rng hot streak i wasnt really serious about blizzard stepping in but when someone is pulling off in tens of thousands or in hundreds of thousands of runs and getting legendaries in almost every draft you have to wonder i usually get a legendary about in runs ive played probably arena drafts and have gotten multiple legendaries twice ive seen kripp get two drafts with multiple just this week
hearthstone,removed,
hearthstone,removed,high rng is at the center of both those things kripps the same player he was when he went the other day and a bunch of times recently
hearthstone,removed,hold the door
hearthstone,removed,he didnt even spoil anything you fucking twat
hearthstone,removed,your mom is a very complexificated word
hearthstone,removed,this is a lot of useless information understand that this community isnt capable of understanding number just create a list of decks some of the notable retards made and gg
hearthstone,removed,holy shit youre stupid
hearthstone,removed,you realize even the players that have wasted more than a month on this trash are apart of the ones that arent capable of understanding any of those number right probably not considering youre trying to defend the time you wasted
hearthstone,removed,far from a salt monster whatever that means but its ohk that youre unable to understand why the game was made for retards being apart of the demographic must be tough
hearthstone,removed,i guess going infinite makes me bad hunh youre the one who suggests zoo or face shaman to climb ladder you must be so skilledno dont recommend a more deep thinking deck like miracle just go face like a retard

hearthstone,removed,they are abusive
hearthstone,removed,fucking hell your clueless no other face deck can kill you on turn on a ranked and never has been able to it doesnt matter what class you play what other deck has a turn damage on board for a turn even when kripp coined his doomslayer on turn he still pushed through it and more fair enough though clearly see people dont feel the same why i do then lets hope blizzard do nothing about it then see how many players heartstone has in month

hearthstone,removed,posting in an epic thread
hearthstone,removed,maybe if na didnt send terrible players like reynad to represent them theyd perform better in these events maybe if chakki didnt try to be cute and played the pirate on turn one like he should have the dirty rat wouldnt have happened reynad is the donald trump of hearthstone a loudmouth narcissistic scam artist who is all too willing to cheat to win
hearthstone,removed,chinese people are pathetic in csgo they rig the group stages to the only chinese team get a easy group with all the good teams in group and this they suck at hosting tourneys and they are corrupt as fuck
hearthstone,removed,china is a country of people who deserve communism because the people there have no concept of fair competition they need a command and control government just to get anything done without total chaos
hearthstone,removed,no i agree the chinese do this shit in other esports too
hearthstone,removed,probably chinese crowds are infamous for cheating like this its basically a meme at this point
hearthstone,removed,china cheetah cheat cheatah
hearthstone,removed,i mean it wouldnt surprise me every time there is an esports even in china there is at least one accusation of cheating or something shady going on this doesnt just apply to hearthstone
hearthstone,removed,maybe instead of more racism against chinese we should validate what reynad is saying is true reynads known to lie and talk out of his ass like when he called out honestly i think those of you jumping to conclusions without proof are retarded
hearthstone,removed,but its true its a culture thing stop with the pc stuff many chinese people are this way remember the video of a little child getting killed by cars with people walking by stop political correctness this is chinese culture
hearthstone,removed,cheetahcom thats china lol becuase they cheated
hearthstone,removed,why congratulate those pathetic cheaters
hearthstone,removed,wwwcheetahcom
hearthstone,removed,i have seen this in dota as well cheating doesnt matter as long as china wins in their eyes its patriotic if anything
hearthstone,removed,chinese players engaging in dishonest tactics well i for one am shocked with their stellar record of following the rules in esports this is almost unbelievable
hearthstone,removed,yeah its kind of something that permeates every aspect of their culture
hearthstone,removed,i totally agree with you chinese people who grew up in china are the worst maybe im wrong but i have not been proven otherwise yet they are incredibly lazy and would rather try to cheat their way through the system most chinese exchange students i had work on assignments with would just copypaste things from the internet run it through an online translator and hand it in i dont care if they do these kind of things if its their assignment but dont pull this shit when other people are involved the best part is that they would never participate in meetings and pretend to be clueless when you tell them that their work is insufficient just two months ago my professor showed me a bachelor thesis of one of the chinese students and it looked like everything was translated by google translator
hearthstone,removed,cheating is their culture dont be insensitive
hearthstone,removed,no i dont generalize a billion people i generalize a culture they are raised to not give a damn about others most of them are like that because its how they are raised they are also the lowest country in the giving index it is their culture it is fuckin pc stuff to always think all people are nice and to silence people calling out hostile cultural systems
hearthstone,removed,cheating is like breathing in their culture so yea its pathetic
hearthstone,removed,
hearthstone,removed,oh the persecution complex reynad has is shared by his fanboy brigade quelle surprise he is as much the donald trump of hearthstone as his fans are the trumpets
hearthstone,removed,they cheat in education as well
hearthstone,removed,man thats just scummy i really hate the chinese culture noone gives a damnthere so many videos of kids being run over and left to die on the streets fucking terrible can someone tell me why is it the population pollution the patriotism where did it go so wrong
hearthstone,removed,they dont stop being a whiner
hearthstone,removed,youre
hearthstone,removed,dude you dont even know im ukrainian one of my coworkers is a rabidly prorussian old fart the mental gymnastics he spins through daily to prove how right russia is in every single situation is kinda worrying examples the athletes were using completely legal drugs that were suddenly treacherously outlawed and they didnt have time to process them out of their systems jets need a lot of time to change trajectory so the turks should have waited more before treacherously shooting down the invading russian jet asbestos isnt dangerous the westerners make bad asbestos our soviet asbestos is completely safe etc
hearthstone,removed,of course chinese cheatsthats nothing new and theres nothing you can do about it other than boycott their shit
hearthstone,removed,as an enthusiastic former handlock player the entire paragraph about molten giant fucking infuriates me brode just memes on about how well holy wrath decks are doing after the change what a fucking prick the way he answers questions with questions shows me exactly why he has the job he has he is so evasive that he can conduct a page interview without actually answering a single fucking question
hearthstone,removed,there is evidence look at his place of birth
hearthstone,removed,have been here longer than you want to know judging by the way you punctuate your sentences youre either a chinese national or a nobody
hearthstone,removed,no need to be a sarcastically prick i dont have any passion linked with japanese culture
hearthstone,removed,they try to do it in work too my mom vets articles for a science magazine and she frequently gets submissions from chinese authors and scientists no biggie but the vetting process goes a bit deeper than that she has to check and see who their references are a vast majority of articles are thrown out because the references research at the same location as the author rule is that the references must be colleagues from other schoolslabsetc or they arent even in a scientific field she had one guy who put his family down as references they submit these hundreds of times to multiple magazines in the hope that one time it might slip through
hearthstone,removed,i currently live in china and can speak to the chinese assholeness the chinese from mainland china in general there are some exceptions are brought up to be selfish and to take advantage of others this is considered clever of them whenever they can take advantage of anyone else to their benefit they will cheat lie and swindle in order to get what they want im not exaggerating here youd have to see it firsthand as i have to understand like i said in parenthesis there are exceptions and exceptional people here but as a whole my comments stand
hearthstone,removed,uh yes it is useful it means theyre listening and obviously if a developer is listening it means that we can look past their lack of action because for sure theres a very good reason it hasnt taken very long i mean just look at the nerf of warsong commander that took six months and what a great change a worse raid leader with one extra hp before some fuckwit downvotes me this is s
hearthstone,removed,fucking annoying that this crybaby sub has enough echo and pull to force changes fuck blizz for caving to these fucking whiners
hearthstone,removed,man tensions between the us and na continue to rise and trump wasnt even in the tournament
hearthstone,removed,thread gets locked again because the mods dont like the truth
hearthstone,removed,this is the attitude of this entire holierthanthou sub dont try to discredit me and hem me into a corner by pretending i was only and specifically quoting the op im sick to death of all these whiny mother fuckers in here every posts is someone crying about the god damn meta and the pirates
hearthstone,removed,great sportsmanship from the chinese team
hearthstone,removed,chinese are very competitive and nationalist and things like this have happened before in
hearthstone,removed,ching chongs cheating who would have guessed
hearthstone,removed,i mean there is literally one of me why dont all you cry babies move on with your life and stop posting about how the sky is falling every fucking minutes
hearthstone,removed,oh no chinese people doing everything it takes to win because of their first place or commit sudoku mentality great country great culture i envy them
hearthstone,removed,chinese cheating again water is wet more news at
hearthstone,removed,that guy wouldnt have gotten any rice for his family if he didnt listen to coach
hearthstone,removed,is forzens dad american or chinese
hearthstone,removed,right right the thousands of you who spend your days posting every minutes about how bad everything is are saviors and heroes but because im a dissenting voice in the circlejerk im wasting my life anytime i rebuke your cry baby horse shit thanks for clearing that up for me im glad youre here to tell me what parts of my life are worth while and what parts are not what a fucking saint you are
hearthstone,removed,helping people with quests or chatting throughout the day
hearthstone,removed,hahaha very funny the are chinese they are allowed to do whatever they want at best blizzard will offer an apology to them and free packs for everyone on the server
hearthstone,removed,i dont know about you but as an american i welcome our chinese overlords
hearthstone,removed,dont apologize to that idiot he has called you and idiot and willingly ruined parts of this game that you enjoyed for no reason at all he has paid us no respect so he deserves none in return
hearthstone,removed,a part of mainland china believes that cheating is just another strategy its the whole face thing they cheat or steal and act offended when they are accused there is something about their culture that instills it in them it even contributed to the mass starvation during the mao era with over reporting crop yields to appear superior long story short if you dont get caught it isnt illegal is what a fair few mainlanders live and die by
hearthstone,removed,what the hell is the point in going through all that work for something that makes no fucking sense who the fuck is incubus what the fuck is any of that art this is nonsense and shit
hearthstone,removed,its really been that long since an expansion huh
hearthstone,removed,dont think a poor hungarian like you can afford a card like that to know what it does
hearthstone,removed,not at all i love the game it just happens to be well over luck i added a yogg in my druid deck just to throw in some more luck so this month was probably more like luck but the game does take about skill you have to make sure not to not kill cards your opponent puts down that can hurt youand stuff
hearthstone,removed,yeah i answered this his math doesnt hold up thanks for the long cp reply tho
hearthstone,removed,no no no youre wrong gives multiple poor reasons defending company over paragraphs
hearthstone,removed,obviously you guys need to do more reading during summer school i enjoy the game im just not naïve enough to think winning it has anything to do with skill the game chooses the cards it gives you you either have the cards you need to win or you dont case closed its common sense you guys are all masterswhen was the last time you lost a game because you didnt get that card you needed just now minutes ago i know its hard to admit you spend a lot of time on the game but i guarantee at least out of your last losses were due to not getting the cards you needed when you needed them not because you constantly screw up
hearthstone,removed,we will never stop spamming
hearthstone,removed,never mind in your case you must lose because you constantly screw up but for most of the top players they dont make your kind of mistakes and for the most part they play the same decks
hearthstone,removed,dont be dumb the game doesnt know its me playing its just luck for anyone playing at any time
hearthstone,removed,amount of time they play deals with blizzard who knows
hearthstone,removed,lol you think we at rhearthstone will help a fucking cancer deck get lost
hearthstone,removed,penis
hearthstone,removed,this is rhearthstone not rpolitics either stop jumping to random topics or please get out
hearthstone,removed,no a sense of entitlement means a sense that something belongs to you criticizing heroic tavern brawl for having a brutally punishing reward curve that is blatantly designed to vacuum excess gold from players is not having a sense that tavern brawl belongs to you dismissing valid criticism as bitching and entitlement simply because its negative and you dont like when people are negative about something you like is the definition of myopic idiocy
hearthstone,removed,correction they more or less made the decision ive been waffling on very easy ie to quit playing altogether in that they lost about bucks a year its not much and its only a data point of but its something that blizz seems thoroughly happy to do for me throughout all thier games that ive played
hearthstone,removed,i tried to find my misplays couldnt
hearthstone,removed,yeah well i really hope blizzard doesnt listen to your whining since this is the only fun tavern brawl ever the entire point of the brawl is to be high risk high reward for the top players of the game so i dont see how its so greedy when no one is forced to do it at all next week well go back to minions costing one mana or some other random bs and casual shitters can have fun again and get their free packs so please just let people who enjoy this sort of competitive high risk tournament have their one moment of fun
hearthstone,removed,just use the search bar and see what people already figured out in the other threads just like yours
hearthstone,removed,i appreciate you literally ignoring my second sentence hypocrisy is a bitch pal
hearthstone,removed,sssh sshhh accolades first criticism later preferably after i escape to cuba what who said anything about cuba anyway youre welcome for solving the meta

hearthstone,removed,add me up on na guys ill help with quest ill give you if i have it as well i dont spend money so im saving gold for next expansion
hearthstone,removed,where were you when kripparian was die hey its me ur flamewreath when a match is going fullretard you gotta go with it if you start going against it if you start going half retard youre fucking done for when your opponent portals tirion for turn you start throwing out burn spells thats how fucking hearthstone works ho ho ha ha we got memes buddy we got memes just watch prepatch and youll see how beautifully the this subreddit it by comparison
hearthstone,removed,guild wars how could you even nearly think this is an accurate comparison i quit because every event involved farming for shit items or buying better ones on the store dont even get me started on the retarded comparison to lol what morons upvoted this shit
hearthstone,removed,twitch viewership is one of many indicators of how well a game is doing irrelevant its enough for me to propose the claim you brought it up when asked for proof that raf is because numbers are down it doesnt even prove that numbers are down let alone blizzards motivations please provide a logical explanation as to why a games playerbase shrinking something very common in the gaming industry is an extraordinary claim straw man again youre horrible at this please give evidence to the contrary to the contrary of what what you attacked in your straw man what do you not know what a straw man is it seems that way since i pointed out other straw men and you still act like everything was fine with them
hearthstone,removed,nope very relevant of course its not not in the sense that it matters to the argument youre just confirming that you dont know how logic works you probably think its relevant because its conversationally related to the topic you dont get even understand the basic terms of debatelogicphilosophy just giving you a taste of your own medicine what a joke i spell out in detail your error textbook examples of fallacy and somehow that is the bad thing and i am the childish one whereas you using the fallacy and whining about paragraphs instead oneword answers youre hoping to get so you can tell yourself youre right instead of dealing with objective reality seriously how can you go on when its already been pointed out that raf programs exist for successful games even brand new ones and hearthstone is successful
hearthstone,removed,two of them are good and one of them is niche and hard to use if thats too complicated for you to understand then i think youre playing the wrong game i suggest go fish maybe go fuck yourself
hearthstone,removed,priest lacks any solid cards ftfy lololololololololol xddddd
hearthstone,removed,hypocrite much dont do the same if you are gonna throw shit at me also it is bumping not spamming
hearthstone,removed,id settle for you shutting your mouth and never coming to this sub again cardstone
hearthstone,removed,my perspective toward the specifics of card design is different from most because ive actually worked in game design im never going to get up in arms about a card being weak because variance in power levels is just part of collectible game design if you dont address the context of your release your analysis is worthless im aware you can release a shit card in a set of cards in magic but you cant afford the same luxury in an expansion of cards so yes when talking about purify you cannot ignore the context that makes it a bad card designwise as well as a game designer of failed card games but card games nonetheless i guess you should know this
hearthstone,removed,you sounded like someone who plays casual mtg and complains when they lose at fnm due to netdecking omg
hearthstone,removed,basically in hearthstone terms you have reached a new level first you started to live in rhearthstone and now you speak in hearthstone terms you really need some sunlight and social interaction asap

hearthstone,removed,in what way is your flippant bullshit comment even relevant is simply expressing an opinion now demanding the world cater to your needs is your reading comprehension really that poor its fine to disagree with someone but attack the point not the person
hearthstone,removed,how is it that the jewish control the world but being called a jew is still an insult im asian and id love to control the world
hearthstone,removed,how is this the best interview ever its just sad you fuck
hearthstone,removed,lets be real here the only reason this is an issue because the gaming community consists of a bunch of socially awkward geeks so now we have to cater to them because they cant function like any other adult with other adults
hearthstone,removed,hes cringy as fuck
hearthstone,removed,im rank in wild the first couple of weeks was mostly secret paladins now its a mix of secret paladins and greedy control decks playing nzoth all of the legend players ive faced the highest rank ive seen legend is like are playing nzoth i think in another month its going to be almost nothing but nzoth
hearthstone,removed,well the first step is to make sure bluestacks is configured correctly to do this youre going to need to load it off of a usb flash drive and navigate to the install folder on your main hard drive there you should find a folder labelled userdata inside of it will be userconfini open that file in notepad and find the line that says change this to then save the file and open bluestacks from both your flash drive and your main hard drive simultaneously if the instance you loaded off your main hard drive boots up to a screen that says beta features active youve done it correctly now from here you should proceed with buying the god damn packs with real money you fucking cheapskate
hearthstone,removed,you people will literally find anything to complain about use that high apm to go fucking kill yourself
hearthstone,removed,good for him i hope that helps him sell lots of nutritional supplements and supports him in his cause of torrenting douchey classical music
hearthstone,removed,do you want to do an interview and can you do an interview are two very different questions wtf are you talking about you social reject i hope u have crippling anxiety because its the only way what you said would make sense
hearthstone,removed,theyre the same thing just hang yourself you fucking pathetic social reject lol do it now or ill come and fucking slit your throat for you so you better do it before i get there also stay the fuck away from your windows because ill probably blow your fucking head off in about seconds lol better fucking duck youre about to be in the dirt social reject kid

hearthstone,removed,wow you should really go jack off or something because you are just throwing shit around for weeks and months can you write properly without throwing around curses in every second word apparently you are trying to throw stuff at me now that you said as if you should somehow decide whats too serious or not never did i write anything about me being the one to decide when something is too serious hhh youre shitposting cause i dont like your thing i literally didnt do this what i did was say that this post is very unnecessary because it is literally not an achievement but spam you are the one that is saying you dislike my comment and telling me that i am shitposting good job on your irony here your example doesnt even correlate to this situation if the dude in your example would submit his achievement to a newspaper it would be similar i never complained about him being happy about his rank apparently you are just looking to argue with someone since you probably had a shit day or something i get that and that is ok just fuck you for being such a little offensive shit

hearthstone,removed,oh navioot you poor pure little unsoiled virgin christian australian boy
hearthstone,removed,look harder
hearthstone,removed,if you werent deaf you might be able to hear it
hearthstone,removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
hearthstone,removed,maybe he doesnt have any dragons no dragons no dragons come on
hearthstone,removed,theres nobody else reddit is just you and me and bots

hearthstone,removed,stop netdecking nerd
hearthstone,removed,yeah and look what happened when the old gods booster pack came out for new players yet in this expansion hunters cards are so crap i am just curious how long and how many excuses people can make why ben brode can get away fucking over hunters i know their is a lot of blizzard whores out there i just didnt think they enjoy sucking the same tit all the time
hearthstone,removed,because i tinkered with all the new hunter cards and literally they are just utter shit i was hoping that the recommended was give me some missing insight but at last it didnt rip hunter
hearthstone,removed,i honestly dont believe you when it comes to the listed decks ive been facing nzoth is too slow so i know for a fact you are full of shit

hearthstone,removed,fishing is when you realize you need to play to your outs and focus only on drawing them thats not what happened dog just topdecked lethal youre straight up lying also how is this a clip that needed to be made how does it have so many votes either this sub is being run by bots or you morons actually enjoy this sort of thing either way this sub completely sucks now check username

hearthstone,removed,yesterday i was playing a renolock variant w prince malc and i discovered a bloodsail coursair from dark peddler i was both surprised and amazed when patches came barging out of my deck
hearthstone,removed,using creative language lol hostile tone welcome to rhearthstone where calling people out for lying and bafoonery means you must have been rejected by a middle school crush hilarious that you pretend to attempt to take the high road before making personal comments i feel sorry for you
hearthstone,removed,as a strictly free to play player who has played for years stop this garbage i have every card i want i have bought every adventure with gold how retarded are you this is not what a new player experiences and what you experienced as a new player years ago when less people had cards and the meta was less established is completely different from a new player entering into the game now
hearthstone,removed,more developers being on them could happen though some dont want to be harassed by the community youre almost too stupid to insult
hearthstone,removed,im surprised he made his way to rhearthstone why its a far more popular game and easier source of viewsincome
hearthstone,removed,solitaire is unbalanced aces are op
hearthstone,removed,i feel like we have the tendency to blame everything and everyone except ourselves getting to legend is just a grind i get stuck at rank every month but id totally hit legend if i were as much of a no lifer like everyone else im totally skillcapped at this game regardless of the mountain of video evidence of players who do this for a living losing games due to misplays all the time
hearthstone,removed,you mean if they just changed it to wealthiest people uh yea what kind of question is that
hearthstone,removed,
hearthstone,removed,people who shout whats actually fascinating is that every time someone says something you disagree with you need to imagine them as frothing at the mouth shouting and did your crush reject you in middle school so now youre perpetually bitter with no evidence whatsoever a psychologist would actually have a lot to say about that
hearthstone,removed,if
hearthstone,removed,team should be called
hearthstone,removed,did i say that go back and read the actual statement im surprised he made his way to rhearthstone when theres absolutely no reason anyone should be surprised by that have fun winning your imaginary arguments by making counterpoints to things literally no one said
hearthstone,removed,i will still call you retarded playing the green card with the highest number hit face and concede when your opponent plays reno is zero skill high level coin flipping some people are still good players but the majority are just idiots ps dont forget to downvote i dont care
hearthstone,removed,have you been to his stream it is very easy to get banned even if you are polite and nice you can get banned for asking a question incorrectly
hearthstone,removed,i used to browse reddit but i made a post just to comment on this the reason aggro decks attract such utter disdain and hatred from streamers is because the streamers are skilled players aggro decks have skill requirement draw well and smorc i never ran combo decks but they are very skill intensive because of the aggro cancerif you survive and draw your piecesyou win now drawing is not the challengewhat is the challenge surving why smorc i am not mad at people using it to climb ladder but it is people like you who try defend it to sound like it is a feat reading potential pressure from the aggro side and potential clears or pending highvalue trades from the control side if applicable are you kidding me it is only tense from the receiving end and you need to make plays aggro player does not need to make plays you smorc board clears do not come into the picture as aggro decks win by turn board clears come into play after that and if aggro doesnt win by turn or sothey are done for aggro decks have not always been strong enough to compete face hunteraggro shamanmidrange shaman sounds familiarbro play your aggro decks and go up the laddermategoodluck but please do not try to defend aggro decks by trying to make them appear skill intensive good day and thank you

hearthstone,removed,you are just a bad troll lets be honest
hearthstone,removed,really good point about similarity to menagerie magician the fact thats its a class card and only has more stat for potentially less value is concerning likely wont see play in constructed but who knows the fact that it can target a specific beast is obviously a plus though
hearthstone,removed,no we dont yet you make another garbage post
hearthstone,removed,hi guys ben brode here we removed blade flurry to design some cool weapon stuff that will keep rogue relevant like southsea squidface or deadly fork staples in every single rogue deck since release were also using all of this wonderful design space weve opened to make rogue a real thief and just steal cards from the opponent fuck priest btw isnt that fun dont you love that the archetipes rogue plays are the same that patches ago surely you love your auctioneers and malygos in every single build

hearthstone,removed,golden showerform ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
hearthstone,removed,youre a fucking idiot jesus christ if they didnt stack the odds against making your bet back then there would be no justification for the high end rewards after wins which is the entire reason people are so excited to play this brawl its a competitive environment in which you can be rewarded highly for performing well not to mention you can pay for this entire thing with fake virtual currency wow so unethical for this video game company to implement a game mode in which you can play the video game with video game money go fuck yourself people like you are the reason why competitive hearthstone is never thrown a bone by the dev team

hearthstone,removed,well and ben brode needs some fucking pussy right now but we cant all have what we want can we
hearthstone,removed,you think that changing a value like the cards mana cost requires extensive testing beyond that period what a fucking clown you are
hearthstone,removed,cool story bro
hearthstone,removed,durr durr this argument is completely played out and is irrelevant today the point is that back when the game launched a higher percent of cards from classicbasic was powerful like yeti wolf rider tzadingo from the basic and sunwalkerargent commanderetc today these cards are trash to make it up you at least need to buff old cards so the percent of viable cards in the basicclassic sets dont gradually decrease over time i really dont think you know how tcgs work fool
hearthstone,removed,did you just say damn whats wrong with you reported

hearthstone,removed,youre retarded if you believe that anyone is bad for losing to a coinflip
hearthstone,removed,yep youre retarded
hearthstone,removed,you arent welcome its insufferable twats like you who continue to perpetuate a smug and entitled attitude around this sub cant wait till the expansion comes out ie you get another lollipop in your mouth to shut you up for another months
hearthstone,removed,honestly kibler is a blizzard shill he wants to promote their product so hes not undermining the priest cards i want to see kibler with all his talk manage to even reach legend with priest in onik something he has failed to do last season despite all his talk
hearthstone,removed,because youre getting free fucking content updates instead of paid expansions are you fucking dumb how do you expect the franchise to last if theyre not raking in more money to keep the game going
hearthstone,removed,anyone who wants to play their play a friend quest or chill and chat im online right now
hearthstone,removed,get rewarded for her smashing me ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°
hearthstone,removed,pogchamp
hearthstone,removed,elder scrolls legends seems pretty good so far its probably the most similar thing to hearthstone but better balanced and designed in most ways i expected absolutely nothing going in lol bethesda but it really really surprised me it has a few major improvementschanges from the basic hearthstone formula the most notable ones are lanes no not like some games do which is usually too much and a couple systems to keep aggro in check no matter what cards are out you start with hp and when you reach and you draw a card also prophecy cards which are slightly overcosted cards but if you draw them when your opponent hit your face by reaching one of the hp increments they are free and you can play them right away
hearthstone,removed,nope im not twisting anything he says he always unconditionally defends or remains neutral for blizzards side i know this sub doesnt like to hear it because kibler is a beloved figure here but its true

hearthstone,removed,its unfair but life aint fair
hearthstone,removed,better translation go on and show off to the whore of your mother your deck is just as filthy and easy as her
hearthstone,removed,do you ever stfu youre putting this scam message of your own on every post that seems phishy fuck up kid
hearthstone,removed,why do people like him even have the right to use emotes is it just to prove that he is not a bot or is it because of his brain damage
hearthstone,removed,makes terrible deck proceeds to lose four ranks somehow concludes the deck is worth sharing another day another display of stupidity by umamasagtlassdas
hearthstone,removed,why are you assuming how they identify
hearthstone,removed,never said he was angry about the guy in the video he very clearly states his frustration about the people trying to justify what was an objectly bad play given the odds we have likewise how does playing any kind of unordinary deck shield you from discussion or criticism towards your plays are fun decks now equipped with nazi censorship rays who dont allow you to utter a single negative word

hearthstone,removed,these shitposts arent even funny step up your game
hearthstone,removed,obligatory fuk u puci comment
hearthstone,removed,this
hearthstone,removed,its fucking ridiculous that this person is still allowed to butcher this game i can bet bucks that if they gave jeff caplan hs as a side project with the team a size that hs has hed make it a far better game than brode could ever fathom to do killing cards because people choose to play them is utterly fucking ridiculous and unacceptable its a damn disgrace one would actually admit as a game developer that this is how things are changed in your game could you imagine if they nerfed heroes this way in overwatch or heroes of the storm this hero is picked too often nerf it to only have half of its hp nerf its abilities to have the cooldown and half the damage of this heros weapon then lets never revisit this nerf or change this hero in any manner ever again
hearthstone,removed,looking to trade gold quest eu you have to go first
hearthstone,removed,if we went with option wed have to inflate the power level of the entire game which you did later on the same year with msg anyway games end on turn now never used to be the case before gods help us all when reno is removed and renolock seizes to exist we could slightly reduce the powerlevel ie keeper but our goal was to make a big impact why couldnt you just nerf it twice if you still thought it saw too much play why didnt you buff it once you saw that this card never saw any competitive play again if by big impact you meant that you wanted delete this card from the game well done we chose keeper because silence isnt something we wanted to be an autoinclude effect it should shift in and out with the meta and your solution was to entirely remove this effect from the game by making every card that has this effect be utterly unplayable trash great balancing technique ancient of lore because too much card draw can make games feel the same each time how about you compensate for essentially making a card cost mana more give it health or something that at least makes it survive better against and or buff the healing effect to restore health to make it playable in other decks that require survivability im completely sure this effect was probably picked in less than of the time clearly indicating that this effect was extremely underpowered compared to the alternative we could remove classic and basic entirely but then our sets have to contain many more cards that do sameish things you could also balance cards like normal games do by nerfing them slightly then nerfing them more if needed and if the nerf was too big you buff them i get it that you dont want players to get full dust refunds by disenchanting changed cards so what you could do is give nothing when a card is buffed and only give full dust value on cards that were not nerfed in the past months and give half of the dust value on cards that were nerfed in the past month weve discussing another option recently rotating a few cards out of classic directly into wild and allowing full dust refunds for them it allows cards that are balanced but a threat to standards ability to change each year to exist for player who want to play them in wild recently this seriously didnt occur to you when you went butchering cards to make them unplayable in the beginning of last year i dont visit hearthstone sub as much as i do some others but i am sure that somebody suggested this its not that difficult to think of this this is what shouldve been done instead of making cards completely unplayable especially since you acknowledge that you made them unplayable on purpose
hearthstone,removed,this is an advanced throwaway with metaautistic wmd commentary hi
hearthstone,removed,shiiit nigga
hearthstone,removed,im telling yall this guy is one stupid ass fat fuck
hearthstone,removed,reynad vs is bad so they must be just like all those stream snipers that dont play around his cards but they are winning so they must be snipping
hearthstone,removed,youre team is bad at game design you need to get your house in order you have gone from classic and basic being the backbone of hearthstone to they hurt the meta meanwhile you print a bunch of objectively broken cards and pushed the curvestone style as much as you can when a buttload of your players aka clientele dont want to play curvestone
hearthstone,removed,please post your full battletag for example your region reading is hard

hearthstone,removed,i hope youll catch something shameful and untreatable
hearthstone,removed,handed the dread sentence which babbles of cragged towers under the bastard light of a cursed moon the color of shameslicked silver it pads on heavy feet through soggy corridors and around jagged corners and trenches inches deep yet miles wide which are roads to an incessant maw it gapes open to reveal a midnight dread sphere with a dizzying accretion disk a a wayward terror spinning round and round and round like dancing monkeys retarded and fooled by their own instincts just as you have been fooled my a false message slipped into your sleeve and threaded within the fibers of your cloth and woven stitched alongside each ripple in your mind which will be dissected and separate bloodied like the folds in a rose

hearthstone,removed,its so satisfying to watch when a dumb ass guy who bms gets punished lol what a retard
hearthstone,removed,shit if you play even a modicum of priest raza has been awesome if you play priest mage or warlock a lot then kazakus is probably a no regrets craft ive been having a blast with him too
hearthstone,removed,nah you can play casually and just go hard one season and make legend pretty easy simple as if you play a lot and never made legend youre fucking horrible
hearthstone,removed,you make a deck that isnt competitively viable but instead made for the video ask a friend to duel you and have them bring you to one health with full taunts on board after wiping all other cards except knuckles and the charge rhino hit record edit upload to youtube and then upload to reddit for karma after all that sit back like the monkey boss you are and stroke your bejeweled brass knuckles
hearthstone,removed,kripp doesnt want to just reach the top of the ladder using the most popular decks he likes interesting decks that force decision making he plays around with different things and tries to make suboptimal stuff work i find that far more interesting than watching another streamer hit legendary using a popular deck hes also very calm and even when hes pissed he doesnt do some overly elaborate fake reaction like some streamers
hearthstone,removed,as long as hes never touching balance again im fine dude has the collective iq of a potato

hearthstone,removed,you must be slow because i have stated i have actually studied the game and learned all the combos
hearthstone,removed,i am bored of year olds like yourself
hearthstone,removed,and i am an engineer making figures unlike you
hearthstone,removed,yes and sadly i never did well with it have tried to adapt to many styles of decks i used to only play priest then things went rocky after standard hit all of a sudden i couldnt use my voljin etc really hit me hard struggling ever since then to do much which is fairly depressing
hearthstone,removed,how is he clearing my deathwing the turn after i smash it right into his face ending him at that point its too late
hearthstone,removed,im glad you know your place
hearthstone,removed,is my time really worth more than this and im not im depressed see everyone being happy and in relationships getting married and then there is me so i am resorting to pissing people off because hey its the one fucking time im not invisible of course i know these posts are useless but hey useless posts with content is way better than crying in a ball in my bed
hearthstone,removed,so youre telling me yogg saron is the answer
hearthstone,removed,autist
hearthstone,removed,so you got cancer at since cancer covers a wide variety of ranges that can reduce your life expectancy to a couple of weeks to nonlethal at all you probably still shouldnt joke about cancer in the end just because you got some cancer at you didnt tell us if you still have it and laughing about it makes you an utter nihilist which you basically are most likely you did not even had cancer and all is made up bravo
hearthstone,removed,tips your mother
hearthstone,removed,dont worry man i got plenty of jokes about your mother wanna have fun now or later

hearthstone,removed,tell me assclown how am i supposed to counter mages in a row each with flamestrikes that cleared my board twice while i had no way to clear his board playing shaman please tell me how i can win that since youre so fuckin gud moron
hearthstone,removed,heroics are easier these days partially because we have a ton of options and mechanics to exploit but no theyre fucking easy because blizzard cant make good encounters you know whats hard to beat dragon warrior dragon warrior is better than any deck from this weeks encounter go back and play heroic naxx yes we had less cards but in those encounters they though of easy counters and dealt with them playing alex would cause the boss to kill her they had better super broken cards powerful hero powers now theres a deck that literally kills itself a boss that gives you mana and still plays drops and one that just plays random spawn cards so if you get unlucky with beast or mech you lose so fucking dumb and easy to beat its bullshit and people like you should not be making excuses for such clear lack of thought i paid for this

hearthstone,removed,the way i see it the problem now relies on shaman and to a certain extent hunters being too strong the other successful aggro deck currently is zoolock discard lock and they are balanced by having almost no spells cheap but mediocre minions that rely on pressure and board presence which are deadly once youve dealt with their minions they will have a hard time coming back shaman they have the answer to frickin everything early game minions check buffs check powerful weapons like spirit claws and doomhammer card draw check board fill check board clear check single target nukes check silence disable check all of their cards are relevant from early to late game and they have every answer against any kind of deck theyre playing against control you rush them down faster and hex key minions against aggro nothing a thalnos drake wrath totem maelstrom portal cant do and you got a fiery war axe with more durability as for hunters the huge amount of deathrattle minions is what made them really good they can easily trade things without losing too much because they gain the deathrattles also they become slightly unhindered by board clear which used to be deadly vs aggro because the deathrattle keeps their board presence making enemies having to spend more resources to deal with things after they clear the board barnes is basically god in that deck because the only nondeathrattle minions are kings elekk and houndmaster which most hunters now play copy of also dont get me started on how every hunter i play against always have highmane on and cotw on turn and another one at if somehow you managed to clear the board finally call of the wild is probably one of the most powerful cards in the game it instantly gives you powerful minions and a guaranteed minimum damage on anything the card is extremely potent on both early and lategame and either when youre winning or losing to deal with this issue and if blizzard really wants to make the game to slow down so the game doesnt turn into a clown fiesta dominated by aggro decks is to actually stop making cheap cards to be really strong stop creating cards with insane effects that applies to mostly shamans and hunters while other classes cant even do a thing until turn at least and by turn theyre already way behind since the aggro deck already has like minions on the board and its opponent already have less than hp left by turn

hearthstone,removed,so youre telling me that a freaking card game required grinding get out of are people straight up dumb pros have been doing to legend forever now i am not saying that everyone should be on kolentos level but new players shouldnt really aim for high ranks they should aim for fun and learning the game maybe blizz should give everyone a full collection no a full golden collection god i swear people on this sub are spoiled entitled kids ive personally coached friends to rank this very month it took me hours each so whats your deal just chill play the game and within a couple of months of not spending a dime youll have at least decent deck
hearthstone,removed,noob
hearthstone,removed,i guess the harsh reality is that your friends suck got in total around people on hs they love the game and how players can actually climb so soon to be fair i coach them to rank but its good enough for them i guess people want what they want blaming the game when its not the problem doesnt accomplish anything pirate warrior is a deck that can get you legend and it requires like dust withing months depending on how much you play you can get it by playing casually
hearthstone,removed,would you be kind enough to link them other than downvote me damn youre mad maybe cause youre bad feelsbadman take away my internet points dude thatll make your dick bigger

hearthstone,removed,your mom
hearthstone,removed,what the actual fuck friend you really want to make one of the worst mechanic in hearthstone applied to all charge minions its pretty ridiculous also you really like to have game decided by a coin flip especially in arena it hurts so much in constructed joust cards are very unpopular due to their random nature

hearthstone,removed,running excavated evil in dragon priest is pure nonsense its a deck designed to snowboard early board control its not a control deck at all even dragonfire potion is considered too reactive by many to be included and entomb is also pretty nonsense in this meta i see you successfully ignored my point about adventures though congrats
hearthstone,removed,lmfao you couldnt be more of a caricature of the typical reddit noob youre not even trying to answer my points and everything you think you know comes from watching streamers since youre actually garbage at the game you obviously dont play high level ladder yet you feel like you can argue about the game with people who do i dont even know what to answer to you about priest of the feast since your comment is just retarded why would this card not be good in dragon priest its a minion with great stats it fits perfectly in the gameplan excavated evil fucking obviously doesnt which is why no one plays the card in dragon priest which you would know if you were a decent player
hearthstone,removed,unlike you im just as good as those streamers and i can use my own brain to form opinions kibler is known for making greedy bad decks that he finds fun he always climbs extremely slowly the fact you use him as your source just proves how deeply ignorant you are people who play dragon priest at legend dont play those cards thats the reality of the ladder its a fact there is nothing actually worth debating here
hearthstone,removed,holy fuck what part dont you understand of the game plan is to snowball early board control youre supposed to be the player on the board otherwise youre gonna lose as i already explained bu you didnt register apparently this isnt a control deck this card nukes your board how is it not obvious to you that its super bad to play excavated evil in there
hearthstone,removed,against aggro you also have board by turn otherwise you lost the game im outta here its obviously pointless to argue with bad players
hearthstone,removed,sylvanas is gachigasm

hearthstone,removed,aaaaand this is exactly what makes you rhearthstone such a fucking toxic group of neckbeard assholes posts like this what the fuck this is seriously borderline witchhunting youre digging to find out dirt on a dev and then judge whether or not they should have even been hired who the fuck are you people how fucking old are you twelve jesus christ last time i checked out of this hideous sub it was because of the grim patron meltdown followed by the secret paladin meltdown you fucking psychos had checking out again i should learn my lesson
hearthstone,removed,its a bad game poorly designed the high production values decent ui the collectathon elements and the wow universe make it appealing and addictive but its not fun and the gameplay is horribly imbalanced people call this subreddit a circle jerk of negativity but it still fundamentally accepts most of the core design decisions in the game and so constantly hopes that a few new cards will make everything ok when onik releases these threads will disappear of you will take whatever new meta deck appears and by virtue of it being new will hail the expansion a victory and play that deck for the next months if you want to hear objective options about hearthstone ask the former whales who have now quit they have no current investment financial or emotional in the game and they are out spending their gaming time on other titles from that perspective hearthstone is one of the most poorly balanced competitive games in recent times with the most stubborn dev team i think i have ever seen and no hope in hell of major major design flaws some present since alpha being fixed there really isnt an argument the game is horribly broken from a competitive pov and each expansion reinforces play styles and win conditions that reduce the competitive value of the game even lower but this will continue forever because enough of you will be swept up with the excitement of the strong new cards and as you win with them n ladder through no virtue of your own youll attribute that success to your own skill and continue to buy and spend money on hearthstone the end
hearthstone,removed,i demand that you shut the fuck up
hearthstone,removed,makehearthstonepurifyagain
hearthstone,removed,your memory is a lot rosier then mine for the competitive state of priest state in different expansions naxx priest got a big buff but it wasnt a top tier deck it was a competitive tier deck which is the best it usually peaks at you still got overun by hunter and zoo undertaker decks without the right answer and they were hurt even worse by the nerf to undertaker then hunter or zoo was gvg velens plus deathlord improved your win rate but it wasnt an auto win ironbeak owl was prevalent and face hunter could still race you down they didnt have great ways to heal or stabilize tgt dragon priest looked amazing until secret paladin took over along with other otk decks like grim patron probably one of the stronger points of priest until people started refining decks loe they got an amazing control card in entomb but again not a top tier deck it just cemented their late game and their fatigue game still got beat up by combo druid anyfin otk freeze mage renolock and aggro shaman missing the mark in wog i think people were dissapointed in wog but it was at least understandable however blizzard didnt meet their expectations in balance the game like they said they would at the launch of standard they made a bad meta read one of the lead designers couldnt understand how cthun rogue wasnt a thing yet in a very slow nzoth paladin meta priest did alright as soon as any aggro or midrange decks refined themselveit was over this is the point blizz can get things wrong and people arent upset with this it is the fact that it takes until the next expansion to change things ups and karazhan didnt change things up it gave priest one of the worst cards of the set on wild this isnt wild wild is the new casual there were about legend players in na for wild when there were several thousand for standard there is no meta reports to propagate strong decks and without nzoth and nerf to combo druid priest wouldnt be doing as well blizzard balance team hasnt improved since beta it isnt that blizzard doesnt get the cards right it is that it takes months to even look at the problem where other games are more responsive and dont leave an unfun state of the game that long people are tired on an unresponsive blizz team and getting the answer right is undermined by the time it takes to get there as an extreme example we should have loved the new deck slots and the default decks were a nice touch but that shouldnt take years to do it poisons the improvement by keeping people angry for so long simply printing op cards i disagree with you on this one blizzards design strategy is to push a deck archetype over several expansionsadventures until it reaches critical mass shaman was actually strong in tgt but suppressed by secret paladin so it kept getting so many new tools that crept into standard that makes it the deck right now the same is going to happen to priest it will keep getting new tools until it is oppressive and then they wont nerf it because it will be another decks turn to be op the problem with purify isnt that it is weak but it doesnt address the main problems of priest and is more concerned with pushing a silence deck archetype then solving the problems we have now the same thing with the resurrect deck archetype we will probably get some amazing targets other then injured blademaster next expansion but we needed those tools now there is no strong or drop like we had in past expansions and even our drop cleric is rather weak at this point most arent upset that priest hasnt been a tier deck but they want a tier playable deck and wog missed the mark blizzard didnt follow up on balancing after their wait and see approach like they always have grim patron took months mysterious challenger never got touched old murkeye got removed when it should have been in standard but that would require balancing anyfin repeating arena balancing mistakes years for deckslots which they just allowed us to delete basic decksetc blizzard gets a lot of stuff right but no one is happy waiting months and their default position is wait and see even if they are wrong which means we wait more months nothing happens and then are asked to wait another months for new content to balance it gets old they want us to rely on cards like book wyrm which i think its major upside is keeping dragon decks alive after brm cycles out but it is a double situational card with a poor statline have a dragon have a attack or less target and they are saying trust uswe think this will work despite dragon decks being weaker in the meta other decks getting stronger early game and priest getting early game sorry i dont trust them at this point and it feels like the same old pr lines until they want me to buy their new content tldr priest has never been a tier deck and that is alright wog missed the mark and that is alright problem is an unresponsive blizzard and waiting too long for fixes even when they are right no one is content just to wait for novdec for blizz to fix this or even another month to wait and see apprach that trustgoodwill has been eroded by their past actions
hearthstone,removed,people hit legend with priest its possible unless you are retarded
hearthstone,removed,if you cant understand how that card is utter shit then you have some problem with understanding card games priest is a class that almost always need multiple card combos to do anything and this is another one of those case which makes your hand clunky and games unreliable this is just terrible and another insult to the playerbase after
hearthstone,removed,no you wont scrub ass youll cry and cry and cry until your class is mediocre and then cry cry cry that you never get enough stay free priest scrub
hearthstone,removed,why do the people that insist that purify is good talk an eastern european accent dont worry purify is good card lot of potentials with card like creepy statue and watchers
hearthstone,removed,you are right had the same reason in mind after going threw silence priest minions and the new karazhan set the thing is if you want to be a soulpriest and want to get rid of your auchenai effect you can play silence for mana which means more consistency and tempo who wants to pay more mana for a card draw and one more mana for nothing
hearthstone,removed,you clearly didnt read what i said and if you did youre justifying calling the the worst dev team of all time
hearthstone,removed,get purified mana spell destroy your weapon
hearthstone,removed,what the fuck is wrong with you
hearthstone,removed,i hate disguised toast
hearthstone,removed,youre incredibly low level if you dont see why boosting the damage on characters like that would be problematic youre an idiot if you think theyre weak characters their kits just arent suited for the type of gameplay in competitive they are designed for quick play asking for defense hero buffs is like putting torbjorns extremely fast autotracking on engineers turret in its an uncessary buff to a class that regardless of how strong would never be played in competitive because the design of competitive is flawed i know for a fact you dont play at a high level if you dont know this pros have been complaining about the way competitive mode is designed since its release yet you noobs keep thinking its a problem with defense heroes being too weak and offense heroes being too op youre incredibly narrow minded to think a simple solution like nerfing offense damage and buffing defense is going to help in any way beyond making both class archetypes worthless
hearthstone,removed,step down resign you are the cancer of this community not the playerbase not even the dramamagnet twitch streamers and their bands of chatspamming edgelord followers compare to you in making hearthstone an unenjoyable and toxic environment seriously step down from anything related to game design altogether now

hearthstone,removed,legion book spoilers a naaru sees him in the future as an avatar of light guiding light against the void so doing a redeemed illidan wouldnt really work
hearthstone,removed,every point you make is the most flawed shit ive ever seen frankly ever which is hilarious honestly you really must be retarded if you genuinely believe everything you say so yeah i am being serious which is an argument against you youre telling me that even more people have seen this than those that saw this thread right i see no way in which this was an argument against me i was just saying and yes obviously more people have seen it than have seen this thread thats the point of spreading thingspetitionsideas that you want support for otherwise sites wouldnt link to other social medias saying share with your friends this is one little cocky thing youve been doing since youve made this thread not everyone has the same opinion as you okay its not of people that think the same way you do people do care to differing extents you clearly have very few supporters compared to what youd act like you have and the percentage upvotes is a strong indicator of that implying that i care about upvotes and downvotes when my intention was to clearly spread this petition is a bold fuckin statement to be completely honest as you just said above less people have seen this thread than have seen the petition so clearly i dont have a small percentage of supporters especially when you consider the explosion of hate towards purify just about everywhere from to twitch to fucking tumblr but apparently you missed the gigantic wave of hate so ill just summarize it by saying every pro player and the vast majority of players hate it im not going to argue that priest is a good class i think its evident that it isnt however i think its absurd to suggest preventing the implementation of a card from an adventure into the game when it has already been revealed and so close to the release of the adventure i think its absolutely absurd to think that they couldnt change it considering games like mtg and yugioh have done almost exactly the same thing with the added barrier of being physical but blizzard simply cant be bothered to utilize the incredible tool they have of being digital because thats simply too much work to do i am telling you that people seem to understand the impracticality of telling a company not to ship a product that theyve been planning for so long and have already revealed and announced you really didnt make it seem like thats what you were saying at the beginning whatsoever as a cherry on top the condescending comments and attitude dont really help your credibility no matter who agrees with you

hearthstone,removed,how old are you
hearthstone,removed,hahaha i wasnt going to but once i saw the lack of substance in your arguments it was picking low hanging fruit i think youre mad because you know youve lost deal with it
hearthstone,removed,so your logic is swashburglar a card that is just flat out worse than babbling book is a great card while babbling book is terrible is because its in tempo class instead of being in another tempo class that runs the most spell synergies in the game alright
hearthstone,removed,you guys are fucking retarded no you dont need to have a strong drop to survive the early game what do you think aoe is for you think control warriors play a strong drop priest with lightbomb and your problem is fixed you dont need a minion only solution
hearthstone,removed,what the fuck did you just fucking say about me you little bitch ill have you know i graduated bottom of my class in highschool because ive been involved in numerous secret carde developement meetings and i have over confirmed priest card ideas i am trained nerfing cards to the ground and im the top streamsniper in the entire neighbourhood you are nothing to me but just another noob i will wipe you the fuck out with starting hands the likes of which has never been seen before on this earth mark my fucking words you think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the internet think again fucker as we speak i am contacting my secret network of shitposters across the usa and your ip is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm maggot the storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life youre fucking dead kid i can be anywhere anytime and i can defeat you in over seven hundred ways and thats just with my warrior decks not only am i extensively trained in curving out but i have access to the entire arsenal of war axes and i will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent you little shit if only you could have known what unholy retribution your little clever comment was about to bring down upon you maybe you would have held your fucking tongue but you couldnt you didnt and now youre paying the price you goddamn idiot i will purify all over you and you will drown in it youre fucking dead kiddo
hearthstone,removed,thats a pretty pussy response
hearthstone,removed,opinions literally dont matter youre just a leech if the game isnt the way you like it you should be begging them to change it and thanking them when they tell you to fuck off
hearthstone,removed,good i have better things to do than argue with a sniveling child
hearthstone,removed,ugly crosseyed bowl cut looking ass hes almost as ugly as kripp
hearthstone,removed,i played for a couple hours and quit its been that way for years because wow is going down the toilet the numbers since lich king show most people agree
hearthstone,removed,wow thats impressive im amazed youd rather argue semantics than the bulk of my argument but ill say i again since youre confusedsub count has dropped so low in the eyes of blizzard they dont even post sub counts anymore
hearthstone,removed,i guess you can enjoy hs for about more years
hearthstone,removed,do me trade smorc

hearthstone,removed,man this thread is filled with salt no more than the announcement thread was we normally means we get brawls aimed at casuals every year yes the explicitly casual format is for casuals whats the harm in having one week for the hardcore players why not both i actually think the format would be really cool with some tweaks mostly in payouts but that doesnt change that i missing something i usually enjoy the rake is still ridiculous yep but so long as people know that going in i guess its fine its their gold to lose im totally in favour of one or two brawls aimed at hardcore players id rather there be real tourney support

hearthstone,removed,man youre a downer im telling you to not waste your time on salt and im the downer thats weird im going to have fun playing the game while im at work wish i could play right now but i cannot while you complain about a gamemode that isnt targeted towards you ive not done that ive complained about not being able to play a normal brawl i dont see why there cant be both competitive play need not come at the expense of casual play at any rate since they announced the heroic brawl they also gave us the play x cards quests so im a happy little casual
hearthstone,removed,dont youll just give them positive feedback on retarded ideas like this
hearthstone,removed,ftfy fuck this brawl and activisions sorry money grab attempt
hearthstone,removed,fuck off i care more about a free pack that i do over some empty sense of fairness in a card game

hearthstone,removed,because that is not my definition at all it doesnt matter what your definition is thats not how the english language works a balanced card would be midrange in power level by definition the actual definition not whatever the fuck you decided in your brain the word meant
hearthstone,removed,yes thank you for fucking explaining it over and over and fucking over again ive shown you screenshots of it in action the screenshots ive shown you shows minions below their maximum health maintaining the increased health after the aura is lost do you really think i need it explained did i ever ask a single time how it works how does that logically make sense that the health gained is persistent compare this to all the other aura effects in the game what other aura effects keep affecting minions on the board when the aura minion dies an aura is not a spell for the time im done with you youre not on topic and you are explaining basic shit that ive shown you you used a referenced that reinforced my point and i had to tell you to read the reference

hearthstone,removed,people playing aggro dont you feel retarded second highest rated comment is one calling people retarded for not having the same preference im not even a main aggro player and im pissed at that statement not that i dont play aggro shaman but i play dragon or resurrect priest just as much and cthun warrior was my main deck that i reached legend with many of the past months what is the point of playing the game to win yes in fact i like to win id actually argue that you are the one retarded if youre not playing to win actually id argue youre even more retarded because your whole comment is about how statistics show you arent winning yet again you call retarded all the players that play for that purpose
hearthstone,removed,uninstall and stop playing cancer helps
hearthstone,removed,i was talking about you playing midrange autopilot hunter
hearthstone,removed,this is definetly not true it is hard for someone without any responsibilities now to accustom to school let alone university or real work he has to make up every basic aspect of every class except maybe english waking up at concentrate for the next hours of boring education going home and continue studying sleeping when you have to and not when you want to thats a hell of a changeover since thats the exact opposite of his life now not to mention that he missed much life experience and especially work experience

hearthstone,removed,updating currently with screenshots of decks as normal done in around an hour max shoutouts to ucampermaybe for letting me know about this meta snapshot would have missed it otherwise lol too busy playing payday do you not like the tempostorm site as much as reddit are you hyped to see flamewaker is rotating out then this is just what you are looking for not really but its kinda a trademark thing now so just go with it tier decks tier decks tier decks pls come up with a better name in the future like old priest rogue tier decks tier deck rip tier also just to clarify no i am not trying to take away the websites ad revenue like someone tried to point out a while ago i am just letting you see the decks and decklists in their ranks but if you want to get guides on how to play and mulligan and cards you can tech in and out then i would highly suggest you go to their website i dont want to force you however if you do want to then feel free to join the where we will answer any question you have about the game of hearthstone to the best of our knowledge and some memes

hearthstone,removed,sure we do that kind of stuff is easy to find just take a look at httpswwwsimilarwebcomwebsitetempostormcomoverview and httpswwwsimilarwebcomwebsitevicioussyndicatecomoverview on similarweb and youll see that tempo storm was trending up until vicious syndicate came on the scene and started releasing their report and are getting about million less visits per month while vicious syndicate has exploded in popularity out of nothing although its limited at the moment by being known mostly just by the reddit community and it doesnt have the broad exposure or multiple other games that tempo storm does the general consensus that vs is kicking tempo storms ass is backed up by numbers
hearthstone,removed,loled on harambe
hearthstone,removed,yes it has been done before someone posted a few days ago abiut sitting on wins with all classes so
hearthstone,removed,says the guy who picked a fight before you explain anything to me go learn what hypocrisy is that has more to do with how you perceive these slights as attacks on you as i explained before it was meant in jest and i even apologized for any misunderstanding it may have caused instead of seeing that you focused on another perceived slight and you got defensive and called me a slut sorry but thats on you in other words you know you are wrong and just cant admit it and just want to try and bow out while saving face its much easier to not listen to the other person and just continue thinking youre right as im sure youre well aware of ps this time it was meant to be insulting

hearthstone,removed,engrish
hearthstone,removed,so i wanted to start off by saying i think the development team has done a pretty great job with the cast of heros in hearthstone they are diverse interesting and compelling from jaina to lliadrin to tyrande the female cast reflects a large spectrum of personalities and player fantasies with that being said lets talk about valeera from a miracle standpoint shes the star of the show shes a great hero when we look at the way shes portrayed in promotional media lore and art in game we know a few things about her shes fast shes silly shes kind shes a good friend her body seems to be comprised of about spunk almost all of her art reflects this shes got cool skins insert skin link shes got fun bm incredible shes got amazing victory lines happy feast of winterveil all of this art reinforces the great character youve built around tracer then out of seemingly no where we have this pose what what about that bottom has anything to do with the character youre building in valeera its not fun its not silly it has nothing to do with being a fast elite killer it just reduces tracer to another bland female sex symbol we arent looking at a alleria pose here this isnt a character who is in part defined by flaunting her sexuality this pose says to the player base oh weve got all these cool diverse characters but at any moment we are willing to reduce them to sex symbols to help boost our investment game getting art into a triple a game isnt a small task it has to go through an implementer a team lead an art director and a creative director this is a team effort and i believe the team is responsible for upholding the great example hearthstone can set to the rest of the industry for creating strong female characters i have a young daughter that everyday when i wake up wants to watch the onik trailer again she knows who valeera is and as she grows up she can grow up alongside these characters what im asking is that as you continue to add to the hearthstone cast and investment elements you double down on your commitment to create strong female characters youve been doing a good job so far but shipping with a tracer pose like this undermines so much of the good youve already done
hearthstone,removed,fuuuuuuck you
hearthstone,removed,have quests add me if you have one as well screenshot httpiimgurcomzpnncjgjpg
hearthstone,removed,me irl t∩t
hearthstone,removed,are you retarded
hearthstone,removed,then you would just complain about the board shaking you would probably prefer if the game was just on a spreadsheet for maximum efficiency right newsflash this game is for fucking babies its meant to look cool sorry if its not up to specs for whatever savant level apm youre trying to achieve
hearthstone,removed,the best one in my opinion was by far the card one just seeing every opponent concede
hearthstone,removed,nevertheless you had the perfect answer for your turn the ultimate play noboby could imagine the almighty and unfathomable escconcede play
hearthstone,removed,trihard
hearthstone,removed,call of the rager tavern barmaiden also seems fun
hearthstone,removed,for the love of god man do you not know that hs is derivative of the other trading card games out there right down to have cards named lightning bolt in both hs and mtg that are spells that do damage do you not know that theres this thing called tropes which all creators of creative content pretty much have to use to make their fictional works make sense to the audience have you lived your entire life under a rock tldr uh yeah another tcg is trying to be made film at never oclock
hearthstone,removed,the fucking cards you get theyre always fucking different i didnt think you were dumb enough that i needed to explain it again the classes stay the same but the decks used arent the same you dont even get to choose if you want to play as cancer or ebola
hearthstone,removed,realy nice work keep it up d artstation is your dreamside thats is realy awesome to look at like this d i love it more
hearthstone,removed,the way i see it much more problematic is the fact that blizz keeps trying to force us to play particular premade predetermined deck types when those dont work out were just screwed want to play paladin youre gonna play handbuffadin because thats virtually all we supported this release oh the deck didnt work out sucks to be paladin there is so little room for creative deckbuilding the way they do things now decks are more or less prebuilt by the devs on release they design a bunch of cards to synergize in a particular way we take those cards and use the obvious synergy because thats what they were specifically built to do and we have very little real choice in the matter as only so many of the cards are playable to begin with sure we have to make a few choices but nothing that amounts to actual freerange deckbuilding deckbuilding under the current system amounts to choose a class pick archetype a or b make a few tech choices of course people sometimes come up with synergies and decks the devs never foresaw but its so rare as the way things are done is so restrictive and again what happens when the deck blizz tried to build for us doesnt work out the class wallows in the dumpster until the next expansion
hearthstone,removed,i dont think so rape probably played an important role in the dawn of human civilization maybe having sex with your mother did too although i bet rape was a lot more common and normal
hearthstone,removed,noone cares about your faggotry down vote me its a throwaway
hearthstone,removed,what would you use your chest muscles for while hunting pulling throwing and all of that stuff would be your back shoulders and arms chest muscles are good for pushing or maybe for holding something down
hearthstone,removed,jew heh
hearthstone,removed,he realized there was no leeroy in his list and yet continued to play because he was far ahead and sure to win his game so he ddnt want a rematch at all he preferred to play with this list then he loses and ask for a rematch like what the heck
hearthstone,removed,who gives a fuck about professional tryhards
hearthstone,removed,dude shut the fuck up with the edits nobody gives a fuck you are on the front page with points

hearthstone,removed,eu you can add me if you need some help with your gold quest
hearthstone,removed,i wonder if blizz ever sees moments like that which very likely determined the outcome of the world championships and thinks hey maybe we should do something about this after a particularly hellacious rng run that saw me lose in a row to coin tosses i am going to check out elder scrolls
hearthstone,removed,its the only drawback when your favourite class goes from shit to top tier
hearthstone,removed,i got a better deal for you folks stop playing this shit game and do literally any other activity be it playing a different game learning a musical instrument or putting your nuts in a vice and having someone flog them and see your happiness objectively improve

hearthstone,removed,do you have any sense of humour do you tell a joke sometime cnat you tell this has nothing to do with shamans being op its just that someone was so lucky that they played elise in one turn got the map the next turn and got the monkey the turn after do you even have friends you little fuk shit head mr im so good at this game and every post will be seriously analysed and evaluated get a life and go out some time to learn a basic level skill called sarcasm humor detection

hearthstone,removed,watch out the shitstained mods here ban for yogghate and going against the circlejerk this is why hs will never be accepted as a serious esport
hearthstone,removed,in every yogg thread fuzati throws a fit because people dont like his favorite card as much as he does youre pathetic
hearthstone,removed,stalk you lol sorry to disappoint you kid but youre not that important i just noticed you getting butthurt in every yogg thread and arguing with people about it
hearthstone,removed,this is why starcraft is the best esport but its still struggling because its too hardcore for the casuals blizzard learned from this they will never again make another game like starcraft it just doesnt bring them money so dont expect hs to get any better if anything it will get worse judging by stupid rng shit cards like yogg the casual player who plays games a week is all that matters to them ubbrode
hearthstone,removed,i mean both starcrafts is more balanced than bw ever was so to call it failed is pathetic if you havent played the game in the last years dont comment its by far the most demanding esport game out there bar it has the least amount of rng and you depend only on yourself
hearthstone,removed,fap fap fap
hearthstone,removed,youre not really in a position to talk about people spending their days and having too much free time when you dont leave your basement and have posts arguing about yogg in every thread lol
hearthstone,removed,idc if dota or csgo are second sc is still number its not a team game its not inherently casual like mobas which were born out of custom games because people didnt want to bother with the main games and it actually has the most consistent progamers and high level plays in hs person became champion for time and people lost their minds in sc you have people being on the top for years because skill and practicing actually fucking matters if there is videogame that can be compared to chess thats starcraft even their unpopularity is similar
hearthstone,removed,man up u pussy u sound like a little girl
hearthstone,removed,rip or whatever the assholes name is d

hearthstone,removed,rip massan
hearthstone,removed,i got hunters in the row and one game i top deck perfect turns emperor thaurissan got on turn and have part of the combo he have minions and can kill me next turn i had a fiery war axe with one attack left i played loot hoarder for into ravaging ghoulwhich i draw this turn in to draw my last brawl clear complet board and top decked my last piece for the combo and next game lil bit the same but instant of the brawl i draw the missing part
hearthstone,removed,
hearthstone,removed,unfortunately i think so as well everyone is rejoicing in belief that major viewbotters such as and massan are going to get banned or sink but honestly they will always find a way to exploit the system in order to deceive the audience and make a living out of it im still hoping for the best though perhaps we will finally see some justice being done by twitch it would help other smaller streamers a lot and overall much better experience for everyone
hearthstone,removed,you dont know these people are children and nobody cares where this shit came from the way you can tell nobody cares where this shit came from is that the question wasnt where did this shit come from or similar
hearthstone,removed,paypal has nothing to do with it and this wont get any federal court involved jesus fucking christ i love it when people just literally shit all over their keyboards and broadcast it for the whole world to see a lawsuit filed in a federal court in california wont involve any federal court what the company that processed all payments and holds all the relevant records has nothing to do with this lawsuit what but even if it was they would defend it in court or simply refuse it dont you follow the news this exact case just happened weeks ago when apple refused to unlock the iphone of someone the fbi investiaged and big tech companies supported them holy shit could you be any dumber could you comment on something you know less about if you think paypal can simply say no to a federal court when they issue a subpoena to produce documents you are thicker than a brick they can challenge it in court but good luck chuck not to mention the fact that these two cases could not possibly be less alike they have absolutely nothing to do with one another and you call them the exact same case what in one case a law enforcement agency petitions a district court to use the all writs act of to order apple to create something that does not currently exist and apple objects since there is no precedent for such use of the act and in the other case a company is ordered to turn over documents it already possesses and are relevant to a lawsuit so in one case we have something unprecedented and in the other we have something that has happened in probably of all lawsuits of this nature please do not respond to my comments you complete and utter idiot
hearthstone,removed,rito pls nerf arena
hearthstone,removed,the largest hearthstone bot shut down
hearthstone,removed,durrhurr lets all go shamanwarrior and forget this whole conversation my point was that all classes should be considered viable so that ranked queue wouldnt be about facing the same class of the time but about preference over a certain class not cos class x or y is in a strong spot but if you think that we should just adapt into playing a certain class every season then okay then finei dont
hearthstone,removed,renolock is fucking dogshit it will be tier on a good day probably not even tier otherwise terrible weak deck with no good matchups it is basically free dust at this point
hearthstone,removed,or join the bunch of donkeys and ditch my values and play shamanwarrior so we get a few more of those for the rankedq
hearthstone,removed,sorry but youre wrong well of course i take your opinion backed up by nothing very seriously since you play at least a dozen different video games and magic the gathering also youre making yourself look like an ass by blowing up at the littlest things calm down and have a reasoned discussion or no one is ever going to take you seriously someone being condescending while saying literally the dumbest shit possible is not a little thing in my opinion also shut the fuck up im dealing with a moron who says a federal court will have nothing to do with a lawsuit filed in a federal court all the while acting condescending does that sound like someone i want to respect me does that sound like someone i would want to take me seriously or what hell be an idiot for the rest of his life see if i care i just want people who read his completely false statements to know they are just that

hearthstone,removed,sir you clearly do not understand how money works of course blizzard lose money when they offer full dust refunds for cards after the standard nerfs i disenchanted all of the nerfed cards none of which ive yet recrafted and ended up with dust so when standard came out i had an extra dust thats a lot less packs i needed to buy to get all of the cards i neededwanted youre being fucking retarded if you thing that blizzard can just give out better arena rewards without losing profit its already the most rewarding part of the game why the hell would they offer better rewards than what they already give

hearthstone,removed,it is offensive that you spam a black man emote just because there is a black person on the stream it is very childish and treats being black like something funny or remarkable and lets not talk about when twitch spams that emote whenever someone plays a monkey and for all of those genius that talk about white emotes like kappa the difference is that people dont spam that emote just because there is a white people on the stream

hearthstone,removed,kid youre not intelligent enough to respond or did you buy worth of cards and think youre good kid
hearthstone,removed,kid what does knowing about a reno help me you idiot he either can do it or cant and its not in my control you dumb ass and you act like im trying to not win and have the game go out it literally changes nothing kid
hearthstone,removed,kid true
hearthstone,removed,kid i own you there is nothing to learn from a child im letting you kids know you are inferior simply and play a garbage game and wasted money on the wrong company
hearthstone,removed,kid youre stalking my shit posts damn youre mad kid i own you
hearthstone,removed,kid no one claimed they were pro also kid this game is influenced by luck so even the best player cant logic lesson for you kid next i said im better than the ranks i vs usually kid but they just get lucky at the very end
hearthstone,removed,kid who says itt that isnt bullied no one is the answer kid youll have to tldr this for me kid im not going to read your rage shitpost kid
hearthstone,removed,kid who talks about memes unironically and isnt bullied in school kid youre and frail as fuck no wonder you correlate being small to smart you have nothing to hold onto that would give reason to live kid as i am unlucky in this game kid youre unlucky in life nothing can fix rng kid you got fucked in the genetic lottery kid its time to accept it
hearthstone,removed,kid i cant embarrass myself when youre inferior and your opinion is meaningless for that part im not trolling much i honestly dont care about nerds opinions who have no intelligence either genetic lotto losers kid next i cant care if im correct anyway
hearthstone,removed,kid youre lying to yourself nothing has proved anyones point at this point it is purely a defense mechanism hes projecting some so he doesnt kill himself or some shit
hearthstone,removed,kid maybe he was already checking this post because of all the inferior kids on it and not because i am able to identify what they are kid
hearthstone,removed,kid thats simply you projecting selfdefense mechanisms are there to protect you and to attempt to keep you healthy mentally but we both know deep inside that youre not healthy mentally and you never will be fortunate enough to have my genes or any normal persons
hearthstone,removed,kid you acknowledge my dominance and you value my opinion towards you my opinion is youre insignificant but entertaining you signified all of what i just said by your edit shit thank you for worshipping me
hearthstone,removed,kid who am i to know kid who isnt angry in some way to those who are inferior and blind so yeah its probably a version of anger but what it also is is social conditioning from a state of leadershipsuperiority i can decide what is wrong and right and condition you to be like me by sharing my ideas im smarter than you and most so for everything to work better you must share my ideas
hearthstone,removed,look at it in the context of conditioning it changes you whether you want it or not and it is efficient youre going to resist i dont care its going to work its efficient too
hearthstone,removed,yes you invest because i own you you want to learn from me you dont know it consciously though you acknowledged that you have no value to me not at this moment but you will be valuable to me when you convert youre stupid relative to me but still smarter than the others in this thread since you realize what is good for you maybe not consciously but you still act on it
hearthstone,removed,unfortunate that you havent realized yet i thought you did i guess i made a mistake im so smart that i thought itd be obvious for you to worship me i keep forgetting youre not on my level kid sleep on it maybe youll be a fast learner and wake up and kiss my toes

hearthstone,removed,i think yogg was a card which seemed really fun and silly on paper but they didnt predict how it would play out in practise its kind of like how my parents in an effort to prevent me from becoming misogynistic and seeing women as objects would go over my internet history couldnt erase or id get my computer taken away and then review the stuff i watched and i had to explain why i masterbated to certain videos and what i thought of the women would i get along with her in real life did i just like her body what was her life like that led to her doing adult videos etc this led to me watching metart type vids and stuff with more intelligent nerdy girls so i could say i liked them cause they were smart etc this worked great until i figured out about private browsing and hidden folders and they found one during a review and it was full of mom son joi type vids and i ran away and hid in the woods for days and almost died of dehydration

hearthstone,removed,the majority opinion is that karazhan cards are not as good as past adventures but it actually does have useful cards if you have a brand new account for example pompous thespian is one of the most lackluster cards from the adventure but its actually pretty good compared to many of the basic cards anyway point being the negativity surrounding karazhan has more to do with the ladder meta if youre planning on playing then the other adventures will probably have rotated out of standard by the time youve amassed a decent collection but also it could be a good idea to buy only the first wings of league of explorers and blackrock mountain because it will let you purchase later wings sometime in the future even after theyve been removed from the shop

hearthstone,removed,basically you this deck without wood you begin to get wood by certain cards the cards that give you wood are put into the deck if youre fully erect before the deck is finished you click finish deck then you head into ranked but can only win when you are in a woodened state if you fail to stay woodened you have to concede basically i am wondering if anyone has gotten to legend with this type of deck yet

hearthstone,removed,so hes admitting to losing to a year old child where is this persons pride so far every time someone like this added me to cry theyve only managed to embarass and absolutely insult themselves my favorite being a guy that proclaimed he had arena wins per run on average and makes hundreds of thousands of dollars per month while i sit in my mothers basement yowch his biggest worry while hes rich and can have everything is apparently losing in a free card game
hearthstone,removed,because it is thats how they made it
hearthstone,removed,if you want to get maximum value make sure the coinback promo is active which refunds you of your spent coins
hearthstone,removed,look at your title who is we the only people that can remove posts are the mods so maybe rephrase the title as can you remove posts at this point youve probably realized that this post should have simply been mod mail
hearthstone,removed,i was hoping someone would find it i dont remember the exact tournament or even year i tried googling the phrase thinking i might find it because iirc it was often repeated as a joke on this sub so i thought it might lead to a vod link unfortunately it basically became meme status for some time so there are way too many results to sort through

hearthstone,removed,whoever decided firelands portal should be a common card definitely never played any arena screw him blizzard not giving any fuck about arena balance really remind me about wow arena balance where it was obvious you were considered a second zone citizen compared to pve or even battlegrounds even though they kept saying it wasnt the case only a few changes would help but they still dont even want to bother well i dont care i play mainly constructed now but still blizzard never changes

hearthstone,removed,hey man just because your stepfather raped you when you were doesnt mean you get to take it out on me ok
hearthstone,removed,whoever decided firelands portal should be a common card definitely never played any arena screw him blizzard not giving any fuck about arena balance really remind me about wow arena balance where it was obvious you were considered a second zone citizen compared to pve or even battlegrounds even though they kept saying it wasnt the case only a few changes would help but they still dont even want to bother well i dont care i play mainly constructed now but still blizzard never changes the problem is the design constraints theyve put on themselves in terms of the flavor of the classes mage is supposed to have the best spells in the game because its mage a spellcaster should have lots of spells thematically rogue is supposed to have low mana cards that allow them to exchange health and card advantage for tempo its part of rogues risk taking dynamic play style other classes have identity in places that arent related to removal shaman has totems poweful elementals and overload cards for tempo druid has ramp and big minions paladin has combat tricks and minion buffs warrior has weapons warlock has token spam priest has minion buffs and tricky conditional removal the problem is that in constructed you can choose exactly which conditional removal goes in your deck giving you good coverage but in arena you probably wont get a flexible spread of removal and the fact that it is not damage based but stat based means that you wont be able to even use it in combination with a trade making it dead in your hand i dont want every class to become mage and rogue i want all classes to get stronger in the context of there thematic strengths with maybe a few tools to level the playing field in terms of early removal like would a darkbomb for priest really be so bad to me at this point its very simple blizzard hates the existence of kripparian and everyone like kripp by that i mean players who are so good at the game that they can game the arena system to make infinite gold and packs if they want if all these people are playing arena and arena is a fair system then the majority of players are going to get absolutely fucking wrecked in arena i think brode is on record as saying that hes uncomfortable that a random person in arena could queue into someone like kripp or hafu and get destroyed by them when there is no mmr or such in arena to account for that the only way to combat this is to create classes in arena that are broken so these players who are not good at arena could in theory win against better players because they got decks so good it requires no thinking to play as long as you point your cards somewhere in the vicinity of the opponent so they give mage all the overpowered shit because they want people who are not so good at arena to have a chance to actually enjoy the format and in the process screw over those of us who like to play classes that arent mage or rogue on occasion then get fucking pissed off when a person whose so stupid they cant tie their shoes without help beats us in arena because of their class
hearthstone,removed,i said that it was impossible to recieve communication because overwatch has a pretty big team while hearthstone has two retards i was downvoted into the abyss oh no my points
hearthstone,removed,this comment section is retarded
hearthstone,removed,typical moron that knows nothing and spews lies
hearthstone,removed,because a large portion of people on reddit are aspies and cant distinguish even the most clearly sarcastic statements without an s at the end
hearthstone,removed,and your username asks for yuri japanese animated lesbian pron thats hilarious dude keep on memeing
hearthstone,removed,mad scientist dies and its deathrattle resolves at the end of the spell text phase putting cat trick into play the after spell phase where cards like flamewanker and cat trick trigger resolves next theres no explicit reason why they have to trigger in this particular order hs is just programmed that way its very much the same as mirror entity triggering after a battlecry minion kills a mad scientist
hearthstone,removed,i think you were trying to make this ¯ツ¯ type it like this ¯ツ¯ i am a bot visit rarmfixerbot for more info
hearthstone,removed,nice try to join in on the circlejerk about meta but druid is just as popular as shaman on ladder and definitely more popular than hunter however utter bullshit with knowledgeevidence is what this subreddit likes the most so i upvote you anyways
hearthstone,removed,whoever plays aggro shaman has either brain cancer no brain at all or is just completely shit at the game to play anything else that requires more than brain cell to function its just the truth
hearthstone,removed,point top comment wut
hearthstone,removed,this is sort of a fundamental issue with hearthstone the two biggest tcgs that made the genre sort of explode magic and yugioh do exactly what you describe in yugioh iirc you can only go face if your opponents board is empty but when you trade your opponent takes damage equal to the difference in attack values its a bit weirder because of the defense position mechanic but thats the gist of it in magic you can only go face and then your opponent can choose whether they want to take the damage or block with a minion in which case those two minions trade damage as they would in hs both of these systems allow any minion to be an effective defender not just those with an ability as hearthstone has with taunt it also means that minions actually do something the moment they hit the board in hs playing a minion when your side of the board is empty will often do nothing as your opponent can just trade with it when ahead over and over
hearthstone,removed,oh well that explains it youre just dumb
hearthstone,removed,the game is too simple and its designed to be accessible and so that bad or new players can compete and dont leave feeling frustrated the game is so easy everybody complaining about broken card around here is legend am i right guys fuck off people all you do is whine yet you cant get further than rank even by playing
hearthstone,removed,known scammer
hearthstone,removed,as defined by blizzard entertainment soon does not imply any particular date time decade century or millennia in the past present and certainly not the future soon shall make no contract or warranty between blizzard entertainment and the end user soon will arrive some day blizzard does guarantee that soon will be here before the end of time maybe do not make plans based on soon as blizzard will not be liable for any misuse use or even casual glancing at soon
hearthstone,removed,you make a retarded post where you are outright wrong in your claim because you lack the understanding of why the card isnt played anymore and then dont want anyone to correct your misinformation and outright incorrect statement maybe you should leave the sub and go post somewhere else
hearthstone,removed,i wouldnt the game is addictive and incredibly unsatisfying right now dont give blizzard the support it doesnt deserve find a design team that cares about their player base
hearthstone,removed,do you really need the s in order to interpret when someone isnt being literal are you that much of a fucking idiot or do you just jump at opportunities to press your glasses up your nose and in your most nasally voice say well actually
hearthstone,removed,lmfao u are actually making me cringe and the fact that a site is respected by wannabes from reddit doesnt make raw data relevant or meaningful i visited the subreddit you linked already once would rather not go back if u dont mind the infinite amount of made up acronyms that noone else uses and first time legend players trying to teach me play is cringeworthy id recommend it to you though its still better thank graphs of whats being played at
hearthstone,removed,so because he has the emotional maturity of a child and gets upset over a video game the game needs to be changed grow up lol
hearthstone,removed,grow up thats what idiots who can think for themselves say when they really mean just accept things for what they are
hearthstone,removed,im not criticising anyone you dense cunt except you i am saying i dont enjoy the game at the moment now go fuck off from whatever hole you came from i wont bother reading any further replies
hearthstone,removed,hearthstone was never meant to be an esport you fuckers when are you going to understand that stop fucking whining
hearthstone,removed,finally a fun brawl after dealing with face shamans and no welcome package this brawl will be a great emotional safety valve i think blizzard really needs to take into account just how drastically hearthstone can effect some players moods worst for me was last year when i was going through some severe mental illness social isolation whatnot and hearthstone was basically all i had going on in my life id just subbed to my favorite twitch streamer and i finally had the motivation to push for legend she adds subs to her battlenet so my goal was to get to rank one stars while she was streaming and then have rontu has just attained the rank of legend pop up on her screen and shed stop and be all wow thats so awesome its only the seventh and id be all mock humble in chat and brush it off and id end up offering to coach her on stream and id be very helpful but gentle and constructive with my tips and wed develop a flirty back and forthand well i think weve all watched enough sappy hollywood romances from the part of the issue was i needed to play honest midrange or control decks like renolock or priest rogue etc cause if she watched one of my games and saw i was just playing face shaman it would kill my mystique i was a rogue expert in arena so i figured that was my best bet i started obsessively watching ryzen and mryagut streams and was full on eye of the tiger with training i finally started laddering and just got beat down by wave after wave of aggro shaman i still tried to keep up my resolve and have a positive attitude but it was all shattered when i was just about to eke out a win when the shaman played finley into warlock hero power and then held a spell till rope at my face which turned out to be lava burst for exact lethal i just lost it i tried to add him but he ignored me i googled his name and the first result was a twitch account he was streaming live the guy looked like a parody of a bro gamer almost like a nick kroll character and he was laughing his ass off while bming me then yelled get fucked and was all thats how we boys thats how we do to his viewers i was so mad i was close to passing out and after looking at the email and info in his twitch bio it wasnt very hard to find his real identity a little googlefu and i had his apartment address and holy shit he lived less than miles from me minutes later i had packed a bag and was on the phone with a bus company i have a bit of aspergers and tend to raise my voice when excited and was probably screaming at this point i heard sir please calm down i cant understand you and i glimpsed myself in the mirror and saw the crazed look in my eyes and realized how insane i was and i dropped the phone and started laughing hysterically until i was on the floor crying after about five minutes of gigglesobbing i felt much better and my head was clear i have no idea what i was going to do when i showed up at his door all i know is i had a brain full of anger and a duffel bag full of knives im better now and saw a government appointed psychiatrist for months until i fell in love with her college aged daughterwhich is uhh nevermind haha suffice it to say im on medication and have dealt with a lot of deep rooted issues there has to be thousands of hearthstone players out there though who are even more mentally unstable than i was and if the day comes where theres a news report about a murder scene with the phrase thank you written all over the walls id be lying if said i didnt feel some blood was on blizzards hands
hearthstone,removed,i think stuff like this which undercuts how seriously we as players can take the game sometimes is a really great way to take the edge off kind of like last year when i was going through some severe mental illness social isolation whatnot and hearthstone was basically all i had going on in my life id just subbed to my favorite twitch streamer and i finally had the motivation to push for legend she adds subs to her battlenet so my goal was to get to rank one stars while she was streaming and then have rontu has just attained the rank of legend pop up on her screen and shed stop and be all wow thats so awesome its only the seventh and id be all mock humble in chat and brush it off and id end up offering to coach her on stream and id be very helpful but gentle and constructive with my tips and wed develop a flirty back and forthand well i think weve all watched enough sappy hollywood romances from the part of the issue was i needed to play honest midrange or control decks like renolock or priest rogue etc cause if she watched one of my games and saw i was just playing face shaman it would kill my mystique i was a rogue expert in arena so i figured that was my best bet i started obsessively watching ryzen and mryagut streams and was full on eye of the tiger with training i finally started laddering and just got beat down by wave after wave of aggro shaman i still tried to keep up my resolve and have a positive attitude but it was all shattered when i was just about to eke out a win when the shaman played finley into warlock hero power and then held a spell till rope at my face which turned out to be lava burst for exact lethal i just lost it i tried to add him but he ignored me i googled his name and the first result was a twitch account he was streaming live the guy looked like a parody of a bro gamer almost like a nick kroll character and he was laughing his ass off while bming me then yelled get fucked and was all thats how we boys thats how we do to his viewers i was so mad i was close to passing out and after looking at the email and info in his twitch bio it wasnt very hard to find his real identity a little googlefu and i had his apartment address and holy shit he lived less than miles from me minutes later i had packed a bag and was on the phone with a bus company i have a bit of aspergers and tend to raise my voice when excited and was probably screaming at this point i heard sir please calm down i cant understand you and i glimpsed myself in the mirror and saw the crazed look in my eyes and realized how insane i was and i dropped the phone and started laughing hysterically until i was on the floor crying after about five minutes of gigglesobbing i felt much better and my head was clear i have no idea what i was going to do when i showed up at his door all i know is i had a brain full of anger and a duffel bag full of knives im better now and saw a government appointed psychiatrist for months until i fell in love with her college aged daughterwhich is uhh nevermind haha suffice it to say im on medication and have dealt with a lot of deep rooted issues there has to be thousands of hearthstone players out there though who are even more mentally unstable than i was and if the day comes where theres a news report about a murder scene with the phrase thank you written all over the walls id be lying if said i didnt feel some blood was on blizzards hands
hearthstone,removed,someone left a report on this post with a suggestion on how we handle stickies do you think this is how stickies should be handled putting one at the top of a popular topic that addresses exactly one person and now everyone has to read this just because one person was a dumbass sorry two people
hearthstone,removed,youre too stupid for your own good while true theres not evidence that supports this being a direct cause op is posing the question is low new player attraction causing these deals the op youre replying to is saying all games do this regardless of new player count please find me the insult in there you fucking crybaby holy shit youre so sensitive did mommy not hold you enough daddy expect too much of you theres not a insult in there you stupid shit stop trying to say cuz u kno im rite
hearthstone,removed,not even of how many people have been exposed to the game from either a word of mouth or b their paid advertising campaigns i do not doubt blizzard is grateful but it would be completely wrong to think that streamers or pro players introduced more people to the game than timing and advertising did for blizzard if anything kripp reynads viewerbase grew because of blizzards ad spend not the other way around
hearthstone,removed,this post is really just useless garbage trying to rally up the reddit circle jerk to bash blizzard its disgusting
hearthstone,removed,according to my sources twitch chat blizzard teamed up with scamaz and north korea to take the tournament down by ddosing

hearthstone,removed,remember when naxx launched and it could take for or when gvg launched and only a few people were actually able to while trying to buy packs or how eu players frequent complaints that the httpswwwredditcomrhearthstonesearchqeudownsortnewrestrictsrontall to the point where blizzard pushed back the start time for tavern brawls in eu to keep the servers up its funny that you mention reno specifically as the reason reno didnt have the active glow at first was because they apparently came up with a solution since it works now but it wasnt always that way multiplayer games dont update every millisecond and arent performing as many calculations as you think looking at planetside with players in a single battle after some digging it seems that the actual population cap is around planetside also updates times per second or once every milliseconds hearthstone has players last i checked and if only are actively playing the same ratio as when the fps world record was set then thats still a times more players thats a lot of additional room for a more complex game especially since programmers cheat by skipping frames when calculations start taking too long as for hearthstone the game has collectible cards plus tokens with some cards having multiple animations summoning another minion entrance chooseone etc and we easily have a good animations and this isnt even including boss only cards but there isnt a timer during adventures to we can ignore them with a cheap comparison algorithm using animation ids instead of names optimized table hash mapping lets say that checking each item on the table takes processor cycles to get the value in the table and a second to compare it this is generous taking the hearthstone million total players even if only million people are playing at once less than the ratio we used above each card played could take to find the correct animation time a processor takes nanoseconds per instruction items in the table each taking instructions is microseconds per card played and players what i just calculated would only be the lookup time on the table which would be on top of processing the game running ai and regular network latency milliseconds while it probably wont crash the servers it could significantly impact the responsiveness and smoothness of playing the game its just enough input lag to be irritating again though all of this is moot since there could just be a flat animation time for every animation and it would likely even out over the course of the game and be infinitely cheaper in terms of processing power and development timeoverhead
hearthstone,removed,also being the aggressor requires less mind capabilities than being the one reacting to the aggressor do you really believe this the aggressor makes all of the decisions like you said they choose trades this is bad imo but true they decide how fastslow to play they weigh the risk vs reward of committing more resources to the board the control player sits back and plays as many answers as they have dont remove minions you lose if they have a board clear by the turn they need it they win and if they dont then they lose if its vs aggro draw cards for answers but vs control dont draw cards unless youre jade because then it doesnt matter you arent allowed to draw in control vs control because control has more answers than threats and no way to protect its threats so this match is either fatigue or misplays anyway you stall out with answers and then you kill the emptyhanded aggro player with your unless you lost on turn because your hand was bad or theirs was good

hearthstone,removed,the hs deck tracker clearly gives you an advantage over other players who dont use it people who dont want to admit that are just dishonest to themselves probably because they dont like to be seen as cheaters but the simple truth is without this tool most of you wouldnt reach the ranks you are reaching right now the whole pen and paper argument is ridiculous as well in reality pretty much nobody has the time or dedication it would take to gather all the information the deck tracker makes available at a glance there are two solutions to this problem deck tracker for everybody or deck tracker for nobody if blizz doesnt want to ban it at least make sure that everyone gets the information that a tool like this exists level the playing field actually actively support fairness instead of hypocritically talk about it and a thread in a rather random internet forum is not enough

hearthstone,removed,a lot of hs players are starting to feel like they arent being heard the whole outrage over purify is solid evidence of that i have also heard that a lot of players feel like blizzard is steering hs in a direction dictated by the dev team without taking into consideration what the actual players want now it is understandable that as game designers you cant always give players what they want or especially everything they want but isnt there something blizzard can do to make the players feel more like they matter going off of this what do you think about the next expansion or the one after that being a designed by the players expansion which includes specific cards designed by the players and fans of hs i personally would love to see some of those card ideas plus it would be interesting to see cards created by the players we all watch like reynad firebat kripp and i would love to see a hs card what do you guys think

hearthstone,removed,chess was around before white men even set foot south of the sahara hence no black people to be racist against the very notion that chess a game thats literally older than black slavery is racist just shows how stupid people have gotten are you actually saying white people predate black people learn your history boy we all came from africa then white people developed chess as a big fu to black people and what does black slavery have to do with this are you saying black people have only existed since slavery that racism against them was born only in the slavery era talk about subconscious racism ive got a couple of tumblr blogs you should read

hearthstone,removed,cool story doesnt change the fact that new players are routinely crushed by legendaries
hearthstone,removed,okay ive been doing my research there is no recourse for new players to compete against those legendary cards if im wrong make a new account open up a stream and lets see you crush them
hearthstone,removed,nothing of what you said is wrong but most trading card games allow for new players to construct decks that can compete with any other deck the spread in hearthstone is way too large
hearthstone,removed,thats what i thought
hearthstone,removed,hey all i promise to nerf our favorite trogg and mana if i receive a tyrande code thank you in advance and embrace the rng
hearthstone,removed,well first of all your an asshole for doing that second nobody wants to help you do that
hearthstone,removed,because i can you phaggot
hearthstone,removed,sure it does it doesnt there are a lot of cards in his deck your odds of pulling the right one are much lower no lets assume your opponent has card out of that you want and you got card that steals card chance of getting it then lets assume you wait that he draws cards and you try to steal it after then chances for getting it it is exactly same so why are you making bs replies as if you know something when it feels you havent even completed highschool math courses

hearthstone,removed,
hearthstone,removed,well yes i such an idiot on games expect garrysmod because i cant code anylonger and ben yes i made this account because im an idiot
hearthstone,removed,you seriously cant read can you im gonna repeat myself if you only look at what you pay in mana for what you get in return the card is basically a random minion that costs you pay for a discount random creature therefore the card is a random creature that costs less in terms of value you get x for y costs it obviously makes the card stronger that the mana cost you pay is split in two turns but its still the same mana cost overall it seriously feels like youre just trying to have an argument with me for no reason here if you think that looking at a card this way is completely meaningless just say so and we will end this stupid discussion

hearthstone,removed,why give a fuck about anything then nothing matters in the end why are people passionate about videos games music model airplanes why do people cry after watching an emotional movie or cheer for their favourite sports teams why did you type about starting hands in mtg not to mention the paragraphs and paragraphs of comments you made on rhearthstone youre pretty damn hypocritical would you go up to a golfer and say why are you playing golf what a waste of time your passion and enjoyment doesnt matter at all and then you go and try to act like some superior human being what a cunt

hearthstone,removed,this thread is complete shit useless garbage what did we get from this you left minions out that would have helped and oh the best part lets read what you put for antonidasarchmage antonidas this is very potentially powerful – the token would be as threatening as antonidas himself but far easier to remove i suspect this will be one of those barnes dream cards in the right scenario uh ok you basically told us yeah it has the same passive and is a and is good in the right scenario
hearthstone,removed,all of them are gay as fuck
hearthstone,removed,meanwhile the infamous dennis clip still exists add on to the fact that there are still plenty of infinite arena players that love being fed free wins because it seems that the common knowledge is that you wont get real opponents until about wins fair matchmaking shouldnt be an expectation once most average players are knocked out of a run if youre consistently only getting or wins per run there shouldnt ever be a chance youre matched against someone who regularly farms arena runs for packs or gold people constantly act outraged that rank farmers exists but seems completely content that the same concept is the norm for arena

hearthstone,removed,mayhem willing to help u in play with friend quest at eu server online now gonna accept ur friend request instantly
hearthstone,removed,the first set of advice is decent but reynad has no game a girl can size you up in the first seconds son your job is to con that stupid bitch into a state of bewilderment where she has no idea what she wants and then capitalize on that
hearthstone,removed,why not just the community makes a ban list like batstone but for ladder so ppl stop complaining and blizz can still make heavy rng cards
hearthstone,removed,was nerfed pretty quickly it was retarded it one hit headshotted at every range found in the competitive map pool maps which is fine but it also did like damage on bodyshots shot close range anywhere and shot in the dick at all ranges headshot damage multiplier is lower body is either and upper body is so it did just enough damage in the dick to shot actually retarded but yeah its been nerfed since but pistols are still retardedly broken fuck the and

hearthstone,removed,poorfag
hearthstone,removed,there is faster and more funny way to beat mill druid and it works against many other decks everyfin is awesome murloc tinyfin sir finley mrrgglton you need finley to choose life tap against other decks and he can stay on the board because nobody fears him and he has more hp than other murlocs for mana mill druid cant deal with that deck because i can play all my hand on turn three and have murlocs on board and they feed me the cards i need
hearthstone,removed,its you who needs to understand probabilities lets say you have a normal six sided die and roll it times theres a small chance that you roll six ten times the chance is exactly the same that is incredibly small as the chance that you roll exactly in this order and the chance to roll is also the same but because people are trained to find patters everywhere rolling a six ten times seems somehow more significant to us randomness doesnt care every outcome is equally possible to it you just happened to witness an outcome which happens to look weird to us humans
hearthstone,removed,if the game tells you heyoo changes and you just go like dont know dont care you deserve to be confused
hearthstone,removed,please dont encourage him
hearthstone,removed,just freaking get good at this game get wins and see for yourself
hearthstone,removed,they are required by the fcc to send the emails look it up
hearthstone,removed,cant wait for final version
hearthstone,removed,are you stupid the matchup chart on vicious syndicate shows that there are only slightly unfavorable matchups for yogg druid which they explain in a previous report is also the malygos druid deck which are aggro shaman and midrange shaman so by vs they are only slighbtly unfavored and not flat out loses as you claim also did you even read anything they said yogg druids presence is humble overall but at legend ranks its the goto deck for many players while the matchup against shaman isnt inherently great its quite close and the archetypes flexibility means you can definitely adjust to shamans overbearing presence to good success its quite close lol you dumbass the one outlier to the meta defining trifecta is yogg druid its an extremely strong archetype with great flexibility and few weaknesses it can beat every deck in the game which is why many pro players claim its actually the best deck in the game you cannot counter it in a tournament lineup and that is a very very big deal
hearthstone,removed,way to just pull a statement out of your ass you stupid fuck
hearthstone,removed,to be fair though its hard to otherwise track what a deck would be a mid range shaman curving out perfectly could just be an aggro shaman to you and you wouldnt be able to tell since you conceded turn hell i dont think you can tell for certain until turn with thunder bluff valiant hero power to reveal the true nature of the deck vs does attempt to address this by listing decently different mid range deck lists vlps xixo cerasi
hearthstone,removed,too bad bitch
hearthstone,removed,
hearthstone,removed,i wouldnt say its a surprise rng has been a core design principle for team since the day hearthstone was released as team sees taking advantage of the digital medium as meaning we can do rng things people have been complaining about rng since release and every new addition to the game whether it be adventure pack or expansion has continued to incrementally add more rng elements its a huge drawback for the game because its otherwise amazing it has great audio amazing artwork a wellestablished theme in wow and when rng isnt a factor games feel good whether win or lose although admittedly card draw rng can still be frustrating but theres no escaping that but regardless how good the game looks its beginning to feel bad for even casual players and thats the tipping point once team loses the goodwill of the casual player their misguided philosophy will finally catch up with them and with a number of new titles entering the market soon i can only pray that it gets someones ass over at blizzard marching into the team office to start the layoffs and correct course on this sinking ship
hearthstone,removed,so there are four versions of control warrior regular yogg nzoth and debatably cthun in every deck sylvanas and justicar are core however justicar along with some other cards like elise emperor and brann are the next to rotate out you have to decide if that matters to you in the first three decks elise is also core while brann is extremely good in cthun and emperor sees play in some cthun lists but isnt necessary if you have nzoth yogg cairne rag or twin emperor thats probably some indication of which version you should go for nzoth is the strongest version currently and can get away without running elise because most of the ladder is aggro but cairne sylvanas and gromm are core in this they are also in the classic set and generally good in standard control warrior as well i would say cthun is the cheapest version but has the fewest classic cards and plays the least like a control deck if cthun sounds good the only legendary you really need is twin emperor cthun is free afaik but even then you can probably get away without it if you have some strong midrange minions but if rotations matter to you at all and you want more of a classic control list my legendary crafting recommendation would be to start with gromm and sylvanas because theyre in basically every list and are classic cards after that it depends on which version you want but you can probably get away with only gromm and sylvanas in a standard control warrior list if rotations dont matter i would go justicar next or even first maybe for epics shield slam and execute are core in literally every control warrior list bash is great though so its nice that you have that obviously fiery war axe is also core but i believe thats a common im gonna edit this with a decent list assuming youre not starting with any legendaries and will be a while before you can afford to craft a few

hearthstone,removed,im at work ill take a screen cap when i get home
hearthstone,removed,because this place is a whiny shithole for manchildren to cry about how much they hate this game and confirm each other that they dont actually just suck balls at hearthstone
hearthstone,removed,people would write and do write about that and many more pressing matters they dont care one of the biggest we dont talk about that issues in the us is the severe constituent underrepresentation in our governing bodies to give you an idea just off the top of my head in spain where i live even though im american and yes i had to go through a rather onerous process to get residency even though im married to a spaniard there are around million people and there are members of their bicameral parliament the lower house has giving an approximate representation of approximately one parliamentarian per people the us has around million people or times the population of spain and only members of parliament with in the lower more important house that gives each representative jurisdictiction over around thousand people compared to for each in spain the senate representation is even worse especially with texas my home state and california but due to its structure cant really be compared if you look at other republics in the western world none of them have the type of underrepresentation in national parliaments like the us there is a big difference between saying write your congressman when that congressman represents people and people like some of the txca ones that was my point that applying pressure to them has become something of a lost cause they havent increased the number of representatives in the us house since barring the temporary increase by two when ak and hi where introduced in the population was around million each representative represents almost two and a half times as many people as they did years ago thats why they dont care they cant listen to the complaints of their constituencies no one could if they had the better part of a million people to represent the noise is just too diffuse at that point so they tend to listen to the ones that are most likely to pay to reelect them instead

hearthstone,removed,comparing hearthstone to money gambling when they are not really comparable before or after adding gambling to it because selling pack of virtual cards for is scammy at best not anywhere near the cost to produce promising a chance of higher rewards makes it gambling when you gamble there is chance for monetary compensation like selling hs account with golden legendaries on the gray market just because it involves risk does not mean its comparable to poker what about the buyin part still not comparable i mean poker doesnt have formats this shady zero players with wins is a possible outcome you are right about this not being comparable
hearthstone,removed,i have tyrande code trade for steam gamesskins pm scammer httpswwwredditcomusercyanist
hearthstone,removed,this is more of a for a ride on the roller coaster and less of gambling its a for a chance to be kicked from the ride after seconds being receiving a month subscription for free rides that you can sell same as hundreds of hs accounts that are being sold stop telling them to tear down the ride because you find it dangerous not everyone like to rides on blizzards dick and this isnt just about preferences when blizzard starts riding kids on it and exploiting their gambling tendencies you cant just come up and say but i like those rides let the kids have fun too down with the haters

hearthstone,removed,i disagree with your formula for calculating mage win rates heres how i would do it first lets define some terms let and be the percentage of mages at and respectively like op let and be the number of mages at and respectively the difference between this and the above becomes very important let and be the total number of total classes at and let w be the win percentage of mage vs nonmage classes at also like op lets first establish an overall win rate formula for mages at intuitively this is the odds of a mage beating another mage multiplied by the odds of finding a mage opponent plus the odds of a mage beating another class multiplied by the odds of that matchup occurring i get something similar to your original formula mage win rate w now that we have a win rate it follows that however there is something important to note here and are not percentages given that your data is best represented as percentages turning them into percentages is our next goal heres what we know this is a bit of an assumption but a seemingly okay one given that half of players at win and the other half lose going back to our first formula lets start working with percentages by dividing both sides by there now were working with percentages lets stop here for a bit to do a bit of sanity checking if then if then if and w then if and w then if and w then everything looks good since were trying to solve for w lets go ahead and isolate that w i dont have your isolated and mage percentages so i cant calculate w but i believe this formula is more accurate

the bottom up top down how do you balance while maintain flavor if possible are we going to see other kinds of grouping in the future a balance is important we wanted to encompass these three families druids are part of jade lotus the triclass cards were perfect to join these classes under a family we wanted you to feel you are playing as part of the jade lotus q have you landed on a direction for priest direction a we have focused on what kinds of archetypes to make with priests what cards are fun to play what cards make it not fun to play against priest focus on archetypes dragon deck no duplicate deck and tricky priest with tons of spells are being explored and focused on improving q are adventures reaching a point in the wild format where it is or will be impossible to balance heroic bosses a with levels of difficulty we can make it very hard and it is okay that it took you times to beat it on heroic we do the best we can and except that people with wide collections may be able to beat it sooner q with arena is anything done about the inflated powerappeared since they are appearing more frequent a with new sets the cards appear nearly double previous cards with karazhan now being dropped to normal status we felt players had played enough with that set with new tools we can balance in different exciting ways in the future q why and how did midrange shaman become so powerful a we designed new cards and looked at power levels shaman was down herelow we design far in advance we dont know were there power will be in months we knew people wanted shaman cards time passes and it doesnt rise so we add new cards working far in advance you are now seeing spikes from this process it has become popular even though it is running around mean streets of gadgetzan may change this ask me again in months q variance is key in trading card games with mean streets of gadgetzan is that actively being designed away from variance in cards themself a variance is critical we want each game to feel different we want players to feel they have a chance part of being a good player is the ability to play around randomness we want each set to feel different so this expansion is specifically moving away from that to set it apart discover is a key mechanic to allow the use of skill to allow what card the player wants with cards in the set we have only seen a handful of them you may be surprised what is still out there q how does the art team cooperate with the design team which comes first a it is a lot of collaboration sometimes concepts come first three families lead to whose their boss q are you going to add a system for tournaments that shows when you log in one is starting soon a tournament mode has different aspects i want to get together with friends and run one i want to join a random player and spend all day seeing how high i can climb i want my wins and loses to really matter high intensity we are exploring different avenues and fantasies we want to continue communicating with the public to find out what they want q heroic brawl when is it coming out after all the work i cant believe you would throw it out what is it leading to a one of the great things with brawls is we can get it out there and see how the community reacts how it really feels once it is in the hands of the players we havent announced when it will launch we are very excited to release it soon feedback will help inform us what we will do with it next q are there plans for new future achievements and if so what are you guys thinking of as ideas for that platinum hero a one option is on the stage to our right is the world championship what can we do for our most invested players how can we create additional things for you to achieve and accomplish but realistic if you are on that top level competing in those heroic brawls or trying to get into the world championship are excellent goals for now yes itplatinum is something we have talked about but no best idea has been figured out yet we do want to celebrate those level of players q how do you deal with when there is a lot of negative community feedback that isnt really accurate or isnt really representative of what you guys actually do and what is the general strategy for dealing with the community a alot of that community feedback comes from a place of passion people dont talk about hearthstone because they dont care about it they talk about it because they love it they play lots of games and feel really good about it we get lots of great feedback it helps us prioritize what we want to work on if our community cares about a certain thing those are the things we want to focus on q are there any plans to bring back the autofill tool a tavern brawls is one of the places we let you explore that there are easier tools to help you build sudo random decks we have no plans to bring back the worst deck builder tool we feel it is important that new players have the deck templates and assistant to help construct their deck it will help them more and build them a reasonable deck that they can play games and enjoy q is it in the works to allow more tools ways to export your decks to use party sites to help a we are working on ways to easily export your decks and send them to your friends q going into the next year are you guys planning to go into doing more tournaments yourself officially a diversity of tournaments is important to hearthstone we plan to continue to support party tournaments our tournaments are to expose and support more diversity q are you into the tempo based state of hearthstone with little ways to come back games and are you willing to add more tempo swing cards or efficient aoe to have a more dynamic game a efficient aoe are important to swing games they are a lot of fun we have showcased already some new aoe coming with the new expansion tempo swings are important and hopefully we will do more of that in the future q do you think the amount of power the class cards forms the way players think about the different power levels and classes for example do you think they expect that every class will have its own top tier deck do they bring over this feeling that everything will be balanced anything you would change to change that perspective a having that ebbs and flows of what deck is strong is really important we are seeing a lot of that right now paladins are one of the weaker classes their is or people perceive that it is weaker classes last year paladin was one of the most complained about classes so you get some kind of ebb and flow it is also important to have multiple classes close together so long as different classes have their time to shine more importantly that different play styles have their time to shine

hearthstone,removed,one of the most retarded posts ive seen on this subreddit
hearthstone,removed,that wont happen if all those packs were new due to pity timers on both epics and legendaries unless you provide proof i think your memory must have failed you
hearthstone,removed,were they all gadgetzan packs there is a thing called pity timer for each kind of packs you are guaranteed a legendary per packs incase you get too unlucky are you sure you havent opened a single legendary
hearthstone,removed,thats not possible no need to lie to us the legendary pity timer is and the epic pity timer is either or lol what you thought making up a story on the internet would get you some upvotes
hearthstone,removed,why did you come here posting this garbage no one is going to give you karma for lies nice try buddy
hearthstone,removed,ridicolous sounds like a spell in harry potter
hearthstone,removed,no this was like my last few months of time to time playing hs and getting packs you shouldnt comment on every post just to shttalk ty for being an important part of reddit
hearthstone,removed,this dude is lying
hearthstone,removed,not possible you have guaranteed epic every packs are you sure it wasnt packs or haha
hearthstone,removed,if i open like different each time can it happen
hearthstone,removed,i have been trying it so far doesnt seem to be super competitive i want to enable some cool aggro and the secret synergy cards but i find i am not as fast as the very aggro decks but not powerful enough for the really strong late game of golem or reno decks i dont see myself getting past rank with it but for kicks and giggles i will continue to play it in casual or when im not trying to make rank if somebody can lay down the list that pwns face id be happy to see it

hearthstone,removed,surely you dont need to do anything if youre planning on being an ignorant being oh are you telling me that his win condition is making him win and thats bs how about you counter it instead of crying about how your deck doesnt have a winrate into every deck and thats somehow unfair to you
hearthstone,removed,why not be honest and put reynad is a slightly mongoloid looking professional hearthstone player arrogant and depressing his head is larger than your normal persons indicating down syndrome known for crying on stream more often than breathing
hearthstone,removed,well isis sure didnt like the french priest
hearthstone,removed,you should probably do that then
hearthstone,removed,both of you are apparently too stupid to get the point of this raging shitpost i dont mind being a scrub i dont consider myself a good player and i dont mind losing to better players if you can outwit me congrats you are a better player you deserve a win yogg is not part of that philosophy yogg is retarded much like you two

hearthstone,removed,you say this im just trying to help you out a little and then complain that im being condescending thats real cute patron had close to winrate and midrange shaman is about on ladder yeah sure patron warrior had a overall winrate on the ladder want to make up some other statistics while your at it
hearthstone,removed,thank you very much
hearthstone,removed,fucking whiner cant even defeat the worst class by a mile in the game
hearthstone,removed,are you retarded
hearthstone,removed,youre simply incorrect dont know what to tell you
hearthstone,removed,top tier midrange druid decks absolutely ran sludge belcher in the drops they ran during gvg all these experts telling me im wrong when they have no idea what theyre talking about is hilarious
hearthstone,removed,ill start of by saying no the deck isnt good but hey lets talk about how to improve it so youve got a couple of options you can stick to the cthun theme and go for a cthun control warrior deck for which the a list would look you could go for a budget warrior deck focused more on tempo if youve not got too many cards in which case personally id recommend the choice as its often worse to compromise on control decks as they rely so much on certain cards to make sure they stay ahead or can come back if youve got any questions about that or if you want to make a cthun warrior deck without some of the cards on that list and want advice feel free to message me on reddit

hearthstone,removed,how retarded do you have to be to not see the problem with this card in a competitive setting the level of mental gymnastics youre doing to not admit yogg should be banned is mind numbing
hearthstone,removed,that is such a dumb reply in so many levels
hearthstone,removed,if you like that watch ulduar by jack its half an hour of epicness but if thats too long skip to the yogg saron fight i warned you
hearthstone,removed,nobody cares commit suicide
hearthstone,removed,yeah i couldnt believe what i was reading that card is op af and literally zoos wet dream aggro decks would simply become more minion based to run such a stupid card in the early old gods meta there was a thread about savjz playing yogg and load hunter one of the top comments said if hunter becomes relevant in the meta it will be with this deck i responded with no midrange hunter will be better this is a gimmick deck carried by a good player yeah i dont take this sub seriously because of shit like this
hearthstone,removed,i was able to redeem the packs without issue but i can see asking blizzard support being the safer bet better safe than sorry im curious though what would you ask them exactly its clear from the support article i posted that blizzard does allow codes to be redeemed the codes i redeemed were long string of numbers to be exact i guess you could verify what a legit code might look like
hearthstone,removed,thats like saying if cheating is such a problem in poker then why dont the players just agree not to cheat you are actually retarded
hearthstone,removed,people who use yogg in tournaments should be publicly humiliated
hearthstone,removed,they have finished making all the cards even look at blizzard comments you fuckwit

hearthstone,removed,northshire is a turn card you combine it with a taunt to draw or especially around mid game with holy nova to draw a quick and swing the board your early game has high health and you have shields so your guys can take a beating and stay alive for a heal brann can either be used as an early tempo play especially with shield to draw out spellbased removal or combod midlate game with historians corruptors your drakes or even just your taunts holy novas can either fire on to clear out totems and other small stuff though if youre losing the board badly on youve probably lost anyway or can be used in conjunction with your highhealth minions to attack into the enemy board then nova to mop up and heal all your guys at once you can use your taunts and overstatted minions to rush face hunter they dont have good tools to deal with mana and mana taunts make sure you keep a taunt up and ready for their call of the wild save entombs for highmanes you can often beat them by turn use your netherspites to get taunts and early game also race dragon warriors your entombs are for their ysera grommash and any other highvalue targets you see when you have mana to spare deaths when you dont yogg druid is tough because yogg is bullshit youll often fight to keep their board clear keep removal for yogg entomb the giants and as youre nearing victory turn hell pop a yogg summon some minions clear your board draw about cards and then you lose if you can win a race you can win but if they pull enough ramp you just lose yogg druids thinned out past rank though cthun warrior and control warriors are a game of chicken dont use your shields dont use your azure drakes and keep entombs for the inevitable fatigue fight count their removal and play around it try to bait a lowvalue brawl on against your and drops you can fight to outvalue and outcontrol warrior decks and win tempo mage is a fight you can win if you save your targeted removal for flamewakers and trade minions into mana worms theyll have to burn spells to contest the board and then its a fight between your highvalue minions and their ability to refill with draw and tomes you can win against antonidas by applying enough pressure that they have to use him early if they get a rhonin into an antonidas youve lost but thats less common aggro shaman is the most common deck youll face they can contest your early game but will use a lot of cards to do it save your removal corruptors pain book wyrms for mana tides and to a lesser extent flametongues dont mulligan deaths as youll need them on the key here is to use your high value minions to grab and hold the board eventually winning like a midrange deck against an aggro deck generally theyll burn rockbiters early against your and then not be able to efficiently clear your taunts and run out of cards by turn you should be winning around turn northshire cleric power word shield twilight whelp netherspite historian shadow word pain wyrmrest agent blackwing technician brann bronzebeard shadow word death twilight drake twilight guardian azure drake blackwing corruptor holy nova book wyrm entomb ysera

hearthstone,removed,dragon priest is tier happy no drag priest is just as brainless as all the aggro decks the goal is to play overstatted minions on curve good players who enjoyed priest before hate the new dragon priest
hearthstone,removed,well now its done four less damage than it usually would have done if theyre really dumb enough to go face instead of trade with it plus the damage it took to get killed you pretty much healed for six leaving a your next minion can eat up this makes no sense whatsoever i think you might be retarded look at it turn by turn all youre doing is trading one card for one card for the same mana cost and taking damage in the process
hearthstone,removed,dont really care either way so bring them on
hearthstone,removed,because it has a curve shit did i say that no alright then have fun with your imaginary arguments against things no one has said its clear thats the only way you can feel like you won you tried to prove me wrong by citing a tier two deck youre practically proving my point for me
hearthstone,removed,you said its mindlessly slapping dragons down which is true i never said everything with a curve is bad which is what you pretended i said really you just come across as someone just trying to pick a fight i hope you dont consider this a fight id take no pleasure in fighting someone clearly disabled im trying to educate you and hoping you somehow grow up and learn to admit youre wrong
hearthstone,removed,nah man we already established youre one of those im that other one i think you might have downs
hearthstone,removed,you said reno is stopping aggro decks literally in your goddamn title except thats not what i said i understand that youre clearly undereducated and language is not your strong point but my point is that only renobased control decks can only hope to exist if reno didnt exist no control decks no control decks aggro go on i await your apology for clearly misreading also i noticed how you completely ignored a mountain of evidence that proves you wrong theres no reason to have this discussion if kazakus were as powerful as youre claiming reno lock wouldnt be tier and the top tier wouldnt be literally all pirate decks keep ignoring evidence though still waiting for you to address that

hearthstone,removed,you dont use strategies in this game you use the best cards and often allow rng to decide which wins if you want to strategize play the elder scrolls legends the rng is minimal in that game although it can still give quite the wtf moment with the wrong prophecy on the wrong rune draw at the wrong time when you were literally about to win with the flick of the wrist half a second later it only feels impacting because it doesnt happen often once you learn to tada strategize around it which you cannot do around hearthstones rng its built into its genetic code so no matter how hard you play to win a downie could beat you with the right kind of luck and the right kind of card at the right kind of time with the right kind of love oooo oooo

hearthstone,removed,ok for crying out loud people i just posted a sound fucking question if blizz cuts combo druid because they say its noninteractive and not fun to play against why dont they ban other decks that work in a similar manner the answer is either because theyre inconsistent to their own policy or the reason they gave for cutting the classic combo druid was bs simple as that classic combo druid wasnt that noninteractive and broken as well wasnt the best as well but it got cut now you give me the same reasons for other decks that didnt get nerfed and i stuck to the fucking point throughout my whole post saying how it is inconsistent to state one thing and not stick to it i did not insult anyone i even said that i understand many mistakes made by blizz because shit happens and im not qqing either about that or other problems they have all i did is post a logically sound question and you are going out of your way to lynch me because i was aggressive by what not saying i love them with all my heart every other sentence fuck you people are lost in your own selfrighteousness

hearthstone,removed,both of the times i spent money on the game dollars on the welcome pack and a couple bucks when i had extra free amazon coins to spend on like i ended up with no legendaries either time from the actual packs i spent all my gold on packs after buying the welcome bundle and convinced that my pity timer was close to being up and gold later i got an edwin vancleef a few days after the purchased packs when the tavern brawl opened up i opened that pack and opened myself up a harrison jones before the welcome bundle i was completely and had a nat pagle and a fandral staghelm id suggest just overall open more packs eventually youll hit that pity timer but without anything else a new player is expected to open a total of maybe packs in their first entire month of gameplay counting tavern brawls and theres only a chance of a legendary so either youre of a pity timer or on pure chance

hearthstone,removed,if you are reading this then you are wasting precious time reading the comments you will probably comment or like this but you will waste more time you are now thinking what i am on about probably thinking that i am on something however you are just wasting more time reading my comment i have just wasted precious moments of your life that you could have spent sleeping or smoking weed if you just realised i have wasted more time explaining that i have wasted time for this reason you might as well like this comment as you might as well waste more time thank you for your wasted time •• ••⌐■■ ⌐■■
hearthstone,removed,lets go back op has full board opponent plays devolve then thalnos you can see both on the action bar in this sequence then he uses his jinyuu waterspeaker or whatever the name of the card is to attack the divine shield taunt the actions do not get recorded on the bar until they fully resolve therefore attack is not shown there yet but divine shield vanished then ability of activates it dealt damage so it heals for but because of auchenai its counted as dealing damage therfore it heals again etc the action of attack will only get recorded after anduin explodes and game ends this is why you dont see it
hearthstone,removed,i sexually identify as a guac boy ever since i played secret paladin i dreamed of taking it inside me people say to me that a person being a guac boy is impossible and im fucking retarded but i dont care i look just like sylvanas im having a plastic surgeon install a bald cap underwear on the outside of my pants and a tampon bow and arrow on my body from now on i want you guys to call me uther and respect my right to take it all and take it way up inside if you cant accept me youre a guac stealing shitlord and need to check your guac privilege thank you for being so understanding
hearthstone,removed,pot of greed allows me to draw two cards
hearthstone,removed,percentage doesnt work like that you tool dont show me that reddit post go read basic probabilities and understand that nothing passes since that represents that the sum of all possible outcomes i mean jesus crist
hearthstone,removed,oh great hes playing fuckface murloc paladin what an asshole
hearthstone,removed,meth shit has had me rolling for three days im hard as a baboon and in heat like a zebra son stay hard ❤️ love you
hearthstone,removed,maybe its a concern then take your head out your fanboy ass
hearthstone,removed,wow haha hilarious post 👌😂😂 man i cant wait to see what disguised toast does next haha how does he come up with this stuff 😂 concede right away haha golden 😂😂😂

hearthstone,removed,why are the cards all in mexican and shit you speak english
hearthstone,removed,whatever man here in america we call it mexican thats what matters plus i cant even do that dumb squiggle thing on my american keyboard so if you dont like it you can just geeeet out
hearthstone,removed,fake and gay
hearthstone,removed,this guy pretty retarded you counter aggro bu literally playing minions on the board and not giving up turn and sometimes in fact reno decks only have to win rate against aggro but look at mid range shaman win rate against pirate warrior and aggro shaman but guess what mid range loses to reno decks cuz they cant win by turn
hearthstone,removed,that only example if you want to nip pick there is dragon priest a mid range deck has win rate against aggro shaman but loses win against agains reno lock but it is obvious you dont want to listen your just some scrub stuck at rank every season and have no idea how to play
hearthstone,removed,my orignal post was a reply to nvgov comment saying aggro will be worse when reno is taken out which completely makes sense cuz aggro beats most of the popular reno decks where as aggro loses to more midrange decks sprouting stupid comments like what nvgov said is literally cancer and shows how ignorant he is to the game the sad thing is it spreads more igorance and makes people think it is a real thing
hearthstone,removed,i have three words for your friend tits or gtfo
hearthstone,removed,youre just making it hard to defend that pirate warrior isnt for retards
hearthstone,removed,why would anyone like reynad
hearthstone,removed,i hate this clips and they get uploaded in the first because those sheeps just want that karma nobody cares about
hearthstone,removed,no its the reason i come to this sub its better than all the constant whining post about the meta by players that stopped this bs rng game right after wotog and started playing shadowverse because its so much better am i right stop coming to the sub then fucking weebs
hearthstone,removed,god damn you are retarded
hearthstone,removed,i just explained how that helps him but your bird brain cant compute it not surprising coming from the guy who cant detect obvious sarcasm
hearthstone,removed,utoxicadamm is a regular noob here too you two are part of a club of like people not more people who like this game enough to actively participate in new yet are still actually completely clueless about the game
hearthstone,removed,he is gay so landing a girl is very uncommon for him
hearthstone,removed,u dont need any of them deathwing is way too slow malygos is being used only in combo decks if u wanna make a dragon priest dont worry about much late game afaik the deck tops at drakonid op and some decks run ysera
hearthstone,removed,see definition httpswwwmerriamwebstercomdictionaryliterally
hearthstone,removed,ive been playing since beta asshat i have over wins this wouldnt apply to me at all eat a bag of cocks
hearthstone,removed,total wins and its the same as it is now possible per day before you troll reddit try to comprehend what you are trolling
hearthstone,removed,hes a fan favorite and one of the few cards you can play that brings legit joy that being said hes way too slow for this hyperaggressive meta and unfortunately blizzard wants every meta to be a hyperaggressive meta so mobile players can play a game in minutes
hearthstone,removed,what if i just want the pack and not the stupid card back
hearthstone,removed,
hearthstone,removed,how about you learn to go fuck yourself eh
hearthstone,removed,learn to stop being a dick and admit when youre wrong
hearthstone,removed,wtf what about the news players who dont give a shit about card backs i only use the classic card back fuck you blizzard and your card back rewards
hearthstone,removed,so what would you do with the extra second you save by not just dragging it
hearthstone,removed,i have used no foul words against this particular person you can read this in any of the comments i have posted this person is a hot head and is a toxic user
hearthstone,removed,it was never a trash card you fags just like to cry about everything
hearthstone,removed,im definitely getting downvotes for this but who cares
hearthstone,removed,yet they gave a broken early weapon to the best early class makes sense
hearthstone,removed,the hole where i point out its not a simple interaction because thats the only point i made the brawl was delayed four weeks blizzard said there was a technical difficulty my point could not be more evident the fact that you seem to think his ability to code a very simple bot means he couldnt possibly be wrong about this is evidence you might have downs
hearthstone,removed,how is this not flagged a low effort content
hearthstone,removed,please if a bum said you were too clean would you get upset its only insulting if you aspire to be a basement dwelling troll
hearthstone,removed,thing is the person wasnt complaining op added him and asked why he concededaka a free win and he explained why they just dont like long games and decided to skip this one for the sake of his own enjoyment of a video game i dont see anything wrong here
hearthstone,removed,op you sound like a dick and thats coming from a control player who avoids braindead decks if you are roping him every turn which you probably were then its understandable that he doesnt want to play again but then you had to go friend him and insult him to somehow stroke your own ego heh then you come in here with this obnoxious post saying im at a loss for words
hearthstone,removed,so is gallywix his name and his title is trade prince
hearthstone,removed,you kinda sound like an ass
hearthstone,removed,its the condescension that makes you seem like a dick i hope i didnt hurt anyones feelings when i called vomiting out stuff on curve braindead cause it requires thought do these people only enjoy shooters if their enemy stands still i feel very sorry for you that you can only enjoy autopilot decks they hate on anyone taking longer than seconds to vomit their hand out the problem isnt the post its the fact that youve been acting like an asshat also you cant let shit go the other player had no problem conceding and moving on take a page out of their book
hearthstone,removed,that was awesome i kept saying remove the armor remove the armor and deep inside me i knew you werent going to do it lmao that was awesome

hearthstone,removed,extreme circumstance is saluting the nazis didnt you get the memo it read these moderators sit about all day giving each other the double dutch and if you aint in their centipede screw you
hearthstone,removed,fucking hearth stone is a shit ass gamecomments like these are the reason i fucking hate reddit and jews
hearthstone,removed,a broken rule that is bent twisted and distorted on the whims of bias and double standards promoting ignorance go and change the subs rules so we can all post selfies as well because that dumb mod posted his pic and was like suck it the moderators are clearly far to stupid too moderated fairly it is a case of suck our dick and if you suck it really good you can do what you want if you dont suck dick dont even bother promoting intolerance just like that name tag suggests band camp
hearthstone,removed,i am serious that guy blows there is no excuse of this was moderated and why anybody anywhere has to suffer associating those images with their game play talk properly that must be really hard but just try and i am absolutely serious there is abundant corruption if a nursery of idiots also know as reddits hearthstone moderators groups together and starts shitting on everybody else and everybody else has got to accept the fact that this forum is a shitstorm of intolerance promoted by moderators throwing their feces that is the message read above the rules dont not apply to everybody
hearthstone,removed,that is funny coming from a recolon oops a typo dank must be the catchphrase for your noodles seriously dank is looking at that idiot if i am playing this game that idiot must be circlejerking the mods proving bias far too many up votes then comments so hat happen when authority removed and then then he cried about it that guy exploits this game and now he has special privileges so kids what does that make this game when the rules are broken and bent

hearthstone,removed,is this actually true
hearthstone,removed,hey guys whats up its reynad back and this time i want to make a quick video on a thought i had yesterday while streaming the new karazhan expansion for a while just kind of something that i think would improve hearthstone beyond the usual stuff i bring up like less early game board control randomness things outside of card design and like rarities and all that i think it actually like to make things a little bit more fun for everybody to play going forward yeah its a little bit of an element that i kind of forgot not really forget but just kinda was wasnt my mind that that magic had and didnt and that element is basically complexity of execution so what i mean by that is i was playing this deck yesterday this one right here pretty much the deck i was talking about in my set review and in even before that in the value town episode this is like one of the decks most looking forward to trying once the new karazhan wing came out and you know has arcane giants and its super fun to play anyway i was dreaming this for a few hours and i noticed the deck was like really difficult to play and i kind of asked myself the question why that is because most decks in hearthstone are actually extremely easy to play its actually one of the reasons i think the game does really well and is popular is you know you dont get punished for misplays too much whereas this deck i constantly would and i kind of thought about it more and more and i realized that theres kind of like two ways of thinking about games of hearthstone and the two ways of thinking or basically like macro and micro decisions so a macro decision is is like i guess ill start with micro micro is just like trading correctly plays theyre just objectively correct like sequencing your stuff in the right order like playing acolyte of pain before playing whirlwinds you draw a card simple stuff like that but also like you know trading a into a rather than your into a just like objectively making the optimal sequencing the optimal trades just like doing stuff correctly most of the the micro you do in a game hearthstone is is just like its kind of autopilot right its very easy like most of the trades after youve played for a couple months become kind of automatic youre just kind of playing most expensive thing in your hand most the sequencing is not difficult right like you play violet teacher before you play your spell its not hard to mess that stuff up i kind of started to think about games like magic and stuff that i played where im sequencing your cards correctly and turn in a turn was actually super complex some decks sure it would be very autopilot and just play the most expensive thing in your hand thats like ramp in magic super easy in that regard but the actual like micro and executing your turn once youve decided what you want to do is super intricate and if you ever messed up if you got punished for it and conversely if your opponent messed up you get rewarded right the better player won more often because theyre more cards designed that way the macro is more of like things that like control warrior or nzoth paladin and like these slow decks they do they do a lot more macro decisions so that involves like kind of essentially this deck up that involves kind of like not playing stuff intentionally even if you can you know like when you can get a decent wild pyromancer plus equality to clear the board but you choose to hold off to get a little bit more value take some damage in the meantime like for example with elise like you wont just run out every card in your hand like loot hoarders and acolytes youll hold off on them because you know that in ten turns in this control mirror your your acolyte of pain is going to turn into like a legendary thanks to elise so you know things like being really conservative with your shield slams and executes like you can play them out and its technically killing something its technically giving you like a man efficient turn but sometimes you make counterintuitive plays because in the long game the big picture pays off and thats what i think is macro thinking right so micros like the correct trades playing stuff in the right order on the macro is like you know should i like do my stuff this turn should i wait a turn even just something like what four drop do i please turn is macro thinking right both plays are technically mana efficient both plays can be good but which plays better like five turns down the line thats another macro decision like when you have the option between drops and things like that so the reason this deck so complicated is because it actually involved like both types of thinking like the micro is incredibly difficult and again thats something that is absent from like almost every deck in hearthstone when im playing a turn of this deck its so easy to miss sequence like one card and like kill off your pyromancer draw one less card or not get like a free off of blood to ichor it was just like all these intricate turns were like if i miss sequence anything will be like one mana off of doing what i want to do and really getting punished for it and then on top of that youre balancing that with all this macro thinking which is more of like should i go off with arcane giants this turn and just like copy one or should i wait a couple turns and try to otk with charge theres all these like decisions that really hard coming at me from both angles and kind of realize thats why the deck was difficult to play and i loved it that thats like so fun for me to play this deck because it is so difficult and i was incorporating both types of thinking and it felt really rewarding to win games like that and it didnt feel it actually felt better to lose games that way to me making mistakes rather than me losing games to portal jugglers or over the fucking like whatever like the normal way of losing in hearthstone right play the most expensive thing in my hand somebody rolls higher i lose thats stuffs frustrating its out of your control this felt very rewarding even though my win percentage wasnt like through the roof and i was like hovering around it was just like satisfying to win the games i won and i felt like i still learned in the games that are lost and i wasnt upset because in my control to play better

hearthstone,removed,didnt even watch it but i get sick of the silliness and appeasement of casualness in this subreddit which is why i downvoted it and think it has no place here
hearthstone,removed,fuccboi pussy
hearthstone,removed,okay so query why dont you see warrior running sunwalker all the time sunwalker is mana healing for around not most classes will have a way to deal damage to pop a little divine shield this car dis mana and heals more usually almost all decks right now would have to hit this twice very few attack minions are ever used so lets just stop with that retarded comparison i already picked one of the ebst comparisons why move away from it for a weaker comparison fucking bubble divine shield with less hp and more attack for more mana hardly similar outside of being a taunt option rom smaller minions it might eat attacks as well and give you armor but it likely wont kill many or any of them leaving your opponent with a board and you without one exactly thats not even a good scenario and it becomes fucking concecration gain life i dont think its a bad board clear card i dont see it that way i see it as a good fucking taunt card thats it nobody looks at fucking tazdingo and says its a bad aoe oh look at me im being smart and itll eat only minoins and die must suck also you seem to be forgetting another important fucking thing this card is mana warrior has no mana card it fucking plays brawl or off curve almost all the time up until ironforge portal which used all the fucking time by the way in legend decks because its a fucking drop in warrior httpimgurcomaqazwj want a good comparison sludge fucking belcher bitch what was that more attack only in its first form less attack after aoe resistant because of deathrattle oh you mean like aoe resistant lieka health minion which no aoe reaches another reason why sludge belcher was used reliable taunt at mana something many decks lacked this card is not competing with shieldbearer holy fuck you know what just stop talking to me im done with you you arent even giving direct counter arguments youre just shifting the narrative because my points are solid as fuck its like a consistent ironforge with different synergies that iron forge iron forge portal has shield slam this card has taunt buffs and consistency now shut the fuck up you wanna know what the funniest part is this fucking retarded double standard you have in the same post nice contradiction fucker that isnt why ironforge portal is run and you seem to think it is go look up some of the top tier meta warrior decks look up the ones from blizzcon and tell me what card youd cut for this and if you think its ironforge portal you just fundamentally misunderstand how these decks are being built ahahaha okay so its not used but it is in top tier decks hmmmmsorry i was talking about using this comptetitively in top tier decks not whatever shit decks youre using seriously no matter what you say im legit not gonna read it so do not bother replying ill just ignore it

hearthstone,removed,you are a piece of shit how could you even think that fucking asshole jesus christ you are a fucking moron really an actual dumb human being lol just meming xd
hearthstone,removed,i saw amnesiac at a grocery store in anaheim yesterday i told him how cool it was to meet him in person but i didnt want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything he said oh like youre doing now i was taken aback and all i could say was huh but he kept cutting me off and going huh huh huh and closing his hand shut in front of my face i walked away and continued with my shopping and i heard him chuckle as i walked off when i came to pay for my stuff up front i saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen milky ways in his hands without paying the girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional and was like sir you need to pay for those first at first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter when she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually to prevent any electrical infetterence and then turned around and winked at me i dont even think thats a word after she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly
hearthstone,removed,i met amnesiac at a restaurant once wed accidentally been given his table apparently he was fond of the restaurant and had a specific table he liked and the management had messed up and gotten their days wrong it was tuesday and they thought he was coming on thursday or something like that anyway the manager completely embarrassed this is a pretty nice restaurant comes by and says im so sorry but wed like to move you to another table if you could be troubled and well gladly compensate you for the cost of the meal and any other meal youd like while youre in town my sister and cousin were both like yeah thats cool and i kind of played the asshole a bit im sorry i just dont understand weve been here for minutes weve just ordered cant we finish our meal here then out of nowhere amnesiac shows up next to the manager and says paul these guys can finish ill be at the bar i got some time and i being a big amnesiac fan said oh wow uh i had no idea please feel free to give him the table amnesiac was grateful shook my hand and said thanks then gave me a card with his number on it and told me to give him a call later after working up the nerve i gave him a call that night and to make a long story short we had a glorious month love affair man on man that i shall never forget our bodies intertwined as one and from the beauty of morocco to the french riviera to the snorkeling in the galopagos amnesiac and i made glorious gay love to each other on six of the seven continents
hearthstone,removed,dude you are so disrespectful actually ill have you know i personally know people who died this way they killed themselves over being chat comments telling them they owed people card packs in a digital childrens card game i sincerely do not know how thijs will recover from this i suggest that we the great and noble white knights of reddit organize a crowdfund to buy thijs a nice jacuzzi or ferrari in which he can sit and cry whenever he feels like killing himself because of card packs
hearthstone,removed,young garbage
hearthstone,removed,heh just last week someone broke into my car and stole values for euro i have an autoimmune disease my ex girlfriend was a cunt i havent spoken with my mum for years my brother is a drug addict i think ive been in the real world for quite some time thank you very fucking much now how about actually discussing the issue at hand instead of acting like a snappy cunt can you do that or is it to much to ask on the internet
hearthstone,removed,i only got one epic thijswherearemypacks
hearthstone,removed,awwww did somebody in twitch chat hurt your feelings or rather not your feelings but the feelings of someone who knowingly streams in front of thousands of the most immature and toxic viewers on any media around today im sorry you have to deal with this and im sure thijs really appreciates that you made this reddit post for him
hearthstone,removed,the kicker is he was playing midrange shaman and got rekt by my maly rogue
hearthstone,removed,was wondering how you top deck the card that you need the most to win the game every game
hearthstone,removed,hey there this reveal is a duplicate and has thus been removed have a question or think your post doesnt break the rules

hearthstone,removed,pipehype verdammt pipehype gut pipehype glaubt pipehype ein pipehype kuro pipehype fangay sein pipehype
hearthstone,removed,alright let me dumb this down for you okay you see his stream at live people in it thats right little one there were people watching his hearthstone matches at the same time as he was broadcasting them now heres where the simpler mind may get confused if he prerecorded his stream then he couldnt have talked to all those happy little viewers he had unless you are saying he prerecorded his games only to which the answer to that stupid thought is in the comment above understand lets give you a little more help little jimmy wanted to buy an apple but he wasnt allowed to go to the store he decided to disguise himself as his dad so nobody would know it was him when he got to the store the cashier asked cash or credit here jimmys plan fell apart because he could not imitate his dads voice because his dad wasnt there get it now probably not so lets make it even simpler people from the past cant talk to people in the present lets make it easier to understand past ≠ present
hearthstone,removed,true story time the other night at eastern time i was playing arena after work shift i was rolling along and having fun rare so i go to start game and notice my opponents name is kripp now i know the name is used a lot due to the popularity of the original but i decided to open the real kripps stream just to check it out sure enough theres me and my turn play on live stream being the decent human i am i averted my eyes to his hand and tabbed back to the game now far more nervous that i had been i played the game fairly while listening to kripp analyze my moves im sure you all and kripp too will accuse me of sniping but honestly im not ashamed i wanted to hear his thoughts on my plays he was pretty positive about my performance and even chalked his win up to a lucky brannhealbot play followed by a cabalists tome i was all jittery and shut but i got a screen cap for my own amusement anyway my point was that kripp never accused me of sniping he even said aloud once that the chat was wrong about it even though by competitive standards i was by my own morality i didnt feel like a cheater more like i was getting free professional analysis
hearthstone,removed,youre wrong why dont you try it out instead of make retarded assumptions
hearthstone,removed,i was all gigidy thinking elled elled didnt foresaw the volcanic drake though

hearthstone,removed,you cant even spell or form sentences properly so i wont berate you about searching the subreddit because that is obviously beyond your capacity as a human if you can even be classified as that
hearthstone,removed,so fucking pathetic that you had to copy that from the forums isnt it i mean thats just fucking pathetic on a grand scale whats the matter little child couldnt come up with something original so you ran to the forums to copy that lmao thats the lowest form of being pathetic you know that right thats worse than webdecking
hearthstone,removed,guess that is karma for you bming people with face hunter on ladder

hearthstone,removed,is this a limerick about orc penis
hearthstone,removed,yes this is a new account because i dont want to risk being downvoted in my original account but i have to link what i have to link by the way im not connected to the makers of that game and by placing this link it may risk them being sued by blizzard
hearthstone,removed,a grilled cheese consists of only these following items cheese bread with spread usually butter this entire subreddit consist of melts almost every grilled cheese sandwich i see on here has other items added to it the fact that this subreddit is called grilledcheese is nothing short of utter blasphemy let me start out by saying i have nothing against melts i just hate their association with sandwiches that are not grilled cheeses adding cheese to your tuna sandwich its called a tuna melt totally different want to add bacon and some pretentious bread crumbs with spinach i dont know what the hell youd call that but its not a grilled cheese i would be more than willing to wager ive eaten more grilled cheeses in my years than any of you had in your entire lives i have one almost everyday and sometimes more than just one sandwich want to personalize your grilled cheese use a mix of different cheeses or use sourdough or french bread but if you want to add some pulled pork and take a picture of it make your own subreddit entitled melts because that is not a fucking grilled cheese im not a religious man nor am i anything close to a culinary expert but as a bland white midwestern male i am honestly the most passionate person when it comes to grilled cheese and mac cheese all of you foodies stay the hell away from our grilled cheeses and stop associating your sandwich melts with them yet again it is utter blasphemy and it rocks me to the core of my pale being shit i stopped lurking after years and made this account for the sole purpose of posting this ive seen post after post of peoples grilled cheeses all over reddit and its been driving me insane the moment i saw this subreddit this morning i finally snapped hell i may even start my own subreddit just because i know this one exists now you god damn heretics respect the grilled cheese and stop changing it into whatever you like and love it for it what it is or make your damn melt sandwich and call it for what it is a melt

hearthstone,removed,just fucking die
hearthstone,removed,see how much i fucking care
hearthstone,removed,i think there would be a dedicated pr or multimedia team to handle stuff like this but apparently an indie studio like blizzard cant afford one
hearthstone,removed,are you freaking serious you record these videos in your bedroom wtf seriously how unprofessional are you guys with the amount of money hearthstone and blizzard makes youre telling me you dont have this equipment and rooms in irvine where does jeff kaplan do his videos his kitchen he obviously does them at the office big disappointment and big fail ben
hearthstone,removed,fuck iskar xd amirite
hearthstone,removed,why the fuck is this fp on the hearthstone subreddit are there mods here
hearthstone,removed,cute story about your kid but its a lame excuse with all the millions of dollars hearthstone has brought in blizzard can afford to dedicate someone to creatingediting these videos they dont need some schmuck in his bedroom with windows movie maker that is the problem your outreach as a whole is poorly thought out and even more poorly delivered
hearthstone,removed,burn
hearthstone,removed,too bad most people will just come to shit on the meta snapshot and not watch the video i guess it takes more thought than copypaste so most people on reddit wont be able to do it
hearthstone,removed,i mean whatever you need to feel superior to someone else i guess has nothing to do with anger if someone acts like a child then treat them like one nothing makes them angrier theres plenty of feel good streamers but then theres the competitive and successful ones that dont cater you arent needed to support reynad he has a ton of it already and its not dying
hearthstone,removed,theres not much of an explanation because youre asking people who cant get past rank every season
hearthstone,removed,ooltre velyoo
hearthstone,removed,you worry about lighting and having a final cut before sending the content of the video for review to your team what the fuck
hearthstone,removed,losers
hearthstone,removed,dont hold your breath literally cuz youll die by the time of frankly id be surprised if you made it to next year
hearthstone,removed,can we fuck off with this blatantly transphobic joke that wasnt funny the first million times it was forced

hearthstone,removed,its not the first time dan and i have been in a casting couch
hearthstone,removed,wow director of hearthstone acting like an amateur
hearthstone,removed,at this point im beginning to wonder if the hearthstone team is a case study being done by blizzard to see how few resources they can possibly devote to a project and still make money hand over fist every story we hear about this team is like a joke
hearthstone,removed,what an arrogant jackass
hearthstone,removed,loser
hearthstone,removed,i cant find a site but he has youtube subscribers and twitter followers some flicker and instagram pics by his name i assume hes a photographer
hearthstone,removed,i hope somebody forcefully shoves bleach down your throat

hearthstone,not_removed,in the past future people were goinig to be nice honest and hard working people nowdays future people are lazy lying and dumb
hearthstone,not_removed,i got one today feelsbadman
hearthstone,not_removed,i crafted alakir day before the nerfs to rockbiter were announced
hearthstone,not_removed,still pretty decent with flametongue
hearthstone,not_removed,according to vss stats almost every top tier deck has about an equal win rate this game has a lot of problems but the aggro plague is a byproduct of the current ladder system lets say you are a really good control player winrate but with your aggro deck you only have about a winrate surely the control deck would be a better choice right no because those control matches take a lot more time you said yourself from rank losses are hardly punished this makes the strategy of trying to win as fast as possible much more effective once you hit the divide is smaller but unless you have a lot of time to put aside to ladder its still going to take a long time im not saying i have the solution but the ladder system is a massive factor in which decks are played and needs a rework
hearthstone,not_removed,yes changing the ladder to better reward control decks would be exploitable but aggro is exploiting the current system right now lets take your example of a win rate pirate warrior with an average game time of minutes so in games without taking win streaks into consideration you would play a little over hours go and gain net stars if you make a win rate control deck that takes say minutes on average a game in the time it takes to play games with an aggro deck you would play games meaning you would go and only gain stars basically playing a faster deck even though it wins less actually outperforms the control deck that wins more im not even factoring in completing quests faster getting more gold for winning games and the odds of getting a win streak increasing much more when you play more games so your point that the ladder is only about wins isnt entirely true when you dig past the surface i agree if the game had a higher skillcap the current ranked system would separate the good from bad players much better but thats a pipe dream since the game is still relatively new and wants to attract new players if the game has too high of a skillcap it will discourage new players who already have to grind andor spend tons of money to get cards to be competitive let alone learning complex mechanics again i want a higher skillcap but im looking at it from blizzards view i think a pretty decent fix for now would be to split the ladder between mobile players and pc players mobile players in general are more casual want quicker games since they play the games in shorter spurts and dont have the raresepicslegendaries it takes to make most control decks pc players have more time on their hands are more competitive and are in general more hardcore gamers blizzard is trying to cater to both players and you cant do that its a moving target yes it may upset players who crossplay between platforms but most mobilepc games are only for one platform so it shouldnt be that huge of a change from other games just my two cents
hearthstone,not_removed,his game has a lot of problems but the aggro plague is a byproduct of the current ladder system lets say you are a really good control player winrate but with your aggro deck you only have about a winrate surely the control deck would be a better choice right no because those control matches take a lot more time you still arent understanding if deck a takes less time to win with than deck b and the win rates are equal of course everyone is going to pick deck a it doesnt matter how you change the ladder system this makes the strategy of trying to win as fast as possible much more effective no sorry the strategy of winning as fast as possible is always most effective regardless of what the ladder system is it doesnt matter if you are playing hearthstone or starcraft or chess if all else is equal and one way to win is faster then why wouldnt you use that one more wins in less time is better period theres no ladder system you can dream up where this isnt the case the problem is that the skill ceiling is so low that everyone can bank on these discrete win percentages of their decks rather than requiring skill to unlock them we shouldnt even be talking about how deck a has a win rate that shouldnt be a thing your win rate should be based on player skill not what deck you copied from hearthpwn
hearthstone,not_removed,lets take your example of a win rate pirate warrior with an average game time of minutes so in games without taking win streaks into consideration you would play a little over hours go and gain net stars if you make a win rate control deck that takes say minutes on average a game in the time it takes to play games with an aggro deck you would play games meaning you would go and only gain stars and im saying there is absolutely no ranking system possible where this is not true i think a pretty decent fix for now would be to split the ladder between mobile players and pc players now thats just silly youre saying that because pc players have more time to waste they are going to be more willing to waste their time why would they what do they get out of spending more time to get the same amount of wins ultimately everyone wants to get as many wins as possible so they can get to as high a rank as possible as long as you have a game where decks that take turns to win are on equal footing with a deck that takes turns people are going to prefer the option that requires less time
hearthstone,not_removed,there is no possible way to obtain the objective winrate of a deck stats are based purely off of play time by imperfect players if aggro is easier and control is harder but the decks have near equal winrates what does that tell you about the powerlevel of the decks if we somehow made the ladder system less biased towards aggressive decks than the control players who are good at playing their deck will see a lot more success
hearthstone,not_removed,i used numbers to show that what you said in your original post was incorrect the criticism is that it favors agro decks it takes less time to win with those decks therefore playing agro decks means you have to invest less time to get to legendthis entire premise is wrong in fact that premise is right clearly aggro has a distinct advantage in the current system which brings us back to your point of the game having a low skill cap which creates equal win rates for aggro vs control which i said was correct youre right that its a problem that leads to more aggro being played its a good wish but theres no way blizzard is going to make the game more complicated or stop printing op aggro cards to make control have a significantly higher winrate than aggro as far as the mobilepc thing goes i get that everyones time is valuable i wasnt saying pc players have no life but if i had to guess the mobile player taking a shit at work would rather play three games of quick and easy aggro on their iphone while the pc player would rather play one game of intricate thoughtful control on their desktop theres a bit of a difference between the average diablo iii player and farmville player they are generally looking for completely different experiences out of a game
hearthstone,not_removed,if we somehow made the ladder system less biased towards aggressive decks and how could this even be remotely possible the variable here is time and unless ben brode masters the art of time travel to implement into his new ladder system it is a factor that cannot change
hearthstone,not_removed,i used numbers to show that what you said in your original post was incorrect oh i see now youre trying to say that control decks can be built to have a higher win rate than agro decks but that is demonstrably false we have the vs data to back that up if someone has a win rate deck control deck it means he is some kind of genius that solved the meta
hearthstone,not_removed,what if we based the ladder on winrate instead of solid wins for example you play placement matches and then you are put into rank based on your winrate you match up with people of a similar winrate and move up or down from there this system favours quality over quantity its not perfect but far from impossible
hearthstone,not_removed,what if we based the ladder on winrate instead of solid wins the current system already does that losses matter its not like the agro decks only win of the time but can just ignore all of their losses if you dont have a win rate above past rank you cant get to legend every time you lose a game you lose a star look agro face deck has win rate but it wins on turn control fatigue deck has win rate but it wins on turn they both have a win rate of but agro face deck gets you to legend faster time is not a consideration when we are measuring win rate if you measured their wl by the time both of those players reached legend it would be the same
hearthstone,not_removed,no it doesnt the current system devalues wins from ranks if you win times in a row then lose one you gain stars but only lose one by removing winstreaks individual wins go up in value even at rank and up losses can be undone but with a winrate system a loss will permanently impact your percentage until the reset
hearthstone,not_removed,what does the time spent per win have to do with winstreaks if you are playing minute games or minute games winstreaks are equally likely for both and as far as winrate the chief problem is that all of the so called viable decks have more or less winrate the winrate is the given okay losses permanently affect your record but how does that apply to an agro deck more than a control deck on reaching legend both would have the same record anyway but one would just take longer to get there
hearthstone,not_removed,like i said before control decks are harder to play so if you are effective with a control deck you will win more than someone who is effective with an aggro deck winstreaks punish you less for losing which means quantity triumphs over quality a winrate system ensures that players must play the deck theyre best at to climb as high as possible
hearthstone,not_removed,so if you are effective with a control deck you will win more than someone who is effective with an aggro deck thats not true though we have data to back this up even though the control decks are harder to play they still win less than the agro decks the win rates are comparable from skilled to unskilled players up and down the ladder
hearthstone,not_removed,they win by less percent something that can easily be mitigated by mastering the deck the data shows that most decks are even and therefore the popularity of aggro decks can be attributed to their ladder climbing efficiency
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,your internet is fucked blizzard doesnt just intentionally ddisconnect players from ranked for a laugh
hearthstone,not_removed,close hearthstone and open it again if that doesnt work log out of the blizzard client and log back in
hearthstone,not_removed,have you tried unplugging the hearthstone and plugging it back in
hearthstone,not_removed,nope i even tried it on my mobile phone
hearthstone,not_removed,their reconnect system is known for not being reliable sometimes it works but it can fail especially annoying given you might miss a turn or two while the system slowly tries its best to rejoin you
hearthstone,not_removed,welcome back to hearthstone currently theres a little pirate thats causing the meta some problems aggro decks are doing very well with aggro shaman efficiently ruling at the top with pirate warrioraggro trailing right behind it with that both reno mage and renolock are also viable choices to counter that as the meta continues to evolve there are new decks growing to counter other decks renomage and renolock often have a hard time dealing with jade druid there are also new forms of shaman both control and midrange with cards such as white eyes or ayajades other decks such as miracle rogue and priestdragon and reno priest are still present and can be viable as long as they survive past the threats shaman and warrior put out rip hunter and paladin personally i dont think there are too many great karazhan cards just open up the new expansions build a deck and then start saving up your gold again i think theres plenty of time before the next expansion tldr aggro is king there are counters kazakus aya and patches are must haves have fun youre in charge now
hearthstone,not_removed,pirates currently reign supreme thanks to gadgetzan giving them a bunch of buffs gadgetzan also gave preist the needed buff he was looking for so dragon preist is now a viable deck and a really strong one too reno decks are coming back strong with gadgetzan giving them more synergies such as being able to make your hero power cost zero that game and creating a powerful custom potion if your deck has no duplicates honestly id say your best bet is to just open up a bunch of gadgetzan packs and start crafting some of the better legendaries of gadgetzan like aya blackpaw patches and kazakus
hearthstone,not_removed,cards
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you aggro still reigns some things never change haha i guess ill buy some gadgetzan packs and start crafting
hearthstone,not_removed,alright thank you pirates seem really crazy and a lot of people seem upset about them
hearthstone,not_removed,solid advice thank you sir
hearthstone,not_removed,yep pirates are everywhere in the meta you just cant avoid them
hearthstone,not_removed,flamewreathed faceless is a male i can confirm i got fucked over by it
hearthstone,not_removed,dont let your memes be dreams
hearthstone,not_removed,check out shengs decks for some ideas
hearthstone,not_removed,zoo
hearthstone,not_removed,midrange hunter just get calls of the wild and you are good to go
hearthstone,not_removed,aggro shaman midrange shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,just wanted to add on that a quick resolution change or swapping inout of fullscreen fixes it still a bit annoying but nothing game breaking
hearthstone,not_removed,morgushan warden large and mostly not theatening
hearthstone,not_removed,thats a very specific shark preference
hearthstone,not_removed,river croc faceless manipulator flamewreathed faceless
hearthstone,not_removed,large and mostly not theatening meirl
hearthstone,not_removed,thats a nice suggestion but i mean i want it to look like a basking shark im considering the coldlight oracle but thats more a deep sea angler then a basking shark
hearthstone,not_removed,river croc doesnt have any resemblance to a basking shark and the other two are just cthulhuesque octopi plus im using rexxar for this deck so i couldnt use flamewreathed if i wanted to
hearthstone,not_removed,ill be honset with you mate there arnt actually any basking sharks in hs other water dwellers might be as close as you can get
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah youre probably right i just thought there might be one someone else might know im just gonna use the coldlight oracle thanks anyways
hearthstone,not_removed,i think that dragon warrior is a great deck to climb to legend with most definitely a novel and completely controversial opinion kappa
hearthstone,not_removed,what do you think about the list that runs gromragonyxia and deathwing as your big drops no malkorok crusher slams faerie dragon also how good is chillmaw if you are ahead you cant ever play it because you risk clearing your own board
hearthstone,not_removed,hey man kuddos on your explanatory vids do you have some input on the different matchup values youre having compared to the ones given on tempostorm for the meta snapshot i understand you have yours due to actual playing but your numbers are a lot more positive than the ones from ts
hearthstone,not_removed,wow i have never seen guide for dragon warrior before glad its finally here kappa
hearthstone,not_removed,i like your content quite a lot its very useful thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,any update for onik
hearthstone,not_removed,post it on rcompetitivehs next time just look at all those retarded comments nobody here takes the game seriously anyway its just a collection of shitposts and qq posts
hearthstone,not_removed,original deck as well nice guide kappa
hearthstone,not_removed,the list seems pretty good theres lots of slight variations that can be made with this list imo chillmaw seems okay but yeah not great if youre really ahead
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks id say trust the vstempo storm meta snapshots over mine they likely have thousands of games going into theirs and i only have
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks ryan glad it helps
hearthstone,not_removed,unfortunately i havent played the list in a few weeks id stick with the same one to farm unrefined decks that people are experimenting with
hearthstone,not_removed,going to hs subreddit for gameplay in elegiggle
hearthstone,not_removed,going to the subreddit of an unbalanced childrens card game for discussion lul
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks kappa
hearthstone,not_removed,how much mana that would have to be like mana to not be stupid broken
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for the comments its would be mana and it would instead it would a with a death rattle to respawn with shedzuhum and a random legendary of the same cost or higher to a random enemy minion if affected to sylvanas windrunner if would trigger after her death rattle
hearthstone,not_removed,its pretty much stupid broken no matter what cant be targeted and divine shield do not belong on one minion let alone and the end of your turn minion gains all health back and divine shield even at mana its the sort of card that either instantly wins you the game or instantly loses you the game its basically if you cant kill this with the minions you already have out when its played you lose the minion the only real response you can have to this card is sylvanas or something like twisting nether or deadly shot class spells that see very little play because the only thing more broken that this minion is a minion that can steal a minion this broken
hearthstone,not_removed,no its not going to be a choose one mechanic so it wont work that would be a huge oversight on their part
hearthstone,not_removed,oh lord rip deckslots
hearthstone,not_removed,nah
hearthstone,not_removed,his ability affects choose one abilities not discoveries
hearthstone,not_removed,fandral also doesnt discover all options from discover effects
hearthstone,not_removed,aww man
hearthstone,not_removed,cos its not a choose one card either i think some people fail to realize its a keyword it doesnt just apply to anything you need to choose an option for
hearthstone,not_removed,since youre not repeatedly playing against the same opponent over and over i dont really understand why you should stick with the same target in all your games i think its ideal to do something similar to what you saidtry to target the character you dont want to hit so that your opponent is confused about your strategy
hearthstone,not_removed,if youre playing against a good player he might notice that youre doing the opposite of what you want and so conclude to your actual strategy even from the first attack on and the reason to keep the same target over multiple games is because if you dont then how do you chose which one you take this game you will chose it based on your deck or something like i want him to think im aggressive because my deck is not aggressive and that way still tell your opponent your strategy and even if you think you chose it randomly for this game it wont be random because of your subconsciousness
hearthstone,not_removed,itll be released in august whether itll be announced in july or august will depend on how team wants to go about it this time if they want to do an loe announcing at gamescom august and releasing the week after is possible edit hearthstone will be playable at gamescom according to this tweet visitors to our booth will be able to get some handson time with all of our games overwatch heroes of the storm hearthstone world of warcraft legion starcraft ii legacy of the void and diablo as it stands its a pretty good guess and fit for the timeline i would bet my golden yogg that well see some new cards at the event at least either as a final reveal or otherwise my hunch is that there will be a feature update ala tavern brawl but could be something else like replays or rework for arena before the content release though edit the more i think about it the more it makes sense that the final reveal will be at gamescom with the first wing launching on say august it makes no sense to launch before that and have something playable at the convention when everyone can just play on their phones anyway and im fairly sure it wont be too late after one of the bosses will probably be playable at gamescom just like at blizzcon
hearthstone,not_removed,im thinking mid to late july with a launch in august
hearthstone,not_removed,probably at gamescom
hearthstone,not_removed,not for a while
hearthstone,not_removed,plz sit down i still need some wings from brmloe and packs i need moar packs
hearthstone,not_removed,how do we know august being the release date
hearthstone,not_removed,do you know if were still getting more expansionsadventures this year i was under the impression that releases per year was going to be the norm but ive seen on here a couple times that that starts next year only this year
hearthstone,not_removed,so these have been the release dates of all new content in hearthstone since the game launched launch march naxx july to august gvg december brm april to april tgt august loe november to december og april all content releases have been in april august and december weeks theres been nothing to suggest that this will change going forward even if its not smack in august itll be shortly before or after the devs have confirmed the plan is to do expansionadventureexpansion for the next couple of years at least source rather than continuing a cadence of expansionadventureexpansionadventure blizzard lays out a timeline with two expansions per year — one at the start one near the end — and a single adventure between them
hearthstone,not_removed,this is a assumption based on previous release times
hearthstone,not_removed,nothing is known for sure so far according to the hs timeline up to now it takes months grand tournament into league of explorers to months old gods for new content to approach so czhihong speculation of a release around gamescom is possible
hearthstone,not_removed,i think they said it would be expansions and adventure per year in the wildstandard format announcement
hearthstone,not_removed,as far as i recall blizzard said for the future they want to release one adventure and two sets per year starting in so expect one adventure in summer and an expansion in fallwinter
hearthstone,not_removed,well there were some news recently that blizzard might change their release cylce of alternating between expansions and adventures into expansion adventure per year but there was no official confirmation whatsoever so we dont know for sure yet what the content update will be about and when it will be released
hearthstone,not_removed,playing control decks without sufficient cards sucks i mainly played priest before i realized that its useless without cabals and justicar i have a sort of hassliebe when it comes to cw its concept is close to me but the cost of this deck is just beyond my reach you need brawls shield slams no corrupted seer will wipe out shamans boards let alone the fact that youll be dead by turn that being said im probably going to try this deck anyway since i am but hate playing aggro
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you this is very helpful i wish there were guides like this for other expensive but popular meta decks
hearthstone,not_removed,ive always been envious of control warrior but all their cards are so expensive i think blizzard purposefully prints cheap aggro cards and expensive control cards so half the ladder isnt control if there were cheap control cards causal mobile players would quit because games take forever and are uninteractive welp im only like away from a good control warrior deck might as well start practicing my patience ill be sure to try this deck when i get the chance also if youre new to the game its unproductive to craft commons if you open packs regularly as youll get them eventually but if you really want to try a budget warrior go right on ahead
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you so much for this post i currently have all the commons the list doesnt have any rares i opened one shield slam and doomsayers i also have all legendaries except justicar cairne harrison and rag i had to choose between crafting the epics or going for justicar now i know what to choose d
hearthstone,not_removed,why no
hearthstone,not_removed,dammnnnn thanks man it was like my dream to play cw like them streamers i especially like how it has one card by one how to get the deck closer to the template very neat thanks again
hearthstone,not_removed,a budget warrior deck that might work ill give it a try how about swapping out a corrupted seer for a gorehowl
hearthstone,not_removed,if youre going for a budget cw wouldnt it be better to include raging worgen as a win condition considering most of the people wont have justicar monkeyfatigue raggrom etc
hearthstone,not_removed,why does that full decklist have nzoth if cairne is the only deathrattle card
hearthstone,not_removed,what are your thoughts on replacing one or two bloodhoof braves for infested tauren and i do love me a good nzoth deck i play tons of reno dragondin and cthun rogue and they run plenty of great class deathrattles garrosh has none though so i am wondering why you are adding a win condition in nzoth that being said if i were to run nzoth what about the chillmaw ysera tagteam ysera like saraad is a card generator for elise instead of a control vs control exclusive win condition in nzoth rafaam can delete enemy brawls clear your opponents full board of tokens or give that baine bloodhoof godmode to push for lethal early saraad can bait out removal to make sylvanas less likely to get dealt with easily create good spells or extra elise legendaries and provides an actual body that can be played on turn against face decks is there no room for gorehowlmalkorok what can i include instead of baron geddon as he is the only card i am missing in the deck thoughts on blood brothers i think its a really interesting card edit this would be my first attempt at making the changes i am asking you about httpimgurcomchmmwmn
hearthstone,not_removed,i have doomsayers because i foolishly chose to make a freeze mage as the first deck i made should i sub him in even though i dont have some of the cards before him
hearthstone,not_removed,so after playing this deck for quite some time i noticed that i tend to run out of cards and removial also i dont like kavalder raider and need weapon removal any tips
hearthstone,not_removed,hi first off amazing guide im new to control warrior could somebody help me out by answering a few questions do i mulligan for a curve or do i mulligan for answers always keep fiery win axe i only have shield slam brawl right now first off when do i shield slam vs execute also when should i play brawl around minions can someone explain what the general playstyle is do i play shield block on turn or play the acolyte do i only respond to the opponents threats or do i play my own right now i just dont have a good feeling for the deck when to play which cards which ones i should save etc
hearthstone,not_removed,i found your deck i know this topic is so old but need to comment i started a new account to help a friend get one pack started playing with it hoping that someday the quest appears so i will use it to play against my personal account got some cards the first legendary i got at this account was sylvanas so i started to look at cheap decks that use her and found this i only can say that it is amazing i just subbed one raider like you said here the rest account is as is it is very difficult deck to play properly in fact i still learning it and got luck opening some hunter cards including one cow so i have a deck to get at level no quick shot hurts i was playing this control warrior version against a token druid he found that he was ahead and dropped all his hand and soul of the forest i dropped one bog creeper and started to popping the creatures next turn he had force of nature needed to use all his creatures and had a board full of of course i got seer next turn two turns later i had the seer intact and one kraken at cleared two minions he dropped cenarius i got second kraken cleared his minions with a intact after that dropped kvaldir and it was a game the best part is that no one plays around bog creeper so they spend hard removal on creatures like brave so the creeper acts like a aoe kraken it is a poors man gromash get damage next turn attack but we have two instead of one even aberrant berserker is a good creature at first i had removed it to a shieldamasta but read your guide carefully and understood why you have it thank you so much for posting this deck i have a lot of fun playing it
hearthstone,not_removed,wait how is revenge better than whirlwind
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i dont see the point of trying to play cw without shield slams and brawls the sole reason cw is strong to me is the ability to remove a big minion for mana and slam down your ownbig minion being able to do that basically times in the game cant be overlooked
hearthstone,not_removed,let me know what you want to see and ill see what i can do
hearthstone,not_removed,the epics brawl is godlike
hearthstone,not_removed,its from league of explorers and his initial list doesnt include any adventure cards
hearthstone,not_removed,minion warrior common loe 🐙 httphearthstonegamepediacomobsidiandestroyer mana at the end of your turn summon a scarab with taunt callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to pm
hearthstone,not_removed,how much of this deck have you completed months later
hearthstone,not_removed,that wouldnt be a bad idea but gotehowl isnt super good in the current meta due to the fact that almost everyone runs oozeharrison still worth a shot though
hearthstone,not_removed,i wanted to keep the deck as close to a control warrior list where the substitutions made sense adding the worgens would also mean adding charge inner rage and cruel taskmaster which would end up looking like frankensteins monster once you start replacing cards
hearthstone,not_removed,and sylvanas at which point nzoth is a mana
hearthstone,not_removed,infested tauren is too easily dealt with in my opinion bloodhoof brave has the potential to clear the board against zoo or shaman the nzoth is there to essentially build a board from nothing spitting out highvalue for the cost of one turn at the point you would play nzoth you arent doing it for recovery but for a sticky board to threaten lethal and a taunt doesnt really matter since the deck is full of recovery options brawl revenge baron geddon and single target removal bash shield slam you dont need to rely so heavily on taunts ysera is pretty slow and with nzoth already being a card that is slow it isnt really a good idea to clog your hand with cards that require a whole turn to use this is also why blood warriors doesnt fit because it too is slow to get value you arent really going to have a board with more than two minions so paying the cost of a minion in order to play a second copy isnt too necessary the problems with malkorok and gorehowl is that oozeharrison are in the meta though either of those cards or even rag could replace baron geddon if you find youre facing slower decks i hope that helps
hearthstone,not_removed,you could but without other removal in the deck its probably better to rely more on minion trading with the berserker than to swap it for that you would be better off swapping it for a corrupted seer if its one of your first swaps
hearthstone,not_removed,sure though it probably wont be filmed for a couple days ive got quite a bit going on with work this weekend but if i can find the time i certainly will
hearthstone,not_removed,the one mana is not a big deal for a control deck and if you revenge for damage against an aggro deck you often just win
hearthstone,not_removed,i know though it is actually impossible to build a proper control deck without epics i put this deck together because it can almost seamlessly shift into a control deck with the changes suggested
hearthstone,not_removed,i get your point well i have a bunch of legendaries required for lots of decks chillmaw sylvanas crafted leeroy crafted cairne got him before he became popular again tirion and i started to play in last august however i bought all adventures with gold and for quite a while my playstyle was suboptimal i started seeing misplays quite soon but my decks were awful before i started netdecking which didnt happen soon enough and my summary is it is not impossible for to build cw but you gotta be pretty lucky the eternal struggle is that you should play a cheapaccessible deck first which is perfectly built and gets you up like face hunter which i didnt do btw then use the resources that you gained i didnt play much arena i was called a tryhard for keeping the stats i reached rank in march for the first time so you can imagine how awful were my chests the big problem with cw is epics epics are also rather hard to get getting epics that you need is harder getting all epics that you need is even harder
hearthstone,not_removed,execute definitely needs to be nerfed and i am not joking they gave shatter to mages and it costs its way easier to damage something than to freeze it so execute should at the very least cost but probably dunno about shield slam since its epic maybe no nerf needed but it would be more fair for it to cost brawl is also busted but i guess that one is hard to be changed
hearthstone,not_removed,going for sometimes even better if your minion wins the brawl is just insane card advantage and removal
hearthstone,not_removed,woops forgot her too personally id still run rag though ive also seen most control warriors run rag as well
hearthstone,not_removed,yes your points about bloodhoof blood warriors ysera and chillmaw are all valid however with regards to nzoths board creation point rafaam does in fact have the ability to create a board from nothing and is not contingent upon having played other drops before him though it is alot less sticky and i can see why you wouldnt put it in other than that i still wanted your opinion on saraad in elise decks as i love that card yes it is greedy but i find when using it in my control decks it eats a removal that allows me to use my tirion or sylvanas more freely for example looking over the deck the only time i feel there is room for it is against control matchups and in this matchup doomsayer can be removed so against aggomidrange geddon and doomsayer are mandatory but against control as you said i can replace geddon with ragnaros since they will have harrison for gorehowlmalkorok redacted because too random surely and doomsayer with saraad sucks that i dont have geddon it really is a tough decision on whether to craft leeroy or geddon next im currently at legendaries with only those and deathwing missing as far as competitive legendaries go thanks for your very helpful replies d
hearthstone,not_removed,sorry for taking your time id also like to ask what you think of obsidian destroyer vs bog creeper and north sea kraken or maybe alex because i built freeze
hearthstone,not_removed,you need epics tops for cw if youre hellbend on playing cw thats only dust not that hard to farm
hearthstone,not_removed,ive run it both ways and while rag has the ability to recover from a losing board so does half the deck having a second sylvanas and cairne along with a is huge and makes your board strong from nothing
hearthstone,not_removed,saras would be better in a slower meta while it is amazing in control vs control its still very much a zoomidrange meta i would consider it as a tech choice if im facing a lot of control but from my ladder experience im not as for which to craft it really depends on which decks you want to play geddon is really only good in control warrior whereas leeroy has a home in zoo and miracle if you want to play control warrior above all else id recommend geddon if not then leeroy for its versatility
hearthstone,not_removed,dont apologize i have no problem helping people i think obsidian destroyer is a card that got much better with the bgh nerf and the only reason i didnt include it was because i wanted to make a deck without adventure cards you could probably sub it in for either of those cards because it generates more value over time than either of them however keep in mind that it plays a different role than either of those cards bog creeper wards off lethal against a bigger board it would be much better to drop from behind if your opponent has a bunch of small minions threatening lethal because they would have to send their board into it to attack face whereas with obsidian destroyer they can clear the and push for lethal that way kraken is more for spot removal than anything which without shield slam is much wanted obsidian destroyer is probably around the same power level as either of those cards so replacing either of them with it isnt a terrible idea but just be aware of the advantages and drawbacks
hearthstone,not_removed,found some time this morning bear in mind im not a video maker or streamer so im not super exciting to watch
hearthstone,not_removed,thats another problem i am not i prefer other decks but eh i do want to ladder up with cw
hearthstone,not_removed,on my phone so i cant edit i meant saraad not saras
hearthstone,not_removed,meh i started last year in may wallet did its thing and cw was among first decks ive crafted alongside freeze mage and handlock its a fun deck but ranking up with it so slow some games are lost by default simply by shitty draw and hunters hell most midrange decks nzoth decks and priest reks you fyi i managed to reach rank with it last season for the first time but ladder was filled with shitty shaman and zoolock decks on which cw preys also cw is not that difficult to play but knowing your matchups is really important especially mulligan
hearthstone,not_removed,idk what else to use to ladder i have a sort of tempo mage no arcane blast no antonidas but i dont like it as much as i love miracle rogue which did get me to rank but not further oh and i crafted midrange shaman which can be modified to face shaman but i cant play that cancer just cant seconding freeze mage though definitely want to play that one day
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah if you dislike aggro and midrange decksand yeah playing boring minions on curve is by far the dullest type of decks in hs theres not much options for you control is expensive were talking dust per decks so focusing on one is your best option that or dishing euros then you figure blizzard really doesnt like control playstyle games are three times longer and net you worse winrate than your average midrange shammy and they havent printed good removal card in ages and you end up feeling like like a moron for paying figuring that they cater to casual base try arena if youre any good youll built your collection quite fast
hearthstone,not_removed,i find midrange hunter really fun and once you get call of the wild its just rares and commons games are relatively quick you can beat most ladder decks if you playdraw well and it lets you get the dust you need to play more expensive decks i agree that if you want to generate cardsdust quickly then arena is your best bet but if youre not great at arena then packs are probably the way to go
hearthstone,not_removed,my average on arena is so maybe not the best idea especially now when its time to save for an adventure been buying packs like insane but to little or no avail
hearthstone,not_removed,i have no cotw but lock and load so i usually play yoggnload in all these months of playing i havent even crafted savannah highmane xd maybe i should try to get some dust though
hearthstone,not_removed,the deck you are describing is the otk worgen warrior i think in the beggining of this season a korean player came up with a tweak for the old worgen otk using commanding shout and wild pyromancer for board clear fast deck cycling
hearthstone,not_removed,its probably otk worgen the idea is to do nothing but kill your stuff and wait until all the combo pieces are in hand thaurissan for one tick can make a big difference inner fire rampage andor cruel taskmaster attack face add faceless manipulator at the end to double the damage
hearthstone,not_removed,minion neutral common classic 🐙 httphearthstonegamepediacomragingworgen mana enrage windfury and attack spell warrior basic basic 🐙 httphearthstonegamepediacomcharge mana give a friendly minion attack and charge callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to pm
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,added
hearthstone,not_removed,mana sap
hearthstone,not_removed,it is playable though if youve been around long enough you should even have the first wing for free
hearthstone,not_removed,you had to actually beat a boss in the wing to keep it open mon ami so that ship she sailed
hearthstone,not_removed,for fun or collection purposes no never otherwise yeah its a meme card
hearthstone,not_removed,those are some damn good rewards but noggen is a just for fun card will almost certainly never be competitive
hearthstone,not_removed,nog is a beast id at least play a few casuals with him before you decide
hearthstone,not_removed,why dont you wait until tomorrow or when the full set is released it probably wont change much since it is more of a fun card but weve seen some wacky cards thus far
hearthstone,not_removed,noggenfogger dreadsteeds
hearthstone,not_removed,dusting a golden legendary is against the rules
hearthstone,not_removed,yes
hearthstone,not_removed,my first ever double legendary pack
hearthstone,not_removed,grats personally i would keep the golden noggenfogger if you dont have a regular one unless you really need the dust although i did dust golden sally without a regular one in my collection no regrets on that one yet
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont have a regular one but only have the dust coming from the future hall of fame cards and preorder for ungoro
hearthstone,not_removed,you can do that after the nerfs
hearthstone,not_removed,but you only have mana leftover to bm with the nerfs
hearthstone,not_removed,hed need more mana though
hearthstone,not_removed,oh im good at naming posts but i think its still amusing
hearthstone,not_removed,hed just rockbiter himself
hearthstone,not_removed,one turn kill combos without needing emporer just survive then use your mana to deal damage in one turn for example with malygos etc
hearthstone,not_removed,aviana would be super op
hearthstone,not_removed,freeze mage would probably be unbeatable by classes that are not warrior
hearthstone,not_removed,also going from to mana is not as big a gap anymore and things like astral communion get a lot better because youll hit a point where you can play multiple cards in a turn
hearthstone,not_removed,you can holy smite face
hearthstone,not_removed,who even plays holy smite
hearthstone,not_removed,but then id actually have to run that in a nonmeme deck
hearthstone,not_removed,dennis
hearthstone,not_removed,technically the title is a bit misleading since you say all cards there are over all cards so you should say all standard cards also the math was already done but maybe not for the latest expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,i am surprised there is almost the same amount of epics than legendaries
hearthstone,not_removed,do you really have to possess the normal version of a card to craft the golden one i think i crafted golden cards without owning the normal version but im not sure
hearthstone,not_removed,to be honest i started it out as a question i wanted to know what the cost of all golden cards was i ended up just answering myself in my defense i do answer the titular question in the first section i tend to get carried away having to fix my organization afterward is it enough to be considered the usual clickbait and deceitful tactics comment your thoughts below and share to your friends edit youre correct in that those posts are outdated i guess im the first at least on this subreddit to have the updated information i didnt do the actual money math nor the gold math so those are still up for grabs edit additionally it was am when i started writing and is am now i must be neurotic or something but some of my behavior like coming back and editing this comment a few times in a row might be explained by the fact that im fking tired because im an idiot
hearthstone,not_removed,thats not so surprising you have different commons different rares n different epics and n different legendaries but if you look at cards you have common cards rare cards rare epics and n legendaries as you can have only of them this also can be explained by the fact you get legendary per class and per set but a few of epics and quite a bunch of neutral legendaries for instance in msg you have legendary and epics per class which means legendary and epic classspecific cards aside you get epic and legendary neutral cards so in total you have epics and legendaries that explains the to ratio
hearthstone,not_removed,or you can just get the innkeeper software sync your collection with hearthpwn and check there how much dust you need to complete either complete collection normal and golden mixed only normal or only golden cards it also gives you a bunch of information about your collection as well i played the toturial on asia to get the numbers for a brand new acocunt i would love to see a hearthpwn api or the possibility to get more stats how much dust to complete a class how many dust to get standardwild collections etc
hearthstone,not_removed,if it survives brawls it can attack that turn right
hearthstone,not_removed,yep unless the minions that died were deathrattle minions that summoned tokens
hearthstone,not_removed,aw
hearthstone,not_removed,wait you were against a warlock liar
hearthstone,not_removed,it was a nzoth renolock featuring villager harvest golem infested tauren and cairne
hearthstone,not_removed,pics or it didnt happen
hearthstone,not_removed,well then i guess it didnt happen
hearthstone,not_removed,why dont i get rank players in my rank games
hearthstone,not_removed,background audio is so fitting
hearthstone,not_removed,loving the audio from the stream
hearthstone,not_removed,mistakes were made
hearthstone,not_removed,that wheeze though
hearthstone,not_removed,i played a tavern brawl once where my opponent had dreadsteed and kelthuzad out i killed the dreadsteed times so after my turn his board was filled with dreadsteeds he couldnt get rid of and he could only play minion a turn
hearthstone,not_removed,i remember everyone looking at apothecary even some trying it out saying it could be decent they were all horribly wrong
hearthstone,not_removed,why the hell do people play that its obviously damage to your face right there with dreadsteed like wtf
hearthstone,not_removed,that warlock is retarded
hearthstone,not_removed,was watching a stream your reddit username the youtube username and the hs name is all the same why not just post that i made a sick play
hearthstone,not_removed,built a reno mage came back to finish it a while later tweaked a few things first game afterwards went to fatigue hm no reno thats probably not going to help
hearthstone,not_removed,thats me trying infinite value reno jade druid didnt think those jade idols through even if you theoretically can wait until you reno before you shuffle jades into your deck thats just not how it works
hearthstone,not_removed,yup this season i decided to try anyfin paladin at rank i played games in a row where i was nearing no cards left in the deck with plenty of life and board control and my opponent conceded after the third time when i had one card left in the deck i thought dang no chance to otk yet check decklist no anyfin at all
hearthstone,not_removed,the first kazakus reno deck i made had flamestrikes in it somehow it took me like games before i realized it
hearthstone,not_removed,i have to assume this wasnt a dreadsteed deck because that would be a dream board
hearthstone,not_removed,i did something similar and it went to fatique with me only taking up to damage a turn at most the warlock had cards in hand and used renounce darkness it gave them a bloodlust
hearthstone,not_removed,i disagree i still believe it is a good card problem is it is not a thoughtless slam it down kind of card so most people who play hearthstone just dont know how to use it anyone with a brain would not have played this next to a dreadsteed
hearthstone,not_removed,at least damage he could ping it with hero power not lethal without alex or additional damage spells but still an obviously terrible play maybe he thought the card only triggered when you played a minion not summoned idk
hearthstone,not_removed,i was watching a stream on my second monitor specifically hsdogdog and hafu thats why theres dialogue other than my wheezing laughter
hearthstone,not_removed,my kazakus reno lock deck was missing kazakus for games whoops
hearthstone,not_removed,it was some kind of rng based tavern brawl with minions only random decks
hearthstone,not_removed,another huge problem with it is that almost all of the competitive decks on ladder right now likely run leeroy except for priest and mage not to mention dirty rat run by all of the control decks pretty much every deck has some way to make that thing deal damage to you i remember in the early days of the expansion thijs tried to make it work but the enemy kept abusing it
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah it feels like he just wanted to be in a highlights even if its for being dumb
hearthstone,not_removed,had a similar board state after rivendare dropped from sneeds old shredder was experimenting with a dreadsteed nzoth deck he killed baron probably a poor choice considering i already had a full board of dreadsteeds and conceded when i dropped malganis next turn
hearthstone,not_removed,is neat
hearthstone,not_removed,hamster has earned you packs in total congrats he qualified
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,would you by chance have a link to the final bracketsresults
hearthstone,not_removed,tyvm
hearthstone,not_removed,no balls
hearthstone,not_removed,you win this one fiend
hearthstone,not_removed,cut or riot
hearthstone,not_removed,s e m a n t i c s
hearthstone,not_removed,and a year from now shamans wil suck again
hearthstone,not_removed,lawyerd
hearthstone,not_removed,fair enough
hearthstone,not_removed,single nut bro here do it you whimp
hearthstone,not_removed,i can see the tag now wouldnt even cut left testicle in half
hearthstone,not_removed,you learn something new everyday thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,this conversation reminds me of
hearthstone,not_removed,very good made me chuckle
hearthstone,not_removed,expected a picture of a two wallnuts one being halved
hearthstone,not_removed,mods do your duty shame him with shameful flair of shame
hearthstone,not_removed,hey mods can you get this pussy a flair so we all know he ha son balls
hearthstone,not_removed,i have two perfectly healthy whole balls
hearthstone,not_removed,it got removed what did he say
hearthstone,not_removed,and everyone will be complaining about priests and their
hearthstone,not_removed,which body part do you want to bet on that
hearthstone,not_removed,and then people will talk about how tuskar was fine and all they needed to do was buff other cards
hearthstone,not_removed,not even a year theyre taking a major hit in months when tgtloe rotate out the class will not be remotely as strong without trogggolemtuskarretc most of its wins even as a midrange list come from oppressive early game starts that force your opponent to choose between losing card advantage or tempo unless they print more broken bullshit shaman will be significantly worse in the next rotation but significantly worse than batshit insanely op is still pretty decent so they might actually be balanced a year from now with some new cards
hearthstone,not_removed,me too was hoping for something like this
hearthstone,not_removed,a missed opportunity for sure mistakes were made
hearthstone,not_removed,he said that if shaman will be tier in year then he might cut off half of his balls except he used another word instead of might and he linked dictionary for the word he used tldr he isnt brave enough to cut off half of his testicles
hearthstone,not_removed,we are not prepared
hearthstone,not_removed,id bet of my other left testicle it will
hearthstone,not_removed,it crossed my mind but i dont have any nuts on hand that arent fleshy and its too much effort to leave my house
hearthstone,not_removed,rogues will be
hearthstone,not_removed,which id are you using there
hearthstone,not_removed,wait you have two left testies
hearthstone,not_removed,im just messing around dude however id recommend a monkey nut for the extra ballsack effect
hearthstone,not_removed,why wont you follow through if you have a spare
hearthstone,not_removed,you dont have left testicles you should see you dr about that
hearthstone,not_removed,hes using it the sense of remaining as opposed to opposite of right naturally
hearthstone,not_removed,all i can is just dive in go face first pun intended and just figure things out at your own pace alot has changed in the game and you wont get it at all first youll need to build that collection so just keep questing keep playing watch streams for tips and just have fun i know this is generic mumbo jumbo but i mean it all
hearthstone,not_removed,some are kind of outdated but can still be useful for a beginner httpswwwredditcomrhearthstonewikiresourceswikistickythreads
hearthstone,not_removed,look for budget decks on sites like hearthpwn when you find decks youre interested in look at the cards you dont have and see if you have something that can replace it reasonably some cards you just cant but others youre probably able to pretty reasonably replace wait until the new set comes out and standard rotates in like a month to make any big dust or cash investments as the game will change drastically but after that look for a deck you like and slowly work towards building it perfectly its rewarding and fun to do and youll learn the play style and game better
hearthstone,not_removed,good morning here is a list of newbie resources i keep on hand for players like you i hope you find them useful trump basic teachings introduces card game concepts dust starter decks trumps decks are decent but intended to focus on specific aspects of the game these are different decks optimised to be as strong as possible for free decks rather than to focus on any one thing decks for new players these are low dust cost decks intended for free to play and beginners to use while they transition from starter decks to complete meta decks updated for msog by the good folk of the askhearthstone discord server reddit guides and assorted resources httpswwwredditcomrhearthstonewikiresourceswikistickythreads additional links and resources to check out including slightly more advanced decklists and archived threads on many topics here is another general guide for new players to hearthstone that i think is good good luck and welcome to hearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,that second pack is from the hct pick your champion
hearthstone,not_removed,hes so positive and generous his fixes barely take any time at just business day
hearthstone,not_removed,ubbrode s parents have been really active on reddit lately
hearthstone,not_removed,i truly love ben brode as a beard bearing man
hearthstone,not_removed,i truly love ben brode period pls be my prom date
hearthstone,not_removed,brode seems like a cool guy but i cant see how that is relevant to the quality of hs i have to say that the whole cult of personality craze lately is frustrating ill give him and team time to make a change but as things are right now the game isnt really evolving the peak we have at the next expansion has me hopeful since the new mechanics are interesting despite that i still have a nagging fear that curvestone will never change and will continue to be unsatisfying with respect to skillful decision making the complaints forced archtypes op packages aggro preference grindy ladder etc people bring up in this subreddit over and over again are valid and i have yet to see anything from team that would indicate that they are going to address these issues
hearthstone,not_removed,when did he get promoted was it true that before him the director was eric dodds and he turned the game into rng fest what happened to him i remember he always made a weird noise when he laughed hng hnng hnnnng
hearthstone,not_removed,apparently he hasnt done much as game director yet besides pr but theres no denying its been good pr hes also very willing to talk with the community about any concerns they have im a bit worried about his design philosophy alienating the competitive fanbase but only time will tell how that will play out
hearthstone,not_removed,its pretty great they got seth rogan to do the reveal
hearthstone,not_removed,you know this was the guy who pushed hard to put patches in the game
hearthstone,not_removed,my lord we have yet to see him produce anything of meaning or merit and yet the circlejerk on how great he is continues lets wait and see then judge whether he is jesus
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah im not sure hes a great game director but he is a hell of a hype man
hearthstone,not_removed,hes a great pr man but a poor game director
hearthstone,not_removed,i truly hate ben brode as a game director
hearthstone,not_removed,can we just have a brode appreciation pinned by the mods
hearthstone,not_removed,found ben brodes alt account at least hes a fan of himself
hearthstone,not_removed,i wonder how much sway he has in how the game develops if he has the influence and just doesnt act thats bad but im sure theres limitations from above as well as from a design standpoint hes got the charisma though
hearthstone,not_removed,hes just a pr mascot at this point if you can see past his wacky antics hes just a money hungry monkey that doesnt give a shit about the dedicated playerbase hearthstone could have way more depth if this guy actually listened to his pro players and the vocal community
hearthstone,not_removed,ben brode is quickly becoming one of my favorite game directors hes just so positive and generous practically costs nothing at all at one mana you drop him on the board and that chill ass motherfucker gives you a game to use later in your life and you also get this adorable little can ping things but usually is too harmless to be removed but more than the bb is just so positive it comes on the board like hahahahahahahaha and im like yeah bb hahahahahahahaha lets do this shit and when he attacks hes like its on our radar and im like yeah its on our radar he doesnt say some bullshit macho shit like i will destroy you hes just like nah its on our radar and it looks so happy i mean this is a human being literally brought to life by evolution it understands its life is a temporary scientific gift and the dude is just fucking loving it i mean hes just so happy i am literally never sad when ben brode is on board idk if hes gonna make it into the metagame or not but for now he a pretty chill gal
hearthstone,not_removed,cult of personality all the op said is that he likes the man
hearthstone,not_removed,i like ben brode as a person but hearthstone is going nowhere with him at the helm this balance philosophy of never buffing anything and taking months to nerf anything is idiotic and i dont throw that word around lightly furthermore his team continues to bleach out any semblance of complexity from the game
hearthstone,not_removed,lul
hearthstone,not_removed,except that the whole post wasnt about what he did will do to the game the original post was about ben brode as a director from a pr side of things his personality the love and passion he doesnt shy away from showing the openness etc
hearthstone,not_removed,but muh ben brod
hearthstone,not_removed,i wonder how much they can get after posting this shitlol
hearthstone,not_removed,what did this copypasta originally refer to babbling book swashburglar
hearthstone,not_removed,i truly love babbling book as a spell generator i have been playing hearthstone for months and i just love the energy and fun he had put into it the world championship video made me laugh its so amazing to see him have so much fun with the game and with the spells he is so amazing because you get to see him act like a goofball not many other spell generators for this kind of thing he is so energetic about the spell and you can really see it through the way he acts ps babbling book if you ever read this thank you for what you have done
hearthstone,not_removed,thats pretty good but shouldve been a instead of
hearthstone,not_removed,by cult of personality im referring to the trend of modern companies having front men to represent their brandproduct for example how steve jobs was the front man for apple where fanboys had an almost godlike worship for his abilities to improve apple products of course brode isnt at jobs status but if you look back at the original post op refers to ben as amazing and different from other game directors sure he is a cool guy but like i said his amazingness has nothing to do with the quality of hs id much rather have a game director that was socially inept and a wellbalanced interesting game
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah his damage control was really good
hearthstone,not_removed,babbling book originally someone made the swashburglar one very soon after though i think basically just pointing out that theyre very similar cards
hearthstone,not_removed,for reference its here
hearthstone,not_removed,but that wouldnt be adorable little d
hearthstone,not_removed,pr god dev devil
hearthstone,not_removed,are you saying dealing damage to the face is not pinging
hearthstone,not_removed,its way too slow no healbot and most importantly molten giant was killed which was an integral part of the deck
hearthstone,not_removed,molten giants being nerfed to shit influenced it demon handlock was pretty significantly better than normal handlock imo but theres no more malganis in standard and with aggro decks being able to access more damage than ever the actual value of a vanilla is worse by comparison overall the meta is just awful for it and the cards arent there anymore which is a shame because handlock was always more interesting than zoo but they chose to promote zoo and kill handlock
hearthstone,not_removed,meta too aggro reno is the only heal that warlock can access so either reno or no control at all
hearthstone,not_removed,ive seen variants of renohandlock but if you consider that renolock then i guess theres that pure handlock without reno has been well and truly killed with the molten giant nerf i mean why would you even want to try to keep your hp anymore if not for the molten giants if you just mean keeping large hands and getting out some power stuff like the mountain giants taunting them up ect then thats kinda what renolock does anyway so its not much different if you want to go middleground i think theres some kinda renodragonlock hovering around with alex twilight drakes azure drakes ect to slow aggro down not sure how good it actually is though
hearthstone,not_removed,renolock is better and moltens dont exist anymore
hearthstone,not_removed,no healing also no moltens
hearthstone,not_removed,it is possible to reach legend with midrange hunter tho with a reasonable amount of effort but yes the deck is good let me say it like this there is no effort winrate deck or anything crazy like that the only thing it takes to reach legend is a certain amount of skill and tons of time and thats where the problem lies for many people they just dont have time for games a month
hearthstone,not_removed,play midrange or aggro shaman theyre pretty brain dead decks i played against a midrange shaman earlier who made one of the most bonehead misplays i think ive ever seen in hearthstone and he still absolutely steamrolled me i myself tried out the aggro shaman deck just to see how broken it was and i won games doing minimal trades and just hitting face before i finally lost
hearthstone,not_removed,yes i played every deck from control warrior to midrange shaman and hunter i was just goofing around with my hybrid hunter and got to legend today albeit i only need wins but its possible hunter counters control warrior and mid range shaman if they dont have their aoe because of all the sticky minions such as kg wolf and highmane
hearthstone,not_removed,with a little luck secret hunter or hybrid hunter should be easy for rank
hearthstone,not_removed,but i dont have bloodmage thalnos for it and shaman get a big nerf soon so i dont want to focus on shaman deck i was thinking of crafting a murloc pally deck after nerfs
hearthstone,not_removed,if you wanna make meme decks to joke around with friends keep it otherwise de it and make ragnaros or sylvanas to get profit
hearthstone,not_removed,it is a free legendary of your choice dust that shit
hearthstone,not_removed,what if i already have both of them
hearthstone,not_removed,make golden ones
hearthstone,not_removed,wrong if he already has regular versions of any cards rotating out making them golden will not give him more dust the only exception is golden commons which will give dust more than regular commons
hearthstone,not_removed,yes it will hell get dust from disenchanting each nongolden copy
hearthstone,not_removed,the math has been done a thousand times in other threads so im not gonna copy it here crafting a golden ragsylv doesnt give you any extra dust if you already have normals but does give you a discount on the goldens if you actually want them instead of the norms
hearthstone,not_removed,heres the math assuming you have a regular legendary refund from having regular legendary disenchant value of regular legendary dust crafting golden legendary when you have the regular legendary crafting golden legendary refund from having golden legendary from disenchanting golden legendary for disenchanting regular legendary dust crafting golden legendary to keep disenchanting regular legendary crafting golden legendary refund from having golden legendary for disenchanting regular legendary dust note loss of dust potential but option to disenchant anytime later some consider it a dust loss since by crafting the golden version of legendary you arent getting the dust refund for the regular legendary
hearthstone,not_removed,mulligan into force tank and alexstraza i can see it already
hearthstone,not_removed,do you want me to wash you while youre in bath because ill fucking drown you for playing midrange shaman in arena jebaited
hearthstone,not_removed,are you sure thats arena
hearthstone,not_removed,the beautiful thing was that that happened but i was still ok this deck was so high in value you can miss a turn and still outtempo your opponent with aoe or hex
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean those two one drops force the only viable control decks to run hp heals were fine with aggro we just dont like it when the entire game is warped around it
hearthstone,not_removed,because its fun to pretend you know anything about what makes this game fun to play and jerk off each other to collect internet points by typing random buzzwords
hearthstone,not_removed,because they want to run the most greedy control decks in the world so they consider even something remotely aggresive like dragon warrior or dragon priest an aggro deck so they hate every deck that is not control warrior
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont have a problem with agro decks in theory its just that the ones in this meta are particularly frustrating to fight against pirate warrior can make a giant weapon and theres literally one card in the entire game that can destroy it its a really terrible feeling when they go buccaneer patches fwe bloodsail cultist and you know the game is already over shaman agro and midrange shaman i dont really mind as much at least they play a little bit slower so you can interact with their minions its just that giving a weapon is incredibly overpowered and i feel like it should not be a thing in this game
hearthstone,not_removed,its pretty simple really losing to aggro by turn or makes me feel stupid it makes me feel like a sucker who has been mugged it is the only type of loss that makes me feel angry any slower loss is okay because i feel like ive been in a contest and lost to a combination of luck and skill
hearthstone,not_removed,the main reason why people dislike aggro decks is that the result is very binary you either have the right answers when you need them and stabilize or you dont and get overrun with nothing you can do neither is particularly fun in other matchups there is some level of counter play eg against combo decks you can try take the board and beat them down before they can burn you from hp or you can contest the board against tempo decks by playing on curve and saving removal for highthreat minions against aggro its just do you have a boardclearooze heals by turn if yes win the game if no lose the game
hearthstone,not_removed,this game isnt set up to properly handle aggro is the issue the game is set up to play on curve and aggro decks bypass that so its basically a coin flip you must curve out very well to beat an aggro deck or youll get run over by turn it comes down to the game giving you the cards you need instead of skill there is time for a bad drawhand because one bad turn and the game is already over their work around is to create a card like reno that can full heal you instead of actually tackling the design issue
hearthstone,not_removed,this varies on class and hunter has no good draw mechanics mainly because if you give a hunter reliable draw he just starts balling on everyone
hearthstone,not_removed,loot hoarder and azure drake are pretty good neutral cycle cards if you play certain classes like mage warrior or paladin then acolyte of pain should also be a decent option otherwise consider these cards for the following classes druid nourish wrath hunter tracking kings elekk mage arcane intellect paladin divine favor works best in aggressive decks priest power word shield thoughtsteal rogue sprint fan of knives shaman mana tide totem warrior slam shield block warlock obviously has their hero power as the main source of card draw
hearthstone,not_removed,what class are you playing that makes a difference
hearthstone,not_removed,is a rare but one of the most used minions
hearthstone,not_removed,i see i was using the hunter today started off with wins them lost times in a row really beat down my confidence
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you so much for the list ill definitely check out these cards
hearthstone,not_removed,i play whatever class has the daily bonus atm but i like the hunter and druid the most i think
hearthstone,not_removed,neutral minion rare classic 🐙 httpwwwhearthheadcomcardsazuredrake httphearthstonegamepediacomazuredrake mana dragon spell damage battlecry draw a card callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to for more pm
hearthstone,not_removed,that card sounds epic i definitely need to check it out
hearthstone,not_removed,really the only viable draw engines only really work in arenas and in wild and then only situationally in wild heres a few to consider trying out they dont all work some can even hurt you more then help you but these are you best options mass cycle via discovers and single card draws such as quick shot azure drake kings elekk webspinner w jeweled scarab tomb spider lock and load cult master unleash the hounds this is a very weak tempo play but it can let you power draw lots of cards curator draws you three one time but your a hunter drawing beasts and dragons and murlocs can be done if your willing to run against the grain this supplemented by other draws means you can make the distance harrison jones lets you draw a bunch of cards against weapon oriented classes more durability the enemy weapon more cards you get unleash infest or draw all the random beasts not always consistently done and rarely will you get draws genzo the sharkjeevesw this one is a bit unusual but hunters tend to burn their hand quickly and other classes typically focus on maintaining a hand size genzo and jeeves normally draw for both players but if their over cards you will only draw instead this makes jeeves and genzo the shark usually work out well for a hunter where other classes wont this being said the later they come to action the more likely this isnt the case hunters really dont good draw most of these answers revolve around neutral draw engines and neutrals tend to suck and those that dont suck tend to not function well enough for hunter to use them every one of them come with caveats except for maybe azure drake and tomb spiderjewled scarabgrimestreet lookout
hearthstone,not_removed,made you a pretty solid list i see ill just mention hunter is going to be a bit tough in the meta right now because it does have that draw problem druid is a better bet for moving up the ladder and you should be able to make a decent budget jade druid deck id think
hearthstone,not_removed,its easily one of the most used cards across all decks its one youll never regret having for sure
hearthstone,not_removed,holy crap i got some studying tobdo
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks so much i was afraid to ask the community but it seems great so far i only play it on my phone i hope that doesnt make too much of a difference
hearthstone,not_removed,cant wait to get it
hearthstone,not_removed,it wont make a difference in terms of the game itself but there are some really great deck trackers you can download for desktop that can help you figure out whats left in your deck as youre playing or what secrets your opponent might have used or how buffed your cthun is a lot of different things so that might be a reason to play on pc sometimes
hearthstone,not_removed,when you disenchant your first card you are rewarded with free dust disenchanting a common gives you dust azure drake costs dust its a pretty decent first craft for new players
hearthstone,not_removed,damn i already did my first and crafted random cards
hearthstone,not_removed,some cards are great but still need to rotate out meta is constantly evolving
hearthstone,not_removed,just play wild
hearthstone,not_removed,just play wild if you want to play with them
hearthstone,not_removed,i was kinda hoping for the quests to be like that except you only pick one faction and you get their legendary some packs as a reward for joining them
hearthstone,not_removed,i like this it gives you an incentive to play each faction i think they should start off with one or two packs to get those faction cards though
hearthstone,not_removed,you forgot the other quests
hearthstone,not_removed,this quests overcome quests that you have right all
hearthstone,not_removed,okay i wont upvote i will downvote this trash comment if they were going to remove the other two quests once you completed one there would be literally no reason for them to do it at all because all the rewards are the same the only reason they will remove the other two would be if they get replaced by bigger quests win more games with x faction to gain even more packs x being whichever faction you chose to do the first quest with
hearthstone,not_removed,you can attack malganis immune taunt means the taunt is gone
hearthstone,not_removed,you can see that youre able to attack the two enemy minions because of the golden border characters cant have immunestealth and taunt at the same time so when they do they just dont have taunt anymore
hearthstone,not_removed,unless you got removal pretty much
hearthstone,not_removed,you cant as a canadian tho what i do to avoid paying usd for my packs is buying on an android device vs pc for example if i bought my pre purchase for ungoro on my phone i pay cad but on pc its usd hope this helped
hearthstone,not_removed,that should work with an android emulator then right
hearthstone,not_removed,correct but idk if id be comfortable putting my account info into an emulator but then again i dont have much experience with them
hearthstone,not_removed,but yes it will work
hearthstone,not_removed,i just did a video series on climbing the ladder starting with a completely basic deck i managed to go from rank to this season very quickly and easily using it i recorded all the games and commentate on the thought process around playing here is a link to the playlist it might be discouraging to feel like you are losing because of your small collection but i promise with some work you can improve and climb despite it good luck on the ladder
hearthstone,not_removed,first off someone from blizzard explained the matchmaking casual and legend play are determined by an elosystem kinda like in lol chess or go whilst in regular ranked only the current rank countsthats how sometimes at the start of a season youll be matched with regular legend players that just so happen to be not further up the ladder right now its a known issue and we all hope and think that blizz will change it this year next up to me as a card game veteran getting all the cards is part of the fun of course it is frustrating for a new player to not be able to use all those shiny legendaries but at the same time i think that a lot of people out there starting with the game dont immediatly wanna play meta decks nor even think about a meta until a certain point until they get crushed by much better netdecks to me one of the greatest moments in hearthstone was getting my first legendary and putting it in every deck etc and the problem with that is that youll still lose to everything i really understand your complaints but i dont think thats because hearthstone is it has never been easier to get packs for free but more because the matchmaking allows for the newbie vs legend match
hearthstone,not_removed,a cthun druid evolved some doppelgangsters nice try also youre complaining that a game based on your collection of cards is unfair because people can pay for a better collection thats how life works those that can or will pay get a boost if youre really tired of not having even ground to play on why not play in arena in arena you get offered random cards the same as everyone else by the way in order to make a cthun druid list you only need to open like packs of whispers of the old gods you too can evolve your doppelgangsters you get enough free packs from the start to do that if you want sorry but you really have nothing to complain about with that yes youll gain stuff from paying no its not fair thats the point thats how they get you to pay
hearthstone,not_removed,you cant expect much from a pay to win game imo
hearthstone,not_removed,none of the games here were newbie v legend though they were newbie v shit deck x
hearthstone,not_removed,im not making stuff up i could be mixing stuff up but not making it up maybe the hunter was the one who upgraded the three doppleganagers into a big meaty board of win even though i managed to beat him but again it was a mixup not a lie secondly arena is something ive been contemplating but again you have to pay to play that game mode even still ive been considering give it a few tries what do you mean enough free packs from the start as far as i am aware they do not give away any free packs other than classic i think the welcome pack may have had some msog packs but no old gods packs for sure not complaining and never said paying and having better cards isnt fair just saying they can enhance the player experience of those who cant or in my case do not want too buy a lot of packs if they enhance the experience with these changes that do not affect players who play at higher ranks and spend a lot of money then the more players like myself would have a lot more fun and more importantly would probably spend more money i know i would
hearthstone,not_removed,as a player i honestly dont see how its pay to win you can pay to skip some grind but the level of grind is very reasonable imo
hearthstone,not_removed,newbie vs shit deck first off while im not a pro by any means im not a noob secondly those decks werent shit decks maybe not tier meta decks but cthun druid that hunter deck and the evolve tunnel trogg deck are a lot to deal with when your basically playing with classic only cards say what you want premium quality cards make a considerable difference when your up against op cards and you dont have op cards you have to hope that player is either really bad or just misplays at all the right times
hearthstone,not_removed,evolve is a shaman card if youve been playing since launch you should have seen the free packs given when whispers of the old gods was realeased it was for a while there were also and might still be free msg packs of them arena costs money to enter because you get rewarded well for playing
hearthstone,not_removed,i disagree a wee bit on the level of grind the thing about it is you have to win to get gold its harder to win when your playing with only basic cards or havent opened a lot of packs not impossible but a lot more difficult to win say games a day and do the daily quest your still not at enough gold to buy pack the pity timer on legendary cards is packs grinding like this would take months to even start gathering a decent collection months of playing every day and winning games a day
hearthstone,not_removed,you are right that evolve didnt happen in either of the two matches i won that match was before it and i didnt win that one i conceded it after i had no answers in my hand or deck left for that evolve i was playing warlock
hearthstone,not_removed,blizzard added tons of new quests so you no longer have to win to get gold just sometimes
hearthstone,not_removed,also it wasnt uncommon for me to take breaks of months maybe more i didnt get any free old gods pack but now that you mention it i did get the free msog packs and got absolutely crappo worth having from them
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you so much
hearthstone,not_removed,summon elemental get a mana pyroblast
hearthstone,not_removed,i hope not i hope that the legendary minion and the quest push different archetypes so i dont feel so much like my deck is being made for me and i dont feel like i need both legendaries to make a viable deck
hearthstone,not_removed,i reckon the reward for whatever the quest is is going to be something to do with spell damage id like to think its going to be a passive ie all spells cast have spell damage or something along those lines but it might just be a smaller malygos deal
hearthstone,not_removed,i agree judging from the nerf and their own comment on how lowcosthighdmg spells limit design space regarding fluctuations in spellpower the new quest almost certainly will have something to do with spellpower be it casting spells to complete it or getting a reward that boosts it also summoning elementals will most likely be a shaman quest it would fit the flavor of the class much better

hearthstone,not_removed,if you see a lot of warriors you can tech in ooze would be overkill and would probably gimp your deck more than it has value
hearthstone,not_removed,techs like ooze are really a personal preference if you feel you are losing to the tempo gain the weapon is giving the warrior add it in but its also important to remember that there are higher quality cards you could put into the deck other than ooze which will help you game against a zoo mirror the occasional mage or yogg hunter
hearthstone,not_removed,is good to tech in on euw the meta is mostly midrange hunteraggro shami or warri in a lot of kinds especially vs shami matchups weapon removal is vital just do games and if more then are weapon matchups tech it in is my suggestion
hearthstone,not_removed,as of tomorrow youll be facing a ton of people playing the new medivh card with his summoning stone weapon so ill be putting ooze in many of my decks at least for a week or two
hearthstone,not_removed,give it a try and come back to us and tell us what you learned
hearthstone,not_removed,to be honest when playing zoo i rarely find myself in positions where id feel amazing about dropping an ooze on or mostly just to eat a fwa with charge youre much better off playing awkward sticky minions deathrattles into fwa than overteching for warrior on the whole besides its brawl that wrecks you big time deathrattles help with that not weapon removal
hearthstone,not_removed,i added one ooze against gorehowlfwa and doomhammer and it worked pretty well so far even if you are not using the bc it is still a good card btw i also added an alchemist against doomsayer which won me a couple of games
hearthstone,not_removed,if you are tanking that much against warriors id say throw in an ooze or two blood sail isnt good against warrior though since it does to easily to a lot is a dead card against non weapon classes and will often serve as an activator for acolyte
hearthstone,not_removed,i played with it a bit couldnt really find a slot for the second one without gimping something else in the deck im not gonna say it never helped but it didnt really feel worth it after a while fwa alone is not losing you the warrior matchup its a combination of several cardsthing the warrior can do not to mention you often wont even draw it in an optimal spot additionally even if you get it on your opening hand the warrior has something like a chance going first to even get fwa i know feels like more after mulligan so a lot of stuff has to align also what if ooze is your only gonna skip turn with zoo against warrior
hearthstone,not_removed,hmmmm i dont know how about you put it in and see for yourself if its working for you how about that blood sail corsair
hearthstone,not_removed,oh wait what about blood sail corsair over some other drop in my last games im against warriors
hearthstone,not_removed,oh wait what about blood sail corsair over some other drop in my last games im against warriors
hearthstone,not_removed,i really do doubt there will be much medivh being played he doesnt fit into any decks out currently and is waaaaay too slow and with all the tempoaggro bs running around you will be dead or lose enough tempo that you will die if you ever play him
hearthstone,not_removed,oh wait what about blood sail corsair over some other drop in my last games im against warriors
hearthstone,not_removed,its actually on the coin and going first if you purely mulligan for axe
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe ill just play two of my one drops instead
hearthstone,not_removed,the bloodsail corsair is a bad card and its only real value is when you can pick it off peddler on a perfect moment i would never include it in my deck by default especially not over ooze ooze can trade with some and even drops
hearthstone,not_removed,bad statline doesnt trade into anything much with ooze could trade up to a potential eg krokon elite corsair removes dura while ooze destroys it doomhammer wouldnt notice a diff with dura
hearthstone,not_removed,people are still going to be trying him i imagine were going to see a lot of people trying control priest and mage using medivh for the first two weeks or so
hearthstone,not_removed,alright thanks for the info
hearthstone,not_removed,no its not most cthun decks have other legendaries with it to like elise yogg nzoth justicar sylvanns its just becasue priest sucks
hearthstone,not_removed,you dont need all cthun cards to make a good cthun deck i only run the two drops the damage battlecries the divine shield one and doomcaller for a second cthun and to delay fatigue then i have two heals and twin emps i combo things with brann to make cthun bigger but even if not an is good enough the rest of your deck can be built around what you need a northshire cleric here an entomb there a forbidden shaping up here ive gotten to rank this weekend with just those cthun cards control the board get in some face damage you shouldnt need cthun but hes a good finisher or board clear if you fall behind
hearthstone,not_removed,in my mind the reason nzoths first mate has the higher percentage is because it guarantees you a weapon the deck really struggles when you dont have a weapon small time buccaneer and a weapon are still the decks nut draws that soul crush your opponent and lead to free and easy wins a turn nzoths first mate against reno mage just does so little in comparison to a stb followed by a war axe into cultist draw for example
hearthstone,not_removed,the reason turn nzoths first mate is better is because you can kill the enemy stb
hearthstone,not_removed,i think i have to agree the only reason pirate warrior wasnt everywhere was because of aggro shaman even reno decks cant really deal with pirate warrior
hearthstone,not_removed,while i dont think pirate warrior will win more i do think that people are over selling the affect this nerf will have classes that reliably can do one damage are better off rogue druid mage but theyre spending mana and usually taking damage to deal with mana in the early game thats a full turns worth of effort classes that have cheap aoe such as rogue with fan if knives and midrange shaman with maelstrom portal will see a tangible benefit from the nerf as well everyone else is basically exactly where they were before that in combination with as op states aggro shaman being seriously affected the weapon hit is just too much in combination with the other nerf means that pirate warrior will very likely remain a popular deck imo
hearthstone,not_removed,things stb dies to on turn now compared to before literally everything the odds of stb getting attacks in with toughness goes down drastically
hearthstone,not_removed,you dont think blizzard would have playtested the deck even a single time to see if it got stronger or not
hearthstone,not_removed,there are still strong lines of play against slow decks such as nfm bloodsail raider bloodsail cultist
hearthstone,not_removed,valid point but nfm still sets up for both pirate and weapon synergy on the following turns
hearthstone,not_removed,i hope this ultimately proves to be the lesser of two evils we will see
hearthstone,not_removed,mana is still a lot to deal with a mana minion even if it uses a hero power instead of a card i think the broad assumption that pirate warrior is wholly dependent on snowballing stb will find themselves in for a surprise
hearthstone,not_removed,the point of the post is that i dont think the deck is as dependent on a runaway stb as people might think
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe my title was worded incorrectly the deck obviously does not become more powerful by nerfing its components but it can become better positioned by removing its strongest competition in the meta
hearthstone,not_removed,the fact that mages will waste turn two to kill stb is good warrior can keep developing with less agro it will be more difficult to tech against it
hearthstone,not_removed,agreed
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean itd probably be a safe bet to see what the meta is like after ungoro comes out we havent even seen all of the cards yet and there is bound to be some power shakeups in the classes when new cards are available quests and other new mechanics can create new deck archetypes which might trump older and traditionally powerful decks both the wild and standard metas will definitely alter next week after release and that gives a golden season of trying out new homebrewed decks before the scourge netdecked meta solidifies
hearthstone,not_removed,im not a fan of jade either but what ive come to realize is after other long running games as well is you just have to appreciate that you got to journey through those deckscards while they had their place theres always gonna be new mechanics new twists that may overshadow old ones personally im excited about quests and seeing how they will integrate into wild
hearthstone,not_removed,this is such bs lol no way do the msg decks invalidate every other deck i got to rank from using anyfin without dropping a single game also i really suspect your skill level when you say every druid is jade lmao nearly every druid in wild in playing egg druid
hearthstone,not_removed,and that gives a golden week of trying out new homebrewed decks fixed that for ya
hearthstone,not_removed,in eternal formats once the power level goes up its not possible to bring it down without heavy bannings they can print more stuff to counter pirate jade kazakus but unless its format warping and raises the bar higher it wont have much of an effect on wild the sad thing is the damage has been done the old decks have a very little chance of coming back especially control
hearthstone,not_removed,why dont you try posting this in their sub since this doesnt really have anything to do with hearthstone also how often do you type ass that your phone autocorrects to it
hearthstone,not_removed,ok
hearthstone,not_removed,those damn boom bots just grind my gears wait you say its not anymore you say there have been less and less high variance rng cards coming out oh right
hearthstone,not_removed,and your post is not cancer
hearthstone,not_removed,hey there unfortunately your submission has been removed because it is low effort content see httpswwwredditcomrhearthstonewikiloweffortcontent for clarification on what is considered low effort content if youre not familiar with the subreddit rules you can read them httpswwwredditcomrhearthstoneaboutrulesrules have a question or think your post doesnt break the rules
hearthstone,not_removed,preach
hearthstone,not_removed,yep
hearthstone,not_removed,i put a lot of effort into that
hearthstone,not_removed,its a super solid deck matey congrats but you still had to pilot it to those wins congrats
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks man
hearthstone,not_removed,wasnt me but that sounds painful i wouldve been so tilted
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel it ive had too many moments like that haha
hearthstone,not_removed,execute in the hands of a mage hero powerexecute means you can destroy any minion for mana
hearthstone,not_removed,forbidden healing in priest
hearthstone,not_removed,equality in basically every class possibly mage being the strongest as they have more aoes than most other classes a flamecaller would at least leave you with a
hearthstone,not_removed,innervate in any class tempo just wet themselves
hearthstone,not_removed,embrace the shadow in paladindruid paladin because of forbidden healing and druid because of healing touch and tree of life
hearthstone,not_removed,savage roar would be absolutely disgusting in warlock
hearthstone,not_removed,deadly shot in warrior for a card twisting nether when combined with brawl bolster would be insane in a midrangecontrol shaman with thing from below taunt totem and feral spirits
hearthstone,not_removed,any minion for mana tirion disagrees
hearthstone,not_removed,tree of life doesnt actually work how you probably hope with soulpriest or embrace i got the combo while i was at health once and my opponent was at and it ended up dealing damage to both our faces resulting in a draw
hearthstone,not_removed,i know but its great to not lose
hearthstone,not_removed,that sounds exactly like how it should work what other way is there
hearthstone,not_removed,it says restore all characters to full health which could be interpreted as heal for however much hp would bring you to full
hearthstone,not_removed,huh never considered that that makes sense yeah
hearthstone,not_removed,it depends when you do that from your timezone and when new quests apper for example for me in europe server new quest appears at my local time new quest can be changed from local time so if i press x to get new one from it will disapier if after it will give me new quest
hearthstone,not_removed,you should have restarted the client long time ago remember each turn is a maximum of seconds long so if a turn lasts more than that something went wrong and you should restart your client as soon as possible to avoid skipping your turns its a bug

hearthstone,not_removed,no
hearthstone,not_removed,no other quest reward minion has the quest reward type on the card so id assume this isnt real
hearthstone,not_removed,card is called kalec instead of his real full name kalecgos confirmed fake also why would kalecgos have atiesh khadgar has that thing not the blue dragon aspect if anything his hero power should have just been a static effect granting you spell power since he is literally the new malygos

hearthstone,not_removed,runic egg was actually really good too i either always had a buff for it or the enemy traded into it themselves
hearthstone,not_removed,obviously it depends what rank you are but everyone is tryharding on the last day
hearthstone,not_removed,some people try more some people try less i would say in general its trying harder
hearthstone,not_removed,nice editing tbh and youre entertaining enough but youre not going to get many people watching rank with mostly classic and basic cards keep workin tho
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks man appreciate the comments i am playing a free to play account and dont have all the cards yet also keeping away from meta decks more enjoyable for me
hearthstone,not_removed,arena is a fickle beast to be sure gratz on conquering it
hearthstone,not_removed,whenever i see a run thread the curve of the deck is always middle finger
hearthstone,not_removed,paladins especially so many good cards at mana
hearthstone,not_removed,team released quoted saying they dont look at the decks in any way for the match ups that said im not sure i believe them because i played or so games straight with an anti agro deck and didnt get one aggro game i knew as soon as i switched it would be aggro so i kept with it dropped all the way from or to because of my stubbornness
hearthstone,not_removed,confirmation bias detected
hearthstone,not_removed,i thought i was the only one who had this
hearthstone,not_removed,you forgot about wisps and a mana spell
hearthstone,not_removed,wisp triple power word shield inner fire
hearthstone,not_removed,i stated that outside buffs werent counted
hearthstone,not_removed,fixed
hearthstone,not_removed,thats mana
hearthstone,not_removed,druid of the fang in lul
hearthstone,not_removed,wisp yogg saron with thaurissan ticks into triple power word shield and inner fire then theres also mounted raptor into kvaldir a edit and the that summons a a wisp
hearthstone,not_removed,take out yshaaraj its not only slow but doesnt fit with your deck having only other mana drop
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think you have enough threats add rag malkorok varian sylvanas grom and geddon
hearthstone,not_removed,id cut the yshaarj rampage and gurubashi berserker and put in another armoursmith and an arathi weaponsmith if youre looking to make a tempo warrior deck and cant afford any of the big cards dragon warrior is very similar and way cheaper especially since you already have grom id look into that if i were you since its a very good deck
hearthstone,not_removed,im of the opinion that if you cant play the properly built version of a deck in this case either tempo or control you shouldnt try to play a bad version of it so if you dont plan to craft the cards necessary for either tempo or control id recommend a different deck that you can afford to build properly
hearthstone,not_removed,lol k done
hearthstone,not_removed,will do thank you
hearthstone,not_removed,but its win rate as is is over
hearthstone,not_removed,that dragon warrior deck is pretty cheap and it looks fun maybe give that a shot
hearthstone,not_removed,then why are you looking for help
hearthstone,not_removed,doing this now
hearthstone,not_removed,cause theres more experienced players than me and they have helpful advice
hearthstone,not_removed,oh ok just get rag sylvanas thalnos malkorok varian and alex
hearthstone,not_removed,sounds simple enough
hearthstone,not_removed,punished for missing one damage
hearthstone,not_removed,well he is hopes end upupupu
hearthstone,not_removed,rngesus who art in hearthstone random be thy game thy random come thy turn be done on azeroth as it is in hearthstone give us this day our daily quest and forgive us our misplays as we forgive those who queue as hunter and lead us not into fatigue but deliver us from zero for thine is the random and the mulligan and the topdeck always yet never ameno﻿
hearthstone,not_removed,if there was a time that i could understand why reynad hates this gameid just turn on his stream but like especially this though
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think you have the right to complain when playing yogg its an all in so be prepared to lose badly
hearthstone,not_removed,if you play yogg you accept this may happen
hearthstone,not_removed,praise yogg
hearthstone,not_removed,honestly this is how i view yogg when an opponent uses it i am full on board i have hp and i have been winning since turn heshe has no minions with hp and has been top decking all game then heshe casts yogg yogg heals himher for fully clears the board sets a secret christmas tree draw until heshe has cards and to top it off casts call of the wild when i use it pyroblast to face
hearthstone,not_removed,strange never heard raynad complain about anything before
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont watch streamers often but i just so happened to catch reynad tonight and wow talk about an incredibly unlucky streak it wasnt even just this game either it started with a druid that had probably the most perfect opener you could ask for there was also a game where a mage topdecked firelands portal for exact lethal
hearthstone,not_removed,i know he wouldve won if he didnt miss that one damage but the sheer amount of bad rng he had to get to even be in that position was disguisting you could probably make a bad luck compilation out of the last hour alone this was just the cherry on top at this point i just felt bad for him
hearthstone,not_removed,quick reminder this is an esport
hearthstone,not_removed,does anyone have a youtube vod the clip isnt working for me for some reason
hearthstone,not_removed,praise yogg
hearthstone,not_removed,playing yogg with only one other minion on the board when both players are at neardeath health is as close to a coinflip as yogg gets its not like he was at life and he still managed to kill himself there are tons of ways he could have died here at life and frozen and those are just as likely to happen to him as his opponent there are also tons of ways in which nothing meaningful would happen and he would be dead next turn anyway
hearthstone,not_removed,why does he play rng cards if he gets so damned salty
hearthstone,not_removed,its been a long time since i laughed so hard at the absurdity of rng in hearthstone i want to thank reynad for reminding me to take hearthstone less seriously and to enjoy the amazing ways you can win and lose games you too can have yogg pyro you in the face only dust golden
hearthstone,not_removed,reynads saltiness always makes me chuckle
hearthstone,not_removed,i was feeling so bad about my rng today somehow im feeling much better now thanks noodle
hearthstone,not_removed,i like reynads stream a lot hes great at the game and its cool to watch someone that good at it but he just complains so fucking much when he is losing its hard to watch him when hes on a bit of a losing streak because he is the type of person to blame most of his losses on bad luck and wins on his skill kripp is pretty guilty of this as well new favorite streamer is kibbler cause the guy just always has fun playing
hearthstone,not_removed,ive heard legends of this event but i never knew it was true
hearthstone,not_removed,when you use yogg that mean you already lost the game and you are hoping hell save your ass you have no right to be salty when your yogg kills you or put you in an even worst spot a good yogg there wouldve been unfair for the mage since has won and left him with no other choice but play the yogg that he say hates and rants about all the time
hearthstone,not_removed,saw this live knew he lost when we saw who he was playing against
hearthstone,not_removed,if it hit his enemy he would have been fine with it rey rng is fine as long as its in my favor nad
hearthstone,not_removed,that is my typical yogg experience i had one game where i played it three times in a row each turn it would progressively do worse and worse things to me finally my opponent played yogg it promptly lava bursted me twice filled his board with minions and pyro blasted my face for their win i just dont play decks with yogg anymore that being said its the number one way i lose games hearthstone has become control board weave in face damage fatigue opponents hand and lose to yogg id rather face only shamans and midrange hunters if i can just never play against a yogg deck again i am counting the days for it to be rotated out
hearthstone,not_removed,anyone know what song that is in the background
hearthstone,not_removed,i understand that at some point noodle was super into the game and was very good at it but i started watching him about months ago so last nights stream was so weird to me noodle nearly legend with a imo super shitty deck making very good lines of play i shouldnt be surprised but it was nice to see
hearthstone,not_removed,given that there are no minions on the board does anyone know what the chance is that yogg casts a damaging spell on your own hero just curious
hearthstone,not_removed,he was avoiding playing yogg of course yogg would punish him for that
hearthstone,not_removed,that clip gave me hypertension
hearthstone,not_removed,gg yogg gg
hearthstone,not_removed,i was once playing tempo mage and i had gotten an ice block out of a cabalists decided to use ice block to gain turn in hopes of getting a board clear but nope so he took my ice block out i survived with hp threw yogg out and first thing he does is forgotten torch to my face i logged out afterwards
hearthstone,not_removed,i play a lot of yogg and it seems to be either completely in my favor or completely in the other persons favor theres rarely any middle ground thats why its so fun
hearthstone,not_removed,my god why would he play that card he knows no good can come of it with his luck
hearthstone,not_removed,beaten by a frog
hearthstone,not_removed,all hail yogg praise yogg next time sacrifice more goats to yogg
hearthstone,not_removed,the price of trying in hearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,mistake gets punished one time
hearthstone,not_removed,makes sense
hearthstone,not_removed,only reynad can manage that level of bad luck
hearthstone,not_removed,ahhh what a salty cunt
hearthstone,not_removed,lul even someone in the chat called out exactly what would happen spell cast by yogg will be pyroblast in his own face
hearthstone,not_removed,by playing yogg later you dont make it less rng yogg often draws you card so you must have more luck to get good outcome when you play it late
hearthstone,not_removed,where were you when reynad was kill feelsbadman
hearthstone,not_removed,feelsgoodman i was there feelsgoodman
hearthstone,not_removed,feelsgoodman i was there feelsgoodman
hearthstone,not_removed,it wont matter
hearthstone,not_removed,damn i forgot about that one damage he missed poor guy it just seems like everything that can go wrong lately has went wrong for him though im kinda surprised he didnt just pulled a reckful and uninstalled after that
hearthstone,not_removed,someone even called out in chat saying his yogg would pyro him in the face two turns before
hearthstone,not_removed,did he not watch those kripp videos
hearthstone,not_removed,holy shit i forgot about that
hearthstone,not_removed,for sure
hearthstone,not_removed,he should have listened to cho in the tutorial
hearthstone,not_removed,missing that one meant that he dealt damage right yeah for sure
hearthstone,not_removed,didnt expect to find monokuma here
hearthstone,not_removed,feel the despair
hearthstone,not_removed,fucking
hearthstone,not_removed,id like to buy ten shares of this meme while its still hot please
hearthstone,not_removed,as a former catholic i appreciate this blasphemy sinner
hearthstone,not_removed,our pasta who arghh in heaven swallowed be thy shame thy midgit come thy sauce be yum on top some grated parmesan give us this day our garlic bread and give us our cutlasses as we swashbuckle splice the mainbrace and cuss and lead us into temptation but deliver us some pizza for thine are meatballs and the beer and the strippers for ever and ever ramen
hearthstone,not_removed,shuntershaman
hearthstone,not_removed,he hates it because he plays more than what would be enjoyable he makes money off it its a job
hearthstone,not_removed,except for two things he was the one that missed the damage that would have been lethal and he played a card that he knows has almost as much of a chance to kill him as his enemy this loss was his own fault
hearthstone,not_removed,right hes just sooooo unlucky for getting killed with health by his lastresort yogg that never happens to anyone else
hearthstone,not_removed,httpgifrificcomwoodyharrelsonwipinghistearswithmoney
hearthstone,not_removed,its not an all in its a panic button
hearthstone,not_removed,yogg killing you is really rare id say on average he does like damage to my face whenever i play him thats with spells every time over a couple hundred games hes card draw and a possible board clear similar to
hearthstone,not_removed,if youre a pro player playing yogg isnt really a choice you have to play the meta decks whatever they are edit for clarification i mean that whether to run yogg isnt a choice because what they play is dictated by the meta not that pros shouldnt play yogg in this case yogg druid is a tier deck so reynad has to play it
hearthstone,not_removed,personally if you want to fill the mana spot as mage might as well play pyroblast as a finisher imo
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont get why someone would downvote you yogg is technically random there is no way to modify the outcome if you play yogg you know what youre doing i found it in a pack recently but theres no way im going to play it more than once or twice for giggles yogg dust if you dont love randomness
hearthstone,not_removed,anyogg can happen
hearthstone,not_removed,yesterday my yogg casted purify into himself when i didnt have any cards card for exact lethal
hearthstone,not_removed,first and foremost fuck you confirmation bias people i have had yogg played against me at least it is likely closer to i have never played yogg myself because my rng is awful on all fronts so yogg is an absolute no go in almost yoggs faced i have never had my opponent cast astral communion not even once
hearthstone,not_removed,the worst part about that one was that the mage played babbling book at max mana but then did nothing but ping reynad down to exactly health leading him to believe it was pyroblast so reynad hero powers to gain one and not die to pyro instead of setting up a turn lethal then the mage topdecks spell damage plays a dragon breath from the book then draws portal next turn for exact it was so hard to watch
hearthstone,not_removed,that druids draw was absolutely perfect i think every card he had in hand played perfectly on curve even after the insane removal turn from reynad
hearthstone,not_removed,can you explain the back story to this dmg meme please
hearthstone,not_removed,only because people choose to make it one
hearthstone,not_removed,its mostly just a relaxing card game when hearthstone first came out there was no thought of it being an esport this is why to this day spectator mode barely works blizzard adding it to the wcs system is to promote the game and appease the people who want it to be competitive but they wont do it at the cost of fun for casual players and yogg is without a doubt the funnest card ever introduced to hearthstone if you want skilled play starcraft
hearthstone,not_removed,its a card game
hearthstone,not_removed,same here
hearthstone,not_removed,the clip is too short anyway there are people mentioning how reynad could have dealt damage more in previous turns i want to see it
hearthstone,not_removed,why do people use that twitch shit it has so many problems esp on mobile
hearthstone,not_removed,can you really make a competitive deck without any rng and if you do hes a streamer he cant just play the same deck on stream for all eternity thats why sometimes streamers just play bad decks because its entertaining
hearthstone,not_removed,didnt he get a doomsayer from his first ever silvermoon portal reynad is just neverlucky personified
hearthstone,not_removed,this i save my yoggs as a last resort do they have health minions and i only have fireballs or torches in my hand thats a yogging is it fair probably not does it entertain me absolutely thats why im playing hs in the first place
hearthstone,not_removed,i can tell youve never actually listened to him talk about rng
hearthstone,not_removed,its on the bottom right corner below the his decklist the fratellis ole black n blue eyes
hearthstone,not_removed,some say others say that there are studies that showed that yogg does his best to favor you making it more like but its honestly all rng
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah he basically hero power passed turns in a row before finally playing yogg
hearthstone,not_removed,drawing your cards is random what card your opponents draws is random that is much more rng then yogg
hearthstone,not_removed,does that distract you from the fact that ultimately your life is meaningless and anything you say or do is irrelevant to the outcome of the world and in years no one will mention or remember you
hearthstone,not_removed,why do people talk like this outside of twitch
hearthstone,not_removed,looking at this stream right now and he is really unlucky he was near top legend but now hes dwindling at
hearthstone,not_removed,im kinda surprised he didnt just pulled a reckful and uninstalled after that and then reinstall it an hour later wtf is the point of that besides becoming a meme
hearthstone,not_removed,he really should just start supporting other digital card games
hearthstone,not_removed,is that why reckful isnt playing hearthstone for the past few weeks i had no idea what happened
hearthstone,not_removed,theres always someone calling yogg suicide whenever yogg is in a deck
hearthstone,not_removed,fucking stream snipers
hearthstone,not_removed,to be fair everyone says that prior to yogg
hearthstone,not_removed,minute delay is strong
hearthstone,not_removed,yogg would be his favorite card i need a mod that playes one of his sound files while yogg fucks shit up
hearthstone,not_removed,this is onna dem classic maymays
hearthstone,not_removed,you never know what meme will cone through that door
hearthstone,not_removed,its not his main job though hes turned donations off completely in the last couple streams
hearthstone,not_removed,chances of yogg dealing damage to yourself rather than damage to your opponent are very low tho
hearthstone,not_removed,ive won multiple games from people having their yoggs backfire
hearthstone,not_removed,i hadnt played this month until last thursday and wanted to at least get a rank reward so i played yogg druid i only hit rank but honestly dont feel like yogg is just a panic button if i have another way to clear or a forsurebetter play sure but the vast majority of the time yogg is just card draw removal
hearthstone,not_removed,i call it last lifeline does it really matter what you call it how you look at it is your thing but he is right on that you should be prepared to lose badly
hearthstone,not_removed,yep if you want all in play deathwing
hearthstone,not_removed,yogg is a panic button it just happens to throw a firebomb straight down and hope they get burned worse
hearthstone,not_removed,im gonna quote ujeejeebaby because they said it perfectly yogg makes unwinnable games winnable again even with the meta decks there are some matchups that wont be in your favour either because your deck is weak against your opponents deck or you had bad luck with your card draws or your opponent had good luck with their card draws etc you can be the best player in the world and play your deck exactly right and still be put in a situation where your game is unwinnable yogg gives you the chance of fixing that of course it also gives you the chance of pyroblasting yourself in the face but if preplayingyogg you had a chance of winning and yogg gives you even a chance of winning youre still better off than you were without yogg
hearthstone,not_removed,yogg makes unwinnable games winnable again it has the ability to completely change any match pyro blast is great past turn when your opponent has or less hp
hearthstone,not_removed,over yogg no chance
hearthstone,not_removed,there are other factors to consider if you have a deck that naturally has a lot of spells runs out of cards frequently and has bad board clears its worth running since it almost always draws cards it usually clears the board if enough spells were cast and you dont have to restructure the deck to make it work token druid is the key example in faster matchups or when you have board control you just dont play it its kindof like death wing but with a greater chance of filling your hand instead of always emptying it its good to have a winlose button if the alternative is chance of loss thats how you play a game with rng you have to take chances im sure the statistics are slightly in your favor most of the time and not
hearthstone,not_removed,if you wanted to play in tournaments there are a lot of top decks that yogg is the right choice to run it isnt like the best players say well this deck could use some rng because why not its fine that yogg is yogg for the vast majority of players but it definitely sucks for the people playing at the highest level knowing that yogg can always rear his ugly head whether its because you need him in your deck to make it as good as possible or the other player will be running him it sucks for pros
hearthstone,not_removed,isnt it only dust
hearthstone,not_removed,thats grandmaster level yogg bm
hearthstone,not_removed,first and foremost fuck people like you who dont get sarcasm without an s mark
hearthstone,not_removed,but thats legit that other player bluffed the hell out of him thats just standard for tcgs high level play is calling the bluff correctly in mtg you might leave open mana to suggest you have a counter even if youre just holding a do nothing card
hearthstone,not_removed,its like i have confirmation bias for someone else its because he stresses it out every time it happens to him other streamers mostly brush it off so it doesnt create a confirmation bias for you
hearthstone,not_removed,he attacked a mirror image with hero power when he could have just killed it with his minion earlier in the game causing him to miss damage to face then he said something like oops missed damage it wont matter anyways
hearthstone,not_removed,he was running out of time trying to attack the mages face with his hero power but kept miss clicking his own minion to attack the taunt so he ended up clearing the taunt but not getting his damage in
hearthstone,not_removed,oh yeah its not like blizzard is hosting fucking tournaments right
hearthstone,not_removed,only because its a blizzard game
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah because randomly losing or winning is fun
hearthstone,not_removed,a childs card game
hearthstone,not_removed,why do people talk like this at all even in twitch is a better question
hearthstone,not_removed,i imagine its like when you watch a good movie and then for the next hour or so your inner monologue sounds like the characters from the movie like you watch a guy ritchie flick about gangsters in london and the rest of the night your brains all oi if any geezers take the piss outta me imma bash em proper good right op is probably a normal member of society but watching twitch for hours on end has turned his brain into pudding
hearthstone,not_removed,and now he just went to play league poor guy is tilted off the face of the earth
hearthstone,not_removed,define unlucky yogg rolled a pyroblast its basically win or lose at that point btw playing yogg in your deck you chose to roll the dice maybe you are talking about the whole stream but definitely not that game
hearthstone,not_removed,sounds more like tilt to me
hearthstone,not_removed,or maybe he made some mistakes that cost him wins such as you know missing damage early in a game and then having your opponent be at life later and still losing
hearthstone,not_removed,sounds like me i made a hunter deck with drops the highmanes yogg saron the arcane giants and call of the wild i dont even run any drops and have a shitload of earlygame i think i played games in a row yesterday and after the mulligan and draw my hand was mana only cards and i basicly started the game playing everything i topdeck until i eventually drew another bad card and just lost i went on and threw the whole deck against the wall and adjusted a shitload of it got rid of yogggiants and tried again with a selfmade variation of secrethunter and even lower curve i didnt draw a single secretkeeper ever and my kings elekk drew me the secretkeeper of the time losing me every single draw all while all my other minions in the deck were mana minions or above aside form the elekk oh and before all that happened i also lost a shitload of games as dragonwarrior which usually is my i want easy games class all i wanted to say was actually that sometimes it just doesnt work out for ya
hearthstone,not_removed,not sure whether or not he reinstalled it after but im pretty sure the main reason is just that he doesnt like the game
hearthstone,not_removed,junkos favorite combo is renocoinshadowcaster with two shadowsteps in hand nagitos is yogg
hearthstone,not_removed,it is pretty low normally but with how thin reynads deck was his also pretty likely to fatigue himself too so that makes up for a lot
hearthstone,not_removed,not really you are not taking into account the fact that if yog misses the one damage to the opponent he is surely dead the next turn
hearthstone,not_removed,cards like swipeexecute that only hit enemies or cards that summon minions will make it tend to slightly favor friendlies
hearthstone,not_removed,that yogg sounds like a pretty nice guy my yogg just bursts me in the face and then casts stand against darknessdoom to mill me
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont disagree my point was that you dont lose your right to complain when playing yogg because at reynads level having to play yogg is dictated by the meta rather than being a personal choice if youre a pro you just have to play yogg because yogg druid is a meta deck and you need to practice it sure when you play yogg its usually your only winning play so in a vacuum it cant make things worse but youre playing a deck that relies on it to drive its winrate up otherwise it wouldnt be in your deck so you still have some expectations its like other rng cards eg implosion you know the card can roll but its still frustrating when it happens because you dont run the card to roll
hearthstone,not_removed,exactly ive won so many game with yogg that literally no other one card could win for me it allows you to get well over mana worth of value at times as well as spells that your class cant even use which is in many cases the only possible way to win yes it can back fire but the idea is to only play it when you have to or at least when you have the highest possibility of a favorable outcome
hearthstone,not_removed,i guess that is rng for you im no expert in yogg but the few times i have played him he definitely did me more harm than good
hearthstone,not_removed,all that to say that its random but can help you or not
hearthstone,not_removed,its the same reason every football coach has a hail mary in their playbook not because they want to use it every game but some games it is the only chance you have
hearthstone,not_removed,thats exactly the point yogg can be useful or not nobody would use it if it was bad every time are you even wasting time writting that and its random if you dont like maximum randomness dont put that shit in your deck the moment you play it youre renouncing every right you have to whine about negative outcomes you knew that it could happen so just deal with it
hearthstone,not_removed,its a legendary every legendary is even if its trash maybe you mean its worth id say not even that
hearthstone,not_removed,downvotes and your comment wont change that yogg has never cast astral against me card is bullshit and needs deleting from the game
hearthstone,not_removed,there was a lot more to it than just a bluff it means nothing without the topdecks after playing to your outs and all but the bluff didnt win the game
hearthstone,not_removed,its not bluffing if you do it on accident
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah bluffing isnt high level its being able to make them think its legit
hearthstone,not_removed,and thats when yogg decided to fuck him up
hearthstone,not_removed,he is the guy that always gets pissed if his opponent isnt punished for a misplay only fair that he get punished for his
hearthstone,not_removed,eh without players and fans its not an esport theyre just filling in as the provider of what people want
hearthstone,not_removed,it is to us casuals p
hearthstone,not_removed,well actually winning and losing in this game is pretty much already determined by your mulligan i play this game for fun it doesnt have enough depth for you to really get any pride out of winning or losing again if you want competition that is predominantly skill based play starcraft
hearthstone,not_removed,its a stress relieving childrens card game
hearthstone,not_removed,where did this meme come from is mtg a childrens card game too league can be played by kids is that a childrens game
hearthstone,not_removed,ouch league is no place to go if you want to get off tilt
hearthstone,not_removed,btw playing yogg in your deck you chose to roll the dice but what you are basically saying btw playing dr boom in your deck you chose to roll the dice i dont think people choose to use yogg in their competitive decks as much as they are forced to do so some of the best rated decks out there use yogg
hearthstone,not_removed,a lot of people play yogg because if you have spells in your deck its the best come back mechanism
hearthstone,not_removed,seems accurate some days i rank up twice from silly winstreaks some days i lose in a row because they drew perfect curves with all the right answers and my opening hand was all mana it happens
hearthstone,not_removed,why do you think they designed purify to balance the game edit froze their arcane mage their yogg played purify on it for lethal nothing is safe
hearthstone,not_removed,and what about cards like morph or polymorph or hex or pyroblast or moonfire or doom or any other card with an any target
hearthstone,not_removed,ive played games with it this week and honestly it maybe lost me games it won me more than that for sure and it provided an advantage the vast majority of the time i hate the design of the card for a competitive game but theres a reason so many top players use it
hearthstone,not_removed,oh i get what youre saying now i thought you meant playing yogg isnt a choice ie pro players would never play yogg youre saying its not a choice because its in so many meta decks gotcha i misread your comment
hearthstone,not_removed,how could you control the possibility of a favorable outcome
hearthstone,not_removed,i believe the math has been done and generally speaking yogg favors the player who plays him
hearthstone,not_removed,yogg definitely benefits the person who plays him the majority of the time you just gotta pick a good spot to play him
hearthstone,not_removed,its random but theres enough ways to push it in your favor that it is worth running if you dont need it then you dont even have to play it and its just one dead card its not like the new legendary that puts cards in your deck at the beginning of the game
hearthstone,not_removed,im glad you can divine intent through onesided interaction
hearthstone,not_removed,sobluffing effectively i would say the difference between a pro poker player and guys playing with their buddies is the ability to bluff effectively im not sure what point youre furthering here other than being pedantic
hearthstone,not_removed,ive never seen them make such a huge scene as reynad does every time something unlucky happens ive never seen a clip on the front page here of i dunno thijs leaving his chair or going on a rant because his rag missed a coin flip or whatever its just reynads thing
hearthstone,not_removed,its a stress relieving childrens card game for eolympians
hearthstone,not_removed,reynad calls the game a childs game pretty regularly on his stream
hearthstone,not_removed,its a lot more skilloriented at least no random pyro blast coming at him plus its a bit less frustrating because when you lose a fight it could be your fault instead of a in chance of something happening reynad has in in chance though
hearthstone,not_removed,it can be if you dont regularly play and are just enjoying relearning the game back when i was first learning i didnt care if i won or lost at all i just liked trying new things and figuring out how the game worked
hearthstone,not_removed,i play games like league to untilt from games like hearthstone honestly even though sometimes you get bad teammates or opponents who just crush you too yknow that oneinamillion time where you lose and it isnt your teams fault it still feels a lot like you couldve won that game if you had played better whereas in hs it just feels like yeah you lost because of rng then you mutter man fuck this game at your dog and go do something else though eventually you often do that in league as well but it happens a lot faster in hs i guess
hearthstone,not_removed,league is no place to go ever or at least not until it catches up to dota in another years or so
hearthstone,not_removed,or an enjoyable gaming experience
hearthstone,not_removed,boom cant hit your own face though
hearthstone,not_removed,id say a card that forces people to use some spells instead of playing tempostone is good for the game right now
hearthstone,not_removed,lifecoach doesnt run yogg in his druid tho
hearthstone,not_removed,its really bewildering too i went like on powerful meta decks last week and just said fuck it and made a retarded druid deck with only spells and minions that were good to pull with barnes pretty much banking only on winning through broken barnes plays and went on a game winstreak with it even though that deck had no business holding more than a winrate at best sometimes the rng gods take and sometimes they give though i suppose they also kind of took from my poor opponents its some real bs to lose a game because your opponent plays barnes and draws sylvanas with it then plays raven idol into living roots to kill his own sylvanas and steal your biggest minion with her to deny you lethal and win the game with it was fun for me though
hearthstone,not_removed,they drew perfect curves my opening hand was all mana playing priest against shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,every card is either neutral or beneficial except for the rare case of astral communion and most neutral cards have higher chances of being beneficial because your opponent has a biggee board when you play yogg
hearthstone,not_removed,you generally dont control it you have the best odds of a favorable outcome oddly enough when youve completely lost control in the game because of spells like doom twisting nether and the massive amount of aoe spells as well as self healing and card draw spells when youre very behind on the board you have the best odds of a favorable outcome all the damage spells hit random targets and there are way more damage spells than buff spells in the game so you have good odds of those spells hitting the enemy or one of their minions think of it kind of like old death wing you use it when a bad outcome matters little because youre probably going to lose the game if you dont play it anyway the truth is because of the number of spells that can only be beneficial to you your odds of getting a favorable outcome are pretty much always better than a bad one that being said when youre already in control of the game theres no reason to risk it so you play it when youre no longer in control and you need some sort of life raft edit in general it better for cards to be more useful when youre behind than when youre ahead because if youre ahead youre probably going to win anyway so cards that are good when youre ahead have little impact on the outcome of the game theyre called win more cards because you were already going to win anyway kelthuzad is a great example of a win more card and its why he never became a meta card despite how powerful his effect can be its because its only really powerful when youre already ahead so its not really helping you all that much
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think he favours anyone from a statistical standpoint but if you play it when you have nothing to lose then it can win you the game edit i was wrong
hearthstone,not_removed,im saying it needs to be clearer that someone who isnt a high level hs player may not have thought about the pyroblast lethal and just played as normal you need to know how to bluff the opponent youre playing if youre playing rank thats a bad play at high legend its a good play a high level poker bluff might go over my head because i cant think of all the possible hands the opnn would play that way
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah reynad just cant stand anything thats unfair rng he conceded a game monday or something because a mage got arcane missiles i think on face with minion on board
hearthstone,not_removed,ya i know that but didnt think the meme originated there
hearthstone,not_removed,playing solo queue is basically the equivalent of playing yogg every turn though
hearthstone,not_removed,you get a random pyroclast instead
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah tell that to the seemingly random execute timer minions aggro pathing enemies escaping with hp
hearthstone,not_removed,that pyro blast isnt that random i mean he played yogg if you dont like random pyros then dont play yogg its a huge random button
hearthstone,not_removed,thats also caused by the fact that noticing mistakes in league in your own play is easy as fuck in hearthstone you have to think back like turns and wonder how you could have played it and if it would have even mattered
hearthstone,not_removed,league is never catching up to dota on any conceivable level ever lol is the hs of mobas and therefore its target audience is very different similarly dota as a consequence of its skill cap and learning curve isnt ever going to command the same sheer number of players as in league
hearthstone,not_removed,you say that like yogg is the reason these decks exist tempo mage literally just slotted him in token druids dont even run him all the time and just swap him for another big dude
hearthstone,not_removed,except you then risk losing the game despite being way ahead it rewards you because average case is okay or good but it can also really wreck you i nearly won a game today off a yogg that was absolutely terrible for my opponent luckily they had two ice blocks
hearthstone,not_removed,playing priest
hearthstone,not_removed,the fact is that some heal spells can only target your face and not the enemys and vice versa for some damage spells summon minion spells can only ever work in your favor so on average yoggs effects will be better for you than they are for your opponent playing yogg is not a coinflip its more like a loaded die
hearthstone,not_removed,because a number of beneficial spells are friendly minion only or create minions and a couple burn spells are enemy minion only no matter what yogg is tilted toward you
hearthstone,not_removed,not as hard as it is to argue with someone who has such a poor grasp of basic english
hearthstone,not_removed,except that pro players can and have solo queued to masters with win rates
hearthstone,not_removed,as a league player or ex league player i kinda quit this season since riot has been messing a lot of things up i made it to diamond playing only shaco all roles ad only in i even played him as adc and support in my diamond promos and won with all that experience ill say this if you are really bad teammates decide all your games if you are decent you will decide about of your games and teammates the other that means if you play perfectly you will get a win rate no matter the teams and statistically you should win half of the other based on teammates league is really and easy game even for people that are bad at it i will be the first to say as a shaco player i am terrible at the game mechanically but i am play shaco and exploit things to win
hearthstone,not_removed,best joke eva
hearthstone,not_removed,the problem is that it is an undeniably powerful card sure there is a nonzero chance to get pyroblasted in your face once for every spell youve cast but the result is good more than of the time so never running the card because it might backfire ends up hurting the strength of your deck
hearthstone,not_removed,youre pretty naive if you think dotas skill cap and learning curve are that much higher than leagues
hearthstone,not_removed,wow you sure got him
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah but on your normal account you play with people of your skill level you can have winrates in hearthstone too going from rank to
hearthstone,not_removed,yes those are the times when you are ahead on board and dont have to use yogg as a win condition gold shitter like me tho im playing that yogg for a full min shitshow ride
hearthstone,not_removed,yes but a majority of pro players just play dynamic que a vast majority because its easier quicker and a ton more reliable
hearthstone,not_removed,l u c k
hearthstone,not_removed,ahh so can pro players in hearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,except that pro players can and have solo queued to masters with win rates i find it hilarious that you list a stat like that to seem to make the game more legit the fact that the best players in the world can only get an win rate against complete scrubs is actually not a testament to the games legitimacy lol
hearthstone,not_removed,ive also seen pro players struggle to make it out of gold for a while their win rates are good but usually not in plat or diamond league
hearthstone,not_removed,i didnt say anything about it not being powerful i said that if you dont like the random effects andor if random outcomes tilt you playing yogg is kinda begging for it tons of cards in hs have a random element to them but specifically because yogg is powerful when the random backfires it backfires huge your cabalists tome might not give you the ice block you were hoping for but it is never going to kill you on your own turn your hit a random enemy effect is never going to randomly turn around and fire at your face
hearthstone,not_removed,people just have no concept of what skill actually means when they compare dota and leagues skill the only thing they compare is how hard it is to pick up and get the very basics learned up to a decent level they dont talk about the actual mechanical differences only what the other game doesnt have and hence it must be worse less skillful and i agree league is way easier to pick up and get into it was pretty quick to get to a decent level in whereas in dota i struggled a lot to make anything happen at all but the problem is when people apply these first weeks of experience and think they can draw conclusions about how easy league is on a competitive level not realizing that turning these simpler mechanics into a real advantage over your enemy is a skillset of its own that perfecting your micro is the only thing to do and thats in my opinion where real skill is shown but hey what do i know subreddits are more religious cults than discussion forums most of the time anyways so maybe theres no point in putting more effort into these thought processes
hearthstone,not_removed,i could respond to that with some actually sensible argument to back what i was saying instead of just dicrediting your viewpoint by calling you names like you did here but i have learnt better by now trying to argue with blind fanboys which you clearly seem to be dont take my word for it and see expert opinions if you want looking at the difference between the games if that is what might show you the light or otherwise lets just agree to disagree that dota is actually on a much higher level of competitive play than lol can hope to be at any point in the near future
hearthstone,not_removed,considering he deleted his post guess i did lmao
hearthstone,not_removed,challenger would be more like top though id put rank at high gold to mid plat
hearthstone,not_removed,no they cant
hearthstone,not_removed,is actually really good when you consider the fact that you have other people on your team in lol you also need to keep in mind that when queueing up to masters you still need to go through the upper echelons of matchmaking so you being able to carry of the high level games is phenomenal
hearthstone,not_removed,thats just false
hearthstone,not_removed,and hes saying that even if you dont like the random effects you still have to embrace the card in order to make your deck as competitive as possible since it is a strong card
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel like league is generally more mechanically demanding in terms of how teamfights play out i feel like dota is significantly more tactically demanding and the variety and depth of strategies displayed at the professional level is much higher than in league i think thats why the celebrated players in league are mechanical gods like faker and the cherished heroes of dota are brilliant captains like ppd and
hearthstone,not_removed,i played league for three years and dota for i think im alright to make the comparison
hearthstone,not_removed,the point was you dont get winrates on your own account because you play with people of your skill level you can only get those on a fresh account while laddering up
hearthstone,not_removed,nope thats not how card games work slower cards breed an aggro meta that tries to end the game early it doesnt slow the game down
hearthstone,not_removed,the quests dont favor control they reward games that go longer actually they hinder control and all archetypes really because theyre a dead card until they do something and at the very least weakens your mulligan even if you ship it because if it werent there you wouldve seen another potentially useful card in its place before you selected cards to ship if a control meta does form it will be because of other cards that allow it to succeed not because of the quests it may just happen that if said control meta were to take root some quests might be playable despite their major drawbacks
hearthstone,not_removed,this is pretty controllish meta
hearthstone,not_removed,patron
hearthstone,not_removed,right after undertaker nerf handlock was a fantastic skillintensive deck and games would sometimes last more than turns freeze mage vs control warrior was also a super fun matchup before justicar and shieldmaiden but while antonidas was still played
hearthstone,not_removed,oil rogue and handlock nerfs loved those two decks to death
hearthstone,not_removed,right after loe was the best lots of control and midrange druid was a thing i liked playing midrange druid
hearthstone,not_removed,loved combo druid loved handlock didnt play oil long gone are the days where my tournament list was just those no matter what and a random deck
hearthstone,not_removed,betarelease where nat pagle decided matches because the game was so slow also deathrattle was not as annoying feelsgoodman
hearthstone,not_removed,definitely just after the undertaker nerf super aggro decks were temporarily down to a record low and handlock my favorite deck to this day was still competitively viable
hearthstone,not_removed,post loe dragon priest with entomb and lightning shit on every copypaste secret paladin it was delicious
hearthstone,not_removed,mech mage meta postundertaker nerf that was the best time in hss history imo
hearthstone,not_removed,prenerf freeze mage that deck was truly oppressive and i had a lot of fun denying other people their fun
hearthstone,not_removed,i started playing in october so almost one year ago and my first love was midrange hunter after gaining some experience and discovering new stuff finally saw oil rogue and oh my god did i jizz my pants from that point all my dust was directed to that deck and when i finally managed to craft edwin which was the last piece standard was announced i was convinced i will play tons of wild with my oil rogue but then the nerf on blade flurry i wasnt part of a lot of metas but i want my oil rogue back i cri everitim
hearthstone,not_removed,brm meta tgt ruins everything cant wait for rotation
hearthstone,not_removed,i really really miss patron warrior after they nerfed it i had to find another cancer deck to play secret pally just isnt the same
hearthstone,not_removed,im not sure but esl and faceit are esports organisations i have used them for other games
hearthstone,not_removed,strive wire
hearthstone,not_removed,so i spent a few days playing tournaments on strivewire and a vast majority of players are regular legend ladder players also literally everyone and their grandmother runs the midrange shaman and malygos druid decks i dont know what i expected but this is really pathetic makes me feel for anyone playing in the competitive hearthstone scene
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you gonna check it out now
hearthstone,not_removed,congratz looks like a pretty average pally deck im surprised it went wins
hearthstone,not_removed,thats at best a solid deck well played
hearthstone,not_removed,party hats
hearthstone,not_removed,it was against a mage that didnt really put up much of a fight they didnt play anything till turn and by then it was too late bad curve i guess
hearthstone,not_removed,minibots decent weapon hammer kings keeper murloc knight seal of champions aldor is an average paladin deck fuck ive been been getting bad drafts then
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks was thinking that myself but miracles happen
hearthstone,not_removed,you want an average win paladin deck one lance one steward one seal one consecrate double truesilver one uldamann almost no synergy to work off from
hearthstone,not_removed,well that was uncalled for young man
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for contributing
hearthstone,not_removed,its only you nobody cares about and the reason is obvious
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe his deck was like the time i got wins with mage in arena i had flamestrikes and a bunch of other random garbage
hearthstone,not_removed,that might have been me did you get murloc knight from murloc knight
hearthstone,not_removed,yep same thing happened to me justa fairly disappointing mage final boss fight
hearthstone,not_removed,no i got the murloc that buffs the others
hearthstone,not_removed,except dusting cards even the socalled useless adventure cards is generally a bad idea since the process is so inefficient that said if you were desperate enough to need the extra dust to make a deck go right ahead just be warned if you ever need those cards again its going to be some very expensive crafting
hearthstone,not_removed,moroes isnt bad though
hearthstone,not_removed,amazon coins is to hearthstone what audible is to youtube
hearthstone,not_removed,why is everyone throwing a fuss about this if amazon paid you thousands of dollars to make a minute video would you of course not to mention it saves people money if anything getting the word out is good for the community
hearthstone,not_removed,im not fussing about it im just making fun of the popularity of this sponsorship during a new expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean its a win for all we get discounts when promos come upstill cheaper per pack for i think though amazon gets blizz gets just depends on your spending habits
hearthstone,not_removed,the only issue i find with rd is that you lack draw lowering the costs of cards is great but i find that i go through them too quickly so i run curator for a alexdeath draw and coldlight for more draw i throw in muklas champion since its a beast
hearthstone,not_removed,i think thats an interesting solution but i also think it could just be better eliminating the cost reduction but then transitioning the card to cost
hearthstone,not_removed,too op
hearthstone,not_removed,nah itd be a trash card then the cost reduction is a massive bonus considering you get random cards they probably wont make a very good deck unless you get very lucky
hearthstone,not_removed,it allows it to simply be a card to replace your garbage cards similar to elise
hearthstone,not_removed,ehhhh but the problem is legendary cards random class cards in the endgame pretty much every time vast majority of legendaries are highcost minions with powerful effects elise doesnt give you crap like bestial wrath and wisps of the old gods
hearthstone,not_removed,yes
hearthstone,not_removed,im still wondering what the hell he says when you play him something about lights
hearthstone,not_removed,itt we go through all hs cards with this format of post
hearthstone,not_removed,quality meta post
hearthstone,not_removed,he asks need a light
hearthstone,not_removed,quality
hearthstone,not_removed,oh it was so gravelly i could never work it out
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks could never figure it out
hearthstone,not_removed,i think its a problem if changes always represent subtraction from the classic set and i wish krush and illidan could get a buff
hearthstone,not_removed,duh thats the whole point blizzard wants the classic cards to suck so that people have to spend money to buy the new sets each expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,to be fair there is an announcement that blizzard is going to take a really close look at the classic set and potentially make more changes soon
hearthstone,not_removed,actually changes would need to be way more regular but not only by nerfing cards
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean it can be good for players too if classic starts sucking as it is that set is so overpowered that it almost always overshadows new content and makes all metas feel similar
hearthstone,not_removed,flamewaker isnt on there
hearthstone,not_removed,war axe
hearthstone,not_removed,where is my entomb option
hearthstone,not_removed,shield or ice block probly
hearthstone,not_removed,where is slyvanas
hearthstone,not_removed,tirion and ragnaros the lightlord
hearthstone,not_removed,thing from below is inconvenient but flametongue is super tilting lol
hearthstone,not_removed,dude second on this i swear to god flamewaker is the most tilting card in the whole game this turn three makes me want to die i serve the firelord coin bang bang arcane missles bang bang ill be sad to see brm go but fuck flamewaker
hearthstone,not_removed,yea flamewaker seems like a good choice but it must have skipped my mind cause i havent really seen it much on ladder
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe not shield but i did really consider putting down ice block
hearthstone,not_removed,flametongue is balanced an can be played around a taunt isnt
hearthstone,not_removed,i think its a good card against control they have to use separate forms of removal or silence it to get rid of it completely and when going to the late game the mana version is going to be good as just a late game drop and even if you dont need it a for and a for is good enough to see play in a minion based control mage or reno mage imo
hearthstone,not_removed,if it were released right now i would play it in my reno mage mine is spell heavy and sometimes you dont have minions to just drop and try to get board control which you need to be able to do in some games it also has some really strong synergy with the revival kazakus potion granted that deck is rotating out so i have little faith in the viability of value mage
hearthstone,not_removed,card art contest its really pretty in my opinion
hearthstone,not_removed,not all cards need to be tier like many cards it is probably gonna bully control warriors hard the first is just an axe swing but the latter ones require hard removal thats pretty good for one card
hearthstone,not_removed,the real question is since its a return this back to your hand card will it be affected by nzoth and im also sure there will be synergy cards for elemental as it seems now it looks lackluster but time will tell
hearthstone,not_removed,against aggro the first iteration may be enough to contest some of the board its not great but itd do that said in a heavy aggro meta you probably wouldnt run it against control it can potentially be cards for and more if you run nzoth the first stage is second is and last is so if you brought all stages back with nzoth youd be looking at a potential cards for under ideal circumstances which would never happen p basically this card could potentially be good if enough slower decks are in the meta but honestly after years of magic and hearthstone i tend to err on the side of caution and assume a card wont be good enough unless its clearly amazing it should be good in arena though a lot of legendaries can be underwhelming in arena but this one is an xx for x that can potentially which is certainly fine
hearthstone,not_removed,sometimes you just need more minions in a value matchup a control deck with nzoth is the obvious fit hopefully it finds a home in a good deck its definitely flavorful and unique
hearthstone,not_removed,reno mageowait
hearthstone,not_removed,its kind of like an early game anubarak except a little worse since it doesnt drop the nerubian i dont think its going to be great but it could have its moments
hearthstone,not_removed,im assuming that there will be some elemental synergy cards that may make it better its also possible that the mage quest will involve summoning elementals
hearthstone,not_removed,it would be a great for a priest from kabal courier or thoughtsteal
hearthstone,not_removed,it wont another trash mage legendary
hearthstone,not_removed,while im not comparing wording right now i can confirm that anubarak and skeleton knight both work with nzoth actually they can be fantastic with nzoth as you can potentially get a whole board of them with only one card
hearthstone,not_removed,yes because the effect is a death rattle which only procs when the minion dies similar to anub and sk
hearthstone,not_removed,woah i actually didnt know that does it work with malourne
hearthstone,not_removed,i havent tested that interaction myself but according to this thread it does also work with malorne
hearthstone,not_removed,in the beginning there was no rewards for playing ranked and nobody played it hence ranked chests were added i think arena rewards are fine as is
hearthstone,not_removed,so by that train of thought wouldnt more people want to play arena
hearthstone,not_removed,most people already play arena especially for new players arena gives a more even playing field and if you can get wins you get evenpositive rewards for your gold most people only switch to constructed once they can get a good deck and even then most would stay in arena until a bigger collection if they didnt want to spam that one deck they arent going to promote a mode thats already popular
hearthstone,not_removed,most people dont play arena and certainly not new players you have to have a pretty decent win average to make arena a good value and between the drafting process the completely tempo based arena landscape and the gold entry fee thats extremely difficult for new players to do
hearthstone,not_removed,there are programs and sites that basically tells you what to draft you need to know how tempo works in both constructed and arena its much easier to learn how tempo works and get used to it when you have cards that you dont need to buy the gold entrance is nothing compared to getting a full constructed deck the cheapest right now is zoo which you need around dust which is basically gold more so if you want to play more than one class
hearthstone,not_removed,when i was new i played almost only arena because i got sick of losing to card quality in a few hours arena is good value for anyone smart enough to install heartharena hard to average less than if you do that
hearthstone,not_removed,mage then rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,mage and until next year it will be mage oh and last year it was mage if you dont know where im going with this the answer will always be mage
hearthstone,not_removed,mage rogue pally shaman warlock druid warrior hunter i think pallywarrior is a toss up honestly and most orders work out since they are all pretty much even
hearthstone,not_removed,probably always going to be mage
hearthstone,not_removed,ask kripp p
hearthstone,not_removed,quality shitpost
hearthstone,not_removed,im just going to assume you are being serious priest by a mile the best commons the best removals the best earlier game and best board clear the only hard choice is which class is second my vote is for hunter
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks alot i think this list makes sense
hearthstone,not_removed,wouldnt you say that druid is better than warlock
hearthstone,not_removed,yup thats the order of the classes
hearthstone,not_removed,why is mage so op
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah purify man
hearthstone,not_removed,i really struggled with choosing that order because i have had a lot of luck with my past two druid runs compared to before but im still not convinced until i watch some more pros play it getting two in arena though feels way too strong
hearthstone,not_removed,the only issue is that its not that linear it feels like top classes are waaaay better than the next and those top are miles ahead of the rest
hearthstone,not_removed,minion druid common kara 🐙 httphearthstonegamepediacommenageriewarden mana battlecry choose a friendly beast summon acopy of it callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to pm
hearthstone,not_removed,i just think that the druid hero power is very strong and most of the class cards are good i woukd put them between paladin and warlock just my opinion though
hearthstone,not_removed,was making a joke about priest not being a real class in arena
hearthstone,not_removed,same goes for warlock even more in arena with such the tempo meta we have right now card advantage is fairly huge to have and most classes druid included dont have much in terms of card draw warlock can make zooish decks for arena and dump their hand without much fear of aoe because they can take board back fairly quickly with the further dilution of the card pool making it more and more difficult to get aoe in arena warlock can go more all in druids ping is great but i feel like druids current seeking point is their late game big taunts highvalue minions and ramping allows them to hold onto board a bit better which was holding them back before
hearthstone,not_removed,wrong subreddit
hearthstone,not_removed,new account or old account
hearthstone,not_removed,currently win average from runs about to start run and needs wins for the average how is chakki not all over the front page of rhearthstone this is amazing edit its over he finished wins short ave i think feelsbadman still expecting this to be na though
hearthstone,not_removed,he just got one more thats amazing
hearthstone,not_removed,he is no hearthstone superstar tho
hearthstone,not_removed,here i am averaging wins thinking i do plays right lol
hearthstone,not_removed,variance
hearthstone,not_removed,id wager that his winrate will drop proportionately as his popularity rises kripp is insanely talented but gets destroyed by snipers so often is a regular occurrence this guy is absolutely one to watch out for i for one am glad that competitive arena is getting more attention because lets face it ladder doesnt really count
hearthstone,not_removed,ive heard it said that top constructed players could make the transition to being good arena players with some ease but this might be the first solid data point in favour of that hypothesis id love to see how other great constructed players like strifecro or thijs or lifecoach if he still played rip would fare in the arena
hearthstone,not_removed,but kripp has like runs you have and are far less sniped not even close to the same
hearthstone,not_removed,is not nearly a big enough sample size to make that claim those other top people have thousands of arena runs in comparison
hearthstone,not_removed,well to be fair he never skipped a warlock and always picked the strongest class in general it is still an amazing result but i wouldnt rank him leagues above kripp or hafu
hearthstone,not_removed,isnt this the same arena that kripp complains about night after night saying it is all about tempo and how theres barely any thinking in what to play turn after turn and how the game is determined by turn and so on and so on hes done nothing but bash the mode for what seems like forever watching him you get the feeling that being called a master of arena is nothing to be proud of
hearthstone,not_removed,im better
hearthstone,not_removed,hes using his main account the one hes been using since beta and its still not that important considering the boost only lasts for the first runs
hearthstone,not_removed,yike i hope the announcement hasnt caused a drastic shift in winrates over last month i was feeling good about placing at my estimated win rate
hearthstone,not_removed,hes not all over the front page because reddit still blames him for every aggro deck ever
hearthstone,not_removed,because he hasnt played shit let me know when he has runs with that average remindme years
hearthstone,not_removed,nice that means na is becoming easier than eu since someone has point average
hearthstone,not_removed,is great
hearthstone,not_removed,on runs with average i dont call that variance anymore i just call that skill sorry if he averaged but had like wins runs then thatd be variance but at on average on runs nope
hearthstone,not_removed,i have to agree with that hypothesis watching chakki recently makes me think that the only real advantage that the arena specialists have is their experience with the arenadrafting meta once he figured out what to play around it seemed like his plays were just on a different level technically than a lot of other arena streamers
hearthstone,not_removed,wasnt twobiers a constructed player and was also the first to finish the challenge
hearthstone,not_removed,kripp probably has runs every month i have close to runs and i hardly ever play arena
hearthstone,not_removed,i believe that to be on the leaderboards you gotta do at least runs in one month so its almost enough
hearthstone,not_removed,well so do kripp and hafu and hafu plays her main account offstream for the leaderboard
hearthstone,not_removed,so hes supposed to handicap himself and pick all the shitty classes like druid and hunter any time theyre offered
hearthstone,not_removed,its true by turn you probably know wholl win the game except against mage and warlock because aoe cumbacks the potion bitch card is exceptionnaly skilled sometimes giving you or your opponent the win for rolling felfire potion or dragonfire potion theres so many cards in rotation you dont play around shit and you probably win
hearthstone,not_removed,arena sometimes is very disgusting yesterday i went with warlock basically of those wins were me getting the only drop i had myriads of tho topdecking abyssal enforcer when needed and rolling on implosion the loss same but exact reverse get shit curve implosion rolls never draw abyssal or when i kill my own board with it i mean goddamn one of those wins against a mage was after he used kazakus mana potion for aoerez flamestrike a felfire potion from the potion bitch fuck that card lost me games in different runs that day on random felfire potions a dragonfire potion from the kabal courrier i just had so much reload he never had time to tempo anything on the board and kept removing
hearthstone,not_removed,that boost is still quite significant for say runs but not so much for for a newer players it would make a big difference to the average if you can get on your first runs and average around after that
hearthstone,not_removed,thats true but its still a pretty good average overall obviously runs isnt enough to prove hes the best in na or we but its still exceptional
hearthstone,not_removed,that doesnt mean anything
hearthstone,not_removed,that probably means youre a moron indeed
hearthstone,not_removed,lol nobody realises youre referencing what kripp said in his video when the last stats came out
hearthstone,not_removed,what i mean is lets see how he continues to average as he plays more arena will he continue to be a dominant arena player or was this a good month for him i know the title is mostly joking but kripp and hafu earned their title for being good at arena for years not just one month when the arena metagame was the most settled its been in a while
hearthstone,not_removed,tbh i still want more data maybe check ins at and runs
hearthstone,not_removed,doesnt even really have to know drafting that well theres tools like heartharena that just straight up do it for you
hearthstone,not_removed,kripp had runs in january so just over a day nowhere near
hearthstone,not_removed,he means to make the claim of being best arena player a leaderboard doesnt show that
hearthstone,not_removed,no but there is a huge difference between averaging with only warlock and some rogue and mage or with all classes equally my average is but when i reduce it to the respective top classes of the expansions i get to an average of around
hearthstone,not_removed,nothing feels worse than losing to discover cards in arena i dunno but i feel like kripp every time they discover a board clear from it my worst was when a priest discovered board clears in turns
hearthstone,not_removed,well there is the fact that ben brode talked explicitly about the filter so its confirmed to exist
hearthstone,not_removed,you do know arenas arent matched on deckscore from a party site right
hearthstone,not_removed,for a newer players it would make a big difference to the average if you can get on your first runs and average around after that i dont see how it could possibly make a difference that dramatic the effect is equivalent to having one extra loss for matchmaking until you hit two losses thats a big deal but it becomes much less so the higher you go once you get to wins its already normal for matchmaking to pick someone one win up or one loss down just due to the smaller pool
hearthstone,not_removed,what can you do stupid people exist too
hearthstone,not_removed,eh hell probably just stop playing arena after ungoro or even just the nerfs i think he just got tired of constructed for a while and instead of pulling a lifecoach he just decided to play arena only for the remainder of the month trying to hit that leaderboard pretty smart of him imo
hearthstone,not_removed,oh definitely
hearthstone,not_removed,kripp had runs in january on one account he has multiple
hearthstone,not_removed,kripp plays in burst and i meant since start of this expansion which has been out quite a while i know kripp had like runs in like the first week and at that time kripps avarage was like and that shows how important sample size is and how you cant play games and say you are better than kripp just checked kripps hearth arena it says he has runs and a average
hearthstone,not_removed,theyre literally competing for a top leaderboard position why wouldnt they pick the best classes to do that i dont get how this is even relevant youre basically saying that all of the people on the arena leaderboard would have way lower averages if they played the shitty classes instead of the good ones but theyre not playing those classes theyre playing good ones and theyre averaging good scores because theyre good players not just because theyre picking warlock cmon man this makes no sense its literally like saying to be fair everyone in top legend did it with decks like aggro shaman i wouldnt rank them in the top
hearthstone,not_removed,wtf its like saying people at the top of the constructed ladder arent the best because they only play face shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,this i just finished runs this month with average of and i played with all classes if i were to play only top tier classes i would be i might actually do that next month if i can be bothered still pretty impressive overall also remember variance runs is not huge sample size yet
hearthstone,not_removed,i believe you but it does nothing to explain what i experienced when testing it out it cannot be a simple filter for your first few arena runs there must be other metrics involved and they clearly have a way of differentiating experienced vs new players
hearthstone,not_removed,i think the point is that if youre getting extra win than you normally would have for the first runs that translate to a increase in your run average looking at januarys leaderboard when youre at the top wins would only bump you up or in rank but if youre in the bottom an extra could bump you up around ranks so its a pretty reasonable benefit
hearthstone,not_removed,its okay i got downvoted too i bet the downvoters felt super smart watch how fast this comment takes a ride down the downvote train as well
hearthstone,not_removed,did lifecoach quit
hearthstone,not_removed,id say atleast runs would be an accurate number the arena meta couldve been easy in that time period for whatever reason if he consistantly gets top of the arena leaderboards instead of just this month then itd be worth bragging about
hearthstone,not_removed,the players at top are obviously very skilled but if two players have almost the same rank but one of them uses a deck with a much higher win rate than the other wouldnt you be inclined to think the other player probably is better
hearthstone,not_removed,no popular streamers are often not playing the efficient decks but rather the funtowatch ones kibler is a very good example which is the only reason they hit legend so late many popular arena streamers pick all classes equally to prevent the games from being redundant to the viewers i honestly didnt know that hafu was playing a try hard account for the leaderboard and plays another for her viewers which changes a lot actually but i dont think kripp has another account to play offstream does he
hearthstone,not_removed,no its not but its like saying some people tried harder than others ultimately the number one of the ladder is the best player im just saying that the circumstances arent the same i honestly dont understand how you dont get that point
hearthstone,not_removed,the leaderboards arent for finding the best arena player theyre just a fun little thing for people to compete on the best arena player in the world could autopick hunter everytime not show up on the leaderboards and still be the best
hearthstone,not_removed,theres no explanation needed even at you can always happen to play crazy decks that had a bad draw or disconnects or a deck that has bad cards but drew the good against you this is about averages and not absolutes
hearthstone,not_removed,oh its definitely a benefit in contesting the leaderboard but i doubt the effect is worth a full extra win and it certainly isnt going to allow a player averaging wins to hit let alone three times in a row as posited in the comment i replied to
hearthstone,not_removed,i get the point but its a useless one to have since you dont have thousands of people averaging wins whatever the class they may pick its like saying hey im not first at the race but i helped a grandma cross the roads i should be first for honor honor means nothing in ladder placements like those
hearthstone,not_removed,well yes i think that was the point all along
hearthstone,not_removed,i misunderstood you at first and thought you were implying hunter was the best arena deck i seriously doubted all my arena knowledge for a second there
hearthstone,not_removed,deck quality has no bearing on the fact that i faced experienced players on game despite there being some sort of filter
hearthstone,not_removed,oh derp didnt see that part yeah its highly unlikely for something like that to happen
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah was agreeing with ya
hearthstone,not_removed,httpstandardhearthcom has the answers you want
hearthstone,not_removed,this is the kind of thing you google not make a reddit post for
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you that is what i was looking for
hearthstone,not_removed,if googled answered the question or i found the correct explanation then i would not of made a reddit post why waste your time in even commenting on this in the first place move along
hearthstone,not_removed,are you too dumb to know how to use google
hearthstone,not_removed,hearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,playing spells rapidly with archmage antonidastrade prince gallywix out may cause a client animation hang if you cast a spell then cast another spell before archmage antonidastrade prince gallywix has visually added a card to your hand said animation will never finish causing a client animation hang since this state will last forever the only solution is to disconnectreconnect or end the process
hearthstone,not_removed,shit happens
hearthstone,not_removed,ive played about games in ranks today and went against hunter a grand total of one time and i won looks like it isnt that viable right now
hearthstone,not_removed,multiple professional players have failed to reach legend laddering with hunter however it has been managed with paladin neither is efficient for grinding ladder from what ive seen so youre less likely to see them unless youre near a rank floor more common to see offmeta decks when stars cant be lost
hearthstone,not_removed,hunter is garbage paladin has anyfin which is decent
hearthstone,not_removed,serious question how is your winrate versus shaman so low as dragonpriest is it all aggro shaman ive been playing midrange jade and my winrate versus dragon priest is i might as well just concede to save time i was rank encountered some pirate warriors and dragon priests and dropped right back to rank how can u lose as dp if you even have half decent draw by the time the jades start getting bigger its already to late edit only saw the saw the samll sample size afterwards question remains tho
hearthstone,not_removed,ok good to know i sincerely hope hunter gets stronger this expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,agreed hunter does not really have a specific type of deck that is good right now at all
hearthstone,not_removed,i have played an aggro and a murloc murloc lol which i won both then i played a mid range jade shaman who just had phenomenal draws and then also lost to a full out control shaman with like crazy late game legendaries and i ran out of tools before him
hearthstone,not_removed,each class will get one legendary minion and one legendary spell quest
hearthstone,not_removed,what is going to suck is this expansion is a major pay to win where as before you can be fine without legendary you have to have each of the class legendary spell card
hearthstone,not_removed,thats why they reduced the amount of neutral filler legendaries now every legendary you pull will theoretically be playable and you dont have to complain about pulling bogeymonsters also theres no saying that you need both legendaries for any deck look at how many decks that dont even run their class legendaries
hearthstone,not_removed,ya that was my entire point most decks dont even run their class legendaries but you are going to have to have the class legendary quest card to even play that class since it will be the most popular and op deck there is a huge difference between filler legendaries and deck defining cards for example patches was a deck defining card without it you can play most of the decks but it was a neutral card so crafting one isnt that big a deal most players will only be able to open enough packs to open or legendary they then craft or that is the most a free to play person can do for each expansion it was ok before cuz for example you only needed patches aya and kazakus but now you have to have all the class legendary spell quest cards to even have a chance even if they get or of them they can only use it for class it wasnt before where they can put it in all thier decks
hearthstone,not_removed,but you are going to have to have the class legendary quest card to even play that class since it will be the most popular and op deck says who you have no way of knowing that the priest one has an amazing effect but you have to actually complete the quest first while being at a card disadvantage which is likely to get you rolled over by aggro and your health total doesnt matter as much against control so it will probably only be run if the meta has a sizeable amount of midrange and otkcombo as having health might be similar to warriors armor up countering combo thats the only quest thats been revealed so far but i highly doubt that all the quests are going to be top tier cards as that as never been the case for legendaries in an expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,that ends up getting spell power and allowing a jade lightning to go face for and exact lethal
hearthstone,not_removed,you could put thier reaction on any hearthstone clip and noone would notice i love it
hearthstone,not_removed,excitement followed by bemused disappointment a perfect example of most hearthstone games
hearthstone,not_removed,imagine if the earth elemental mana transform into a mana flamewreathed faceless
hearthstone,not_removed,jjs laugh after the one was so awkward hes like hah what were not laughing this time ok
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,every lifecoach clip is him being extremely happy and laughing his ass off and then he gets fucked over by another card and looks dead serious like he wants to kill someone i love it
hearthstone,not_removed,apparently they lifecoach superjj are playing pirate jade shaman and reached top before lossing to an aggro shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,i love these so much
hearthstone,not_removed,the spellpower ended up being quite nice
hearthstone,not_removed,hahahaha play second devolveohh that sound made my day
hearthstone,not_removed,der ist auch gut that one is also good

hearthstone,not_removed,now theres a forced laughter if ever ive heard one
hearthstone,not_removed,man i want to see a whole series of supercoach clips where theyre losing their shit but the hearthstone board is all just normal mundane stuff happening
hearthstone,not_removed,flamewreathed faceless is that a different card from
hearthstone,not_removed,it was more like hah fuck this shit
hearthstone,not_removed,both of them live in vienna and practice together a lot
hearthstone,not_removed,god forbid anyone enjoy the games theyre playing
hearthstone,not_removed,nope same card
hearthstone,not_removed,practice right
hearthstone,not_removed,they are doing the visual equivalent of typing xds in a youtube comment its incredibly cringy
hearthstone,not_removed,is that what you got from my comment wow
hearthstone,not_removed,the joke is the name is
hearthstone,not_removed,coach does have a wife
hearthstone,not_removed,isnt it the opposite writing xds is the visual equivalent of what they are doing
hearthstone,not_removed,xd
hearthstone,not_removed,anddd you killed it thread
hearthstone,not_removed,i would say that the comment would be the textual equivalent
hearthstone,not_removed,btw
hearthstone,not_removed,not sure about the effect but i wouldnt mind if they used the artwork
hearthstone,not_removed,that seems awesome i love hunter hero power to
hearthstone,not_removed,hunter hero power sucks on the other end of the stick though
hearthstone,not_removed,you have good taste in art
hearthstone,not_removed,id pick swipe
hearthstone,not_removed,but swipe is much better than swipe in this scenario no
hearthstone,not_removed,actually i dont knowmaybe swipe is the best choice here
hearthstone,not_removed,nice job surviving booms beat bog creepers today lol
hearthstone,not_removed,more like congrats on surviving mages
hearthstone,not_removed,does it beat nzoth pirate murloc warrior
hearthstone,not_removed,handlock priest keep reading that until you see the problem
hearthstone,not_removed,how can priest be handlock when handlock literally means warlock
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah knew about that thanks tho
hearthstone,not_removed,but did you know that httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvqemnprsgqqk
hearthstone,not_removed,im fucking dead holy shit
hearthstone,not_removed,people are dicks theyre going to bm is it an asshole thing to do very but that isnt going to stop them just autosquelch and move on
hearthstone,not_removed,morgls cuteness is overloading

hearthstone,not_removed,oh veleera 😍
hearthstone,not_removed,greeeeeeeeeetings traveller
hearthstone,not_removed,dont know about the kkk shaman costume though
hearthstone,not_removed,garrosh in stormwindalliance costume
hearthstone,not_removed,spooky
hearthstone,not_removed,nice work
hearthstone,not_removed,morgl as a klansmen
hearthstone,not_removed,valeera is witch mercy confirmed
hearthstone,not_removed,garrosh could be an orange tic tac
hearthstone,not_removed,assuming tgt is still legal for halloween garish would go as a nokia phone
hearthstone,not_removed,thrall should have been frankensteins monster
hearthstone,not_removed,anduin is gonna disguise as a legend rank after all its fun to play pretend
hearthstone,not_removed,hnng rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,sounds like a fun idea but i dont want a download for it and then another download to remove it
hearthstone,not_removed,thats too much effort for a card game instead of doing that the devs will just do another nerf for lulz happy halloween
hearthstone,not_removed,until you see that deck hes playing
hearthstone,not_removed,seconded i absolutely love what op did with morgl
hearthstone,not_removed,costumes arent supposed to be everyday wear dude
hearthstone,not_removed,expected anduin dressed in other classes costumes a little bit disappointed
hearthstone,not_removed,wow
hearthstone,not_removed,tombstones are victory poses anduin doesnt get one
hearthstone,not_removed,not all is lost hamster has our back stay strong priest bretheren
hearthstone,not_removed,essentially accurate
hearthstone,not_removed,deadly broomstick mana battlecry open the design space
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you
hearthstone,not_removed,too spoopy
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you
hearthstone,not_removed,great idea
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,it was actually worse in the first sketch when i had the bed sheet going over his fin things on his back so i poked holes in them klan still kinda ruins bed sheet ghost fun though
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you
hearthstone,not_removed,not gonna lie witch mercy was what inspired this entire set
hearthstone,not_removed,your joke falls flat because lots of the people here would love more nerfs
hearthstone,not_removed,control shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks so much
hearthstone,not_removed,that would have been be a good idea i had absolutely no ideas for him
hearthstone,not_removed,too smorcky
hearthstone,not_removed,i prefer buffs to some cards like blood warriors just to see it more played or creating a complete new warrior archtype i also want to see buff for gladiator longbow king crush yshaarj
hearthstone,not_removed,i would prefer they buff some of the more pathetic cards that would have the same effect of changing the meta whilst being positive as opposed to negative
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah control shaman it does run board clears after all must be a control deck
hearthstone,not_removed,cuterol shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,totally not relevant name
hearthstone,not_removed,those cards dont need a buff since theres at least chance of someone actually using them the cards that need buffs are the ones nobody even remembers such as poisoned blade silverback harambe captains parrot junkbot eye for an eye tentacles for arms boogiemonster skeleton knight hemet nesingwary bolf ramshield kidnapper etc
hearthstone,not_removed,hallazealfatigueconcede shaman totally is a control deck it has a silly win con but its control its completely reactive
hearthstone,not_removed,the last time i saw someone playing the actual control shaman was before kara was released its the nature of hs being proactive is more consistent than being reactive
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah fuck this meme
hearthstone,not_removed,i like me some good memes good being the keyword here so yeah its pretty crappy
hearthstone,not_removed,welcome to reddit
hearthstone,not_removed,its rhearthstone stupid memes make up of all content here
hearthstone,not_removed,this meme has always been one of my favorite memes its just so positive and generous practically costs nothing at all
hearthstone,not_removed,mmmmmm pasta drools
hearthstone,not_removed,what copy pasta are you referring to i actually have no idea whats being referenced here
hearthstone,not_removed,it doesnt need to stop it needs to move to rhearthstonecirclejerk like susan did
hearthstone,not_removed,does reading copypasta make anyone else really happy
hearthstone,not_removed,the fuck are you talking about
hearthstone,not_removed,look at what youve created
hearthstone,not_removed,the other is threads making fun of reynads high sodium blood work and misplays
hearthstone,not_removed,this shit
hearthstone,not_removed,¯ツ¯

hearthstone,not_removed,no none option unplayable
hearthstone,not_removed,none
hearthstone,not_removed,i only have shaman and it sucks because i got it playing reno battlecry shaman with rumbling elemental back in loe but now everyone will just think i got it playing cancer decks
hearthstone,not_removed,im closest to rogue surprising that its such a minority
hearthstone,not_removed,only priest the light shall burn me
hearthstone,not_removed,control warrior and dragon priest ive got wins on all the other classes
hearthstone,not_removed,warlock and im wins away for pally im probably going to go after hunter or druid next ive got about wins with each of those classes it takes forever playing just a couple of games a day
hearthstone,not_removed,honestly really surprised druid is bottom with combo druid having been strong for so long til the nerfhammer
hearthstone,not_removed,mage paladin warlock warrior and hunter in that order my next closest class is priest with a whopping wins probably going to be a while until i get another one
hearthstone,not_removed,i got my golden rogue back in the miracle days
hearthstone,not_removed,this ive played since launch have all seasonal cardbacks grinded to every season since the rewards were introduced and legend once and still golden heroes edit the point here being the vast majority probably has none
hearthstone,not_removed,if you dont have another ysera hell no its a golden card that makes other golden cards its in the classic set and its actually quite good played it this season in barnesres priest
hearthstone,not_removed,its a golden legendary that creates more golden cards its also a classic card and a really good one dont dust it
hearthstone,not_removed,ysera has won me a lot of games usually with either emerald drake mana or nightmare mana give a minion then kill it at end of turn there was also that one time i got her to with priest
hearthstone,not_removed,ysera is not a bad card but you could always craft a more relevant legendary here you go friend
hearthstone,not_removed,iirc nightmare kills the minion at the start of your next turn so you can even use it on a taunt
hearthstone,not_removed,ah right see i never really encountered that since i always use it to win the game
hearthstone,not_removed,it makes it vastly better than po not only is it but the start of next turn or end of turn is a huge difference
hearthstone,not_removed,lol sucks for you
hearthstone,not_removed,god you again so wait do you think youll have to craft the legends the quests give in order to use the quests because thats not what he said
hearthstone,not_removed,we will be getting a quest and a legendary minion so technically you have to spend twice as much dust on class legendaries
hearthstone,not_removed,if theyre all good which they likely wont be
hearthstone,not_removed,flamewanker is in there lul
hearthstone,not_removed,edit in case anyone wants to go through them in chronological order im still updating them though im not sure for how much longer holy shit someone had time on their hands nice job 👍 sidenote were currently getting cards per year so were actually catching up at a rate of cards per year if the current release schedule continues i have a feeling well have bigger sets as time goes on though
hearthstone,not_removed,a man after my own heart
hearthstone,not_removed,wow thanks for doing this it was always a hassle to look through the previous card threads one by one
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you so much uoagoz can we get this to replace the messy list thats already included in the threads
hearthstone,not_removed,its amazing how many cards have been talked about already and also how few total
hearthstone,not_removed,uhypersniper can replace the list with this one in the generator
hearthstone,not_removed,looks like there is alot more cards than i thought
hearthstone,not_removed,okay be honest how much time went into that post
hearthstone,not_removed,will this list be updated
hearthstone,not_removed,i swear you lagged my brand new phone when i opened that nevertheless really incredible
hearthstone,not_removed,happy everyone and thanks to the whole dcd crew for all their ongoing work so i took a little time to see how close we might be to catching up on the full run of hearthstone cards here goes and let me know if my counts are off
hearthstone,not_removed,oh god theres so many what have i done with my time
hearthstone,not_removed,i swear it was not intentional
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont see how you cards a year catch up to cards a year
hearthstone,not_removed,internet helps love once again
hearthstone,not_removed,you got it
hearthstone,not_removed,i started it four days ago i think hours per day im a bit frustrated with the amount of warriors and shamans im facing in ladder so i thought this would be more productive
hearthstone,not_removed,yes
hearthstone,not_removed,basic cards remaining from classic from naxx from gvg goblins vs gnomes from brm blackrock mountain from tgt the grand tournament from loe league of explorers from wotog whispers of the old gods from onik one night in karazhan from msog mean streets of gadgetzan for a grand total of dcds remaining so were almost halfway there except
hearthstone,not_removed,well it is only letter away
hearthstone,not_removed,we have days in a year meaning daily discussions minus is
hearthstone,not_removed,ooh i guess ill be saving this post then
hearthstone,not_removed,blizz plans to release expansions and adventure each year if we assume each expansion has cards each like wotog and msog had and the adventure has cards like loe and onik then that adds another cards to the pool each calendar year
hearthstone,not_removed,since beginning in july the dcd crew has generated threads which happens to divide evenly by months into threads each month not quite one every day but pretty close twelve months at threads each yields threads per year meaning the crew would essentially cover all the cards for the year plus reducing the backlog of past cards by per year and that means at their current pace the dcd crew will get all caught up right around if by some chance the crew does crank up their pace to a full threads per year then that cuts the catchup timeframe to years instead of assuming hs stays alive that long
hearthstone,not_removed,and now we know blizz plans to release full expansions annually o assuming each of those contains at least cards then were talking cards per year the daily card discussion crew cant ever catch up
hearthstone,not_removed,nourish into raven idol into naturalize into clearing board into burning enemy reno absolutely disgusting
hearthstone,not_removed,but did he life tap to mill another card
hearthstone,not_removed,wait what why didnt he take his headset off and started to scream
hearthstone,not_removed,that was a sweet play
hearthstone,not_removed,thats awesome epic calls but also reno is probably the or card that id want to burn after jaraxxus and leroy
hearthstone,not_removed,did he win in the end
hearthstone,not_removed,great clip if this play was made by a top streamer it would have upvotes
hearthstone,not_removed,credit to httpswwwtwitchtvbonusprimo for the content and uqcree for sharing it
hearthstone,not_removed,what a beautiful turn
hearthstone,not_removed,at first i thought it was pretty common to get naturalise and didnt understand what the big deal of the clip was then the hammer dropped i love it
hearthstone,not_removed,dont think ive ever lold uncontrollably like i just did gf gave me the biggest look of da fuq am i going out with ever but seriously this fml
hearthstone,not_removed,i like how naturalize a card that was previously just terrible can actually be useful now because there are so many reno decks which usually have lots of cards anyway
hearthstone,not_removed,the call on the reno mill is sick
hearthstone,not_removed,the amount of crap that sees front page lately is just absurd
hearthstone,not_removed,credits go to the streamer who can be found at wwwtwitchtvbonusprimo and the op uqcree brought to you by your friendly neighborhood bot happy new year
hearthstone,not_removed,im just glad in not a thjis highlight hes alright by it seems like this has become a thjis or rant only sub lately
hearthstone,not_removed,this is so fucking generic what about this is interesting
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,the rng is not quite that bad here its just a nice turn of events dictated by correct plays
hearthstone,not_removed,knees weak palms sweaty hit life tap ten cards already forsene
hearthstone,not_removed,forsen forsen boys forsen boyyyyys
hearthstone,not_removed,reynad is that you
hearthstone,not_removed,thats why he lost in the end
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think as many warlocks run jaraxxus anymore
hearthstone,not_removed,its tilting as fuck to lose reno when you built this deck for him and kaz
hearthstone,not_removed,nope
hearthstone,not_removed,this one did and he used jaraxxus to win
hearthstone,not_removed,at the very least not many run both leeroy and jaraxxus
hearthstone,not_removed,i still do very crucial card when facing other reno decks or jade druid and jade shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,honestly since control warrior and freeze mage are gone leeroy seems to be a better card than jaraxxus but jaraxxus is still good
hearthstone,not_removed,nah reno isnt the win condition of the deck its more tilting when you lose a win condition which is leeroy combo or jaraxxus hero power which is probably why the player still lost in the video
hearthstone,not_removed,turns out renolock has other ways than reno to generate value
hearthstone,not_removed,jaraxxus still wins by itself against most priests as well
hearthstone,not_removed,his arrogance was his undoing
hearthstone,not_removed,can confirm
hearthstone,not_removed,because both of them usually serve the same purpose in the reno deck theyre both strong finishers in the control matchups you usually will need both finishers in other matchups youre looking for other niche cards that serve very specific purposes
hearthstone,not_removed,cuz theres much aggro deck out there aggro shaman aggro pirate warrior miracle rogue etc dont need too many dead cards when game ends by turn rather have room for heal and wave clear
hearthstone,not_removed,not seen in the clip was him saying several times that he was still somehow going to lose he lost maly to dirty rat shenanigans shortly thereafter so it was pretty even on win condition negations
hearthstone,not_removed,arrogance not quite sure you know what that word means
hearthstone,not_removed,thats a jaraxxus quote trifling gnome
hearthstone,not_removed,oh and btw i think you can stop with your toxic shitposting spam we got it after the first post already
hearthstone,not_removed,youre actually just fucking dumb
hearthstone,not_removed,every player had a chance to win or being voted on being a favorite means you need to deal with pressure regardless of game
hearthstone,not_removed,havent seen anyone this salty about missing out on free packs since this subreddit got htb delayed
hearthstone,not_removed,complaining about free packs also i think that this doesnt hurt thijs stream in the slightest he will still have a large amount of viewers and definitely wont be kicked from actually i dont see what blizzard has to apologise for
hearthstone,not_removed,no this is very serious blizzard is exposing its players to toxicity and this is something that cannot be accepted
hearthstone,not_removed,it is important to take a stance against promotions that promote toxic behavior we cant accept practices like this that hurt their players
hearthstone,not_removed,it is though blizzard is promoting practices that exposed its players to toxicity they need to apologize for this
hearthstone,not_removed,no i am taking a stance against this practice do you think toxic behavior is acceptable and that questioning it is dumb i hope not
hearthstone,not_removed,you mean like you hurting blizzard for bringing up this again and again like a toxic person would do
hearthstone,not_removed,kys
hearthstone,not_removed,we shouldnt just blindly accept problems with blizzards practices we need to take a stance against this toxic promotion instead and encourage blizzard to apologize
hearthstone,not_removed,by far one of the best cards in the whole game the other one being purify
hearthstone,not_removed,you accidentally included a time stamp in your link you need to remove the at the end so it doesnt jump to near the end of the video
hearthstone,not_removed,i love your videos its awesome and hilarious that you chose to do the ragers this time keep up the epic content about the lore in our hearthstone deck
hearthstone,not_removed,you have some sexy voice d have you made totems
hearthstone,not_removed,not really just give it defensive stats to represent tranquility and the ogre effect to represent indecisiveness
hearthstone,not_removed,oh yeah i use purify in every deck even non priest ones
hearthstone,not_removed,to be fair purify is better than a lot of the pack filler cards although theres no question it was the worst card in karazhan
hearthstone,not_removed,what about backstreet leper easily my favorite card i run him in all my control decks and ramp druid
hearthstone,not_removed,rank here we come
hearthstone,not_removed,pompous thespian would like a word with you
hearthstone,not_removed,hmm i suppose
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think pompous thespian is as bad as purify hes an okay card besides being boring cards just have to be busted to be constructedtier these days and hes not busted purify is well as said this card is useless
hearthstone,not_removed,purify actually saw constructed play though
hearthstone,not_removed,thats because purify is more interesting you have no reason to run thespain because its just an unremarkable body with taunt which isnt as good overall as whatever else you could have instead purify fits in very bad but sort of playable combo decks and actually does something there that justifies running it over something else it didnt make silence priest good but it made it better thespian fits in a lot of decks but isnt good enough to make the cut in any of them while purify is considerably worse overall and isnt splashable at all but fits in one particular deck hence it sees more play it also has the meme factor and people trying to make the best of obviously bad cards
hearthstone,not_removed,an uninteresting card that sees no play at all is worse imo
hearthstone,not_removed,this is what yoggsaron is going to do literally unplayable
hearthstone,not_removed,ev expected value of a reroll before the new quests was around gold and is now a bit over gold that means on average youll get around gold if you reroll your a net gain in the long haul that said i keep the im interested in playing and reroll those i think i wont be able to finish off easily the difference of gold just isnt worth it to me to play quests i wont enjoy
hearthstone,not_removed,i havent seen the math to know how likely it is to get one thats worth more but ive been rerolling all of the quests
hearthstone,not_removed,if you want to maximize your gold gains let your quests build up until you have and reroll the lowest value quest then complete the highest value quest do this every day as normal you basically give yourself a quest buffer for rerolling are so common now that i think you can safely reroll them into other or just take them and complete also if you want to maximize gold for buying adventure wings or youre banking gold for next xpac release reroll those useless spectate quests i think most players overvalue that dust
hearthstone,not_removed,i usually keep quest and only do a day just to make room for the new quest that will come in by doing this i am able to sometimes keep and in reserve rerolling a is ok for me if i have another or a i can do for that day the worst outcome if you reroll a is that it turns into a neutral out come is it turns into another disregarding the difficulty of the quests here im simply talking gold however the good out comes would be getting a spectate duel a friend sure the probability to get those may not be that great but at the risk of only losing it is easily worth it
hearthstone,not_removed,does this factor in the fact that a quest queue no longer exists i guess you could reroll until you have and are forced to complete one but seems like you could get stuck with
hearthstone,not_removed,you mean the hidden queue rerolling quests would clear your hidden queue so i dont think the removal of it will have any effect on quest rerolls there is some variance on the ev based on the value of the quest youre rerolling and possibly of the value of the quests youve completed recently i dont know if its still the same but several years ago it used to be that you couldnt get a completed quest again for several days and around a week for the gold quest but ive no idea if its still that way as the infinite reroll bug was fixed a long time ago
hearthstone,not_removed,your game is likely about to crash
hearthstone,not_removed,tempo rogue got me to rank
hearthstone,not_removed,miracle is good and i very much enjoy my nzoth rogue deck
hearthstone,not_removed,basically just miricale now unfortunately
hearthstone,not_removed,nzoth rogue is ok in wild
hearthstone,not_removed,its okay
hearthstone,not_removed,i made a hybrid miracle rogue build which has been pretty good certainly not amazing but it holds its own at rank
hearthstone,not_removed,there is a swashburglarhucksterquesting rogue that is quite good
hearthstone,not_removed,the class is not in a great spot miracle is the best rogue archetype but its terrible against two of these toptier and popular decks aggro shaman and secret hunter its decent against most other decks latest vs data report
hearthstone,not_removed,which tempo rogue like where can i find it
hearthstone,not_removed,httpwwwicyveinscomhearthstoneroguestandarddecks
hearthstone,not_removed,you dont play to win each game you play to win the series drhippi is omega is
hearthstone,not_removed,im a bit lazy is there a place that has deck and player winrate ive done some googling but havent found anything as of yet i would love to see these stats if you have them send them my way
hearthstone,not_removed,this is why you do group stages as a swiss and not doubleelimination
hearthstone,not_removed,in what scenarios do you play differently in a game such that you improve your chances of winning the series but not of winning that game this isnt baseball where you rotate pitchers based partly on how badly you need them tomorrow
hearthstone,not_removed,with such a small group size this doesnt make any difference imo double elim for people is basically everyone against everyone except you leave out the match first against last as it couldnt change anything anyway first is in anyway or last is out anyway or the only thing this might change is the order of both advancing players if you take won games as second criterium which imo feels worse than just taking the direct comparison as the second criterium but taking that as the second criterium doesnt change the outcome compared to double elim which again makes the game first vs last redundant
hearthstone,not_removed,deck choices maybe both before and during the tournament
hearthstone,not_removed,you can avoid playing a tech card that you think you wont need to win in order to hide the information that youre running it
hearthstone,not_removed,i think it does when you are dealing with a card game put simply say you are running tempo mage zoo control warrior druid shaman if you match up against someone that isnt running control warrior your lineup is incredibly favored as you can simply ban shaman leaving your decks with favorable matchups vs other potential metadecks if however you match against someone who is you are going to be hardpressed what swiss does is it eliminates that chance of being matched with someone that simply has a lineup that hardcounters your own it allows for these matchups to dictate the course of the group stages progression far less and for skillconsistency to shine through additionally it tends to promote the competitors to play at a stable level throughout just speaking from experience being in losers bracket fucking sucks even though everyone talks about how they dont tilt you still do at least a bit when you are in lb however in say a round swiss being down after the first rounds doesnt have nearly that same kind of crushing effect you might still end up being it feels like the odds are stacked far less against you
hearthstone,not_removed,decklists are public tho
hearthstone,not_removed,the deck lists are public information
hearthstone,not_removed,i wonder if they can be generated by babbling book and such
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,probably no that will make lots of player tilted plus it doesnt have the spell tag
hearthstone,not_removed,they confirmed you cant generate quests you play with whatever quest you put in your deck and thats the only way
hearthstone,not_removed,if theyre class specific then only the mage one could
hearthstone,not_removed,kabal courier etc
hearthstone,not_removed,since no one actually plays that card now no one has figured out that the treants still have charge on them and that the keyword is just missing
hearthstone,not_removed,known bug
hearthstone,not_removed,yes people have posted this many times before
hearthstone,not_removed,i played steal priest vs dragon priest today the game went into fatigue and lasted almost min we must have played operatives and a shit ton of mind controls even though i lost it was great fun and i added the guy after hes pretty chill too
hearthstone,not_removed,filling my board with with a rogue cthun deck
hearthstone,not_removed,this month i messed with ladder players using astral druid i made it to rank with it and my victories usually were sometimes i went httpmimgurcomalevky but gosh that was a lot funny moments
hearthstone,not_removed,you say we all hate the current meta but for everyone person that says they dont like cookie cutter jade decks or being spammed by pirate warrior theres more playing it on ladder so apparently this current meta is great
hearthstone,not_removed,played against a mage he had health and ice block as a secret so i threw leroyinner ragerampage faceless manipulated him and threw a nightmare onto one two leroys one at and one at damage swing in its his turn he dies to fatigue i didnt even do the math something just seemed better about using my nightmare on only one leroy since i thought i had lost laughed my ass off and tried to friend him he never responded
hearthstone,not_removed,been hunting renolocks with my mill druid deck one time i made the renolock mill his reno kazakus and jaraxxus in turn he conceded after that
hearthstone,not_removed,the time i httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvgysomekvvcq a renolock while messing around with anyfin paladin
hearthstone,not_removed,i picked a mind blast off my kabal courier over value because i thought i was in a good position to smorc the jade druid with some kazakusbuffed guys about four turns later it gave me exact lethal it always feels nice to be rewarded for unorthodox play
hearthstone,not_removed,i like the current meta
hearthstone,not_removed,looks so fun my biggest regret for this standard rotation is not shelling out the dust for shadowcasters to try this deck
hearthstone,not_removed,just because people play the winning decks doesnt mean they like it look at what day said after hitting legend with midrange shaman he said it was the worst experience of hearthstone and i wholeheartedly agree spamming the metaest deck on ladder for tons of games just sucks the soul out of you at least it does for me
hearthstone,not_removed,good thing shadow casters are whisper of the old gods and arent rotating
hearthstone,not_removed,does that explain why im here having fun with a maly hunter i made and today ive ive not played against one deck that isnt card for card from the internet at rank on the last day none of the people im playing against at this rank will make it to legend they dont need wins yet they are playing the same dragon priest decks or jade druids they arent playing for wins they arent aiming to get to legend they are just playing the most op deck they can make because they enjoy beating people with little effort
hearthstone,not_removed,brann is
hearthstone,not_removed,i keep getting dumped after each game
hearthstone,not_removed,im having a different problem every match it says im facing a worthy opponent but it ends up being a pirate warrior or pirate shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,anyone else rooting for cydonia hes one of the few thats been playing really well
hearthstone,not_removed,really glad i picked amnesiac and not thjis
hearthstone,not_removed,amnesiac is looking like a beast
hearthstone,not_removed,rooting for hamster if i had seen the decks he would bring before i cast my vote it would have been on him
hearthstone,not_removed,yessss cydonia is awesome i met him on rcompetitivehs ages ago and hes always been a great player and great guyanswering my noob questions lmao i really think he has highest chance with thijs out of the picture
hearthstone,not_removed,i did the same and its not that i thought thijs would lose early its was more that i wanted to root for people instead of just one
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah hes done really well and im not sure i could point to a single misplay in his cydonia games
hearthstone,not_removed,rhscoaching

hearthstone,not_removed,thanks thanks thanks a lot my server is america and my battle tag is
hearthstone,not_removed,it ok just pointing it out for future reference
hearthstone,not_removed,you may should have added your region zo the initial post eu here
hearthstone,not_removed,the author not noticing the baby curator seems odd given that its the subject of the card and all as for fullart changing your opinion on the card art ancient of lore is one of my favorites since is more beautiful
hearthstone,not_removed,daily reminder that stoneclaw totem is not a snake
hearthstone,not_removed,did they just photoshop a dickbutt into the closeup of stoneclaw totem
hearthstone,not_removed,they missed the hidden spongebob characters spongebob mr krabs and patrick on the httpimgurcomhvyoimc card

hearthstone,not_removed,looking at the art close up is always fascinating couldve done without the captions though
hearthstone,not_removed,turns out humility is under the glowing zangarmarsh mushrooms and is not just funky yellow and blue lighting
hearthstone,not_removed,thats an awful post not a single secret was revealed literally random zoom ins with really terrible subtitles
hearthstone,not_removed,this is all obvious nonsense
hearthstone,not_removed,surprised they dont have s leg trickery in here
hearthstone,not_removed,great post
hearthstone,not_removed,the only one i wasnt aware of was stoneclaw totem
hearthstone,not_removed,great observations a lot of the cards have great full arts that people never see
hearthstone,not_removed,uow
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont know if the post was a trollbait or not but that was a terible secret discovery lul feign death looks pretty alive for a guy pretending to be dead well duh unless you are blind and cant read the card says feign death meaning youre pretending to be dead and the best way to show this is to show you have your eyes opened i wont even talk about the fact taht you dont need a zoom to see his eyes are opened everyone can see that on the card stoneclaw totem it wasnt a snake after all again are you blind since when did you saw a snake thats a murloc head murloc warleader okay it was neither an umbrella nor a black cloud jesus ill ask this for the time are you blind you must be you can clearly see its a sword or at least something hes holding an umbrella jesus fucking christ where does people come up with this ok the only thing surprising is the defender of argus i always thought his shield was bearers faith shield one of the gorgeous shields in wow
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for the new wallpaper on my phone d httpimgurcomldghbjh

hearthstone,not_removed,yes gnome here wasnt referring to the race but the height because goblins are just about as big as gnomes theyre saying they forgot how short he was and saw wrong thinking he was bending but he was actually bowing i saw wrong and thought he was holding a shield not realizing his suit wasnt armour
hearthstone,not_removed,wow thats a good opener for an deck you got really unlucky sorry man
hearthstone,not_removed,your first mistake playing priest oh wait
hearthstone,not_removed,no matter what mode you play trogs rule
hearthstone,not_removed,literally constructed
hearthstone,not_removed,technically you have a guaranteed chance to get a random reward i think the issue is that the lowest tier of the random reward for that box is sooooo much worse than all the other rewards its like good good punch in the genitals good great i suspect if the worst reward was just not quite as bad as a standard common maybe gold or something people would find it less disappointing
hearthstone,not_removed,why is it alright to be rewarded a golden common in arena i got less and a golden flame imp instead thats disgusting
hearthstone,not_removed,the common card replaced dust
hearthstone,not_removed,but the best reward is an entire pack gold thats a ton
hearthstone,not_removed,i know but part of the psychology of rewards system is not making people feel stupid for playing the game humans have far greater aversion to loss than they do desire for reward on average because the worst reward in that box is so so much worse than the average reward it really feels like you got duffed for playing the game as a game designer thats never the feeling you want to give your players
hearthstone,not_removed,all of the adventures apart from naxxramas have had domains that redirect to the bnet page for that adventure im not sure what youre talking about
hearthstone,not_removed,the domain for loe is httpwwwtheleagueofexplorerscom
hearthstone,not_removed,you spelt league wrong and league of explorers had a domain httpwwwtheleagueofexplorerscom please do research before you try to shoot someone down
hearthstone,not_removed,domain owner probably wasnt willing to sell or wanted too much
hearthstone,not_removed,okay
hearthstone,not_removed,last i heard the game has more diverse and competitive decks than ever before im not really certain what you are referring to as the terrible state in this situation unless you just dont like the current aggro heavy meta that would be entirely understandable but also thats just the state card games tend to gravitate towards
hearthstone,not_removed,dont know whats wrong with the state of the game im having a great time
hearthstone,not_removed,well from the weve seen there arent solid enough antiaggro tools just yet
hearthstone,not_removed,if you think its terrible now youll likely think its terrible soon after the next release and the one after that and the one after that
hearthstone,not_removed,no i dont trust blizzard to be able to balance after also firelands portal being a common should be proof enough
hearthstone,not_removed,warriors in high eu legends so diverse
hearthstone,not_removed,the top decks are all aggro decks the game has almost no successful decks that require actual decision making any deck that requires thought is punished by a no thinking deck like shaman dragon warrior or these aggressive zoo decks the only diverse class in the game is warrior priest is dead paladin is almost dead shaman dominates early game theres many games decided by horseshit rng like if a healing totem is summoned to fuck up your board clear or if totem golemmana tide spawns off tuskarr etc overall the game is at its worst in my time playing it ive been playing since before tgt now hs is all about snowballing the games are won by turn and its entirely based on drawing curve not decisions theres hardly any antiaggro and almost no decent comeback mechanics for the majority of classes even reno is too slow these days
hearthstone,not_removed,i think this is the most aggro meta weve ever had control has been getting consistently worse as expansions come out and after the standardwog dust settled aggro is more dominant than ever
hearthstone,not_removed,do you enjoy aggro decks if so you wouldnt see the problem p a lot of people want a metagame where you arent hamstringing yourself if you decide to play a different archetype in a perfect metagame youll have at least a couple viable aggro control and combo decks right now aggro is miles ahead
hearthstone,not_removed,whoever decided firelands portal should be a common card definitely never played any arena screw him blizzard not giving any fuck about arena balance really remind me about wow arena balance where it was obvious you were considered a second zone citizen compared to pve or even battlegrounds even though they kept saying it wasnt the case only a few changes would help but they still dont even want to bother well i dont care i play mainly constructed now but still blizzard never changes
hearthstone,not_removed,i hate the no thinking argument lol go get legend tonight with one of those decks if its so easy
hearthstone,not_removed,what tier list are you referring to for this i just checked ts yes i know but its generally at least somewhat accurate and the top three decks are dragon control warrior aggro shaman and yogg druid this is followed by zoolock and midrange shaman i guess its going to come down to whatever tier list you subscribe to but i thought it was at least pretty universally acknowledged that a form of control warrior is dominant at this moment as for your curve argument i can see why you might say that i disagree but its such a large part of the game that i can see how someone could arrive at it being the only thing that matters
hearthstone,not_removed,it is definitely not the most aggro weve ever had that was back in the undertaker meta also there isnt that much aggro in the metagame rn according to vs only of the tier decks are aggro zooshaman in terms amount played aggro makes up about of the meta so no we arent in an aggro meta
hearthstone,not_removed,im not going to argue that there arent a lot of aggro decks to be found but midrange and control warrior decks have been pretty dominant the past month at least as for your suggestion that aggro is getting more dominant the longer the expansion comes out well yeah i even said that initially card games especially with hs mechanics naturally gravitate towards aggro youd have to look at the diversity of those decks and how they carry out their business to judge the health of the meta at least in tempo storm ranking the top only has two aggro decks and tier is all midrange and control now maybe youre running in to a disproportionate amount of zoolocks and aggro shamans regardless out of the viable decks in the current meta aggro appears to be in the minority edit im not trying to suggest youre an idiot or say that aggro is the best way to play im just trying to say that any expansion that comes out is eventually going to settle on an aggro meta same for mtg same for hs same for duelyst same for elder scrolls legends when it comes out this expansion cant fix the meta because the meta is exactly where wed expect it to be any time
hearthstone,not_removed,except that is exactly what we have there are top aggro decks zoo and aggro shaman lots of top midrange decks dragon warrior midrange shaman midrange hunter tempo mage yogg druid a few top control decks cthun warrior renolock and a great combo deck in worgen warrior seems pretty healthy to me
hearthstone,not_removed,the top decks are all midrange right now and there are a fair few viable control decks like renolock and cthun warrior the meta is pretty healthy outside of the lack of priest and paladin
hearthstone,not_removed,what huge decisions are you making with those decks if i actually had the time and could stand playing a deck i hated for twothree weeks i guarantee i could get legend with any of dragon warrior face shaman or zoo the number of dumb zoo players at high ranks who tap last make shitty trades and still win is shocking shaman you just play whatevers in your hand and overpower the opponent with your op early game minions dragon warrior is just a straight up curvebased tempo deck just play curve and you win not a single choice to be made just play your mana charge and your mana all the way to the bank i only ever played control priest and malygos rogue prestandard and i regularly got to rank with those much more difficult decks where you lose for even one mistake i havent played hs at all since a couple weeks after wotog because both decks arent even a shade of their former selves i want to go back but i hate what i see from watching streams these shitty decks run amok getting legend with these is just about having the time and the will to get to legend
hearthstone,not_removed,dragon control warrior what deck is that ive heard people call it either dragon warrior or draggro as in dragon aggro they play a mana charge and a mana how is this a control deck midrange shaman is an extremely aggro deck as far as midrange decks are concerned almost like midrangehybrid hunter from before where they just throw in a few cards that cost mana and now its midrange there is only one good control deck in the game and its for the only class that can actually support diverse deck types warrior every other class is either weak andor onedimensional perhaps warlock is the only exception because it can play either zoo or renolock thats about where the diverse ball stops though
hearthstone,not_removed,a meta is not healthy when one or more classes have no decks to play with you want a healthy meta i say the post loe one was pretty good enjoy it but they took to much to release new content and it became stale now with this meta you cant say to me that is healthy when warrior has like archetype and priest has you dare to say there is one because there is none at least none good
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think its actually any better than the inspire cards that are in tgt in paladin for instance its worse than silver hand regent in druid its much worse than savage combatant barring silly majordomo combos it doesnt seem worth it
hearthstone,not_removed,are you insane i already think that justicar with warrior is too op
hearthstone,not_removed,so much work put into a cac honestly itd be more playable as a battlecry though that way you could just curve into inspire minions as it works now it just makes inspire more snowbally when you get it working
hearthstone,not_removed,the problem id have with this card is that it just moves too slow and has a poor stat line inspire has never been bad because of its potential power inspire has been subpar because there are just consistently better options the glaring issue always having been they have poor stats and the cost of making use of them is their mana cost it ends up being tempo loss every time think about it this way in order for your card to see its use you have to play it either turn with a coin or turn or beyond a at turn and two hero powers is not going to offset the power discrepancy between it and a cost card two that come to mind are cairne and sylvanas do you really see this card outpowering those two just from doubling up a hero power best case scenario you heal yourself twice with priest before one of those two minions kill yours and is still on the board to be dealt with dont get me wrong i love the idea of inspire cards i wish the game was somehow slow enough to make decks around them because they have a lot of neat affects the game has just never been in a state that would make them dominant over other cards and im afraid yours wouldnt accomplish it
hearthstone,not_removed,according to blizzard its not great design because they already stated that the problem with inspire was its too snowbally so they kept its power level low basically inspire is poorly designed and therefore a powerful card supporting it is poor design
hearthstone,not_removed,this would just get removed there is a very good card on paper that was released in tgt which is called crowd favorite you always have something with a battlecry to enable it next turn so its a guaranteed for which is not straightup awesome but very decent question do you ever see it being played
hearthstone,not_removed,quality shit post
hearthstone,not_removed,inferno inferno inferno inferno inferno inferno inferno inferno
hearthstone,not_removed,another neutral with great rogue hero power synergy
hearthstone,not_removed,no the card is pretty shit
hearthstone,not_removed,just post this to rcustomhearthstone please
hearthstone,not_removed,the card as is doesnt really stand out from the currently existing inspire cards already in the game now if it was a
hearthstone,not_removed,i run a inspire priest deck and it seems fine i think if you just open enough packs you can find enough cards to make an inspired anything pro tip inspire priest works best with when a character is healed cards and frost giant the giant and be replaced with another giant but its a good idea
hearthstone,not_removed,wouldnt hunter break this card in half you now have a mustanswer threat on board at mana your worst case is burning for every turn your high end is apparently damage per turn with creatures on board to deal more
hearthstone,not_removed,tgt was a big failure when i think about that set i can only come up with justicar too few other cards from that set have seen actuall play its sad actually
hearthstone,not_removed,what they should have done is maybe something like that nexus champion saarad same stat and cost battlecry and inspire add a random spell to your hand and same thing with other inspire cards some being redesigned with this idea not to be too strong
hearthstone,not_removed,the card is unplayable in rogue without poisoned blade thats bad design
hearthstone,not_removed,would probably just be used to make control warrior more obnoxious
hearthstone,not_removed,does this mean that warlock would draw twice for two health and two mana if thats the case the card would be completely broken
hearthstone,not_removed,in an interview they said that a lot of the inspire cards were nerfed during playtesting because the games would snowball too often with stronger inspire cards
hearthstone,not_removed,i would have been overjoyed to see a card like this exist
hearthstone,not_removed,itt people who apparently dont think cards for nonladder competitive decks should exist
hearthstone,not_removed,truly this is some really high quality content that everyone wants thanks for the shitpost friend
hearthstone,not_removed,its not what it does alone its what it does with justicar and other synergy cards damage anywhere druid casting bite for mana every turn a dagger that replaces itself with a dagger the possibilities are endless
hearthstone,not_removed,on its own i dont think it has any potential for constructed parred with garrison commander andor some kind of upgraded hero power however you would be able to generate meaningful value see the deck section right now the only hero power modifying card thats really played is justicar for cards like and to be played in hightier decks i believe some more hero power amplification is needed this is my take on such a card
hearthstone,not_removed,it could be kinda broken with coldarra drake thats damage if you could get them to stick
hearthstone,not_removed,no no no no this is great card design why would op lie about a card he made s
hearthstone,not_removed,what would you take out of warrior to make space for this card without justicar it would be a mana that gives two armor maybe another two if youre lucky it survives really not worth a spot after drawing and playing justicar which makes it a lot weaker as its not played oncurve you now have a mana that gives you four armor possibly four more if it survives if it survives it might look decent enough for a spot but the keyword is if if you rely on cards surviving there are cards much more snowbally than this one brann emperor etc i dont think it would have any home in cw
hearthstone,not_removed,it doesnt trigger inspire effects twice only whatever your hero power actually does your wording might me a little smoother and slightly less snowballing but it would lose synergy with garrison commander which kills a lot of the combo potential which is half the reason anyone would bother with this card
hearthstone,not_removed,i think you hit the nail on the head this card does have crazy synergy with other cards but i think its asking a little too much to have other inspire cards survive on the board
hearthstone,not_removed,the problem with inspire in a nutshell if it triggers once it was either too weak or balanced but in that case the minion might as well cost more but if it triggers twice you win the game which makes it dumb text
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think this card is any like crowd favorite yes if you just drop it and end your turn you might not get any value that applies to half of the cards in this game but if you hero power the turn its played you can get value immediate on top of a body if this card were ever used in constructed though it would probably be part of some combo not something you just drop like crowd favorite
hearthstone,not_removed,not like usually but before standard i made a battlecry shaman with crowd favorite and rumbling elemental and cf actually did pretty well
hearthstone,not_removed,i did and then i posted it here the voting system can decide if its welcome or not
hearthstone,not_removed,dont forget to make it shaman only other classes dont need the double hero power anyways
hearthstone,not_removed,i think it would draw twice for health and mana
hearthstone,not_removed,why are you being so rude
hearthstone,not_removed,armor residentsleeper
hearthstone,not_removed,a dagger that replaces itself with a dagger one of these is not like the others
hearthstone,not_removed,justicar was the card that needed to be removed from tgt
hearthstone,not_removed,if you can get a drop and a drop to stick you probably win anyway
hearthstone,not_removed,to be fair this card wouldnt make tank up much more powerful than it already is considering that in a cw deck this guy would essentially have taunt gaining armor and playing a for mana may seem pretty crazy until you remember that ancient shieldbearer gives you more armor for more mana and both instances require a certain amount of setup justicar being played vs cthun being powered to a and provide a fairly sizeable board threat that is pretty easily answered for their mana cost
hearthstone,not_removed,well theres the hero power itself factoring in to calling it mana so its more like a mana that gives four armor or with justicar a mana that gives eight armor
hearthstone,not_removed,well the minion is a threat will need to remove it and sometimes you would need to spend a spell or trade a good minion to kill it but youre right i dont think inspire minions have any home in this meta
hearthstone,not_removed,or you hang on to it until you and your opponent start hitting fatigue so its harder for them to clear it and you have no problems making it to fatigue because youre cw
hearthstone,not_removed,idk if the idea is to make inspire good battlecry is just better if your plan is to make cards that make inspire better better then sure yay garrison commander
hearthstone,not_removed,nah i did exactly the same with one cf that i had it was good when it worked but it mostly didnt
hearthstone,not_removed,justicar makes it mana no health
hearthstone,not_removed,blizzard coulc print a card a called pile of shit and it will still be vialbe in warrior compared to others
hearthstone,not_removed,justice was the card that made tgt worth it lol
hearthstone,not_removed,wtf are you talking about shieldmaiden dont need any set up p
hearthstone,not_removed,but triggering the effect of your hero power twice isnt the same as the justicar version of the hero power so the second trigger would also have the effect draw a card and take damage
hearthstone,not_removed,pile of shit you mistyped tentacles for arms
hearthstone,not_removed,wtf are you talking about and who mentioned shieldmaiden read twice commenting my tip for a beeing a less awkward redditor
hearthstone,not_removed,it was funny how trump said it is useable in some decks he created several decks after that and in the best case it did something like face damage in fatigue battle some cards are just not worth the effort
hearthstone,not_removed,tenteacle for arms is great in a fatigue match up its just that no one goes into fatigue anymore
hearthstone,not_removed,and the thing us gorehowl exists if you want to play a card that is a ton of value but high mana cost very slow and will use your life pool gorehowl is your man repeatedly paying mana to deal some face damage isnt worth it very often
hearthstone,not_removed,tentacles for arms is supposed to hit face in fatigue so you gain and deal every turn
hearthstone,not_removed,its a wow thing but i suppose its semihearthstone related
hearthstone,not_removed,hey there unfortunately your submission has been removed because it is unrelated to hearthstone all submissions must in some way relate to the game of hearthstone the greater hearthstone community or this subreddit posts about the community its members and hearthstone drama must be either related to the game of hearthstone or the career of a community member the personal lives of a community member are not considered relevant to hearthstone if youre not familiar with the subreddit rules you can read them httpwwwredditcomrhearthstonewikirules have a question or think your post doesnt break the rules
hearthstone,not_removed,literally my entire friendlist does this
hearthstone,not_removed,we are in the process of coordinating this with battlenet and the other game teams because our social system is a crossgame system wow hearthstone heroes adding this functionality is not trivial for us so what theyre saying is that the technology isnt there yet
hearthstone,not_removed,finally yay
hearthstone,not_removed,is this going to be exclusive only to overwatch otherwise were gonna need a designer insights with ben brode to explain how team could be so off the ball
hearthstone,not_removed,hopefully a decent first step is just knowing that we arent opposed to the idea and want to embrace it frankly im a bit dumbfounded by this appear offline was first mentioned over four fucking years ago and the fact that it never came was attributed to higherups deciding they didnt like it now after hearing literally nothing for four years all of a sudden theyre not opposed to the idea um okay when did that change because obviously somebody was opposed to it for a quite a while or we would have it by now
hearthstone,not_removed,i like how open the overwatch team is on these things wish the same were true for hearthstone what i find interesting is they integrated live streaming voice chat within the battlenet client but still cant deliver an appear offline mode
hearthstone,not_removed,this will be good for goblins gold makers in wow no longer have to worry about friends going to watch and undercut you
hearthstone,not_removed,pretty sure thats why theyve held off for so long
hearthstone,not_removed,its in the works coming soontm
hearthstone,not_removed,no the overwatch comment explains that all blizzard teams have to work together to launch the feature for all games simultaneously
hearthstone,not_removed,honestly i think its just that the overwatch team which seems to my outside eye to be the most involved with their respective community is pressuring the other teams to make this it been requested for a while but you have to get all teams if you count the battlenet team to add the functionality which could be alot of effort when each team has their own priority lists and schedules
hearthstone,not_removed,doesnt seem super clear to me they might just be working together to launch the feature for overwatch jeff said we would like to add an appear offline option to overwatch not we would like to add an appear offline option to battlenet
hearthstone,not_removed,but four years ago they announced the feature on the official blogs of all three games that were out at the time making an announcement like that without having all of the teams on board seems really dumb which is why everyone assumes that all the teams were on board when they announced it and then something changed thats what i dont get
hearthstone,not_removed,not the tgt board not a fruit fairly rare the golden turnip is rarer than the boot
hearthstone,not_removed,httphearthstonewikiacomwikigameboards
hearthstone,not_removed,up vote for rhyming
hearthstone,not_removed,woops blanked a bit there thanks for clarifying
hearthstone,not_removed,i had reno telling me no to pick him one time lol
hearthstone,not_removed,actually managed to get mimirons head effect off in arena discovered mimirons from the gorilla bot so naturally had few mechs on board was best stats as well so win win opponent stayed and let me hit him in the face with it turns felt pretty fucking good
hearthstone,not_removed,we need a four drop
hearthstone,not_removed,sorry for asking but would you mind tell me the name of that porgramm
hearthstone,not_removed,your deck looks preeeeeeeetty good already
hearthstone,not_removed,and pagle has synergy with stormwind champion why because they can both be dropped in the same turn i dont understand
hearthstone,not_removed,plumbst you little goob
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont play arena but i was wondering do theese things actually help
hearthstone,not_removed,how do you get heart areana numbers to appear in client i have to type them in
hearthstone,not_removed,whats this extension
hearthstone,not_removed,fantastic
hearthstone,not_removed,what app is this
hearthstone,not_removed,whats the point of drafting if you just use a program to pick all the cards
hearthstone,not_removed,that site has only ever made my runs worse
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean the helper is randomized so yeah its unbiased and shes not wrong shes the best choice there since the body is good and the effect can be good if it goes off
hearthstone,not_removed,such a humble man
hearthstone,not_removed,i pulled it off once as well i got mimiron from unstable portal
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,i pulled voltron once in arena when i had two mechs on my board and mirror entity then my opponent played mimirons head props to him for letting me attack with voltron and not conceding
hearthstone,not_removed,yup same happened to me in a rogue deck i think and the turn after i had dark iron dwarf and it him
hearthstone,not_removed,that was me unless someone else lived the dream had no removal weapons or board as warrior feelsbadman
hearthstone,not_removed,did you get two mimirons was it on eu if so it mightve been me
hearthstone,not_removed,well he only has two drops in the deck so yeah usually youd want more than that
hearthstone,not_removed,four mana card
hearthstone,not_removed,im surprised theres no mana memes
hearthstone,not_removed,these reasons on heartharena are so random sometimes have two and two so far pick this because it makes up for our lack of
hearthstone,not_removed,this i suck dick at arena and would use a little help just in the few first runs to get the general idea of getting a decent arena deck
hearthstone,not_removed,looks pretty bad the early game is awful and the rest isnt absurdly good enough to make up for it could be salvaged with the rest of the draft but at this rate it doesnt look good
hearthstone,not_removed,drops u serious
hearthstone,not_removed,as well as muklas champion i suppose its counting things that let him attack
hearthstone,not_removed,l u l
hearthstone,not_removed,yes if you dont know how to judge card value in arena very well
hearthstone,not_removed,i think its using the overwolf client try searching overwolf heartharena
hearthstone,not_removed,atm
hearthstone,not_removed,heartharena companion overwolf overlay
hearthstone,not_removed,im a ftp player arena is the best way to acquire cards to use in constructed i use arena as a means to an end rather than my goal
hearthstone,not_removed,friendly reminder
hearthstone,not_removed,ye i miss my free wins against full taunt arena decks as well
hearthstone,not_removed,and then you went to tempostorm meta snapshot and copied the highest rated warrior deck
hearthstone,not_removed,you should see a doctor about that
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel like that drafting programs kinda ruin it
hearthstone,not_removed,all of the best players use tier lists if youre not using them at least for referencecomparing what you believe youre probably not very good at arena
hearthstone,not_removed,i know it was a joke p
hearthstone,not_removed,you must be really fun at parties
hearthstone,not_removed,humble he doesnt want to share his riches with you
hearthstone,not_removed,did that in a tournament a few months ago my opponent seemed to have forgotten that boom bots are mechs
hearthstone,not_removed,same here got mimiron from effigy and a mech from unstable portal had another mech on the board already at the time
hearthstone,not_removed,does voltron not get added to the new voltron
hearthstone,not_removed,paladin has so many good mana cards thoughblessing of king true silver consecration keeper
hearthstone,not_removed,i know just the one
hearthstone,not_removed,look above you
hearthstone,not_removed,a drop can also be a drop play because you always have the option to play the drop and then hero power that is why when you have an equal number of both and probably if the power level of the choices are not two far apart it suggests the two drop since you can play it turn as well
hearthstone,not_removed,do you like using that program or have a good experience with it i tried using it but first i had to install lots of other stuff like a browser and steamcopy and so on and then it didnt look like on this screenshot first i couldnt get the overlay to work properly but maybe just because im stupid and then there were lots of buttons always over the screen and in the edge of the screen there was always this window with advertisement for mobile games or browser games and stuff it also kept opening the builtin browser for random reasons when i didnt even want to have that did i do something wrong or how do you get only this heartharena overlay without all this random stuff annoying you i might give it another chance if others had good experiences with it
hearthstone,not_removed,anyone out there know if something like this exists for mac
hearthstone,not_removed,ah man this is not fair now i have to get some other program just to be on their level
hearthstone,not_removed,i played with that program when i was new went the same week i installed hearthstone with days spent leveling heroes now i dont use it and have been on a win streak painfully long
hearthstone,not_removed,it doesnt even matter sometimes though ill run this and still get stomped to the ground by assholes that somehow have amazing decks at sometimes arena is all about luck and even if you have a great deck you might run into that jerk that has a perfect counter deck to yours a time or two and your run is shot
hearthstone,not_removed,heartharena httpwwwheartharenacomoverwolf
hearthstone,not_removed,full deck at right now relatively good luck with not getting run over turn
hearthstone,not_removed,excellent card quality for the rest yeah he could use some early drops but he has cards to go
hearthstone,not_removed,its also nice for keeping track of synergy
hearthstone,not_removed,boom headshot
hearthstone,not_removed,joke what is joke
hearthstone,not_removed,party hat flair helps with that
hearthstone,not_removed,dont worry hes just jealous of elise because shes a better waifu than reno
hearthstone,not_removed,im gonna be rich
hearthstone,not_removed,silly question but does the deathrattle go off in this situation
hearthstone,not_removed,so heres how it works step kel and mimiron parts on field step online step minions killed by mimiron come back at the end step turn mimiron is created but all come back repeat until all spaces are filled with mimiron
hearthstone,not_removed,that doesnt matter if you dont actually have them i also wouldnt call keeper a drop unless you already have a token on the board or your enemy has a big minion
hearthstone,not_removed,only keeper there is actually a four drop true silver is at least a turn play but bok and consecrate are both entirely too likely to not be playable on turn keeper is still understated though and you only really want to play it if youre getting benefit off of the effect
hearthstone,not_removed,youre not wrong and if we were pics earlier id agree with you completely at pick you need to be looking at your curve and fill the holes as best you can because youre probably not going to fill all the holes with perfect cards
hearthstone,not_removed,its eerie statue isnt it
hearthstone,not_removed,oh oh i know i know a class based overpowered drop its murloc knight
hearthstone,not_removed,thats true but it would make more sense if we had enough already but if are missing too then the obvious reason would be pick it because we need
hearthstone,not_removed,got from zero wins to threefour and now regularly with this program also had my first and only wins with it
hearthstone,not_removed,do you like using that program or have a good experience with it i enjoy using it from time to time i usually use it as a guessing game during the draft what would i pick here does it agreedisagree with me should i consider what it is saying make pick i usually have a decent idea of which of the three cards i should pick but it is good at swaying my opinion when theres bad card and two average ones
hearthstone,not_removed,writing from memory here so this may not be perfect information it installs overwolf which is the equivalent of what battlenet is for hearthstone shifttab brings up the overwolf menu when its running and you click the innkeepers face to launch heartharena you can hide overwolf after that the little popup is just so you can sign into their site so your runs can be stored if you care about that you can click the minus sign on it to minimize it into a little innkeeper face you can also change the setting in that same popup just look around at the options i turned off their browser autoloading upon starting an arena run hope this helps
hearthstone,not_removed,not really it just gives you information they already had a site before they made the app all the app does is let you skip manually entering your options
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah k ive used it the last probably runs and i finally got to wins
hearthstone,not_removed,you will always have variance but your average will still be good if youre a good player see kripp ratsmah grinning goat guardsmanbob hafu etc
hearthstone,not_removed,looks like you ended up with a reasonable amount of early game or at least enough to avoid getting destroyed immediately that being said though i dont think this is usually a win deck so great job piloting it
hearthstone,not_removed,in which he might or might not get more than drops which could also be bad skipping your turn is often game losing
hearthstone,not_removed,theres a difference between helpful advice and dependence if youre learning arena its definitely a valuable and great tool if youre high skill player then you probably shouldnt have to use it even still you can choose to go against the hearth arena suggestions no one should be ashamed to use it no one should be reliant on it
hearthstone,not_removed,i think its fine to do a mix i dont necessarily think you should use a drafting program for every single run but its really really good for new players who might have trouble even getting wins in arena for a long time most people look up or cards on tier lists on every draft if theres a really difficult pick plus good players dont go with drafting softwares every single pick it can just add another perspective if youre using it right youre not blindly following it but just treating it as a friend sitting next to you giving you advice on some picks
hearthstone,not_removed,the boombots are destroyed so yep
hearthstone,not_removed,they do mimirons head creates a forced death phase for the mechs involved
hearthstone,not_removed,well if your board is weak you might have to play it anyway without any other options youd have to do it just for tempo
hearthstone,not_removed,if you look at the curve he needs drops more than drops
hearthstone,not_removed,war golem from portal
hearthstone,not_removed,it better have value two cards at scares me
hearthstone,not_removed,it depends on the class thoughin rogue you dont need a lot of so it could be prioritizing turn plays above turn since rogues hero power is so strong on turn turn is also more important than turn in arena thats when you get significantly more powerful minions
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah their card drafting is great im using the heartharena website for that already just typing in the cards there but what about the program for the overlay
hearthstone,not_removed,my issue with arena isnt drafting cards but doing in game plays which it doesnt help with watching kripps steam i play a game where i try and guess which card will be selected before the overlay pops up and i only miss cards in a deck
hearthstone,not_removed,i installed it while i was drafting hoping it would help me it took too long to install i made the deck myself and the program slowed the shit out of the game causing me to lose the first match i went like i fucking hate my life
hearthstone,not_removed,but i didnt even know about the site
hearthstone,not_removed,have someone spec you i think you are making some major mistakes in gameplay
hearthstone,not_removed,i can maybe help you with arena if you are on eu if you are just pm your account name p im infinite arena player although i dont play that much hearthstone anymore
hearthstone,not_removed,pm me your battlenet id if youre on na and ill spec you and point out mistakes
hearthstone,not_removed,what the other guy said you could pm me your name and region im not the best but i have a lot of experience and usually do pretty well id spectate you
hearthstone,not_removed,and crashed the game when it killed clockwork gnome or yeti source my game and hearth got crushed when i pulled the dream at wins only to break the game hope it got fixed
hearthstone,not_removed,let me guess you struggle getting more than wins in arena and blame the randomness of the game
hearthstone,not_removed,you definitely want a lot drops as rogue hero powering is just so awful for tempo rogue in arena wants to just get on the board from the start and win early through tempo it has a very bad late game
hearthstone,not_removed,the program is fine but its done through over wolf which is a party overlay program sounds like you messed up somewhere along the line it should be as simple as installing over wolf and then installing the overlay i recommend it it makes drafting a lot smoother
hearthstone,not_removed,this is just heartharena with an overlay makes it much easier to draft some people complain about how it hogs too much memory but i personally have not had that problem
hearthstone,not_removed,well since turn by turn plays like you said is your problem you should also spend each turn maybe at least the ones that arent entirely obvious predicting what kripp should do and see if you were right if he explains why he did a certain move you can learn from it since you can be almost certain that the move that kripp makes is the right one
hearthstone,not_removed,well now you know i was just pointing out that you dont have to get some other program because its available in web form its got a good ranking system but if youve been playing the game long enough it basically just speeds up your draft because you dont need to think about synergies and your curve as much it helps out new players in building a good deck but it cant pilot it for them
hearthstone,not_removed,or youre cursed
hearthstone,not_removed,i play arena on the us server and have a shaman deck ready to go could i add you
hearthstone,not_removed,this community is so nice
hearthstone,not_removed,yep its fixed
hearthstone,not_removed,im sure it did when the poison seeds change was reverted they both force deaths
hearthstone,not_removed,haha no i just feel like if they have an answer to two drops and i dont have card draw im screwed
hearthstone,not_removed,yes
hearthstone,not_removed,im on eu sorry
hearthstone,not_removed,id just rather have arena become less of a mystery to people fresh blood
hearthstone,not_removed,yes i got reversing switch too so it was damage mirmiron lethal im glad its fixed so no one else has one of the most awesome plays in hearthstone crushed
hearthstone,not_removed,yea but if you do drop and a mostly meaningless hero power you probably just get out tempoed
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,oh crap meant to say i use arena on the eu server so that i dont have to spend gold on my main
hearthstone,not_removed,whats your name p
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,i favorite is when im trying to quickly do a quest before midnight in casual mode and my opponent is thinking about their play for seconds on turn ya bastards its not a blizcon tournament its god damn casual mode
hearthstone,not_removed,i rope every priest and warrior anything to slow down their rank climb
hearthstone,not_removed,i have the same problem and i just concede and look for new opponent if they rope twice in as many turns im done i dont have forever to play and its just casual
hearthstone,not_removed,you seem nice
hearthstone,not_removed,rank climbing in hearthstone lol dont make me laugh
hearthstone,not_removed,crazy how mad people get i laughed at your comment and now i want to do the same who the fuck is so angry to downvote
hearthstone,not_removed,i always want to do that but i dont want to reward that behavior
hearthstone,not_removed,exactly i feel if i concede to a roper at any point in the game it lets them feel that they get free wins by roping the tits out of people
hearthstone,not_removed,let me clarify i only do it in casual never on latter i agree i dont like giving for wins but in casual really who cares most of the time it is just slow players as far as i can tell
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont get it
hearthstone,not_removed,you shouldnt be too happy now you have no dinner tonight
hearthstone,not_removed,o i could always only get it to two boots you sir deserve a medal
hearthstone,not_removed,bottom right boots
hearthstone,not_removed,credits go to the streamer who can be found at and the op uijustgotapentakill brought to you by your friendly neighborhood bot happy new year
hearthstone,not_removed,clearly hes not very skilled
hearthstone,not_removed,the card back is their incentive to persuade you to spend cash and not gold that and the fact that its better value that way theyre even doing smaller bundles last two or three wings with the same pricing of per wing for those who realise the error of their ways part way through and want to switch from gold to cash and still make the saving
hearthstone,not_removed,they said its for buyers only
hearthstone,not_removed,i think i may be wrong though that you have to spend some money at least to get it next week before it comes out im almost positive previous adventures only let you buy wings as they went live after the first wing however i cant say for sure if you wont get the card back by just giving gold for the first wing and buying the rest with gold later
hearthstone,not_removed,pretty sure you have to spend money on it seeing as you cant buy the wings for gold until the week they come out assuming its like every adventure to this date
hearthstone,not_removed,ok thanks thats kind of shitty tbh but then again blizzard has always been greedy that way
hearthstone,not_removed,brm had a pre purchase card back that you couldnt get with gold so were assuming itll be the same this time
hearthstone,not_removed,yea i wasnt sure if you could get the backs for the other ones through gold i just payed for them since i play too sporadically to save up properly so i couldnt say for sure i just knew you couldnt buy all wings day with gold though that alone is a good indication that you would have to use money for the card back
hearthstone,not_removed,its a one mana if youre playing control you dont care about your opponents life total you just care that you got a very wellstatted minion
hearthstone,not_removed,in class like priest you can also buff it with pws and velens chosen and it can even live until auchenai soulpriest turn and then when it dies it deals damage to the opponent
hearthstone,not_removed,in todays meta it would almost deal with a small time bucanner opener thats insane
hearthstone,not_removed,if you can drop the chow on it will compete with drops and even often drops the health the opposition hero gains a lot of the time isnt even full health heck sometimes its none because they havent dropped below as youre just trading minions
hearthstone,not_removed,whats so good about playing two drops for one mana
hearthstone,not_removed,its an amazing anti aggro card you never care about the health against aggro so it didnt really have a drawback it was kind of useless against control but everyone used it so it didnt matter much
hearthstone,not_removed,easy board control for the first turns at least and the heal is more often than not meaningless because the enemy wont have taken damage while youre doing board control a strong opener and its deathrattle rarely helps your opponent
hearthstone,not_removed,it would often trade for and since your opponent was usually still at the deathrattle didnt matter and it was fun in gimick priest decks
hearthstone,not_removed,it trades times on average you can kill the average drop because vanilla stats are than you can trade into most drops with the stat distribution
hearthstone,not_removed,how do you not see how good that card is face damage makes no difference on turn or if you are a control deck the card is soooo good in arena its almost an auto pick in most scenarios the health is a non issue when it eats drops and then damages a or drop do you only smorc or something
hearthstone,not_removed,another day i was playing wild using a midrange paladin deck and i had in my hand chow chow coin minibot and muster i thought there is no way the pirate warrior is going to be able to gain early board control against this how wrong i wasi even drew shredder on and peacekeeper on but he was not only able to deal with this curve but also kill me on turn its crazy how easily they can gain board control in the first few turns
hearthstone,not_removed,seriously edit ah sarcasm im a dipshit sorry
hearthstone,not_removed,was no gimmick decktrumpthe streamer not the president won his first tournament on its back and was considered tier ppl realized that huntertaker did the same thing only faster and easier editlink to the decklist
hearthstone,not_removed,cool undertaker nerf was a few months before i started so a bit before my time i guess
hearthstone,not_removed,good thing for your sanity it was huntertaker of the time you queued back in the day
hearthstone,not_removed,jesus christ
hearthstone,not_removed,i think it wont draw cause deathwing says to destroy all minioms before it says discard all cards but it can draw if they happen at the sametime cause deathwing is placed after the imp
hearthstone,not_removed,deathwing buffs tiny knight of evil before it dies so i assume imp of malchezaar will refill your hand before it dies deathwing marks all minions for death and discards your hand at the same time then the minions die after his effect is resolved this means that imp of malchezaar will still be alive as your hand is getting discarded
hearthstone,not_removed,i believe it would draw you a single card regardless of number of cards discarded unless your hand was empty but need to actually see the card in action to be sure
hearthstone,not_removed,prediction we will a see trolden video with impastral communion interaction
hearthstone,not_removed,based off the presedance in which it is possible to one shot an opponent with fists of jarraxus with malygoss on board it should refill your hand
hearthstone,not_removed,i just assumed that you would draw a card per card discarded but this actually makes sense too we just dont know if cards get discarded one by one or if discard you hand or two cards in doomguard etc is just one action
hearthstone,not_removed,it draws cards as many as discarded by the way its written
hearthstone,not_removed,that should only be damage but the point still stands
hearthstone,not_removed,you might be right because the card text is identical to tiny knight of evil and that card gets buffs per card discarded though i never tried it with dw
hearthstone,not_removed,thats how usually rank games go ps apply cold water to the burn
hearthstone,not_removed,try rank i can understand why you would think its rank though seeing as you never made it past rank ps apply for disability welfare if you ever recover ucyberbeni
hearthstone,not_removed,top quality banter fellows actually both of you for the jolly good show
hearthstone,not_removed,christ mate its a joke calm down
hearthstone,not_removed,yes we can have an anti armor card fun fact blizzard would be allowed to make an anti armor card without making an anti stealth card first the more you know
hearthstone,not_removed,anything that deals damage is an anti armor card
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,every time i propose something like this on rcustomhearthstone the warriors go crazy like theres some sacred fucking rule that they have to be able to gain unassailable armor or the game is broken
hearthstone,not_removed,mana stealth this minion deals double damage against armored targets might be fun
hearthstone,not_removed,i think ahving such a card would be pretty weird as it is useless against classes and even in that class only useful against heavy controlfatigue seeing the new jade golem emchanic i dont hink control wariiors with armor stackign is going to be a viable palystyle anyways dies immediatly to a druid with mana jade card
hearthstone,not_removed,by the logic all aoe is antistealth which it obviously isnt anti at all antiarmour cards would be specifically targetting the enemys armour
hearthstone,not_removed,a lot of antiarmor cards i see are completely ridiculous while i do think there should be more ways to interact with it so its not just literally equivalent to health cards like destroy all your opponents armor are absurd thats basically the same as having a card that says if this is in your deck your opponent cant use their hero power this game
hearthstone,not_removed,this is far more well designed than the destroys all opponents armor bullshit we usually see when this suggestion is made
hearthstone,not_removed,thats basically the same as having a card that says if this is in your deck your opponent cant use their hero power this game thats not true because a hero power is available all game long and an antiarmor card like that is available once or twice per game max its really not any more dramatic than reno or alextraza that said i think remove all your opponents armor is not great but i once created a legendary that said set a heros armor to or something which again once per game maybe and its no more dramatic than alex or reno you could also do like battlecry remove armor on an epic minion or something and it wouldnt have to have low stats given how ridiculous the cthun priestwarrior cards are regardless there should be something
hearthstone,not_removed,mmhmm what would you like us to do about it
hearthstone,not_removed,op is collecting karma here mobile app player down on his luck needs upvotes to buy a pack
hearthstone,not_removed,did you even look at the album i posted
hearthstone,not_removed,wat
hearthstone,not_removed,unlucky things happen to him every single minute he plays hearthstone can you give a bit more detail
hearthstone,not_removed,because rogue has other minions and spells that can summon jade cards that the other classes do not jade rogue is intriguing because its plays can keep up with aggro while still being a jade deck but the lack of healing and board clear in rogue makes the gameplan a little funky but still comes in at the second best jade deck imo with shaman being the best basically if you run a deck that will lose hard to early aggro then you better have heals and board clears available shaman has board clears good heals and varying mana cost taunts to stall while allowing their new legendary and aya blackpaw resummoned with nzoth to destroy most control decks if it goes late
hearthstone,not_removed,bounce them with shadowstep discover them with journey below bounce them with that new guy they got
hearthstone,not_removed,raptor shadowcaster journey from below brann
hearthstone,not_removed,as mentioned raptor shadowcaster shadowstep journey below and gang up are already existing synergies how well those work together will need to be tested but ill go on a limb and say itll be underwhelming
hearthstone,not_removed,raptor is likely to hit the drop journey below can fetch the drop and aya aya is considered a class card in terms of class fetch stuff you also have the ability to bring the death rattles back with nzoth of the jade golem classes rogue has the most existing synergy you can just toss the jade golem stuff into a nzoth deck and you are pretty much good to go
hearthstone,not_removed,well if you make a deathrattle jade rogue then you can add some heal and board clear seargent sully cold blood can clear the board and i think there are some deathrattle minions that restore health to both heroes for mana that could work with raptor if you need some health
hearthstone,not_removed,journey of bellow is a great card
hearthstone,not_removed,it could but sally is a delayed board clear in rogueyou need backstab to activate and this card combo is bad the new drop is good but its not enough aloneits also a delayed heal compare this to shamans healing wave the best bet for rogue is discovering heals from the jade neutral rogue just isnt suiting for a drawn out control game like shaman and jade decks want to go late
hearthstone,not_removed,if you curve out like a god you can get it to with aya dying im assuming we dont play spirit because it sucks and we coin out aya on and we are running counterfeit coin even if you dont find the you still have jade shuriken druid can do better with idol wginnervate aya coin behemoth that is a bit of a pipe dream given you need to go second and you need innervate and aya on turn rogue looks like it can get golems out faster than the other decks the problem with jade golem rogue will be the problem with every midrange rogue the complete and utter lack of defensive tools you have no class based healing or taunt mechanisms often youll just get blown up
hearthstone,not_removed,super long and confusing title youre telling me im pretty sure half those words are unintentional
hearthstone,not_removed,no it wouldnt
hearthstone,not_removed,know it woodnt
hearthstone,not_removed,where are my eyes
hearthstone,not_removed,these fucking comments lol
hearthstone,not_removed,casually find mad scientist piloted shredder and dr boom
hearthstone,not_removed,know it wouldnt ftfy
hearthstone,not_removed,they sound like mad german scientists who just had a breakthrough
hearthstone,not_removed,this is the nerdiest thing ive seen all month i love it reminds me of year old me opening rare mtg cards
hearthstone,not_removed,their duo stream is pretty funny to watch and instructive too
hearthstone,not_removed,kripp how good is shaku lifecoach and jj its pretty good pretty good
hearthstone,not_removed,watching them play together has been the most fun and informative stream i have watched so far great duo
hearthstone,not_removed,superjj channelling lifecoachs kid on christmas reactions i love it
hearthstone,not_removed,im convinced everyone who stays with lifecoach sells their soul to the devil to get good at hearthstone the one side effect is that they have to have these crazy reactions to plays and act like theyre again
hearthstone,not_removed,heres the duo thinking theyre dead against midrange shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,its hard not to smile with them
hearthstone,not_removed,these two are the biggest dorks i have ever seen im saying that on a reddit board for a video game about a card game biggest dorks
hearthstone,not_removed,man i keep seeing all these clips about awesome shaku pulls and i really want to craft him but i feel like hes kind of bad
hearthstone,not_removed,im really not sure if they are drunk or if this is just the normal excitement level for them
hearthstone,not_removed,youve just witnessed two dudes genuinely enjoying a game and not giving a damn what you think
hearthstone,not_removed,and heres one with a gamechanging brawl
hearthstone,not_removed,good to see lifecoach is sharing his coke with his friends
hearthstone,not_removed,oooh ooooh oooh ahhh ahh
hearthstone,not_removed,does anyone else get the feeling jj is trying hard to be like lifecoach ive never watched his stream but he just does the nerdy things coach does
hearthstone,not_removed,i really enjoy watching this duo it seems like jj brings playfulness into coachs stream and coach takes the salt off of jj while maintaining the academicalinstructive atmosphere lifecoach has been running
hearthstone,not_removed,credits go to the streamer who can be found at and the op uwhitestarbg brought to you by your friendly neighborhood bot happy new year
hearthstone,not_removed,i love lifecoachs reactions theyre so pure and make me happy
hearthstone,not_removed,i know it wasnt actually an impression but jjs reaction was by far the best lifecoach impression ive ever seen goddamn theyre rapidly becoming one of my favorite streamer duos still aways off zalaebat for me but definitely closing that gap
hearthstone,not_removed,those streaming together is such a good hearthstone stream experience lol
hearthstone,not_removed,after their series of vlogs and moments like thishow can you not be rooting for jj and lifecoach in any situation
hearthstone,not_removed,disclaimer i am not a good player but i love shaku was my first legendary pull from msog he absolutely dominated in my clockwork brawl deck first turn second turn third turn fourth turn after that it was just big minion after big minion so much fun to play
hearthstone,not_removed,shaku is probably my favorite card of the expansion getting multiple procs via windfury is pretty awesome in this expansion we were given some stealth support in both a minion that returns to stealth after a condition is met and a minion that buffs only stealthed minions i wonder if that is a rogue mechanic blizzard is going to explore more going forward
hearthstone,not_removed,i hope to have a bromance as beautiful as these two some day
hearthstone,not_removed,man i just got this guy i guess its time to make burgle rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,credit to for the content and uwhitestarbg for sharing it

hearthstone,not_removed,someone please sink up their reactions to the ronda fight and make it a gif i will give you my karma
hearthstone,not_removed,im not sure if lifecoach is doing these extremely overblown reactions to mock cancer streamers or to actually entertain children i love it
hearthstone,not_removed,i hope theyre not acting
hearthstone,not_removed,get you a man who gets as excited about you as superjj and lifecoach get about hearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,sounds like julia child found a new recipe
hearthstone,not_removed,this guy is the incarnation of value
hearthstone,not_removed,onomatopeyas tho
hearthstone,not_removed,oh my god thats so awesome they are so happy its awesome
hearthstone,not_removed,i honestly think if he had windfury hed be a good and balanced card and not op at all
hearthstone,not_removed,germans overreaction
hearthstone,not_removed,people may not realize this but lifecoash has been providing sunshine to the hs community since its early days
hearthstone,not_removed,cringe compilation
hearthstone,not_removed,this reminds me of beavis and butthead for some reason lol
hearthstone,not_removed,i love how people who dont know how rogue works are criticizing the shaku this kind of miracle rogue has a lot of core cards it needs but other than those you can add any card you want because the win condition the core cards are already there thats why shaku works in this deck he is an early drop adds value and has a soft taunt because he can get out of hand if not dealt with immediately in case you didnt notice all rogue early drop are undervalued statwise thats because rogue has very cheap even free removal in the early game shaku will never be the card that loses you the game but he can be the one that wins it for you same as swashburglar being and i see no one crying about it
hearthstone,not_removed,holy shit
hearthstone,not_removed,no ragrets
hearthstone,not_removed,i love that now they both make sounds during the matches
hearthstone,not_removed,the hands they make the clip
hearthstone,not_removed,love lifecoach hey guys
hearthstone,not_removed,i could listen to giddy germans all day long
hearthstone,not_removed,serious question not judging are these guys high on something not endogenous of origin like are they on drugs or just naturally exuberant people or camera hans not condemning any of those options just curious fun to see people having fun
hearthstone,not_removed,i wish i could have so much fun with hearthstone too
hearthstone,not_removed,that moment at the end its good right its really good was awesome
hearthstone,not_removed,name a more dynamic duo they said found em
hearthstone,not_removed,this gives me faith that will be a good year
hearthstone,not_removed,hahaa
hearthstone,not_removed,i just want to feel as happy as they do at that point cant even remember when that last happened
hearthstone,not_removed,collecting souls
hearthstone,not_removed,its pretty good what are they like when its really good or even great
hearthstone,not_removed,i could watch this all day
hearthstone,not_removed,this makes me happy
hearthstone,not_removed,damn i wish i could get this happy over a video game
hearthstone,not_removed,nerdgasm
hearthstone,not_removed,anyone know what deck they are playing got a golden one that i want to play with before disenchanting
hearthstone,not_removed,love how lifecoach looks like a serious man but is indeed just a big child d
hearthstone,not_removed,tbh if shaku had windfury it would be really good
hearthstone,not_removed,i really dont know how people enjoy these super fake personalities this is so forced i dont remember life coach being this crazy did he up his coke intake or something
hearthstone,not_removed,how do these mundane interactions in hearthstone get to the top of the subreddit is it because of the two manchildren giggling zzzz
hearthstone,not_removed,are they supposed to be funny because they are not
hearthstone,not_removed,isnt it illegal for multiple people to play the same account its easier to earn blizzcon points cheating like that
hearthstone,not_removed,to the front page we go
hearthstone,not_removed,are they kappapride
hearthstone,not_removed,they act really weird and artificial
hearthstone,not_removed,collecting soullls
hearthstone,not_removed,das ist soooo insaaaaane
hearthstone,not_removed,as a german i thought the same d
hearthstone,not_removed,they remind me of the family guy bit with the blonde foreign guys
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah kinda my and year old cousins react this way to everything in multiplayer games
hearthstone,not_removed,rjustneckbeardthings
hearthstone,not_removed,cause they are basically never truly salty yes they get annoyed but they never really rage which makes the stream super chill to watch and educational
hearthstone,not_removed,jj pretty good
hearthstone,not_removed,that and the whole not having souls buisness
hearthstone,not_removed,nah its people like kripp or reynad who are soulless
hearthstone,not_removed,so your teammates are just leaving auctioneers on board yeah
hearthstone,not_removed,how do they have so much fun i really envy it
hearthstone,not_removed,i love how jj is doing life coach reactions
hearthstone,not_removed,most hilarious part about their stream is how lifecoach the older way more experienced person is like a bubbly kid and jj keeps cool and collected at almost all times
hearthstone,not_removed,its really a video game about a card game about a video game
hearthstone,not_removed,its almost hard to imagine how one of them is a multi millionaire successful in different industries and who has lived in different countries makes me want to stay true to my dreams
hearthstone,not_removed,hes really bad
hearthstone,not_removed,shaku is a slow and probably not that great but he is so fucking hilarious against warrior just beat pirate warriors in a row pulled the give a taunt and taunted up a huge edwin guy had kept going face instead of killing shaku pulled arcanite reaper and kor kron outraced him guy kept going face instead of killing my shaku pulled alley armorsmith instaconcede these pirate warriors are just hilarious oh theres a stealthed shaku better throw my axe into face anyway oh shaku is up better just throw my kor kron elite into face anyway
hearthstone,not_removed,shaku is one of those cards that will probably have a chance to shine postrotation if they nerf pirates
hearthstone,not_removed,hes bad i crafted him day one and have played him in burgle rogue and jade rogue and honestly hes the worst card in every list i put him in
hearthstone,not_removed,if youre playing the rogue deck thats only job is to steal cards then it can be fun but its really binary its either going to be fun and win in awesome ways or be the most unfun infuriating losses ever
hearthstone,not_removed,the great thing about shaku is it keeps resources in your hand
hearthstone,not_removed,hes not bad but not great stealth cold blood shenanigans are another out with him which is nice but the cards are hit and miss fucking fun as hell to play tho
hearthstone,not_removed,i actually crafted him probably too slow to be really effective in this meta right now he was probably the best rng card for me personally my yoggs always suck and any other discover card never gave me the same value as when i used him hes single handedly won me several games probably not worth crafting unless you like screwing around if he was a like a or hed probably see more play and go from dumpster to mildly useful like xaril is
hearthstone,not_removed,he was my first msog legendary and i think hes really good fun he needs to get on the board early if you want him to draw more than once but he pretty much always generates a lot of value actually you can make him a bit of a fork for the opponent on a bigger board because they have to choose between getting rid of a bigger target or this small guy that is generating constant value
hearthstone,not_removed,save and craft two undead whatever hes called
hearthstone,not_removed,i like him i have a high win rate with my burgle rogue in standardwild atm but i got him from packs when expansion first came out but my success might be more due to my pirates and rng wish he also automatically reduced the mana cost of the cards he burgles too that would be nice
hearthstone,not_removed,i like him alot really doesnt perform too well edwin vancleef is arguably one the strongest legendaries in the game though so we cant complain about shaku too much
hearthstone,not_removed,i think he is a good tempo play in rogue instead of burgle because you get the body also i wish he was a or for mana though
hearthstone,not_removed,undercity huckster allowed in deck compared to shaku mana compared to mana for more health and stealth has raptor curve next turn and nzoth synergy no idea how theyll make this card moderately good unless they make a mana minion with battlecry give a stealth minion health
hearthstone,not_removed,normal lifecoach superjj imitating lifecoach
hearthstone,not_removed,they just really like the card game
hearthstone,not_removed,i love how jjs losing it while lifecoach is raging internally in this one
hearthstone,not_removed,sounds like baboons learned german
hearthstone,not_removed,hes not trying its a normal thing to start to mimic someone a little people will take on subtle accents or mannerisms of those they hang around with more empathetic people will do it in no time at all even with strangers its just one of the tricks in our social tool bag
hearthstone,not_removed,duos are imo always more entertaining than a single streamercaster they talk back and forth and its just way more fun to watch
hearthstone,not_removed,ive always thought lifecoachs reactions seem like they should be coming from an adorable female streamer and not a giant german beard
hearthstone,not_removed,its strange i dislike how amaz overreacts but when lifecoach does this i find it endearing
hearthstone,not_removed,what if they are playing against each other

hearthstone,not_removed,high on life
hearthstone,not_removed,a little bit of everything
hearthstone,not_removed,they could be having drinks or they could just be reacting the way people usually react around their friends imagine watching funny videos by yourself versus watching with friends youre more likely to laugh out loud or react outwardly with friends while you wouldnt react at all alone even though youre amused the same
hearthstone,not_removed,its so sad when people are having fun we must assume that they are on drugs
hearthstone,not_removed,just try to be fake it till you make it being jaded is easy
hearthstone,not_removed,miracle with coins and southsea deckhand
hearthstone,not_removed,would be really good would be totally broken i see
hearthstone,not_removed,do you not get excited when youre around friends
hearthstone,not_removed,shows how good your body language reading skills are
hearthstone,not_removed,im a miserable person who cant enjoy anything so it really upsets me to see other people having fun with their friends
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont know either but this kinda shit sells viewership as if people jump up and down like little kids and slap each others arms because they got a great combo off i dont care if people enjoy it but i dont know why they think its genuine reactions just like how these popular streamers laugh for seconds straight
hearthstone,not_removed,same here thats why my favorite hearthstone personalities are firebat trump and theyre real
hearthstone,not_removed,do you like the game to have interesting content
hearthstone,not_removed,technically yes but who really cares
hearthstone,not_removed,i thought it was collecting salt 🤔
hearthstone,not_removed,reminds me of year old me opening rare mtg cards yeah i hate year old neckbeards too
hearthstone,not_removed,yes because these guys totally look like neckbeards if youre referring to uwtfduud well youre on a subreddit for an online card game based on the fantasy mmo world of warcraft
hearthstone,not_removed,plus they ban all the spammers and twitch meme stuff you can actually interact with them over the chat and ask questions if you want an informative stream he is one of the best choices if you want funny dank memes go to almost any other streamer
hearthstone,not_removed,if you think jj never gets truly salty you havent watched enough of his stream
hearthstone,not_removed,i was watching them the other night and i really enjoyed it one game lifecoach had pretty awful draws and basically lost the game in the first few turns to perfect draws he was pretty bummed out jj was getting coffee for them and when he came back he cheered up lifecoach in seconds they discussed the different plays and what could have been done differently they didnt just yell cancer deck feelsbadman like most streamers would
hearthstone,not_removed,preeeeeeetty good
hearthstone,not_removed,exactly those two
hearthstone,not_removed,playing with friends can make almost anything fun
hearthstone,not_removed,i do lc reactions too dont you
hearthstone,not_removed,its really a video game about a card game about a video game about another video game
hearthstone,not_removed,more accurately hes very mediocre if the next set adds more support for that stealth rogue deck he might see play though
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i have pulled him from packs and i tried making him work in jadeburgle and nzothburgle decks verdict pretty bad but really fun in casual like i dont have jaraxxus but shaku gave me against a warlock enemy warlock oozees my jaraxxus fist boy he never saw the eredar lord coming
hearthstone,not_removed,yep youll get one card maybe better off with pretty much any discover card
hearthstone,not_removed,hey he is good in my reno rogue deck
hearthstone,not_removed,hes like finja just give him divine shield and buff and you can get value simple really edit s
hearthstone,not_removed,why craft him every card review agreed he was terrible
hearthstone,not_removed,comparing huckster and shaku is like comparing loot hoarder and manatide totem both loot hoarder and manatide usually only draw a card but if manatide gets left on the board it can get out of hand huckster and shaku are the same way
hearthstone,not_removed,everyone has been a baby someday
hearthstone,not_removed,but if it did come from a female streamer it would be attention whoring
hearthstone,not_removed,lifecoach is half japanese tho
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe its in part due to lifecoach not caring about making money anymore
hearthstone,not_removed,you panic
hearthstone,not_removed,they might be on caffeine
hearthstone,not_removed,yep if im watching a comedy or standup alone i probably wont laugh out loud unless its insanely funny around friends i tend to laugh at jokes that are just funny at all im sure theres some psychological reasoning behind it
hearthstone,not_removed,the answer is in your question he has no friends
hearthstone,not_removed,lifecoach has donations disabled subscriptions do not have any incentives no notifications badge privileges etc and his chat is heavily moderated so that only discussions pertaining to the game is allowed none of these things is really good for viewership or making money in the slightest and lifecoach understands this he states his stream his purely for educational purposes for the community i dont see why he would fake reactions for the sake of entertainment after that all for no apparent benefit not to mention that people whove met lifecoach in tournaments all say hes like that in person
hearthstone,not_removed,ummm overreacting with friends while playing games is very commonat least with mine
hearthstone,not_removed,i thought it was collecting soap 🤔
hearthstone,not_removed,sehr raffiniert
hearthstone,not_removed,its whats inside that counts
hearthstone,not_removed,what do you mean interact his stream has a min delay and he reads chat every minutes
hearthstone,not_removed,not much of an interaction when theres a minute chat delay a huge stream delay as well as the fact that lifecoach only reads chat after a match is complete and even then he ignores like of the messages
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,what is good
hearthstone,not_removed,ultra

hearthstone,not_removed,i found out that they can now use though
hearthstone,not_removed,brojob brojob choo choo
hearthstone,not_removed,we need to go deeper thinking
hearthstone,not_removed,or the theif rogue that onik tried to introduce
hearthstone,not_removed,well i got to attack with him twice the other day and he gave me piranha launcher both times
hearthstone,not_removed,shut up pandawaifu
hearthstone,not_removed,except rogue has no tools to give him divine shield or to buff him
hearthstone,not_removed,because i like to play burgle rogue and i like to actually try cards out
hearthstone,not_removed,not really no saying that one snowballs and the other one doesnt is an oversimplification and not what make them necessarily usable manatide totem works well with stronger early minions as shaman can be protected with the many shaman taunts has synergy with thing from below and is more useful midgame a lot of the times manatide isnt even played on curve drawing a card from the deck for aggromidrange shaman is also a lot more important the only thing that shaku synergizes with is shadow sensei and shadow sensei doesnt really synergize well with anything else even with your comparison theres a reason why huckster is used in rogue decks while shaku isnt and manatide totem is viable in both aggromidrange shaman while loot hoarder isnt
hearthstone,not_removed,except mana tide does it at end of turn which is a massive difference huckster is often used in conjunction with raptor so it can get out of hand
hearthstone,not_removed,anymore did he win the lottery
hearthstone,not_removed,le gasp
hearthstone,not_removed,when do they duo stream on life coachs channel
hearthstone,not_removed,great now pretty doesnt sound like a real word anymore

hearthstone,not_removed,or the deathrattle rogue or the pirate rogue or the other unfinished rogue plans
hearthstone,not_removed,ok now try writing that in english
hearthstone,not_removed,but that seems so unlikely i mean the part where you played vs hunter not the part where shaku gave you the same card twice
hearthstone,not_removed,value
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,saying that one snowballs and the other one doesnt is an oversimplification i dont think its an oversimplification both huckster and loot hoarder gain no additional value from being left on the board for multiple turns whereas shaku and manatide do gain additional value every turn they are left on the board comparing shaku to manatide golem makes sense
hearthstone,not_removed,he made a couple millions in online poker and did some smart trading with that long story short he lives in a pretty large villa in vienna drives an expensive car and his main occupation is having fun in a childrens digital card game
hearthstone,not_removed,but what does it do
hearthstone,not_removed,at least weapons rogue is completely finished
hearthstone,not_removed,i think he said hed rather run malygos over jaraxxus in his rogue deck
hearthstone,not_removed,hunter is that a new class
hearthstone,not_removed,im aware of the existence of shadow sensei not a fan of playing a buff card that only hits one target
hearthstone,not_removed,rogue minion rare msog 🐙 httpwwwhearthheadcomcardsshadowsensei httphearthstonegamepediacomshadowsensei mana battlecry give a stealthed minion callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to for more pm
hearthstone,not_removed,in practicality its an oversimplification shakus snowball effect isnt that great midgame and after while manatide is at worse a cycle shaku simply cant snowball with what rogue has so the point is moot regardless thats why i suggested that if he can somehow gain a whole lot of health next turn he might be useful honestly if this card was in grimy goons it could be decent with all the buffs that has the potential of snowballing
hearthstone,not_removed,and he donates all of his earnings to charity
hearthstone,not_removed,holy crap never heard of this before now thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,ok thx i was perma banned by one of life coachs mods so i stopped watching his channel
hearthstone,not_removed,stick a fork in it its done
hearthstone,not_removed,that plus crap
hearthstone,not_removed,weird i usually put two jaraxxuses in my rogue decks
hearthstone,not_removed,that comment looks like it was made by a neural network when hearthstone was entered in i dont have a damn clue what you are talking about
hearthstone,not_removed,he has some pretty long videos about his life in german on his youtube channel
hearthstone,not_removed,you should contact the mods they will unban you maybe
hearthstone,not_removed,fork weapon mana what
hearthstone,not_removed,hes saying that rogue doesnt have the tools that shaman does to protect minions that stay on board to generate value like tauntwolves thing from below etc
hearthstone,not_removed,i called the mods nazis so thats probably a no not that i want to be unbanned i really dont care edit oh no i do actually care about my internet points pls dont downvote me
hearthstone,not_removed,weapon mana preeeetty goood
hearthstone,not_removed,if you are triggered by that opening let me advice you to never visit rhspulls
hearthstone,not_removed,its not youre guaranteed at least legendary in packs so its a chance for the legendary
hearthstone,not_removed,i got legendaries and an epic the other day lol
hearthstone,not_removed,xx
hearthstone,not_removed,but he got rare epic and legendary in one pack
hearthstone,not_removed,ugh fine chance for legendary chance for an epic chance for both a legend and an epic in the same pack not even close to your
hearthstone,not_removed,first starting off he asked me is it like where i can trade and get better cards eventually can i play with your cards or can you give me some of your extra cards this is a really good point i get hearthstones model for making money however theyre making it really difficult for you to pitch their game and for everyone else really its a glaring blindspot in their expansion strategy i dont envy the new player who has come to hearthstone without the patience of a saint or the wallet of a highroller
hearthstone,not_removed,yea last year i recommended hs to of my friends one rich and one from a financially normal family the rich one has already payed over most of it at the very beggining in order to play the other one gave up after like a month so take notice blizz edit chaneged pay to play
hearthstone,not_removed,so i just got back into hs before a few days ago my only experience was playing enough right at launch to unlock all classes and get one of them far enough to unlock all cards since i came back i have all but with all cards unlocked have played about games with wins and did arena twice i ground out enough ranked wins to hit for the season before giving up so far my thoughts are as follows the welcome back quests and current expansion quests that reward packs are major boons without them i wouldnt have gained enough to hold my interest with them completed reality hits and interest has been fading tbh it would be great to have pack rewarding quest chains from previous expansions as well matchmaking needs a revamp from things were fine i felt balanced enough that my card collection didnt matter once i hit it became very obvious how my lack of past expansion cards crippled me almost entirely maybe all i need to do is buy all the expansions for the unlockables either way without doing so a win is absolutely pure luck and unlikely maybe a match system taking money spent or cards held into account would help arena is great the one area i as a noob and at that feel evened out its nice to see cards i wouldnt know exist otherwise no complaints here but i would love an arena mode that had no prizes you could play any time i feel like itll take me months or hundreds of dollars to have as much chance as i do at arena games and without understanding the meta at that one cool addition would be a quest that rewarded a single random card per day even if capped at a rare it feels like im grinding for days to get practically nothing even if a shit card to disenchant daily was given for a innkeeper win it would maintain my interest
hearthstone,not_removed,they could easily do crafting discounts on x classic cards per week say commons rare epic and low chance of legendary cost reduction that way new players could catch up more easily to the rest of people heck even something like dynamic classic pack prices based on difference between your collection and average players collection for that server i have been playing full for years now all adventures fully unlocked missing roughly dust per expansion to get all of the cards so dust give or take
hearthstone,not_removed,i think its cruel and unusual to recommend this game to friends i did make an account and unlock a few adventure wings so mom wouldnt have to play spider harp in windows but she refuses to play probably because she has seen me on the ipad chronically when i visit although her excuse is that its to complex
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel bad for you and your friend i hope he soon gets some cards to start enjoying the game more i basically went through the rough grind from start as a because i just had a bad breakup and needed a new game
hearthstone,not_removed,hearthstone is a major cash cow for them to solve any of the issues you mentioned would result in less profit thats just the way it is and its not that the designers only think about money they just love this game and try to make it the best they can its blizzard upper management and investors that will not accept any change that would result in a drastic decrease in profitability
hearthstone,not_removed,writing tip if you want your grievances to be addressed by a company state the age group of your friends and the range of income youll be made fun of if youre poor or in high school but by providing the devs with specifics it might help clarify any misperceptions marketing might have or maybe even help them make their case to accountingdesign to introduce new ways to help you earnprocure cards edit you will never be able to trade cards with accounts doing so would create an online black market for the cards and that is something that blizzard has deliberately engineered out of the picture theyve learned a few lessons from wow also you and your friends might belong to the bottom right of the demand curve sorry
hearthstone,not_removed,you should be able to gift dust to your friends put caps in place you can only gift up to a cap to any one person so i can give bob up to dust but thats it forever each account can only receive so much dust andrew has friends on his list but he can still only accept dust up to maximum this gives people a chance to build a competitive deck easy it just requires generous friends or i dont know a giving reddit community
hearthstone,not_removed,i understand the struggle of people wanting to play the game for free and get better cards but one thing that the players need to understand is that if you start playing a new card game even in real life chances are you have no or very few connections and need to buy some cards to start card games are inherently pay to play and if you want better cards you gotta buy them blizzard is being kinda generous with the cards they give you you wouldnt get anything free from a card shop sure they arent cheap but no card game is anymore
hearthstone,not_removed,the game is welcoming as far as atmosphere goes but the collection acquisition is indeed terrible for new players unless they spend some dollars when they start playing but knowing blizzard thats exactly what they want anyway they have always had high income expectations from their games look at wow only mmo that still charges you a monthly fee on top of the regular reacquisition of the game expansions overwatch a lot more expensive than cs diablo remains the only reasonable one the regular updates it gets are pretty weak but at least theyre free so hearthstone is a good and fun game but you either have to enjoy it with a minimal collection of cards or go for the expensive option and even the expensive side has lots of flaws like the lacks of diverse features or fun competitive environment after years of playing the game my collection has gotten pretty good but evey time an expansion rolls out i feel how it is to be a new player that cant afford the best cards every time i play against raza and kazakus i feel my wallet spilling its last guts out for my enjoyment go buy them but i dont do it because i dont want to eat homemade fried potatoes for the rest of the month
hearthstone,not_removed,the guy who introduced me to the game stopped playing for a year or so and now he is trying to come back to the game but it is just too hard although he knows how to play the game and is a really competent and creative deckbuilder he has a very hard time to rank up on ladder and to have fun since his collection of standard cards is extremely limited i find it really sad because he is actually decent at the game taught me how to play it and now is unable to have fun with it because the new playerreturning player experience is so miserable
hearthstone,not_removed,i would absolutely love to be able to loan a friend cards a month i know hed play the game if he could play a half decent deck without having to substitute leeroy for rocketeer etc
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel kind of lucky i have a lot of friends who all play the game with competitive decks and we have actually attended local fireside gatherings together
hearthstone,not_removed,every friend ive tried to get into hearthstone have stopped playing because they kept playing people with better collection then they did
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe they could start with the god damn awful tutorial which introduces loads of stuff which is only in the tutorial like enemies talking having large minion hovering in the air etc i replayed the tutorial recently and it makes little to no sense
hearthstone,not_removed,tavern brawl is nearly the only way for new ftp players to get at least some cards if you dont want to use money you just get rekt all the time in normal game modes and not good enough for arena
hearthstone,not_removed,as of today meaning current meta your friend is better off playing either magic the gathering or elder scrolls legends hearthstone is a cesspool of agro decks or brain dead decks that people found on the internet theres no strategy or planing in this game anymore everyone and their mother wants to kill you in or less turns if you play something fun that forces you to think you need to be lucky with the card draw ie getting reno in your starting hand or else youre fucked even on tavern brawl people make agro decks lul i can understand playing brain dead decks on ladder you want to reach legend rank faster unless youre in rank or higher playing agro decks in chicken rank or rank is laughable but on tavern brawl are you so desperate to show off your epeen by killing the oponent quickly that you need to play the same stupid sht both in lader and tavern brawl
hearthstone,not_removed,when ever my friends ask me about how to get in to hearthstone i tell them the same thing you ether drop bucks on it when you start or you plan on getting good at arena and grinding that and quests for a year
hearthstone,not_removed,use the friend post to get more friends accept friend requests if you dont have friends on hs its because you dont want to i was introduced to the game by two friends more than a year ago i have more than those two friends in the game
hearthstone,not_removed,i cant persuade my friend to play a game with me therefor a computer game company must give me hope and they are failing me and the community
hearthstone,not_removed,not trying to be a jerk here but dont you get like a crapton of free packs now when youre starting to play sure you have to win some games but you can win even with basic decks on low ranks or play casual i get that its hard but when i started back in the open beta we only got one free pack and that was it for a it was really hard
hearthstone,not_removed,do you think theyd benefit from a system like lol where a few of the deck recipes with their respective cards are lended to you and then cycled over time
hearthstone,not_removed,i think just changing up the dust rations would help immensely if you max out your questswins per day you earn over the long term about dust per day thats enough for common cards you might be missing plus dust to save up for about hours of playtime a day with a meta deck and a lot more when you have no cards at all thats essentially nothing blizzard know very well that every single game relies on whales but what they dont seen to get is that every game alos needs the huge install base in order to get at those few whales and if every new player to the game is put off by the prohibitive grinding eventually you reach a tipping point the players go away no new whales show up and the game dies you cannot make money off eveyone on a game like this so they shouldnt pretend they can and as for the whales weve had stories here on reddit of people spending up to dollars on packs and not having full collections how the hell is that even possible a few weeks ago a guy posted about how hed gotten an allgold collection after spending over dollars how the heck can you not have access to all the games content after spending that amount of money im not saying everything should be available to everyone right off the bat but make it just a little bit easier have commons cost dust rares epics and legendaries that would let people craft decks faster get more invested and feel progression instead of stagnation instead blizzard apparently wants new players to use bloodfen raptors and shattered sun clerics for about a year before getting the cards they need to build a viable deck only then all those cards will have rotated out
hearthstone,not_removed,the digital ip thing is weird i asked if i could sell my stuff that i feel ive collected and was told i must be trolling
hearthstone,not_removed,well most digital card games reject the idea of trading i follow most of them you wouldnt believe how many there are and the most common excuse keywords are confusing prone to abuse speculation incentivising hacking and account stealing after i tried a digital trading card game however i can tell you the main reason is that it allows people to regain what they spent on the game and most developers cant suffer to think that someone new would pay another player to get cards instead of putting that cash in developers pocket i bought part of a collection from a guy who quit because he had a child on the way and the developer didnt see a dime out of it can you see any moneyoriented developer accepting something like that its not a surprise that there is only one serious digital trading card game on the market
hearthstone,not_removed,i only started playing last summer and thats basically how i felt as well it felt unfair that i couldnt build anything close to a competitive deck until i spent months saving up gold and got lucky with pack rng now i just have to accept i wont have any of the classic legendaries without saving up a ton of crafting material since im mostly buying msg packs and getting those through arena
hearthstone,not_removed,i think you just told blizzard that their model is working
hearthstone,not_removed,take notice blizz high fives all around in the blizz office and yells nailed it
hearthstone,not_removed,if you dont want to invest money you have to invest time simple as that
hearthstone,not_removed,ben brode mentioned that since they revised casual matchmaking its become much better measured in terms of average winrate as a proxy for finding appropriate opponents than ranked which makes sense as the lower of the playerbase clusters at rank which creates an extremely varied mix casual also isnt subject to rank resets which is all a longwinded way of saying that if ranked is a problem you might want to try casual if youre a returning player its likely your previous experiences with it were colored by the original version which was much worse at handling players with little history to base mmr on
hearthstone,not_removed,a weekly showcase of random cards on a discount sounds good and not that hard to do unless it means a new update every week
hearthstone,not_removed,too easy to abuse dust for everyone which is not a lazy bum is not that bad
hearthstone,not_removed,very few games are so alienating for new players usually you get an easy ride and showered with currencyloot till youre hooked and only then you hit the paywall hs might as well require packs purchase only then you can reasonably start putting some cheap deck together
hearthstone,not_removed,and in that real world card game you would sit down with your friends and other people that also have shitty collections and have a blast with nonmeta timmy decks because there are places for such people at you local shop and once you settled in and decide to get real you borrow and trade cards from your friends and traders but alas we have been through that and we all know that your comparison to real life collectible card gaming is inadequate hearthstone is not a real life collectible card game
hearthstone,not_removed,real card games arent pay to play theyre pay to receive cards with actual value that can be used to play or sell or trade when youre receiving a tangible good with value thats completely different
hearthstone,not_removed,friend loans that locked the card from you using it would be pretty cool and give you the best chance of not being easy to abuse maybe a limit on the total cards you can borrow
hearthstone,not_removed,flooding the board with level monsters then winning on your second turn is not a rarity in yugioh
hearthstone,not_removed,do you honestly think other cards game dont have aggro and netdecking its every game and people need to realize its not a bad thing
hearthstone,not_removed,i think itd be tricky because of hearthstones current framework of casual vs ranked though it might seem unfair i would think temporarily free premade decks should only be usable in casual mode unless the premade decks would stay the length of a ranked season i just wouldnt want a player having a really good week in ranked with a premade that gets cycled out the next week with them in the lurch
hearthstone,not_removed,i wish people couldborrow cards from the innkeeper maybe flag the cards in some way or give them a specific cardback hearthstone compounds the worst parts of tradition tcg and decapitates the best ones you dont own anything in the game you cant trade your cards with friends you cant sell them you cant even directly buy the ones you want the currencies you do have to buy things come from a terrible value of dusting cards will be changed without compensation you cant buy specific decks you cant set up house rules you cant wager cards you cant organize tournaments im trying to imagine myself as a kid saving my birthday money up to buy some booster packs to trade and play with the kids at school except you dont get to open the packs you hand them to the teacher and she keeps them in her desk until recess where she will deal the cards and manage playing so you never touch them the cards are all hers so you cant trade but she also wont let just anyone play with every card the advantage is she will also come to your house after school and help you play with your friend while you poop
hearthstone,not_removed,honestly had they not come up with the wildstandard system i would have suggested they eventually make classic all free and available to everyone since there would be a time when there will be way too many expansions and cards in the card pool that classic would be a small percentage with the rotating system though this is impossible as classic would be a large percentage of the card pool and a big money maker
hearthstone,not_removed,to be fair a lot of the games content isnt worth having how much money would you have to spend to get a full collection for any given format in mtg
hearthstone,not_removed,i asked a gm if there were going to be any packs given out for christmas and he said i must be trolling also his reply hey gm dropping by tonight hope youre having a good one out there not sure if theyre trolling or what but theres nothing going on as far as hearthstone goes last year if a pack was bought additional cards were given but thats not happening either
hearthstone,not_removed,you dismiss incentivising hacking and account stealing immediately but im seriously glad i dont have to deal with constant threats of malware spammers and farmbots in hearthstone as has sometimes been necessary in wow old diablo iii etc
hearthstone,not_removed,lmao too true blizzard is here to embrace the moby dicks of this world
hearthstone,not_removed,it works for those who will dump money in the game not so much for others that cant afford to do that
hearthstone,not_removed,unlike everyone else i think blizzards model of spend on classic packs and the most current expansion then buy an adventure is fair since almost all other games require a upfront free including tangible card games other online card games may be more giving that hearthstone but they have to since hearthstone has a majority of the online card game market business wise they are doing nothing wrong
hearthstone,not_removed,theres only one currency in this world time you merely decide the exchange rate
hearthstone,not_removed,my previous experience was effectively nonexistent but casual is quite close to my experience on ranked
hearthstone,not_removed,and is that such a problem dust is a lot of time to grind and barely a legendary or two and that is a one time boost so by the time the next expansion rolls out you are shit out of luck
hearthstone,not_removed,i know if i went through the effort to gift myself dust it really isnt changing my spending habits in the long run on this game also that doesnt impact my collection at this point as far as competitive viability is concerned however if i and other friends could each throw dust at a friend he can now craft a reasonable deck rares and epics miss a legendary or two so that he feels like he can compete that gets him more interested in playing long term as an alternative i could throw battlenet gift cards st him but then i feel like i wasted money if he doesnt stick around wasting dust when i really dont need it feels much less bad
hearthstone,not_removed,didnt we already went through a likewise effort in order to give ourselves the morgl hero portrait and some extra packs
hearthstone,not_removed,should the account giving the dust have been more or less active for months or so then could something like that help
hearthstone,not_removed,what shop do you play at i tried to bring my jank homebrew to a casual mtg saturday and got fucked by burn decks
hearthstone,not_removed,anything even one card a month haha why not you know
hearthstone,not_removed,man thank you i was gonna say yugi oh is fucking way worse than hs as far as newbies go my buddy at work brought in some decks and so we spread everything out he pulls out a card that saw half of its face filled with tiny text and says you lose i still dont understand how i lost but apparently thats how yugi oh is ill stick with hearthstone thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,uhatoristeel took the words right off my mouth hs is the only card game where agro is played by pretty much everyone save few examples and the fact that im being downvotted proves that
hearthstone,not_removed,its easy to achieve with free legendaries of the week every week there is a new rotation of maybe new free legendaries for people who dont own them lets say nat pagle bolvar fordragon chogall nobody would complain if these legendaries would be free for week for everyone competitive players have all the cards so it would only influence the experience for casual players
hearthstone,not_removed,i have no idea but in mtg at least the one with actual cards you can trade in you can get value from cards you dont need while in hs if you get a dupe ir card you dont wantneed you dust it for of its value my point was that for a new player even getting enough cards to have one viable deck is a herculean task that should be made easier and that getting the full experience being able to build the decks you want rather than being constrained to waiting should be easier too either in terms of time or money i think player retention would increase too and the longer you are invested in a game the more likely you are to pay it worked in my case
hearthstone,not_removed,they should have a look at cygames shadowverses company deal with customers unexpected maintenance or servers have problems here grab a handful of packs new expansion here well give you free packs slightly modified to have higher rarities show up more as teaser new years coming here login daily for a few days and get enough for more packs oh youre a new player i know ill give you about upgraded packs of every set so you can start with a dozen of legendaries to help you really theyre really generous and yet they keep growing and attracting people
hearthstone,not_removed,would you say blizzard really likes dicks
hearthstone,not_removed,dust is legendaries
hearthstone,not_removed,theres no good burn is standard right now so this is your chance i play home brew kiora ramp but its better in an aggro metta then this more controlling meta
hearthstone,not_removed,waaaahhh wahhh i lost to pirates nevermind that there are like very viable control decks right now
hearthstone,not_removed,and the fact that im being downvotted proves that it really doesnt
hearthstone,not_removed,there are aggro meta decks right now thats not unhealthy youre being downvoted because youre wrong and because mindless complaints have people frustrated recently
hearthstone,not_removed,that seems a lot worse than the rotation of deck recipes idea gives new players a competent deck to play with at all times makes the players want to have cards so they can have the deck recipes forever or decks like it and its easy to explain
hearthstone,not_removed,nobody would complain if these legendaries would be free for week for everyone people who cant play the deck they made any more when the legendary rotated out would
hearthstone,not_removed,i rather like this gives people an incentive to experiment with new cardstry to find a deck for these ignored cards
hearthstone,not_removed,if theyre not changing anything about how much free stuff is given out then they must be pretty happy with the profit theyre making no
hearthstone,not_removed,only crafting golden ones ftp btw
hearthstone,not_removed,sure if your first craft isnt golden nozdormu but thats not my fault at that point
hearthstone,not_removed,get downvotted guac boi
hearthstone,not_removed,it actualy does shows that anyone that disagrees with the notion of agro being the norm is agaisnt the community thus getting downvotted
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean if we are talking about rhearthstone team could probably offer everybody free blowjobs with pack purchase and somebody would come here and complain that it didnt get sucked well enough
hearthstone,not_removed,stfu scum
hearthstone,not_removed,oy oy golden noz is bae
hearthstone,not_removed,there are like very viable control decks right now for all ages except hatoristees age
hearthstone,not_removed,or it could show that aggro being the norm is incorrect thus leading to that person getting downvotes why is your first instinct to assume that person getting downvoted is that they are right and the world is against them rather than just that they are wrong
hearthstone,not_removed,oh ok hey if you play hearthstone gravity is actually a dog that chews tobacco and i am a firedragon gosh people here downvote it therefore im right because theyre wrong s i think if you want to go into it your logic is flawed because its circular like youre proving your assumptions by assuming your assumptions are true
hearthstone,not_removed,jaina was too busy got garrosh instead blizz plz refund it hurts
hearthstone,not_removed,wizards could put bills in packs and people would complain about how they were folded
hearthstone,not_removed,i ask you the same why do you think im getting downvotted bc im wrong have you ever stopped and think that this subredit likes to circlejerk and bandwagon agaisnt people that go agaisnt the norm
hearthstone,not_removed,heh greetings
hearthstone,not_removed,board clears are not one card taunts are not one card
hearthstone,not_removed,thats true its a very circlejerkish place almost every thread has a comment downvoted to oblivion for no reason at all and yet that doesnt prove everyone plays aggro
hearthstone,not_removed,funny how im being downvotted for saying that agro is the norm when theres plenty of posts every day here or in any other fan site showcasing that if you take your time to go to youtube pretty much every player there says the same yet im the one getting downvoted bc im wrong right suuuuuuuuure
hearthstone,not_removed,bth look i know the pirate epidemic is bad but please dont resort to using black tar heroin youll regret it
hearthstone,not_removed,lol freeze mages sucks at the moment seems like you do too
hearthstone,not_removed,freeze mage is good against like one popular deck right now
hearthstone,not_removed,control warrior is supposed to wreck her
hearthstone,not_removed,kara gave freeze mage nothing imoyou dont want to waste mana to deal or some random spell
hearthstone,not_removed,even though freeze mage sucks currently it is still by far the most infuriating deck in the game imo with the old miracle rogue a close second nothing feels quite as infuriating as spending the entire game with the board frozen just for the opponent to draw their entire deck and insta kill you in one turn without ever having to worry about anything while ignoring you the entire time you may as well just be watching a guy play the ai back when it was big
hearthstone,not_removed,jesus christ someone call an ambulance
hearthstone,not_removed,care to one v one me and see for yourself send me youre battle net information bitch hahahaha
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean mages in general hunters get another shitty and makes get dank spells and a that gives you a class spell fucking bullshit i hope blizzard dies
hearthstone,not_removed,pff why bother i know the result
hearthstone,not_removed,blizzard already got nerfedit cries
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah you would lose hahahaha didnt think so mother fucker
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean if you think freeze mage is gamebreaking when its one of the worst decks on the ladder hes right you are bad instead of getting butthurt about it you could try to actually improve but given your attitude so far i doubt you will
hearthstone,not_removed,really good arguments you got going or this is a bait
hearthstone,not_removed,lmao ill one v one quick scope all you fucking pansies ill do it with a priest and nothing but two cost cards lets fucking go everyone
hearthstone,not_removed,i really enjoy some aggro decks zoo is fun and my favorite deck for several straight seasons was a lowcurve midrange hunter just enough midrange that it wasnt face just enough face that i could burn down an opponent but i still had to tightly manage my resources i loved winning off of dropping jeeves with an empty hand pirate warrior is nowhere near that level of fun to me theres so much damage in the deck that even when out of cards the topdeck genie appears to grant consecutive damage turns aggro shaman has more to it but its still so insanely robust that it feels less exciting to play so yea im with you its a valid playstyle and it can be fun to dominate with a fast deck or sneak a win off of an aggro deck that draws perfectly but personally im not fond of the recent breed of aggro its not as fragile as it should be to generate that excitement on both sides of the board
hearthstone,not_removed,its been shit since at least the standard patch the one before old gods actually dropped when i got a common card reward for wins five runs in a row i stopped playing arena altogether and havent touched it since its the shittiest feeling
hearthstone,not_removed,i recently asked about this got some intresting math
hearthstone,not_removed,it seems so personally i stopped playing arena quite some time ago
hearthstone,not_removed,ive been told they raised the dust gain and lowered the gold gain since wotog was released arena is still just as much value but infinite arena is a lot harder to do
hearthstone,not_removed,i just went wins and got gold a golden common a golden rare and a pack gold for wins feels like ass man
hearthstone,not_removed,they did seem to secretly nerf the arena awards some time back not sure how much it changed though these types of rewards make arena borderline pointless for anyone who cant get at least wins this part makes no sense though as long as you get at least gold the pack and one other thing which i think is still the average for wins then youre still getting more out of it than you would just buying packs since youre getting gold the pack gold the amount you payed whatever bonus you get even if it is a common thats more dust than the gold could have possibly gotten you otherwise
hearthstone,not_removed,a big problem is the card pack is always wotog and doesnt let you choose playing arena is the cheapest way to accumulate new cards but does nothing in the way of helping get the cards you actually need classic packs give you the best overall minions
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont care about rewards but i will play arena after they ban frikkin mage
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah it really sucks also packs seems to be what blizzard deems a fantastic award but it really isnt when i just want more gold
hearthstone,not_removed,the commons annoys me so much id rather get a stinking turd in the parcel at least then itd be clear to everyone that i got screwed
hearthstone,not_removed,a common is dust because youre obviously going to craft muklas champ and play him in standard right
hearthstone,not_removed,either ive just been lucky but havent received dust as an arena reward so far based on the stats stcloudy posted it does seem the rewards arent rewarding as they used to
hearthstone,not_removed,i frequent this sub several other hs and arena related subs and several other arena or hs related forums and websites over the last years or so i would think ive seen perhaps about times a thread like this madehave arena rewards been made worse recently so far in past the answer has always been a clear nowith the exception of adding pack chance it has always been people on lower ends of variance and often many others like them popping in to agree but ofc it doesnt mean that its not possible that they recently just changed it and we dont have the collective data yet as community it is possible just a bit unlikely if you start thinking why it would happen right now after years of wait and with you being the player to first notice it but who knows just saying that in recent history or past ive never seen any screenshot of arena rewards that doesnt add up to what we collectively know oh how arena rewards work like below gold for wins or below for wins or normal common on wins or below gold on wins etc in your case it does sound like perhaps the unfortunate case of hitting wins several times recently is really bumming you out case is that it sucks to hit wins because the biggest jump in gold rewards comes between to wins the minimum gold you always get jumps from to when going from to
hearthstone,not_removed,i have about the same goldrun in wog and loe despite having more wins
hearthstone,not_removed,i think they rebalanced it a little ive been getting double packs sometimes on wins though so its probably still worth it
hearthstone,not_removed,i definitely noticed it getting worse after standard but then yesterday i got gold for wins but that was not normal as of late after standard i got packs the first few runs and i thought that was great and maybe thats why other rewards were lower but then i hardly ever got packs since
hearthstone,not_removed,i havent played arena in quite some time but i tried it again the other day and i got wins surprisingly i only got gold isnt five wins where you break even and sometimes get a little more
hearthstone,not_removed,yep i really wanted that huge chunk out of my gold winnings earlier on my run really needed that betrayal
hearthstone,not_removed,yup yesterday got wins pack dust and a common card like really
hearthstone,not_removed,in og i i have an average og and get gold dust and golden and regular cards both every run
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont have stats to back up my claims so i may be mistaken but i have the feeling they incremented the variance of the possible rewards at a certain number of wins while making the average reward worse now you can get some crazy reward even at a few wins like a legendary card or two packs if you get super lucky which wasnt possible before but the average reward you most likely will get is shittier and yeah i stopped playing arena as well it doesnt feel worth it anymore if you aim to make value
hearthstone,not_removed,played like arena in the past month got wins got packs but only total gold and a golden ancient watcher
hearthstone,not_removed,according to my stats average gold reward has increased from wins compared to loe and average gold reward below wins has decreased a tiny bit i have been getting more packs on average but also way more plain cards and barely any golden ones also from wins on i get at least gold or more on average my sample size is fairly small though with barely half the amount of runs in wotog compared to loe and may have had some positive variance
hearthstone,not_removed,heres the actual math showing what you get
hearthstone,not_removed,well in my last win arena run i good really shitty rewards i got gold i think and common golden common and a pack
hearthstone,not_removed,my heartharena average says chance for a single card not golden
hearthstone,not_removed,yea my last arena runs and wins ended up with around gold and a pack
hearthstone,not_removed,am i the only one who doesnt give af about the rewards i like the challenge of building a random deck and not having to worry about what i consider stupid constructed archetypes and before you say thats because i dont need the rewards i dont have old rag new rag sylvanas cairne nzoth yogg edwin thalanos ysera onyxia deathwing and a ton of other legendaries and what seems like a million epics
hearthstone,not_removed,i got the other day and got only gold for it so really just a gold plus i was really sad yeah i got packs too but i only really care about the gold
hearthstone,not_removed,my rewards have been pretty great lately win run with gold wins with gold each and wins both with gold each
hearthstone,not_removed,its just variance i think for my last win decks ive netted me on average gold packscards including the minimum a few times but then my most recent run i got still seems similar last run was a winner and i got and packs
hearthstone,not_removed,if you use your hero power muklas champ will buff the other rewads
hearthstone,not_removed,i got gold for a win yesterday came in my pants been on the worst win streak ever and gotten gold almost every time
hearthstone,not_removed,they even improved the rewards a few months ago now you have the chance to get a second pack from win onwards which wasn´t the case in the past
hearthstone,not_removed,i mightve been overthinking but ive been getting shitty rewards as i always play mage rogue paladin one time couple of days ago i had to pick warrior because of shitty choices went and got shitton of gold like ive never got not sure but it would be cool if they fixed the rewards depending on the class you play edit rhearthstones bragging detectives on the case so had to do a little fix
hearthstone,not_removed,when you make a thread like this blizzard white knights come in and try to make an argument how its fair for you to get a dust in a reward slot i was mainly an arena player until seasons ago and just stop playing regularly i only play times a week at most now
hearthstone,not_removed,i stopped arenas alltogether since standard now i only play the weekly tavern brawl for completing quests used to play competitively and near infinite now i only gather gold for the upcoming solo adventures yeah blizz killed the fun for me
hearthstone,not_removed,in ranked wins would get you gold and buying a pack would put you down gold costing you gold in total in arena using the example above you win gold and paid gold losing gold in total but also gaining some extra dust and a card it still looks like its strictly better than just buying packs but not as much now
hearthstone,not_removed,as a player who has never gotten more than wins and typically around i welcome the improved rewards for crap players like myself
hearthstone,not_removed,the fucking greed is so disgusting a new expansion probably for a couple of playable decks every year and thats still not fucking enough wins last week and i only got pack gold and two golden cards not epic not legendary its so frustrating to play
hearthstone,not_removed,i got too annoyed by arena around naxx i dont know how people like kripp and hafu can stand it
hearthstone,not_removed,everything to get more paid arena runs out of you huh sigh fuck you blizzard
hearthstone,not_removed,none of my last have given gold
hearthstone,not_removed,its good to keep in mind that the difference is negligible if you account for shorter games in ranked unranked the fact that you get gold for playing outside of arena meaning that the win is just more than you would have received from playing standard along with maybe extra dust which might not be worth it for people who dont enjoy arena
hearthstone,not_removed,not necessarily making more the time it takes to play and win those arena games prob can get more gold playing tavern this week since the games are quicker
hearthstone,not_removed,same here just a few hours ago i finished a run and got a tgt pack wotg pack and some gold
hearthstone,not_removed,if the rewards hadnt changed then statistically there should be a few really unlucky guys and from the perspective of those guys its very unlikely that theyre this unlucky suggesting that the arena rewards have changed but then again there are always unlucky people and right now it just happens to be them also of course the vast majority of people with average luck arent posting about it to use a metaphor if you tell a million people to flip fair coins then a couple of them will get really weird results that make it seem like the coin wasnt fair and those guys will be the only ones to speak up and if you only look at their results the coin does seem skewed but then again statistically you expect a few guys to get really weird results thats why you first need to formulate a hypothesis and only then do the experiment if you take data and then formulate a hypothesis you may draw unjustified conclusions this is especially dangerous if you take a subset of the data the results of just a few guys rather than all available data to make this effect even more pronounced people tend to remember getting unlucky much more vividly than they remember getting lucky
hearthstone,not_removed,you got a pack gold for gold you broke even and got a little more if you are asking about when you get gold as your reward its wins
hearthstone,not_removed,wins is break even while wins is guaranteed gold back so you get free stuff
hearthstone,not_removed,if you are going to lie at least learn the gold rewards of the arena system
hearthstone,not_removed,this is a tactic i would use to nerf something id make people think that im giving them more free shit when in reality im giving them less like op ive been getting for going and ive gotten packs maybe once or twice out of the last runs ive had which was since wotg
hearthstone,not_removed,nice try because for wins that pack can replace the gold bag you wouldve gotten otherwise in addition to the guaranteed gold bag making you lose gold
hearthstone,not_removed,he is asking if there is a trend among everyone or if he is just unlucky after noticing a pattern i see nothing wrong with that
hearthstone,not_removed,things fucked arena imo rewards are a bystander its annoying but not the reason you stop playing a game mode no rotation in arena means you meet the same bullshit we met for years in constructed which isnt fun especially in a toned down powerlevel game mode even more cards so less spells to choose from an already small pool of spells which means tempo is as always but even more king and playing around flamestrike is for the weak not really but anyways even more big dudes to slap on curve that locks the game but also kinda stop the polarizing that could happen between aggroish and more controlish drafts now an aggroish deck can just draft bog creepers and do super fine and a control deck can draft of those as well as other taunts and be very very annoying basically just like tgt where it was who drafted the most x be it murloc knight or keeper of uldaman it seems it went to who drafted most bog creepers oh and also mana and mana summon a in arena is fun fun fun
hearthstone,not_removed,i spent like bucks on release and havent spent money since just do your dailies and you should be fine
hearthstone,not_removed,damn dude you think for an adventure is greedy id hate to inform you about the prices of physical tcg decks
hearthstone,not_removed,i would be pretty happy about these rewards for wins as long as i dont disenchant it its a gain for me and i only disenchant the extra copies prioritizing keeping golden ones
hearthstone,not_removed,if you grind enough you can get some top tier decks
hearthstone,not_removed,they kind of get paid to play it
hearthstone,not_removed,unless you play hours a day you can still get free arenas off your dailies
hearthstone,not_removed,yes but then again when i got wins last week i got a pack and a common that sucks
hearthstone,not_removed,meaning that the win is just more than you would have received from playing standard along with maybe extra dust if you take into account the fact that playing arena has a risk of not getting wins which makes you make you lose gold getting only extra golddust for going is really bad i mean you got two times more wins than you got losses you should always get something better than just breaking even i know rewards are random and that on average you get something better than and a common for but we never got as much complains about arena rewards hitting the front page since wog was released and its really weird since the only thing blizzard said was that we now had a chance of getting a second pack as a random rewards
hearthstone,not_removed,negligible but still slightly in favour of arena for people looking for the value out of it since thats pretty much what makes it worth it which is what op says it isnt worth it anymore then if you get lucky and get the wins its a good boost if you dont like arena though it is definitely better to just do what you enjoy in rankedunranked and your losing almost nothing unless you average over wins in arena but my point was still pretty much that even with the worse rewards now as long as you can get wins most times you are still getting more value from arena
hearthstone,not_removed,for this week maybe on average though id say its at least as good to do the arena and better if you get the wins whether by luck or consistently as long as your wins or more all runs
hearthstone,not_removed,played arena runs since old gods patch and ive get packs only once for wins but also wins arena gains me only gold on average where wins means thats pretty huge gap for one win not counting runs for wins where packs reward is quite common
hearthstone,not_removed,i hate that thats better than my win run yesterday
hearthstone,not_removed,wins basically means at least win rate which defines infinite arena thats the main reason why rewards are boosted from there the gap between is also pretty large in term of rewards since an extra reward is added
hearthstone,not_removed,ive played over arenas since wotg and ive gotten wins multiple times overall average is and i still havent gotten a pack reward ever not for wins or any other arena
hearthstone,not_removed,yes as there is an initial cost to begin not the case with hs
hearthstone,not_removed,and you can dust the adventure cards if you want to to get the dust needed to craft a card you want instead of buying packs
hearthstone,not_removed,dude im the mirror version of you for card packs ive opened and have never gotten a double legendary pack my friend made an alt and got the fabled double legendary pack in his free wotog packs that said i got chillmaws in packs so thats nice
hearthstone,not_removed,i like hearthstone a lot more at this point because the cost to buy in is so much easier to budget and gets cheaper over time for something like magic dollars on a new set might let you play standard that year after hours of trading and having friends that let you borrow or pool cards for that same cost hearthstone gives you every single card in the latest set enough dust to craft every major card you need from the next set and lets you pool all the gold you get to buy into the next set after that then as cards rotate out you have enough resources to keep up with formats for years even if you only play casually
hearthstone,not_removed,i havent opened any double legendary packs either but over the course of years of hearthstone i have or golden legendaries most of which suck
hearthstone,not_removed,what evidence are you going off of to say there is no nerf youre equally guilty of using individual samples to say that the probability of getting good rewards has remained the same instead of decreasing
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah the last time i tried to get into mtg a few years back i got deep and still didnt have much in the way of a competitive deck granted back then i didnt know about sites for buying single copies of needed cards and such but then youre still committing cash to a card that may be out of play in a year
hearthstone,not_removed,i have like or or so but most of them are crafted so theyre actually good ones did open golden skycaptin pirate dudes though
hearthstone,not_removed,add wild growth raven idol auctioneer feral rage all remove mark of the lotus acolyte of pain starfall loot hoarder are all mostly bad might throw in an ancient of war instead of one auctioneer if you are dealing with too much aggro not sure if you have loe but brann and raven idols are also very benefitial edit also note that jade druid is a pretty bad deck when you go further up the ranks because it can´t deal with aggro and those are full of it right now so craft with caution
hearthstone,not_removed,heres a link with a list to give you an idea of what some other players do httpwwwvicioussyndicatecomdecklibrarydruiddecksjadedruid id consider it a good starting point to look at and make changes based on what you want to run or have available
hearthstone,not_removed,thats super helpful thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,classic welcome bundle for now if you have extra gold buy the first wing of leagueblackrock adventures before they rotate
hearthstone,not_removed,welcome bundle is great value classic cards are important too expansion was announced yesterday coming in early april so try to save gold for that
hearthstone,not_removed,mtg lite i imagine youre talking about the gameplay but its definitely true in terms of costs you get heaps of free stuff in a digital card game whereas a physical card game like mtg can be ridiculously expensive
hearthstone,not_removed,granted we arent certain about the power level of this next expansion lately theyve been pretty good but the grand tournament expansion was so underpowered that its best to keep an eye out to see if these new cards end up actually being strong before spending too much money as far as decks to build towards midrange decks in general are easier to build towards if you spent a significant amount of the mean streets of gadgetzan though you are likely to land yourself great synergy with jade golems or even grimy goons who are likely to be stronger in the new meta and if you grab a lucky kazakus then you could scrounge up a deck with him relatively easily
hearthstone,not_removed,buy the welcome pack later if you can right now classic packs are the thing to buy there are a few cards you can pull which will give you free dust after the upcoming patch
hearthstone,not_removed,why would he buy the adventures just to dust the cards he is starting now and already lost so many good wild cards he should just focus on standard
hearthstone,not_removed,ill definitely go for a welcome bundle thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,okay cool would it even be worth buying multiple welcome bundles then
hearthstone,not_removed,i meant gameplay not in a bad way but yeah i can see what you mean by cost as well
hearthstone,not_removed,ill just stick with the welcome bundle and try to save for the next one i guess thanks for the input
hearthstone,not_removed,because a its the best gold dust conversion in the game and b once he has the first wing unlocked he has permanent access to the adventure to unlock at his leisure new player or not the adventure will still be needed for future wildbrawl shenanigans
hearthstone,not_removed,you cant only one per account
hearthstone,not_removed,ooo gotcha one it is then thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,you are on the wild ladder switch to standard if u want back
hearthstone,not_removed,link dont work fam
hearthstone,not_removed,yes unless you count noncollectible cards like ashbringer
hearthstone,not_removed,yeh
hearthstone,not_removed,good point never noticed ash bringer is legendary i wonder if that signals collectible legendary spells weapons are coming as well over powered but you can only have one
hearthstone,not_removed,nothing implies that these new spells will be overpowered
hearthstone,not_removed,they turned off his antialiasing
hearthstone,not_removed,literally playable
hearthstone,not_removed,it finally follows de rules of typography
hearthstone,not_removed,finally i can sleep at night
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel like im missing something obvious here and its bothering me
hearthstone,not_removed,yes no more orphans
hearthstone,not_removed,i dunno this might be too much we dont want another secret pally meta
hearthstone,not_removed,i thought you meant literally buffing things lol
hearthstone,not_removed,jokes aside me might actually see pally do decent this expansion some of the buffs are not bad note how i am not stating they are good either
hearthstone,not_removed,save the orphans
hearthstone,not_removed,change
hearthstone,not_removed,you vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
hearthstone,not_removed,i know this is just a meme thread but why do people think that paladin will be good now lets ignore the new buff archetype for now because nobody knows whether they will be viable or not personally im not exactly hyped all the cards seem ok at best and thats simply not enough for constructed not to mention that this meta has a lot of very strong decks a new archetype has to compete against control or anyfin will probably remain dead since shaman hunter and pirate warrior will remain strong or become even stronger then we have aggro paladin which is currently a solid tier deck lets face it eboladin was always a meme deck it was only ever relevant when control dominates the meta so for about weeks per expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,i wonder if theyve fixed the loneliest of orphans on the polymorph flavor text that poor lost little lamb
hearthstone,not_removed,an orphan has been adopted
hearthstone,not_removed,weirdo
hearthstone,not_removed,follow the rules or not apparently
hearthstone,not_removed,follow the rules of typography
hearthstone,not_removed,thats not all they reworded a bunch of stuff to be more consistent
hearthstone,not_removed,left version looks better
hearthstone,not_removed,new meme meta line breaks and implied punctuation change an enemy minions attack to unless a player has deal damage to him or her put the top six cards of target players library into his or her graveyard
hearthstone,not_removed,stop shitposting please
hearthstone,not_removed,can we ask blizzard to get the hand sparkle effect out of the game most of paladin grimey goon hand buffs effect your entire hand so kind of telling ifwhen you dont have a spell or weapon
hearthstone,not_removed,it wouldnt be a shitpost without shit editing
hearthstone,not_removed,im pretty sure they actually added aliasing
hearthstone,not_removed,fixed the orphan
hearthstone,not_removed,compare the text mainly the
hearthstone,not_removed,a more efficient way of solving the orphan problem is by sending a wild pyromancer to the orphanage
hearthstone,not_removed,no more orphans ftf y
hearthstone,not_removed,kill the orphans
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,literary
hearthstone,not_removed,you gotta brush up on your rhearthstone memes
hearthstone,not_removed,well the grimy goons do a lot of buffing and paladin is one of them
hearthstone,not_removed,me might actually see pally do decent this expansion you sound more like your average hunter player
hearthstone,not_removed,nice so youre like every reviewer this expansion who wont commit to an opinion
hearthstone,not_removed,so far grimy goons look less powerful compared to jade and cabal factions but that buff mechanins might be way stronger than i imagine
hearthstone,not_removed,im tempted to add the new secret to secret paladin cant decide if i should swap it out for the resurrect one or just add it in
hearthstone,not_removed,wtf is wrong with this circlejerky place that you get downvoted to hell for saying a class might do well this expansion days before the expansion releases
hearthstone,not_removed,i took buff paladin to rank this season and im not exactly good at this game its always pretty good or busted the fact it got any support at all pushes it that much closer to being busted divine favour is always busted after rotation jade looks to crush kabal and aggro paladin is the most promising new deck poised to beat jade druid aggro paladin doesnt care at all if their kabal opponent consistentlt blows everything up on turn much less whilst some divines shields are live equally aggro paladin doesnt care if their opponent starts chucking out every turn after turn it looks promising i wont say definite but easily its almost a case of it doesnt matter so much what tools paladin has but whether other decks have the tools to beat it the fact that midrange and control are also things paladin can do is just gravy maybe one of those decks will emerge too

hearthstone,not_removed,riterarry
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you causticacrostic disciple of memes
hearthstone,not_removed,why doesnt claw say attack and armor
hearthstone,not_removed,lol why my favorite deck right now is a murloc dragon pally i have created i can see some potential maybe i am wrong but we wont know for sure till a couple weeks have passed from the release will we
hearthstone,not_removed,alright ill say it then midrange paladin is still gonna be bad after the expansion the cards may seem pretty good but they only enhance what paladin already does lose board early gain it back and grind out you opponent with high value minions none of the new cards add any good early presence which is what the deck sorely needs
hearthstone,not_removed,its way too early to tell but i can see potential just not top tier one
hearthstone,not_removed,i expect that every card except those not played will be at the very least playable to be fair i think like everyone is cautious after literally everyone except those one or two guys that someone is going to bring up below me got dr boom grim patron and mysterious challenger wrong
hearthstone,not_removed,jade druid probably beats rogue looking at the current vs report spell druid beats miracle rogue and there likely wont be too much change in either list other than maybe the addition of counterfeit coin and jade idol
hearthstone,not_removed,its reddit mate everything gets downvoted here i think some do it on principle for example this right here has a high chance of being downvoted too lol seriously though i think some expected better for classes like pally and rogue so they express their frustration this way its wrong but what can you do
hearthstone,not_removed,divine favor is either busted or complete garbage theres no middle ground with that card
hearthstone,not_removed,can you pm me your buff pally decklist
hearthstone,not_removed,you missed the joke
hearthstone,not_removed,yes and it sucks it definitely gives away a lot of information to your opponent
hearthstone,not_removed,ayy captain
hearthstone,not_removed,no more orphans
hearthstone,not_removed,we have no time for games
hearthstone,not_removed,because the armor persists past your turn until it is expended eg you are hit while the attack is only on the turn its played
hearthstone,not_removed,i was riffing on the fact that you misspelled we as me which makes you sound like a caveman and the hunter stereotype is that they are this was the autopsy of a now dead joke
hearthstone,not_removed,they mostly got crazy aggro cards though none of them really make midrange that much better
hearthstone,not_removed,midrange will be bad but smalltime recruits seems incredibly strong to me thats a nourish for less mana yeah its got restrictions but still
hearthstone,not_removed,exactly what i think
hearthstone,not_removed,the mana legendary does and among neutrals dirty rat mistress of mixtures and gadgetzan socialite could see play
hearthstone,not_removed,its not too early to tell literally every card is already revealed

hearthstone,not_removed,when its played im way more saltier than when yogg is played
hearthstone,not_removed,hmm i still dont get it can you fill me in
hearthstone,not_removed,is it just a bug that doesnt sound like it should be a thing
hearthstone,not_removed,i cant hear you
hearthstone,not_removed,no all orphans
hearthstone,not_removed,but for minions that you play and are buffed for instance using houndmaster those effects persist however the card text says is this only unique to armor related effects sorry im pretty new to the game and im just curious
hearthstone,not_removed,ah lolim sorry guess i am a bit tired nice one though me now gets it
hearthstone,not_removed,fwiw you made me smile with your gag
hearthstone,not_removed,i generally play slow grindy decks so i dont really care about that but most of those cards dont really impact eboladin too much it seems to me
hearthstone,not_removed,divine favour still outclasses it immensely
hearthstone,not_removed,im not top sure about the legendary yet im optimistic but i fear it simply doesnt do enough gadgetzan socialite is outright bad diety rat could see some play if jade druid becomes a thing but its horrible against shaman since they rely on oure stats mistress of mixtures seems really good but its not enough id wager
hearthstone,not_removed,just because you have all the right pieces to put something together doesnt mean there wont be some trial and error in getting the construction right same thing applies to the new cards the only thing having all of them spoiled lets us do is make educated guesses theres no way anyone could predict how every class and card is going to pan out in the postexpansion meta until we actually get to play them
hearthstone,not_removed,how have you not solved the puzzle yet you have all of the pieces already
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,ayy ayy captain
hearthstone,not_removed,right so thats consistent with the attack buff having the qualification of attack this turn but the armor buff not having that qualification you get attack on the turn you play it which does not persist between turns even if you do not use it you get armor which does persist between turns until it is expended being hit by or more damage
hearthstone,not_removed,well if that doesnt brighten my day like a visit to chernobyl
hearthstone,not_removed,i just want that legendary to be good so badly as someone who god gold pali purely off midrange pali i think pali will actually be fairly strong in this expansion simply because of how good the class is at shutting down high value minions changing minions stats
hearthstone,not_removed,exactly for example evolved kobold was completely ignored until recently when it started making freeze mage lists please note i have no idea if it is still run in those lists
hearthstone,not_removed,oooooooooohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
hearthstone,not_removed,ohhh okay gotcha gotcha thank you for the clarification
hearthstone,not_removed,no problem glad i could help
hearthstone,not_removed,just cause hes black i thought you people were better than this
hearthstone,not_removed,you cant even report it from not within the game not at all i had the same reported it on the blizzard website by contacting support i gave them the name but they said they cant do anything unless i give them the whole battletag with the number which i didnt have and couldnt find out i tried to add them to see it they didnt accept me support also said there is no way i can find it out then and no way they can do something wtf the name of the person i tried to report was even worse it made fun of the holocaust
hearthstone,not_removed,go on battlenet and report them with that screen shot
hearthstone,not_removed,its a username for fuck sakes
hearthstone,not_removed,€ you are some one with a negative attitude
hearthstone,not_removed,hes just jealous
hearthstone,not_removed,blizzard and thanks for your money
hearthstone,not_removed,httpeublizzardcomengbcompanyaboutcontacthtml
hearthstone,not_removed,were just reddit sorry
hearthstone,not_removed,lol me and my cousin are doing an adventure where we dont spend a penny on hs and get to legend i may have bought loe though
hearthstone,not_removed,what
hearthstone,not_removed,what ufrankerzfrankerz is saying is that you have accidentally sent your letter to reddit rather than blizzard honest mistake try this blizzardcom
hearthstone,not_removed,i wanted to post on blizzard forums but i couldnt find a suitable section to post it in
hearthstone,not_removed,your client had an error your opponent didnt do anything if you dont see the rope after seconds restart your client
hearthstone,not_removed,this is a client bug your opponent didnt do anything purposely to freeze your client
hearthstone,not_removed,and then was the salty
hearthstone,not_removed,the sneaky disconnects have been a problem since the beta the technology just isnt there
hearthstone,not_removed,lol your client disconnected its not them
hearthstone,not_removed,part of the challenge is to complete the quest with a stranger without the means to communicate the brawl is designed with that in mind if you are able to communicate with the other player you trivialize the brawl
hearthstone,not_removed,isnt fun enough reward for a game
hearthstone,not_removed,the technology isnt there yet
hearthstone,not_removed,do friendly brawls count towards brawl quests im assuming not but i havent tried
hearthstone,not_removed,this ive done about brawls each day with strangers for fun other than the occasional idiot this brawl isnt hard to win even without communication
hearthstone,not_removed,actually i think its just to prevent wintrading since other brawls are competitive
hearthstone,not_removed,this week was tough enough that even seeing each others screen didnt trivialize it we almost lost a couple times
hearthstone,not_removed,sure it is but this mode usually gives a reward and asking for a reward for playing a coop brawl with your friend isnt the same thing as begging for rewards
hearthstone,not_removed,it would be if this one provided any
hearthstone,not_removed,they do not friend games dont except for that one week they counted
hearthstone,not_removed,i never lost a game and i played or so brawls as long as your partner doesnt intentionally lose the game for you one person can easily carry the other
hearthstone,not_removed,this brawl wasnt hard when i didnt realise it was coop for the first or so turns and thought the point was board control to have your autoattackers win for you still won it first time
hearthstone,not_removed,they really need to have quests against friends count all the time while i have a complete collection and have played since beta people just starting do have it very hard simply trying to complete some of their quests sure the new types of quests added over the last year have helped that to some degree this would i believe go a long way to helping bring new people into the game and ease that new player experience
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean eventhough its not begging the whole encounter gets trivialised once you can chat with the person on the other side
hearthstone,not_removed,they do count towards the win games in any mode quest though
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,but thats just hilarious
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,id say you have a pretty good deck i cant think of much to put it thats not in an adventure it will definitely get you to a solid rank
hearthstone,not_removed,check out wwwheartharenacom for help with your drafting its not perfect but its usually much better than a new player can do on their own then once youve got drafting down a bit better start watching some of the pro arena streamers on twitch i like watching kripp simcopter guardsmanbob and grinninggoat adwcta and merps
hearthstone,not_removed,try to consider every single play and always look at how the board will look at the end of your turn you will often make quick decisions only to later realize that you are still kind of behind on board this is true in arena much more so than in constructed imo
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for the tip
hearthstone,not_removed,hunter
hearthstone,not_removed,well ill tell you one thing its definitely not freeze mage holds alextrazza and cries in a corner
hearthstone,not_removed,you really want to tech your playstyle for warrior when you have wth if it was winloos from games its fine but youve played games against warriors man
hearthstone,not_removed,token druid and there is no such a word as vsing
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont have the required cards to run token druid so ill see if i can hit rank with hunter
hearthstone,not_removed,i havent been keeping stats for very long it is tied with shaman for most class played i do get what youre saying though the sample size is tiny
hearthstone,not_removed,two more days and i will certainly be trying it
hearthstone,not_removed,hybrid hunter should take you there
hearthstone,not_removed,craft your rare epic cards
hearthstone,not_removed,what legendary do you want to craft have you looked at other hunter decks to see what they play
hearthstone,not_removed,second that if possible craft neutral cards first
hearthstone,not_removed,princess huh not sure what her name is exactly but i thought shed be nice with my highmane
hearthstone,not_removed,she doesnt see play in most midrange hunter decks she was tried but has been replaced by now
hearthstone,not_removed,get to crafting two copies of power of the wild i stead
hearthstone,not_removed,i already have well actually i only crafted one but i got the second from a pack
hearthstone,not_removed,aggro shaman or pretty much any aggro deck thats good right now
hearthstone,not_removed,both of those decks are very viable so the better thing to do might be to see if you can find a streamer you like playing one of them and watch to see what hisher tactics are shaman would probably be your best bet for inexpensive id think if you have many of the jade tools already im sure you could find a deck that suits aggro shaman seems most common right now but midrange jade shaman is also being played id try hearthpwncom to see if theres a deck you can make if you really want to switch over to something new if you use their innkeeper feature you can also sort by what you have or by the dust it would cost you to craft a deck
hearthstone,not_removed,is aggro shaman cheap c
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you will do
hearthstone,not_removed,pretty cheap youll need patches to be any good and probably leeroy to break
hearthstone,not_removed,i agree i always love tavern brawl no matter if its portals spiders or pirates make tavern brawl last all week already
hearthstone,not_removed,edit geez you people cant even handle someone giving them positive feedback on the game there are literally zero comments here
hearthstone,not_removed,im with you man i enjoyed this tb so much pretty much on point with the arena but i feel it was a little bit better than playing arena kinda like a game mode an alternative arena also by far the most ive ever played a tb
hearthstone,not_removed,damn this toxic community cant even handle op
hearthstone,not_removed,you dont have a lot of early game gonna have to get lucky with draws
hearthstone,not_removed,well your beating the mages and rogues so thats something
hearthstone,not_removed,im sorry for your lose
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i feel that already d
hearthstone,not_removed,well its over xd
hearthstone,not_removed,thx p
hearthstone,not_removed,early game is drops you have about playable early game drops to not lose the game not high chances to have good consistent early draws
hearthstone,not_removed,congrats i also just made it to rank for the first time ever using patron shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,congratulations friend ☺
hearthstone,not_removed,congrats i also recently made it into rank with dragon priest whats your deck

hearthstone,not_removed,congrats friend i also finally got to the single digits for the first time this season actually went on a huge win streak all the way to rank a season of firsts d
hearthstone,not_removed,okay
hearthstone,not_removed,here you go friend
hearthstone,not_removed,you sure that elise and thaurr are good i might replace elise with ysera or nef dragons are too low imo and thaurissan with sylvannas more nzoth value i also decided to tech in harrison just crafted him
hearthstone,not_removed,have a better late game
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,you would have hated control warriors of yore armor everywhere
hearthstone,not_removed,i have no way of beating that its literally impossible first things first its not literally impossible i literally hate it when people misuse the term literally further to that of course its not impossible if you do more than damage a turn after theyve played youre going to eventually crack through their armor i mean it just boggles the mind why youd call it literally impossible when its so clearly not anyway more information would be required like what decks youve tried against them and what deck theyre playing if theyre playing control warrior a deck that focuses on survivability and value cards thats one of the better control decks generally the most reliable way to beat this sort of deck is to attempt to outvalue it things like deathrattle minions card draw strong battlecries that sort of thing ill also give mention to from druid if it is indeed a control warrior then if you can keep up with them for the game by trading cards theyll eventually run out and start dying to fatigue jade idol on the other hand means that a druid running it wont ever die to fatigue

hearthstone,not_removed,in some cases it certainly can be literally impossible
hearthstone,not_removed,you are literally wrong in critizing ops usage of literally the informal definiton of literally meaning not literally was even added as informal usage of the word by some dictonaries httpsenoxforddictionariescomdefinitionliterally
hearthstone,not_removed,absolutely from the context of the ops post though the general statement he made indicated that this wasnt the case unless theyre so bad at deckbuilding that their deck has a chance of winning against whatever armor based deck theyre talking about and i get that a full control warrior deck would seem insurmountable to a new player but id be terribly surprised if you couldnt construct a basicsonly deck that had a greater than chance of beating it
hearthstone,not_removed,hm indeed apparently it was changed in so you can forgive me for not being aware after having used the word for around years prior to that p though i have to say that just seems silly literally doesnt have to be literal anymore what a world
hearthstone,not_removed,so most likely his basic deck literally cant beat the control warrior not a misuse of literally if this is literally the case
hearthstone,not_removed,did we actually just have an argument on the word literal im sorry if the way i used literally offended you but why does that matter
hearthstone,not_removed,even then id disagree he has the option to change his basic deck and as i said id be very surprised if a well constructed basic deck had a chance to win against even the best control warrior lists if he can change his list to beat them they arent literally unbeatable
hearthstone,not_removed,i very highly doubt that any combination of basic cards can beat the best control warrior lists
hearthstone,not_removed,to a level id be willing to cede that the probability would be extremely low but there must be some case where the basic player gets an amazing draw and the control warrior gets absolute trash
hearthstone,not_removed,you have to give barnes a little more time he wasnt ready to perform yet

hearthstone,not_removed,no thats a terrible thing to say grow up
hearthstone,not_removed,if someone is genuinely roping for their plays im fine but if someone is just emoting while roping i get mad
hearthstone,not_removed,would that be me or them
hearthstone,not_removed,its obviously exaggeration and hyperbole i would never wish violence on a person im just expressing frustration at the players that wait for rope on turn one and then pass and then use their hero power turn two and wait till rope to pass again etc over and over again
hearthstone,not_removed,waiting for rope on turn one and then passing and then using their hero power turn two and wait till rope to pass again etc over and over again sometimes people even wait till theyre behind to start
hearthstone,not_removed,it doesnt fucking matter to be honest hyperbole or not its ridiculous
hearthstone,not_removed,that feeling when you cant earn any more gold today and youre player btw my first time getting that message
hearthstone,not_removed,i just used the reddit app
hearthstone,not_removed,i think agro takes a fine amount of skill and there are plenty of opportunities to misplay i think in general people hugely overrate the amount of skill it takes to play control decks
hearthstone,not_removed,i play a lot of aggro and for me the level on skill goes like this combocontrolaggrotempomidrange combo is harder since you have to play it a bit like control but if you use your combo pieces too much you will not win control is similar but much more flexible aggro is not braindead you have to think when it is better not to press the board and just use hero power when you should trade rarely but you must sometimes and against some decks balance carefully in the late game if i press and ignore his minions will he kill me similar to combo in half of the games you have to very carefully prepare your lethal turn since usually one turn more means your oponnent will take total control of the game or kill you i read somewhere that the difference between a good or bad aggro player is just damage to the face but that means of win difference
hearthstone,not_removed,watching tournament players use aggro decks im starting to realise that you really have to think about when to play stuff and how much to hold back putting too much on the board can lose you the game if your opponent has a good board clear in hand
hearthstone,not_removed,its the second easiest archetype to play at effectiveness and the hardest to play at excluding incredibly intricate combo decks
hearthstone,not_removed,i think people or at least me are salty about aggro because if you missplay on every oppurtunity you can still win if you missplay on every oppurtunity as a control player you will lose
hearthstone,not_removed,id say aggro is more difficult than midrange you cant just mindlessly play out your curve and have to play around boardclears a lot more
hearthstone,not_removed,but after many denied friend requests and salty opponents telling me how unskillful my secret hunter deck is its hard to make friends unless in the game i would think that only games where the other person won and something special happened ie your rag missed lethal times in a row or something otherwise the comments will more than likely be a saltfest
hearthstone,not_removed,aggro needs some skill but most of the time your gameplan is extremely proactive just dragging everything to the face you are depending more on your draws opponent playing inefficiently than in your actual skill but like any other deck improving your winrate and your decisions needs skill on your part even with a face deck
hearthstone,not_removed,how unskillful my secret hunter deck is whats most infuriating about secret hunter often you just play cloaked huntress a number of secrets on curve this deals with a lot of stuff buffs small minions etc while offloading the work of thinking to your opponent protected by the christmas ornaments you can pursue your game plan while screwing over your opponents
hearthstone,not_removed,aggro taking skill lul
hearthstone,not_removed,shaman is actually less brainless than hunter because you have to worry about more placement with flametongues and such
hearthstone,not_removed,touche warriors spend most of their time hitting the button
hearthstone,not_removed,totally agree the trading decisions are very important in an aggro deck people who just play charge minions and burn spells that all go face will most likely lose because they run out of steam and eventually your board overwhelms their board and health i beat a face pirate warrior with rogue some days ago after playing pillager on he played arcanite reaper on and decided to go face i won the game at simply because he didnt kill my pillager which dealt him damage in turns instead of killing it
hearthstone,not_removed,circlejerk harder pls it definitely takes skill but not in the way that op is describing seriously mulligan skills this is where the circlejerk comes from
hearthstone,not_removed,and aggro decks are less brainless because you are always limited on resource so your every move matters not so much for shaman you can play on curve missplay and never get punished
hearthstone,not_removed,not just that playing reactively is in general easier than playing proactively i do think control vs control is usually more skill intensive than aggro vs aggro but in control vs aggro matchups often its aggro thats faced with the tougher decisions and control is autopilot
hearthstone,not_removed,i love how you just said the button we all know which button it is that one
hearthstone,not_removed,any deck takes some skill op is exaggerating so hard there are plenty of aggro type decks that dont need a brain to pilot of the time if you just go face you have enough burn in the deck to win anyways
hearthstone,not_removed,uh yeah mulligan skill thats a thing you gotta know when to keep certain cards for certain matchups
hearthstone,not_removed,try name deck in the game that will never need you to think of the time
hearthstone,not_removed,good play puppers
hearthstone,not_removed,puppers mvp
hearthstone,not_removed,frankerz approves
hearthstone,not_removed,kripp played a card to the front page we go
hearthstone,not_removed,dont care about his play show more of the pupper
hearthstone,not_removed,whats a pupper
hearthstone,not_removed,your safe on mekripp
hearthstone,not_removed,wait did kripp get another dog or is that someone elses
hearthstone,not_removed,credits go to the streamer who can be found at wwwtwitchtvnlkripp and the op brought to you by your friendly neighborhood bot happy new year
hearthstone,not_removed,love how he complains about priests having epic rarity removal superwhines about having of them and has drafted lightbomb and dragonfire potion himself
hearthstone,not_removed,with where this game is heading i dont really see the point in classes anymore
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont need help understanding ive played tcgs at a professional level kripp has a very small understanding of the inner workings of the game he is capable of making technically correct choices based on current gamestates but he is very limited clue as to what is happening behind the scenes frankly anyone who complains about luck as much as he does has a very limited understanding of game theory he is absolutely not correct about what affecting the boardstate means he is so fundamentally wrong about that that it is essentially the precise opposite of what he said i cannot for the life of me understand why he is popular other than that he gives other people who dont like thinking too hard an outlet for why they lose oh hes unlucky i must be unlucky too i can see no redeeming qualities for this manchild the man is a gradea moron and about as unlikeable as a human being can be edit
hearthstone,not_removed,a tiny doggo
hearthstone,not_removed,he got a corgi like a week ago he put a video of her on his channel she is adorable
hearthstone,not_removed,he got another cute pupper yes
hearthstone,not_removed,cant tell of this is pasta or just a garbage comment
hearthstone,not_removed,kripp is one of the most ancient gaming moguls i treasure his stream tbh
hearthstone,not_removed,haha please you sound full of yourself riamverysmart
hearthstone,not_removed,thats not what game theory is
hearthstone,not_removed,your comment may be right in a way i have no idea but kripp has the best arena win rate in the world he beats top meta decks with original decks he creates he isnt just trying to be legend at all times he plays for fun as much as he plays to just win he hates losing we all do but to say hes bad or doesnt understand the game is a bad argument purely based on his win rate his win rate and consistency destroy your argument
hearthstone,not_removed,a smol doggo this may be a corgo
hearthstone,not_removed,whats a doggo
hearthstone,not_removed,thread so im hearing this meme that kripp doesnt know the inner workings of the game and lets himself rely on luck or rng guys its time for some game theory
hearthstone,not_removed,if its not already pasta it is now god bless
hearthstone,not_removed,yes
hearthstone,not_removed,bro hes really good in arena thats it youre really overselling his abilities in constructed play he constantly makes mistakes that should frankly be embarrassing to someone who has been playing the game for three years already he sucks at ladder play his decks arent good in fact he could only make legend tryharding with face hunter that should tell you his skill level
hearthstone,not_removed,i have one i am sure it is a corgo
hearthstone,not_removed,a big ol pupper
hearthstone,not_removed,holy shit
hearthstone,not_removed,but thats just a theory
hearthstone,not_removed,its pasta and ill take the downvotes to make it happen
hearthstone,not_removed,you act like he cares about ladder or like of his game time isnt in arena he fully states he isnt trying to be the best in constructed he doesnt even use meta decks youre retarded
hearthstone,not_removed,shhhh dont tell people that i like encountering people on ladder trying to win games with kripp netdecks
hearthstone,not_removed,getting to legend is just a grind with the flavorofthemonth deck kripp could easily get to legend youre just jealous
hearthstone,not_removed,lol what was it originally in response to
hearthstone,not_removed,i suggest you reread that turd of a comment you posted the one i replied to wherein your disconnect with reality was on full display your very mention of legend in the context of kripps skill level was laughable the whole point of my reply to you was to say it isnt that kripp just doesnt care to go for legend but that he could never achieve it even if he tried his hardest because hes just not that good at it
hearthstone,not_removed,you dont know what youre talking about he legit had trouble to get legend tryharding with one of the easiest deck to get legend with ever to exist in the game i admire his arena skills hes undoubtedly an arena god but hes just bad at constructed theres no two ways about it what am i jealous of exactly
hearthstone,not_removed,edited to add
hearthstone,not_removed,uh no he definitely could its not hard to play net decks you just sound like a hater who doesnt watch him hes way above most top streamers they just stick to net decks and doing same shit over and over
hearthstone,not_removed,ha thats fantastic sorry you got downvoted so much your sacrifice will not be in vain
hearthstone,not_removed,httphearthstonegamepediacommaievshadowsong will be available to players after they win games in standard format ranked or casual play mode after the first expansion of releases the next expansion of is expected to roll out in the beginning of april so you will get your chance then edit nvm lol you got it
hearthstone,not_removed,they already said there will be no content behind single player missions and because of that they can be and will be harder
hearthstone,not_removed,there is no pve content for this expansion it starts from the one after this
hearthstone,not_removed,but then how do they increase profits the growing developer team needs their salaries paid you know
hearthstone,not_removed,there will be free packs for completing it tho
hearthstone,not_removed,sad i thought its for every expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,id wager freebies increase customer satisfaction which leads to increase in sales
hearthstone,not_removed,yes but nothing exclusive you can get the same packs by other means
hearthstone,not_removed,a staff that works like truesilver would suit the class well but if truesilver were a priest card it would cost mana and people would say its op
hearthstone,not_removed,cool so would pretty much every other class priest doesnt get their own weapons though
hearthstone,not_removed,priest is not a weapon class
hearthstone,not_removed,druid of the flame for hunter
hearthstone,not_removed,malganis for hunters with beasts instead of demons
hearthstone,not_removed,twisting nether in control warrior or control priest
hearthstone,not_removed,i would just give savage roar as is to warlock i like watching the world burn
hearthstone,not_removed,archmage antonidas for rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,tirion fordring for warrior but gives you gorehowl instead or bolvar fordragon who gains attack for every armour you have great with charge
hearthstone,not_removed,hunter alreay has a mana
hearthstone,not_removed,ya that would be soo broken lol
hearthstone,not_removed,just make the text in the bolvar something along the lines of while this is in your hand it gains one attack for every point of armor you gain just so you dont get fucked should you lose all your armor
hearthstone,not_removed,more like the ancient of score
hearthstone,not_removed,i finally got a classic legendary from this weeks brawl pack i was close to the pity timer packs millhouse manastorm
hearthstone,not_removed,that shows why people hate priests even when they are supposedly in the dumpster
hearthstone,not_removed,people are assholes thats it really
hearthstone,not_removed,people who bm are generally people who are losers in real life and use bm to feel better about themselves if they come into a perfect curve in a rng brawl it makes them feel as if they are superior individuals pity them for they are dead inside
hearthstone,not_removed,because the opponent cares
hearthstone,not_removed,either they keep losing in ranked or they are that salty
hearthstone,not_removed,why do people shitpost because of being salty over bm in a rng based brawl in a childrens card game
hearthstone,not_removed,because people are probably just having fun and dont give a shit i swear people on reddit are such babies about this idk why anyone gives a fuck whether or not people bm and emote like crazy get thicker skin and suck it up none of my friends in real life care when people emote constantly or bm for fun
hearthstone,not_removed,actually i just emote because magni is so cool and and a dwarf with a nice voice whats going on in the game doesnt really matter when i do that
hearthstone,not_removed,ho there so many choices buy my beard my hand is full after transaction is complete thank you i gotta move
hearthstone,not_removed,the only time i emote is with malfurion and all i say is my greeting its great for welcoming legendaries to the board especially yogg
hearthstone,not_removed,i really hated piloted shredder it was so strong that you had to add it to your decks and yet i never wanted to because of the stupid rng that was in voloved in it there are many cards i really like and its hard to decide but i think ill go with brann broncebeard you need to build a fitting deck for him and to have a good timing playing him but if he works out he is really strong
hearthstone,not_removed,ice block and call of the wild hate them both
hearthstone,not_removed,i used to hate doomsayer when i was a noob cause i never knew howwhen to play around it now i only hate him when i get frost novad
hearthstone,not_removed,ive been playing a ton of malygos rogue so malygos is easily my favorite card right now and shout out to emperor thaurisan for making combos possible fuck tuskar totemic doom hammer call of the wild but wo it hunter would be worse than priest right now so its whatever and hmm mysterious challenger
hearthstone,not_removed,favorite tie between effigy and sylvanas both have won me so many matches sometimes also in combination most hated every damn hunter card simply because i hate the class and hate to play against it d
hearthstone,not_removed,i really advice you buying karazhan
hearthstone,not_removed,if you have all the staples from classic then id probably go for gadgetzan karazhan has a few cards that you need but if you choose it i wouldnt buy more than the first two wings
hearthstone,not_removed,first question do you have rag if no get classic next is what are your favorite decks that will decide next in line
hearthstone,not_removed,oof you shouldve waited until the nerf to dust him dude
hearthstone,not_removed,its not as simple as a replace because you also might want to cut tomes or babbling books and you might rebuild the deck as a whole because there are better options than the yogg engine im going to test out a barnes engine for example but arcane giants and antonidas work as a starting point for a replacement
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe antonidas to get value out of early game spells that doesnt do much anymore
hearthstone,not_removed,whats your deck list pyro isnt all that great in tempo mage since it can be a dead card for so long
hearthstone,not_removed,a straight replacement without a complete reworking the quickest fix i can think of is cabalists tome yogg emperor thaurissan archmage antonidas the idea is that youd discount a few spells and possibly antonidas himself for a turn where you play antonidas and a few spells for zero or mana giving you two or three fireballs it forces the other player to either kill you that turn or be able to deal with antonidas and take damage without losing id also recommend running flamestrike in that deck if you werent already
hearthstone,not_removed,i would really like to know this as well lol i just got out of a game where i had health cast spells within the game and had a pyroblast in handthe enemy had cthun on board and health instead of pyroblasting for the win i decided to bm with yogg spells come on now damage has to hit him or at least clear his cthun right nope he ran through all the spells he drew me cards overloaded my shit killed did dmg to me and then killed himself yogg is such a troll nowdays he literally just took a ish on my chest rofl feelsbadman
hearthstone,not_removed,this
hearthstone,not_removed,probably not nobody misses the good old patron druid meta of who can drop emperor first i think that the meta has also shifted away from thaurissian as most decks that have a ton of card draw now are low curve aggro or tempo decks that are looking to dump their hand sooner rather than later purely because its more reliable than cycling for thaurissian and hoping you have all the combo pieces
hearthstone,not_removed,i really do hope that some cards are transfering to standard for me emperor shouldnt be rotated out ever it is not game breaking and not obnoxious it is a really balanced card which gives more flexibility and like you said makes more combos happen
hearthstone,not_removed,they claim not to actively support existing archetypes but its pretty obvious they do where they feel like it what for example am i supposed to make of darkshire counsilmanpossessed villagerforbidden ritual except gee zoo is losing some deathrattles lets give them some new stuff its a shame the inept development team wont give priest the same treatment
hearthstone,not_removed,i doubt blizzard would introduce something like emperor again they pretty much hate combo decks and cards like emperor also messes with design
hearthstone,not_removed,the idea of standard is that cards which are meta defining like emperor thaurissan in combo decks will eventually allow room for newer cards to be played in the mean time more cards can come out and encourage other archetypes to be played example control isnt very powerful currently due to all the fast decks that rush you down also combos are mainly centred around cards from the classic set along side some newer cards example malygos hunter is possible due to more mana damaging spells wild on the other hand allows for all these cards to be used simultaneously so later on in the life line of the game when more cards with combo interactions are released a better combo deck can be created
hearthstone,not_removed,because fuck priest
hearthstone,not_removed,i would argue that thaurissan also is key in a lot of control decks as well and blizzard does like control thaurissan is one of the cards that gives opponents a chance to interact with combo decks which is something that blizzard likes
hearthstone,not_removed,i would argue that thaurissan isnt meta defining at all combo decks are rarely at the top tier it is just a card that supports the archetype
hearthstone,not_removed,blizzard would rather take away combo decks rather than having someone react to it you can see this from their reasoning of blade flurry nerf as well as patron warrior nerf and previously even auctioneer direct damage from hand fun in their philosophy
hearthstone,not_removed,by that logic they would have nerfed almost every mage spell in the classic set or just deleted the mage class altogether as all most every mage deck in the game is at least partially dealing a lot of damage strait from the hand damage from hand is ok as long as there is room to play around it blade flurry wasnt nerfed because of the damage aspect it was the fact that it just did too much a board clear plus a fair bit of burst damage to the face for just mana patron warrior was just due to the fact that you really couldnt play around the combo at all no matter what there is no reacting to it they have been happy to allow healthier combo decks in the past like freeze mage and miracle rogue it was just combos that you couldnt prepare for that cause problems
hearthstone,not_removed,is the latest i could find its still post wog
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,they dont show up at least days after you complete them not reroll them
hearthstone,not_removed,i thought quests werent supposed to show up again for at least days after you reroll them ive never heard anything like that
hearthstone,not_removed,i thought quests werent supposed to show up again for at least days after you reroll them nope cant say ive ever heard that before
hearthstone,not_removed,judging by the quality of certain posts quite many on this sub are
hearthstone,not_removed,youre absolutely right although i dont think their delivery was intended but a result of attempting to be campy as well as being game developers and not actors in the future blizz should abstain from employing any new member who doesnt at least hold a goden globe this will solve all problems involved with their quadannual hs video posts
hearthstone,not_removed,what do you mean
hearthstone,not_removed,they were just being playful
hearthstone,not_removed,something something childrens card game
hearthstone,not_removed,i guess to some people they seemed slightly awkward but its hard not to get won over by bens ethusiasm
hearthstone,not_removed,i can see use in a reno deck
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think so its an elemental and they added the elemental texts to other cards so there has to be some sort of support coming for it and in wow mages can summon an elemental so it would fit the theme maybe im just optimistic though
hearthstone,not_removed,well white eyes gets shuffled into your deck and doesnt have elemental synergy i think its bad too but who knows maybe elementals are broken
hearthstone,not_removed,the funny thing is that pyros would have been a decent priest card
hearthstone,not_removed,the meta would have to be the slowest its ever been
hearthstone,not_removed,of course it is if there are no good elemental synergies well have to see
hearthstone,not_removed,reno rotates out
hearthstone,not_removed,reno removed from game
hearthstone,not_removed,fair but does anyone take wild seriously yet
hearthstone,not_removed,wait is there a scenario that the play he made would work out well or was that just a complete misplay the warlock knows that he still has at least one dragon in hand because he activated twilight guardian and hasnt played any dragons since
hearthstone,not_removed,that face in the thumbnail says it all
hearthstone,not_removed,this is what happens when you let a mage play warlock
hearthstone,not_removed,i love the gamut of trumps emotions from ohhh free dragons wait no hes gonna clearwait he cant clear yes what yes
hearthstone,not_removed,oh yess no yess no

hearthstone,not_removed,even at rank you still see rat getting misplayed so hard once again we see someone just drop it for no apparent reason with not even any mana to do a removal if he had it
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont understand why he reacts like that the enemy seeing that he hasnt played doomsayer yet assumed he was in his hand so he played the dirty rat it was a gamble but the right play nontheless
hearthstone,not_removed,this was likely a trump fan letting him win he missed lethal twice in the two turns prior to this
hearthstone,not_removed,my money is on misplay but theoretically if he traded his brann into the cabal and somehow knew trumps hand was chillmaw dragon he could have done a really cute board clear if chillmaw was brought out
hearthstone,not_removed,i didnt watch the game so dont know if trump never played doomsayer but you could be hoping to pull that out to clear the board
hearthstone,not_removed,something something reno is a dragon
hearthstone,not_removed,warlock was running out of steam and trump had a better board dirty rat was most likely a hail mary of some sort
hearthstone,not_removed,if he would have had doomsayer in had people would have called out sniper so hard
hearthstone,not_removed,there was a delay i think they were fishing for reno
hearthstone,not_removed,your can tell he didnt play it because of the deck list on the right
hearthstone,not_removed,my bet would be he wanted to get a doomsayer as a way out
hearthstone,not_removed,kripp justifiably salty after playing that game good god
hearthstone,not_removed,this whole game was insane
hearthstone,not_removed,this was at two potentially win decks going head to head that soon is fairly mind boggling

hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think there is one place but you can find it on this subreddit if you search hard enough one of the posts the newest is morgl sir finley
hearthstone,not_removed,nope it was just like this the last time in fact one of the keys to playing this brawl is knowing which cards to pick and how they will interact with your opponent getting no draws for example joust will almost always tie naturalize and recycle are both buffed and running someone to fatigue via fel reaver doesnt really accomplish much if youre really desperate for more pirates i recommend you play warlock
hearthstone,not_removed,weird ive a total mind blank on this brawl then thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,people think that all the aggro decks are ruining the game and instead of finding a way to counter them they go on reddit and complain the same people think its the design teams fault that theyre not a higher rank so they want the ladder to be reworked
hearthstone,not_removed,read
hearthstone,not_removed,hovering around in the ladder rank is frustrating when higher ranks give better rewards
hearthstone,not_removed,literally everything in hs
hearthstone,not_removed,tentacle pirates four mana secret agents coming throughwhats not to be mad about
hearthstone,not_removed,perfect summation this place has been embarrassing lately
hearthstone,not_removed,if you see a problem find a solution bitching about it isnt going to solve anything thats whats so frustrating about this subreddit right now aggro is actually good for this game because it keeps the greedy control decks in line and it adds variety to the game i understand why people are bitching i just dont understand why dont they take it upon themselves to play midrange shaman or renodecks to have a positive winrate against aggro instead of letting someone else in this case team or whatever to fix the problem for them this reminds me of that one month of hysteria were everyone was bitching about secret paladin and what happened after a month people teched all their decks against it like freaking tidesoftime ran mctechs in his druid list yes people can have different opinions but the circle jerk gets old dont even get me started on people asking for the ladder to be entirely reworked i just want to say though i see you a lot in this subreddit and i pretty much always agree with what you say
hearthstone,not_removed,the only match making happening is your rank you can fight somneone who this is his first game ever or someone who spent years playing both on the same rank so yes this is normal sadly
hearthstone,not_removed,youll be facing people with basic cards in their deck up to around rank and you should be able to hit rank with a little grinding since you cant lose stars you wont get below rank unless youre very very skilled with deckbuilding or you use a netdeck ive seen everything from golden portraits to tier dragon warriors at rank its a cluserfuck that only netdecks or highly experienced deckbuilders escape from my advice get rank and the chestcard back and then just get the daily quests build up dust through the free packs and eventually craft a tier or tier netdeck to go further dont pick the deck based on how high it is tier is good enough to break out if youve got half a mind for how to play just pick a deck you enjoy and that you can afford personally im loving cthun warrior i enjoy the controlling style fast decks dont suit me even though mid hunter and zoolock just shit all over me every time we match up
hearthstone,not_removed,fair enough i thought it was weird i was seeing legendary cards at like rank
hearthstone,not_removed,being as it was the last day it could have just been people getting to for the card back that put it off this long unless the season reset already not sure when it does just sometime tonight in which case it could easily be someone who just lost his normal rank and is going back up to that said having legendaries doesnt make the player or deck automatically good and not all legendaries are good themselves its just luck of the draw and the opponents getting lucky with using them if it isnt one of the two situations above
hearthstone,not_removed,season resets in about hrs from now so it may be ppl grinding out to lvl may just be normal start of the season is always a shitfest of veterans just crushing everyone as they rise in rank mid to end of the month is ever so slightly easier but yeah seeing a few legendaries is normal around there just keep grinding to lvl and then leave ladder and just focus on dust to craft a netdeck any farther and youll very quickly become frustrated with the game and quit it really is a shitstorm at lvl regardless of the time of the month giggity
hearthstone,not_removed,solid thanks for the advice
hearthstone,not_removed,will do so you think just hit and then do dailies in casualai matches and brawls
hearthstone,not_removed,yup dailies and tavern brawls classic is a good investment for the gold since it never rotates out but wotog has a lot of great cards that are required for the net decks
hearthstone,not_removed,can confirm none of the cards played were living roots daddy deathwing is very similar to be fair

hearthstone,not_removed,they released a couple of new quests which have free packs i am not sure if they are daily quests or general quests like wotg edit check this post
hearthstone,not_removed,lol no
hearthstone,not_removed,its in the rogue class challenge but im not sure whats required for that i think but im not positive that you have to beat all the wings to unlock specifically the rogue class challenge
hearthstone,not_removed,it makes no difference in cost it will subtract from the cost each time you buy one of the wings if you dont get them all he is in the rogue class challenge by getting wing four so all of it really
hearthstone,not_removed,its in the wing plus youll also get a fuck ton more really good cards like brann and reno if you buy the full thing
hearthstone,not_removed,if you really want tomb pillager then just buy the whole adventure because its more expensive if you buy each one separately tomb pillager is in wing the last wing
hearthstone,not_removed,incorrect all you need is the halls of explorers completed and you can purchase that wing
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for clarifying i knew it was wing but i wasnt sure if you had to unlock previous wings to get there

hearthstone,not_removed,still a better love story than twilight
hearthstone,not_removed,if he is a close online friend to you and is worth worring as much as posting to a whole community you should probably add him on other media as well get discord get his phone number for whatsapptelegram add him in steam or however the other platforms are called hell even just add him on facebook there has to be a way d anyway im happy that the alexmund bromance can go on
hearthstone,not_removed,forgot to write dont upvote pls and then top comment would be so very original upvoted anyways dont tell me what to do
hearthstone,not_removed,close friend but you do not have him on any other form of social media
hearthstone,not_removed,we really need some extra confirmation buttons here and there
hearthstone,not_removed,this is the best craigslist lost connection ever
hearthstone,not_removed,i just want to find a sigismund some day
hearthstone,not_removed,and i go and immediately look at each persons post history to determinate
hearthstone,not_removed,somewhere in lordran
hearthstone,not_removed,in all seriousness this is a real problem with the battletag system not being able to search for users without having the digits at the end is really stupid
hearthstone,not_removed,still better love story than twilight
hearthstone,not_removed,add me i struggle to get friends on hearthstone none of my mates play

hearthstone,not_removed,oh snap i was friends with sigismund too cool guy
hearthstone,not_removed,hearthstone is such a lovely community
hearthstone,not_removed,honestly why do we need this battletag thing it causes more trouble than it does good imo but im new to the game so
hearthstone,not_removed,how is he your close friend if you cant contact him by other means than bnet
hearthstone,not_removed,this seems appropriate
hearthstone,not_removed,think of how many random adds he is getting now
hearthstone,not_removed,this sub reaches new lows everyday at least theres something consistant with it

hearthstone,not_removed,reddit is amazing sometimes this makes a finnish guys otherwise crappy morning happy it even freaking snowed here enjoy the friendship
hearthstone,not_removed,i was convinced this was a new fake account but it checks out
hearthstone,not_removed,rip friends list
hearthstone,not_removed,i used to play wow during bc on the realm maelstrom and my guild leader for an rp guild arbiters of light had the name sigismund any chance thats you shot in the dark here
hearthstone,not_removed,fuck yeah

hearthstone,not_removed,ive been kidnapped and my napper demands a new playstation pro
hearthstone,not_removed,underrated comment
hearthstone,not_removed,how dare op unfriend the son of dorn heresy
hearthstone,not_removed,heresy so much heresy where is that commissar when u need him
hearthstone,not_removed,vulkan shall fight to protect all friendships with lots and lots of promethium
hearthstone,not_removed,sigismund wrote his full battle tag inside of a world of warcraft graphic novel and then sold it to a used bookstore now op goes from bookstore to bookstore looking for that novel just hoping that his friends name will be inside
hearthstone,not_removed,they should have a recently deleted friends list to readd
hearthstone,not_removed,i think thats to unclear we should add more popups and visual cues
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel like a similar filter needs to be put in for adding friends to ensure that people arent just adding somebody to shit talk them after a match
hearthstone,not_removed,good vibes
hearthstone,not_removed,is worth worring as much as posting to a whole community i wouldnt see this as a downside those internet points are just a bonus
hearthstone,not_removed,it already asks you if youre sure when you click remove
hearthstone,not_removed,but both accts are not main accounts go figure i have a separate reddit account for when i need to give away my battle tag too
hearthstone,not_removed,did you pick the in your reddit name because of the first two numbers in your btag
hearthstone,not_removed,euna
hearthstone,not_removed,ahhh so thats how friends are found does it work even if you didnt have any to begin with
hearthstone,not_removed,unfortunately theres no way to lookup specifics about it like a reverse image search comparatively
hearthstone,not_removed,true they would not search everybody but since you already had him as friend but deleted him they might be able to help you
hearthstone,not_removed,two reasons firstly and more importantly this allows multiple users to have the same name and still have unique battle tags so that we arent stuck finding alternate versions of the name we want blizzard sticks a number on the end to differentiate between all of the various out there second it keeps popular streamers from being inundated with friend requests
hearthstone,not_removed,aww young romance its so beautiful
hearthstone,not_removed,this made me think of this scene for some reason xd
hearthstone,not_removed,still a better lovestory than twilight
hearthstone,not_removed,i love comments like urs thanks for the good laugh
hearthstone,not_removed,peso

hearthstone,not_removed,holy shit ive been playing for almost years and didnt know that
hearthstone,not_removed,what
hearthstone,not_removed,tfw your friend is a top legend player and you get suggested pro players
hearthstone,not_removed,being friends with sigismund restricted the design space for new friends
hearthstone,not_removed,weve decided to remove humor on sigismund we feel he was too much an include in many friendships and this change should give some others friends a better chance in ops circle
hearthstone,not_removed,did someone say
hearthstone,not_removed,he can see it in your smile
hearthstone,not_removed,i dunno the next lyric
hearthstone,not_removed,is leaking
hearthstone,not_removed,byeeee
hearthstone,not_removed,yes
hearthstone,not_removed,did someone ever saw underrated comment having a positive score
hearthstone,not_removed,little did he know he already has the book in the dresser draw of the guest bedroom in his south beach level condo
hearthstone,not_removed,watch out holliwood will steal and sell it as the nerdy romantic lovestory flick of
hearthstone,not_removed,yes but are you sure youre sure one can never be too careful
hearthstone,not_removed,actually its a coincidence haha and my birthday is on the
hearthstone,not_removed,i didnt mean it like that i checked for the names of some of my current friends on google and since i had their battletag for reference i was able to identify almost all of them that way i also found a very old acquiantance only knowing their nickname without the number
hearthstone,not_removed,you forgot the reason to shame those with digit tags because they are inferior beings
hearthstone,not_removed,tale as old as time

hearthstone,not_removed,the day long con for internet points
hearthstone,not_removed,to be fair i think it was added fairly recently
hearthstone,not_removed,i think they added this feature only like a month ago
hearthstone,not_removed,it was added recently
hearthstone,not_removed,holy shit ive had a battlenet account since and didnt know that
hearthstone,not_removed,youre all he ever wanted
hearthstone,not_removed,seeing as it was left forgotten with almost no upvotes falling down the comment list yeah it was underrated at that time thanks for trying though good on you
hearthstone,not_removed,too late some one already stole it and travelled back in time to make the movie
hearthstone,not_removed,rip decksluts
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah some other parts of the game dont even have a single are you sure button really annoying i sometimes missclick and tell the client i dont want it to finish my deck automoatically i want it to ask me if im sure that i dont want it to finish it automatically then perhaps implement your idea and make it ask me if im sure that im sure i dont want it to finish my deck automatically
hearthstone,not_removed,did you pick the in your birthday because of the last two numbers on your reddit name
hearthstone,not_removed,now whats the last digits of your social and your mothers maiden name
hearthstone,not_removed,i know i was just kidding around
hearthstone,not_removed,tonight

hearthstone,not_removed,theres fucking chance thats not just gibberish
hearthstone,not_removed,eikö torilla voi ennakkoäänestää
hearthstone,not_removed,except the op account is the new one
hearthstone,not_removed,weve been able to see friends of friends for much longer than that but recently i think they connected it to facebook and made a search field
hearthstone,not_removed,its been a part of battlenet since they did the big update for wow years ago
hearthstone,not_removed,i laughed way harder than i should have to that
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah its like playing against aggro with me i take everything at face value
hearthstone,not_removed,a tale of terrible tragedy
hearthstone,not_removed,im gonna have myself a real good time
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,beauty and the beast
hearthstone,not_removed,i was just rewatching it yesterday so it sprang to mind
hearthstone,not_removed,fandens svensker
hearthstone,not_removed,are you telling me you cant speak fluent goblin
hearthstone,not_removed,its go absentee vote already
hearthstone,not_removed,paikkakunnasta riippuen mutta oletan että ei tämmöisillä säillä
hearthstone,not_removed,fuck should i buy a pitchfork or no
hearthstone,not_removed,friends of friends got added roughly a little over a year ago to the blizzardbattlenet app
hearthstone,not_removed,battlenet whats that
hearthstone,not_removed,of darth plageius the wise
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel aliiiive
hearthstone,not_removed,well neither can you since its elvish not goblin failfish
hearthstone,not_removed,noni
hearthstone,not_removed,ive been able to manually view friends of friends ever since they added realid years ago im fairly sure that was a part of the realid feature
hearthstone,not_removed,rip battlenet
hearthstone,not_removed,its blizzardnet kappa
hearthstone,not_removed,i hate sand
hearthstone,not_removed,a surprise to be sure but a welcome one
hearthstone,not_removed,its the blizzard app
hearthstone,not_removed,which loads like seconds battlenet was launching in few seconds
hearthstone,not_removed,so its treason then
hearthstone,not_removed,auwarghhhh
hearthstone,not_removed,treason have you lost your mind arthas
hearthstone,not_removed,i am your father
hearthstone,not_removed,nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
hearthstone,not_removed,nope
hearthstone,not_removed,hopefully it will come back np
hearthstone,not_removed,the demon is likely the one you summon from the kazakus potion the sheep is the one created by the kazakus potion they are outcomes of the jury rigged concoction
hearthstone,not_removed,rumors say kazakus is a demon and a dragon lies
hearthstone,not_removed,every token you can get from kazakus is listed there
hearthstone,not_removed,by vanilla do you mean just basic cards no gem or classic set and basics
hearthstone,not_removed,is this a suggestion or a psa im assuming it is a feature request you want blizzard to implement but you might want to make that clearer for example by putting in your title next time
hearthstone,not_removed,are there even enough cards for that
hearthstone,not_removed,httpwwwtvtropescommainurbanlegendofzelda
hearthstone,not_removed,if you go back to the sick guy in midgar you can revive aeris
hearthstone,not_removed,proof
hearthstone,not_removed,no text on minions
hearthstone,not_removed,httpwwwtvtropescommainurbanlegendofzelda note that the above is merely the same kind of nonsense
hearthstone,not_removed,httpwwwtvtropescommainurbanlegendofzelda
hearthstone,not_removed,ops cousin works at valve so he knows these things
hearthstone,not_removed,httpwwwtvtropescommainurbanlegendofzelda
hearthstone,not_removed,httpwwwtvtropescommainurbanlegendofzelda
hearthstone,not_removed,it means you got disconnected you lose turn off the game and restart
hearthstone,not_removed,this occurs when you draw and play a card too fast and youre technically disconnected in that you dont send any data to the server but you can still receive what hes doing like hovers and emotes restarting fast enough fixes the problem
hearthstone,not_removed,bug restart the game whenever this happens
hearthstone,not_removed,its you disconnected from the server youve already lost
hearthstone,not_removed,no hes still replying to emotes looking through his cards and everything it just doesnt stop i tried restarting switched from android to pc and back nothing works
hearthstone,not_removed,how have you switched from one device to another without the game ending that literally cant happen youve gotta be bugged just close all game clients you may have opened and start over
hearthstone,not_removed,you most certainly can ive dropped from a phone game it was just faster to relaunch on pc no problems
hearthstone,not_removed,thats amazing he had a out of chance to win the game from the top deck cleric zoobot wrath gave lethal and claw gave a possibility to survive another turn
hearthstone,not_removed,why not make lightwell give adjacent minions health rather than all minions if this change was made that way it would be positioning based like flametongue also you missed my favorite priest card mass dispel i would like this card to be made viable perhaps by decreasing its mana cost or printing a new card that destroys all silenced minions to indirectly buff it
hearthstone,not_removed,i thought about that but the balance of health doesnt let minions trade up like attack does attack even temporary is basically damage theres a reason abusive sergeant is getting a nerf soon the same reason that we see more minions with high health at low cost but few with high attack at low cost just look at the number of drops with health and upsides how many cost minions have attack without a downside i think a positioningdependent tag to the card would make it too weak since the goal is to keep the minions alive which removes a lot of synergy that flametongue totem has where the dead minions gives the next one in line a buff as well as for mass dispel i love it too i can tell youre a priest player because youre even able to remember it exists i struggled to think of a good way to keep the spirit of the card alive while also not making it op the best i could come up with was to remove the card draw since its such a valuable part of it and drop its cost to printing a good mana card for priest without a niche is almost pointless with how many they have but balancing a cost standard priest card is more reasonable
hearthstone,not_removed,are you a sad pirate warrior
hearthstone,not_removed,im a sad midrange hunter
hearthstone,not_removed,class neutral card type minion rarity legendary mana cost card text after you summon a minion trigger its deathrattle effect attack health
hearthstone,not_removed,so do you get infinite dreadsteeds with this summon one and it chains until your board is full
hearthstone,not_removed,sylvanas died for this
hearthstone,not_removed,umbramoat lurker oh the possibilities
hearthstone,not_removed,there are so many ways that weasel tunneler can break the game now
hearthstone,not_removed,really a shame it specifies minions i was looking forward to comboing it with for mana do nothing
hearthstone,not_removed,cairne on board play umbra and moat lurker cairne moat lurker dathrattle triggers summoning a copy of cairne newly summoned cairne triggers summoning a baine moat lurker still has a cairne inside it you now have a board of baine umbra moat lurkerdeathrattle summon cairne newly summoned cairne baine edit also the instant dreadsteed full board is pretty funny
hearthstone,not_removed,so the cost of the expansion just went up by dust
hearthstone,not_removed,turn this into turn living mana what the actual fuck
hearthstone,not_removed,this is pretty much the idea of your deathrattle minions have battlecry instead idea that has been thrown around for years
hearthstone,not_removed,new brann
hearthstone,not_removed,amazing in jade rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,this is the card jade decks need to push them into viability
hearthstone,not_removed,this before aya and its like brann never left
hearthstone,not_removed,jesus christ this is strong wild is gonna die
hearthstone,not_removed,instantly fill board with dreadsteeds
hearthstone,not_removed,damn priest getting three legendaries this expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,not sure if art is original or just a screen grab from the teenage mutant ninja turtles series
hearthstone,not_removed,neutral legendary mana after you summon a minion trigger its deathrattle effect
hearthstone,not_removed,blizzard gives kripp the op cards seems really good and this is exactly why sylvanas got removed for those asking the card is a neutral legendary mana after you summon a minion trigger its deathrattle effect
hearthstone,not_removed,everyones talking about sylvanas and im just staring at stalaag and feugen with wide gaping eyes
hearthstone,not_removed,this card looks amazing for decks with a good number of deathrattles im guessing this is probably the reason why sylvanas is rotating
hearthstone,not_removed,synergy
hearthstone,not_removed,ill definitely be trying out a priest combo pseudootk deck with this umbra embrace shadows x mistress of mixtures circle of healing profit definitely not competitive but seems like we wont have many combo options soon then ill join the op priest club and play quest
hearthstone,not_removed,in wild with one tick from emperor thaurissan umbra rivendare chow chow mistress embrace heal face damage with mana and only cards blizzard pls nerf
hearthstone,not_removed,this card will be new brann of standard so much value in low cost minion like this
hearthstone,not_removed,suddenly sylvanas migrating to the hall of fame seems more sensible
hearthstone,not_removed,sherazin synergy s
hearthstone,not_removed,first auto craft of this expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,sooo like brann but with deathrattle instead good card really synergize with bomb squad
hearthstone,not_removed,since its summon and not play does it trigger nzoths summons
hearthstone,not_removed,first legendary to craft boys
hearthstone,not_removed,cant wait to get some emperors procs into a majordo oh
hearthstone,not_removed,i really want to see umbra into skygolem into shreder into nerubian egg in wild hope some youtuber will deliver
hearthstone,not_removed,this has potential to have synergy with deathrattle cards
hearthstone,not_removed,when your opponent leaves any deathrattles up and you just umbra volazj
hearthstone,not_removed,this should be really strong in deathrattle quest nzoth priest
hearthstone,not_removed,i cant watch the video feels bad man can someone describe it to me
hearthstone,not_removed,it is summon too its good we dont have sylvanas and dreadsteed in standard anymore
hearthstone,not_removed,wellanother day one craft
hearthstone,not_removed,so dr boom just got even better summon two boom bots deal damage to a random enemy twice
hearthstone,not_removed,i predict this card will be nerfed to or cost by the end of the expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,just needs twothree emperor ticks and i can summon ragnaros without having to kill executus
hearthstone,not_removed,its summon so it works with all the copy as guys edit and resurrect effects
hearthstone,not_removed,i was wondering when kripp would get to reveal his card
hearthstone,not_removed,jade rogue hype
hearthstone,not_removed,turtle power
hearthstone,not_removed,this is it i finally have a day craft for ungoro
hearthstone,not_removed,wait there is another op priest legendary besides this ones
hearthstone,not_removed,jade rogue wow so fun very value wow
hearthstone,not_removed,pretty good prob try to draw this or craft it
hearthstone,not_removed,new brann
hearthstone,not_removed,finally the buff that tirion needed
hearthstone,not_removed,it says summon does that mean that if you play nzoth with this on the board you you get a shit load of deathrattles triggered
hearthstone,not_removed,you can get some crazy stuff comboing with moat lurker imagine if you could get something like this play spiritsinger play a deathrattle minion deathrattle play moat lurker and kill the minion deathrattle moat lurkers deathrattle goes off and resummons the minion causing its deathrattle from spiritsinger deathrattle moat lurker dies summoning the original minion spiritsinger triggers its deathrattle deathrattle both minions die deathrattle
hearthstone,not_removed,this card looks really good
hearthstone,not_removed,combo with bomb squad kappa
hearthstone,not_removed,just to verify if you summon a minion with battlecry adapt and pick the deathrattle this will give you the immediately right
hearthstone,not_removed,so its grann bird beak
hearthstone,not_removed,this combined with is gunna be insane with the priest quest since this is on summon not on play
hearthstone,not_removed,this expansion is getting expensive so many cards to craftget
hearthstone,not_removed,spiritsinger umbra neutral legendary mana after you summon a minion trigger its deathrattle effect how poetic kripp gets a triggered card cant wait to see his priceless reactions when staring down this bad boy on the other side of the table
hearthstone,not_removed,goodness this is looking like a must craft
hearthstone,not_removed,of course they give kripp one of the best cards weve seen in the set so far lol
hearthstone,not_removed,yay more brann effects
hearthstone,not_removed,like the card hope i open one
hearthstone,not_removed,guess was right huh
hearthstone,not_removed,obligatory combo reliant op legendary granted its deathrattle one of the most powerful effect in game still doubtful it will be broken powerful maybe decent most likely
hearthstone,not_removed,umbra moat lurker friendly weasel tunneler with baron rivendare profit
hearthstone,not_removed,now i know why living mana is in jtu
hearthstone,not_removed,where was the guy who predicted this card just that he said it was priest legendary and not neutral
hearthstone,not_removed,i was pretty sad that they put her into the hall of fame she was my very first legendary and a gold one at that i put her into every crappy deck i made back in the day but now im getting dust from her and seeing this new card i can see why they made this move shes going to see a fair amount of play in wild thats for sure
hearthstone,not_removed,damn this will be annoying to face against
hearthstone,not_removed,i immediately thought of some kind of auchenai zombie chow combo deck with this
hearthstone,not_removed,this card with anubisath sentinel in wild is nuts you play them both on mana and get effectively worth of stats which is pretty good and then deathrattle your way to an added on top of that just filthy all in all a potential mana worth just raw stats you can also use this to force the stalegg and feugen combo and achieve some thick thaddeus memes and since were on the subject maybe we just run him in wild nzoth paladin while we are at it and include some hand buffs to allow for even more outlandish baselines and then curve into nzoth on ten thats so oh my goodness
hearthstone,not_removed,doesnt dreadsteed just immediately fill your board since the wording is after you summon
hearthstone,not_removed,wild format just became wilder
hearthstone,not_removed,this card seems like a musthave with the new expansion instacraft if i dont open it from the packs ill have on launch day
hearthstone,not_removed,good card but i actually think design like this is really boring its quite limiting because this will essentially be an auto include in any decks with deathrattle focus its also completely dependent on other cards
hearthstone,not_removed,the new braan should be able to pull off some fun combos with this
hearthstone,not_removed,how will this interact with nzoth lets say i play this then aya but she gets hexed will nzoth still bring back the one aya because her deathrattle triggered or does the game actually keep track of which of your minions died
hearthstone,not_removed,funny how neutral legendaries are becoming more powerful than class legendaries now
hearthstone,not_removed,this card is pretty powerful even the stats are good for the mana cost looking like the best legendary weve gotten so far blizzard didnt skip the kripp
hearthstone,not_removed,it seems preeetttyyy good
hearthstone,not_removed,oh its hp is covered by my logo okay guys you dont know how much hp it has better go watch the video oh kripp you cheeky fucker
hearthstone,not_removed,looks op nzoth seems to be the pushed direction for control decks
hearthstone,not_removed,excellent card can easily see a number of decks built around this card for numerous classes will be very fun to see this in action
hearthstone,not_removed,reminder that many many players will have of dust to burn on jug launch day thanks to hall of fame dust payouts trust me umbra will be seen everywhere also while everyone has noted strong interactions like tirion dreadsteed and savannah highmane here are some you may have overlooked selfless hero to shield a random minion maybe umbra itself jade swarmer to summon a jade golem spawn of nzoth to give all your guys corrupted healbot to hit face for if you have an auchenaitype effect in place deathwing dragon lord to bring all dragons in your hand onto the battlefield
hearthstone,not_removed,turns deathrattles into battlecries holy heck thats good
hearthstone,not_removed,kinda feels like a neutral fandral priest is gonna be op op
hearthstone,not_removed,if i copy a deathrattle with unearthed raptors battlecry does this proc
hearthstone,not_removed,it says summon so this should work with the priest tovir aswell the summon a copy of a minion so if you have a nice deathrattle on board you could stillactivate it
hearthstone,not_removed,this looks to be good in nzoth priest wonder if you will be able to make a kazakhs nzoth priest viable
hearthstone,not_removed,that sherazin synergy
hearthstone,not_removed,neat
hearthstone,not_removed,if you ever get to mana you can have some fun synergies
hearthstone,not_removed,looks pretty good in hunter
hearthstone,not_removed,spiritsinger umbra deathlord wonky dirty rat
hearthstone,not_removed,i think wild just broke sylvanas and umbra for days
hearthstone,not_removed,wow my prediction a couple of weeks ago was actually really close i cant wait to see the shenanigans that people try to pull with this card and baron rivendare in wild
hearthstone,not_removed,they are keep making new characters but there are still a lot unused from ungoro in wow if they forgot about maximillian of northshire i wil riot
hearthstone,not_removed,seeing this then aya will be so much fun
hearthstone,not_removed,the godhand prediction for this in that other thread nice job bud
hearthstone,not_removed,the dreadsteed synergy
hearthstone,not_removed,but i already got my pitchfork out what do i do with it now
hearthstone,not_removed,well what worries me is that they clearly cant make many powerful deathrattle minions without making nzoth completely broken so i was expecting that once it rotates next year would be the year of deathrattles but this card delays that much more so basically there wont be absolute freedom to make strong deathrattle minions for a long time i wanted that design space to be explored more but well
hearthstone,not_removed,any idea how this works with cards that have battlecry gain a deathrattle specifically unearthed raptor or moat lurker does the battlecry activate before spiritsingers effect or after
hearthstone,not_removed,this card is insane o
hearthstone,not_removed,rip baron rivendare
hearthstone,not_removed,it helps give you the extra tempo when playing majordomo with the instant rag might be a bit op
hearthstone,not_removed,crafting this day one even if just for my nzoth rogue wild deck
hearthstone,not_removed,someone called this
hearthstone,not_removed,the fact that this is an ongoing effect makes it even stronger in priest because you can get the effect again with onyx bishop sadly resurrect rotates out or even kazakus if youre going for a renostyle deck
hearthstone,not_removed,rip baron rivendare in dreadlock
hearthstone,not_removed,man they could have just made it a priest only legendary its gonna be an auto include in every deck anyway
hearthstone,not_removed,cant wait to get it from barnes
hearthstone,not_removed,spiritsinger umbra weasel tunneler bois
hearthstone,not_removed,they could have at least pretended to care about wild and make it cost with appropriate body
hearthstone,not_removed,how does it interact with moat lurker
hearthstone,not_removed,i wasnt sure about what legendary i was going to craft first for this set but now i know this made me so much more excited for the ungoro
hearthstone,not_removed,neutral fandral youll be seeing this card for years boys
hearthstone,not_removed,this and living mana wtf
hearthstone,not_removed,how does this card work with raptor especially with a brann on board
hearthstone,not_removed,oh its brann for deathrattles
hearthstone,not_removed,thaddius returns woop
hearthstone,not_removed,this is the first legendary ive figured will be a week one craft not that the rest have been bad just not sylvanas level of nearly every deck compatibility and for mana
hearthstone,not_removed,i want to combo this with deathwing dragonlord
hearthstone,not_removed,damn new brann basically
hearthstone,not_removed,so is this the deathrattle version of brann it seems pretty good
hearthstone,not_removed,what the hell is wrong with his forehead
hearthstone,not_removed,crazy in slower demon decks in wild mad synergy with both voidcaller and dreadsteed as well as other deathrattles that would be in that deck
hearthstone,not_removed,so this works with raptor too right bartlecry goes off first then the minion is summoned
hearthstone,not_removed,finally a brann for nzoth decks
hearthstone,not_removed,does playing malorne with this on board just effectively eat up mana without effect
hearthstone,not_removed,is master of disguise still standard id love to see her hit this card followed by a nzoth
hearthstone,not_removed,im so making a weasel tunneler deck with this card shadowcastershadow step with the rogue quest evil laugh
hearthstone,not_removed,this is the meta defining card
hearthstone,not_removed,do we have confirmation on whether the deathrattle stays and triggers the second time when a minion dies or does it act like a battlecry and goes away
hearthstone,not_removed,autoinclude in any deck that favours dearhrattle right
hearthstone,not_removed,malorne synergy
hearthstone,not_removed,spiritslinger umbra sylvanas moat lurker on sylvanas next turn for even more profit
hearthstone,not_removed,this card is more like probably
hearthstone,not_removed,new skeleton knight meta
hearthstone,not_removed,deathwing dragonlord combo
hearthstone,not_removed,so its currently triggered whenever a minion is put into play from any source and not only on cast from your hand a la battlecries i imagine this is gonna be nerfed to hell
hearthstone,not_removed,so how does something like spiritsinger umbra baron rivendare embrace the shadows zombie chow circle of healing work if rivendare works with this then thats mana damage
hearthstone,not_removed,looks like my kind of card
hearthstone,not_removed,too soon executus
hearthstone,not_removed,in wild would baron make it trigger twice i presume so
hearthstone,not_removed,well we all know where dust is going on day
hearthstone,not_removed,how does this work with moat lurker does it double the minion
hearthstone,not_removed,it says summon so if you use this then dirty rat does the opponents summoned minion deathrattle go off if it has one like bomb squad for instance
hearthstone,not_removed,boom oclock insane value d
hearthstone,not_removed,what are good combos with this vatf that arent going to be in wild it seems pretty good but i cant think of any crazy standard plays you could do with it
hearthstone,not_removed,this is why they banned sylvanas
hearthstone,not_removed,i was looking forward to wild but now this card just broke it and will be autoinclude and nauseating
hearthstone,not_removed,insta jade lightning that shit lmao
hearthstone,not_removed,princess huhuran is a really good card
hearthstone,not_removed,seems pretty darn scary with aya
hearthstone,not_removed,jade rogue here we go
hearthstone,not_removed,what happened to old moody kripp being happy is nice and all but like this he looks like hes seizing
hearthstone,not_removed,wild is fucked
hearthstone,not_removed,if u could pick a deathrattle for yourself what would u pick
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel like blizzard broke wild with this expansion and as a wild player im not very appreciative
hearthstone,not_removed,so is that basically a delayed baron rivendare effect or does the deathrattle get used up and this is the your deathrattles are now battlecries effect
hearthstone,not_removed,baron rivendare and seasinger umbra are about to become good friends
hearthstone,not_removed,well there goes dust
hearthstone,not_removed,well looks like i just found my dayone craft
hearthstone,not_removed,sweet card
hearthstone,not_removed,play it with gelbin for the card draw
hearthstone,not_removed,i already hate this card
hearthstone,not_removed,one of the only must have cards for me so far so much fun to be had
hearthstone,not_removed,jade rogue deathrattle priest and dreadsteedweasel tunneler shenanigans aside this could be good with mistress of mixtures healing can be pretty strong im even thinking in wild spiritsinger umbra embrace the shadows mistress mistress zombie chow zombie chow coh mana cards also to your hero but most games you wont need the full combo zombies and a mistress is already damage and its wild you can also run flash heals and emperor thaurissan to squeeze also a hero power maybe
hearthstone,not_removed,noooooooo dreadsteed is going into wiiiiiiiiiild
hearthstone,not_removed,this is what people thought the priest legendary would be
hearthstone,not_removed,i really dislike how ambiguous the wording on this card is the wording implies if the deathrattle summons another deathrattle minion itd keep triggering them so basically dreasteeds would then keep being summoned untill you time out thats obviously not how this card will work its just that the wording and the rules of the game are constantly ambiguous in the name of making it simple blizzard has achieved the total opposite making it so a new player never knows how the game works unless heavy googleing is involved its time to take inspiration from the wording in other card games personally i think eternal does it right keywords are just like hs but hovering over a card tells you exactly what they do whatever model they choose to use going forward with keywords i think its clear the current one has failed to achieve its purpose and needs changing
hearthstone,not_removed,does moat lurker trigger its battlecry first or its deathrattle first when this is on the board
hearthstone,not_removed,one thing i havent seen mentioned double barnes synergy barnes summoning spiritsinger extra deathrattle spiritsinger on board play barnes your deathrattle gets triggered
hearthstone,not_removed,ball of spiders combo too op please nerf
hearthstone,not_removed,ball of spiders hype
hearthstone,not_removed,this is the type of card ive been waiting for with these reveals so with minions that have both a battlecry a deathrattle it essentially triggers both at once if im not mistaken but does the deathrattle still trigger again once the minion dies if so thats crazy
hearthstone,not_removed,rip the mana spiritsinger umbra sylvanas windrunner combo
hearthstone,not_removed,at health and mana this is kind of a hard card to combo until late in the game brann being one less mana is kind of a big deal i feel battlecries tend to be stronger but im not actually sure about that i think this is a must add for a deathrattle deck but i dont think see this being the new brann or fandral idk could be wrong its hard to put this out on curve and that is why im skeptical bran and fandral had a chance against some classes for that class not to have removal that can clear it on curve
hearthstone,not_removed,two emperor ticks into baron rivendare this double bomb squad
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont like the artwork it doesnt look legendary
hearthstone,not_removed,this is the brann bronzebeard for the year of the mammoth wow
hearthstone,not_removed,in wild turn spiritsinger umbra dreadsteed turn kill umbra play mayor noggenfogger i greet you
hearthstone,not_removed,huh it does say summon not play thats really crazy in that case
hearthstone,not_removed,the wording says yes
hearthstone,not_removed,this card is obnoxious in wild with dr boom and sneeds in ramp druid i love it
hearthstone,not_removed,big if true
hearthstone,not_removed,paging uhsdane
hearthstone,not_removed,dreadsteeds are tgt so theyre rotating out of standard anyway but yes this says summon rather than play so if you dropped this and then a dreadsteed on an empty board youd fill the board with dreadsteeds immediately itll also combo great with pyros assuming anyone actually plays that
hearthstone,not_removed,sylvanas died for silvermoon actually
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah this card is straight up insane in wild sylvanas shredder etc
hearthstone,not_removed,think of it this way umbra has enough reach to be a day craft itll be seen all over for the next two years sylvanas paid for this
hearthstone,not_removed,true story they couldnt allow you to play both shed be in every deck
hearthstone,not_removed,at least we can use her sacrifice aka dust to craft this one
hearthstone,not_removed,oh my god sylvannas with this card would be op oh wait
hearthstone,not_removed,she will die plenty more in my wild priest decks
hearthstone,not_removed,well this card kinda fucks up wild
hearthstone,not_removed,feelsbadman
hearthstone,not_removed,also conceal and this card is a good example of why master of disguise got the big change permanent stealth on something like this would be broken
hearthstone,not_removed,cant you just taste the potential bugs
hearthstone,not_removed,umbra moat lurker on a weasel
hearthstone,not_removed,target a cairne with this and itll spawn baines and respawn the cairne
hearthstone,not_removed,well damn thats a really cool idea
hearthstone,not_removed,you can play him right to the opponents deck now no more waiting for it to die nonsense
hearthstone,not_removed,malorne battlecry shuffle this minion into your deck
hearthstone,not_removed,warrior weapon epic og 🐘 httpwwwhearthheadcomcardstentaclesforarms httphearthstonegamepediacomtentaclesforarms mana deathrattle return this to your hand callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to
hearthstone,not_removed,i love cards that break other cards wild is gonna be super fun unless the not being able to respond becomes an even bigger issue seam like getting the coin would be even worse as wild gets more and more powerful
hearthstone,not_removed,bairnes cairne
hearthstone,not_removed,im glad i didnt get rid of cairne when the meta was faster he might be decent now in some death rattle decks
hearthstone,not_removed,seems only fitting to use sylvanas dust to make this
hearthstone,not_removed,how often can fandral live one turn for you to play nourish next turn this minion has one less health than fandral
hearthstone,not_removed,good catch living mana may actually be playable with this in a deck
hearthstone,not_removed,this mana in stats and basically astral communion without the discard once they die
hearthstone,not_removed,this is druid we are talking about they can play both out as early as turn if they ramp once and double innervate crazy good
hearthstone,not_removed,except it also keeps the deathrattle
hearthstone,not_removed,its brann for deathrattles with a slight delay edit and its way better than baron riverdare because you can guarantee the effect when you play it no need for any setup
hearthstone,not_removed,except itll trigger deathrattles from minions summoned through barnes forbidden shaping etc even better than playing a battlecry
hearthstone,not_removed,yep this is essentially brann for deathrattles way better than baron rivendare and will definitely be used in a few decks
hearthstone,not_removed,jade rogue might even become a dominant deck next expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,amazing disgusting in jade rogue unearthed raptor is leaving thoughso less op combos
hearthstone,not_removed,oh shit maybe this is why yong woo said he was most scared of jade rogue before msog this plus the deathrattle jade guy and aya will be nice not to mention any extras from journey below or shadowcaster
hearthstone,not_removed,jade rogue the others only have aya which i dont think will be enough reason to run this like jade druid has already cut brann and brann affects way more cards than this one plus brann has lower cost
hearthstone,not_removed,this could be pretty degenerate i hope the cost difference vs brann limits its impact im worried though
hearthstone,not_removed,holy cow the kripperinos are fast
hearthstone,not_removed,looks good on paper but in wild you still have pirates knocking on your death door at turn so well see if you can combo it as much as you think you can
hearthstone,not_removed,i believe it would yes not necessarily what youre looking for but funny
hearthstone,not_removed,oh shit everyone on here talking about wild made me completely forget about the priest quest this is probably gonna make it pretty strong
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont know if i manage to get to turn with midrange hunter i might like it with highmane
hearthstone,not_removed,knowing blizzard id say screengrab fo sho
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,thats gonna be so dirty in wild even if you just play it with a haunted creeper got a really strong soft taunt effect that you dont dare leave it alive for a turn
hearthstone,not_removed,hallazeal wasnt too op but yeah kripp gets the good stuff
hearthstone,not_removed,why is it summon and not play though that just gives even more synergy with reincarnate not sure which id prefer
hearthstone,not_removed,even piloted shredder now you can get two doomsayers from it d
hearthstone,not_removed,sneeds shredder or even tiron shield taunt weapon which you will use up before he dies again for a weapon
hearthstone,not_removed,that will work right i mean the deathrattles say if the other also died does the deathrattle check that it actually died itself
hearthstone,not_removed,turn a a random mind control and a with deathrattle do another random mind control and the is still a threat to leave alive
hearthstone,not_removed,any priest deck that plays the priest quest will have this card too
hearthstone,not_removed,i think at the very least it gives every class some board clears maybe with or any aoe deathrattle
hearthstone,not_removed,indeed im playing the shit out of this card with my nzoth hunter in wild
hearthstone,not_removed,knowing weasel tunneler it will probably just instantly go into your opponents deck and not end up on your board
hearthstone,not_removed,bounce weaseltunneler shadowstep rogue now seems a lot more viable
hearthstone,not_removed,on second thought that also deals the same amount to your own face but if youre at and theyre at success
hearthstone,not_removed,two flash heals for plus its not like theyll get all their health back on the next turn you can keep some mind blasts and whatnot in hand so like a weenie aggro priest or some such edit did not realize flash heal was from tgt i am a dumdum my bad
hearthstone,not_removed,in wild you can add zombie chow and flash heal and use emperor if you need to
hearthstone,not_removed,in wild with two ticks from emperor thaurissan umbra nzoth crazy stuff happens
hearthstone,not_removed,add in circle of healing for another damage
hearthstone,not_removed,its much easier to do umbraembracechowchowmistressmistresscircle thats damage for though you also take so it can be damage for or with an emperor tick on a minion another possible combo is umbraembracechowchowcircleflash healflash heal for damage and mana without takind damage yourself
hearthstone,not_removed,its not as op as people seems to think here even if you trigger it and steal enemy minion right away they can now aoe your board or kill your sylvanas for free without triggering second effect
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah this sherazin cards more cards and you get a dormant plant
hearthstone,not_removed,kappa
hearthstone,not_removed,yes
hearthstone,not_removed,yes summon means exacly that enters play of course youll have to stick this to the board first its a mana combo otherwise
hearthstone,not_removed,i would imagine it would but most of the time you nzoth the board is full except some rare instances
hearthstone,not_removed,golden too since every minion summoned from a deathrattle would most likely be also golden too
hearthstone,not_removed,i guess ill have to finally craft nzoth while im at it
hearthstone,not_removed,actually spiritsinger aside wild priest combo potential with majordomo and awaken the makers fulfill the priest quest by playing majordomo as your deathrattle minion and proc your quest if you can survive to your next turn and kill majordomo on your terms you could follow up with amara for a health majordomo hero
hearthstone,not_removed,tasteless can we expect to see some drop play on this map
hearthstone,not_removed,its a tortollan shamanlike figure against a purple nightsky background standing on a grassy precipice with both arms raised facing the viewer its right hand clutches a gnarled staff while its left hands three fingers are open in a spellcasting gesture both hands are suffused with a green aura
hearthstone,not_removed,mana neutral legendary after you summon a minion trigger its deathrattle
hearthstone,not_removed,spiritseeker umbra mana neutral legend whenever you play a minion trigger its deathrattle art is a tortallan priest lookin guy
hearthstone,not_removed,what will the the most broken interaction in standard be highmane cairne kindly grandmother tirion mana combo i dont see it being that broken in standard very similar to brann in that it has a soft taunt wild on the other hand probably an autoinclude in any nzoth deck particularly disgusting when combod with dr boom
hearthstone,not_removed,blizzard nerfing cards that fast you wish buddy
hearthstone,not_removed,would be a fitting way to honour sylvanas memory
hearthstone,not_removed,nah brann is cheaper and lower stats its staying
hearthstone,not_removed,makes you wonder why it even gets shipped below mana seeing that its a neutral its like theyre deliberately creating work for the patch team
hearthstone,not_removed,was brann ever nerfed
hearthstone,not_removed,probably changed to play instead of summon
hearthstone,not_removed,why would it
hearthstone,not_removed,nice call buddy loooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooool
hearthstone,not_removed,thats a hero in a half shell if ever there was one
hearthstone,not_removed,hmm jade rogue is a good point the raptor things are rotating out though so maybe its not actually getting stronger
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah it should granted it might not do any thing if its trying to summon minions but stuff life priests card steal will work well
hearthstone,not_removed,im pretty sure it will because it will because it says after you summon should also work with faceless and mirror entity
hearthstone,not_removed,blizzard can never win this sub complained karazhan and mean streets didnt have a lot of good cards now theres too many
hearthstone,not_removed,so far most cards seems like a lot of fun and there is still cards to go btw sigh
hearthstone,not_removed,youre in bad shape if you crafted unplayable cards in the past better grind for coins
hearthstone,not_removed,only if you play deathrattle decks
hearthstone,not_removed,lol why is this funny
hearthstone,not_removed,all decks gain two weasel tunnelers even arena and brawl
hearthstone,not_removed,thats not necessarily a bad thing if youre limited on dust
hearthstone,not_removed,others streamers did the same
hearthstone,not_removed,well just like brann i dont think you necessarily build around it you put it in a deck with a lot of synergies but that is also good without relying on this effect alone will be a staple mustcraft though
hearthstone,not_removed,and keeps them as deathrattles double deathrattle action havent had that since rivendare
hearthstone,not_removed,i think it should proc because its after you summon a minion so the battlecry should resolve before umbras effect goes off
hearthstone,not_removed,what about a moat lurker that uses its battlecry on a moat lurker
hearthstone,not_removed,neutral minion rare kara 🐘 httpwwwhearthheadcomcardsmoatlurker httphearthstonegamepediacommoatlurker mana battlecry destroy a minion deathrattle resummon it callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to
hearthstone,not_removed,everyone including the person that posted the stats says the card is summons rather than plays
hearthstone,not_removed,whenever you summon a minion
hearthstone,not_removed,you read the card right it says after you summon a minion right there
hearthstone,not_removed,this card definitely says summon
hearthstone,not_removed,no after you summon a minion trigger its deathrattle effect you dont summon a minion when you cast that spell
hearthstone,not_removed,depends on interaction baron could be insane with this if it triggered deathrattles twice as if it was a battlecry
hearthstone,not_removed,probably yes
hearthstone,not_removed,neutral minion legendary naxx httpwwwhearthheadcomcardsbaronrivendare httphearthstonegamepediacombaronrivendare mana your minions trigger their deathrattles twice callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to
hearthstone,not_removed,baron triggers the dr twice upon minions death umbra triggers it immediately upon play
hearthstone,not_removed,shame all of the good dragons are rotating
hearthstone,not_removed,if you brann into book wyrm it doesnt let you pick two targets
hearthstone,not_removed,welcome to why formats exist in magic wild is so broken there are turn one otk decks and decks that never let the opponent do anything until they fatigue its kind of different because of how hard it is to make those decks but i believe this was bound to happen eventually in wild
hearthstone,not_removed,i think its a double effect basically you get the deathrattle as a battlecry then get it as a deathrattle
hearthstone,not_removed,interesting how that interaction might work though since the deathrattle would act like a battlecry which might trigger first initial answer would be what is mentioned first in the text but actual results might differ day one bug testing
hearthstone,not_removed,the kill yourself meta has a new entry
hearthstone,not_removed,best part is you dont even have to play them on the same turn you just need to have set up on board and then trade it off after you drop umbra its a way more consistent way of getting a dreadsteed board for your than or ever were
hearthstone,not_removed,malganis works as well when he hits the field he calls himself a turtle so that umbra doesnt feel like the only turtle around
hearthstone,not_removed,you sir are a genius a mad genius
hearthstone,not_removed,shaman says
hearthstone,not_removed,too bad it costs no doctor instaboom
hearthstone,not_removed,the consistency maybe
hearthstone,not_removed,so the answer is no
hearthstone,not_removed,huge if not lie
hearthstone,not_removed,pyros is worded to say return to your hand on death so i could see the effect basically just returning to your hand right when you drop it
hearthstone,not_removed,comboing sylvanas with silvermoon guardian was too strong
hearthstone,not_removed,sylvanas died because she was too stubborn at hunting arthas while he invaded silvermoon actually she was spouting some noble nonsense seemingly trying to defend silvermoon but actually she was just too prideful got her ass owned and turned into a banshee rip
hearthstone,not_removed,i just crafted shredder for no reason other than i wanted it even with an expansion right around the corner this makes that feel a little better its also won me few games already edit im dumb you meant piloted shredder im talking about sneeds old shredder
hearthstone,not_removed,get an emperor tick on spiritsinger andor dr boom turn gives you a a two and damage randomly twice damn
hearthstone,not_removed,gonna see these two together a lot in wild
hearthstone,not_removed,dont worry they keep wild balance in consideration
hearthstone,not_removed,imagine this with malorne
hearthstone,not_removed,wild is supposed to be fucked up
hearthstone,not_removed,tastes like toast
hearthstone,not_removed,jesus christ what would that do i assume youd need to play the weasel first then moatlurker the weasel which will go into your opponents deck the moatlurkers battlecry will activate giving it the deathrattle and place it in the opponents deck immediately but the weasel is in the opponents deck already so the deathrattle now means your own deck i have no idea even worse would be using this on a multiweasel deathrattle raptor and combo with rivendare both decks suddenly turn into weasels
hearthstone,not_removed,error wrapped my computer in a box upon being played shuffled opponent into deck discarded my hero nothing unusual here
hearthstone,not_removed,play umbra then play weasel and umbra puts one weasel in the opponents deck then moat lurker it which puts another copy in the opponents deck and summons one weasel for you and then umbra puts a third weasel copy in the opponents deck because it triggers on summon not on play get the moat lurker killed you summon a second weasel umbra puts a fourth copy in their deck then get your two weasels killed and put two more weasels in the opponents deck weasels in the opponents deck if they dont clean this up in between
hearthstone,not_removed,that is one of the best interactions ive seen so far
hearthstone,not_removed,also combo this idea with the new rouge quest shadowstep weasel für more profit
hearthstone,not_removed,oh no now druid has a way to go infinite and beat fatigue
hearthstone,not_removed,its the same question as with pyros does pyros get sent to your hand or a duplicate well have to test it to be sure how its coded
hearthstone,not_removed,or whats that tgt legendary skeleton king or whatever joust if you win return to hand
hearthstone,not_removed,hm well played i concede
hearthstone,not_removed,yup this will be another kill on sight minion
hearthstone,not_removed,how many killonsight minions can you reasonably answer if youre constantly having to use hard removal to deal with this fandral auctioneerat best you kill them all and have no removal left for any actual threats they run
hearthstone,not_removed,its rare but its a win if you can put down fandral on an empty board on turn say you trade everything out and the opponent cant deal with it then you play nourish and pretty much win its not very common but the play is worth it that said damage is much easier to muster hero power in many cases than
hearthstone,not_removed,its the same with brann if you know what answers your opponents deck plays and what they likely have in hand then you can drop him and get full value even if its a risk it happens rarely that you can safely drop a health minion but it does happen and in the scenario above if you arent able to kill it youve just lost the game additionally forcing the opponent to use inefficient removal can be considered a win of sorts
hearthstone,not_removed,pretty often actually
hearthstone,not_removed,its good in egg druid play it on turn then mark of the lotus and go face for its worth of stats for tbh wild egg druid looks disgusting being able to easily trigger the eggs and sticky shit to make savage roar threaten lethal at almost all times
hearthstone,not_removed,living mana deathrattle gives an empty manacrystal but still it is rockin
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,wasnt that baron rivendare
hearthstone,not_removed,play spiritsinger umbra play baron rivendare play deathrattle minion how many times does it activate
hearthstone,not_removed,that was a rivendale
hearthstone,not_removed,new wild combo forbidden shaping into majordomo executus with umbra on board into concede
hearthstone,not_removed,reincarnate hype
hearthstone,not_removed,this is the card myself and everyone else wanted baron rivendare to be rivendare was such a pain in the ass to set up i just stopped even including him in my reincarnate shaman ie the one deck where he should be amazing that said its understandable that rivendare worked the way it did given the deathrattles at the time sylvanas belcher shredder etc
hearthstone,not_removed,baron needed to be setup to be viable you either needed baron to stick or a deathrattle minion to stick which in hs just doesnt happen this card is good because it can be a combo but it does underly the weakness of hss design its aggro power combos or spell heavy control
hearthstone,not_removed,lmao
hearthstone,not_removed,because of a card you can only run one of thatll only live for turn i doubt it
hearthstone,not_removed,less turn two not hero power plays hallelujah
hearthstone,not_removed,jade rogue might even become a dominant deck next expansion i play jade rogue in wild greedy
hearthstone,not_removed,perhaps this was why they decided to rotate conceal instead of auctioneer
hearthstone,not_removed,theres reason why rogue got less jade cards
hearthstone,not_removed,swarmer loot hoarder huckster aya mixtures my body is ready d
hearthstone,not_removed,i hope the cost difference vs brann limits its impact im pretty sure the text being terrible for jade is going to limit it a lot more than the cost in the current jade decks aya is the only jade card this synergizes with brann hits aya both spirits both behemoths for druid and both chieftains in shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,they once took a clip of his stream to text so fast that the next words he said after the clip was its already on reddit which made people think he might have uploaded it himself
hearthstone,not_removed,if youre dying that early in wild youre doing something wrong why not just add deathlords zombie chows and all that other juicy early game
hearthstone,not_removed,not necessarily what youre looking for malganis objects
hearthstone,not_removed,to each their own i love the style and am glad to see some variety
hearthstone,not_removed,seems a bit out of tune with other card art
hearthstone,not_removed,were pretty close to reach the singularity where every single minion in a deck is a must remove immediately not there yet but soon and itll be amazing
hearthstone,not_removed,think of its value in wild mill rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,its possible that they thought it would be its a strong card for control shaman but control shaman itself has been quite weak
hearthstone,not_removed,nzoth
hearthstone,not_removed,youll put barnes in any deathrattle deck which this combos nicely with
hearthstone,not_removed,while those are two legitimately powerful combos feugen or stalaag can be played on the same turn as this mind you one needs to have already died for the effect to trigger but thats still a or and an for mana whether or not you get the one that triggers from the actual deathrattle thats an insane tempo play at mana
hearthstone,not_removed,no more than it does in the sense that thats just how deathrattles work so if when this minion dies do x is changed to when this minion is played from your hand do x i dont see why it wouldnt work its basically as if the deathrattle is just changed to a battlecry both of them dying before thaddius appears is purely flavor otherwise its just a typical deathrattle effect its a pretty unique interaction though so i understand the uncertainty like how if you silence the first one and it dies you still get thaddius from the second one as long as it doesnt get silencedmakes sense when you consider the mechanics behind it but its a bit awkward and might throw some new players off you might think silencing one of them would interrupt the effect entirely but thats just not how its programmed
hearthstone,not_removed,i fully endorse this comment
hearthstone,not_removed,this might actually be decent in handbuff paladin though i dont think hand buff pally will be great or even good as a way to get things like that to trigger when you want them to also kinda useful because it doubles all draw effects like the new priest drop undercity huckster loot hoarder etc

hearthstone,not_removed,i agree thats how it should work
hearthstone,not_removed,and then it triggers an opponents snipe dies in their deck and goes back to yours add baron rivendare and the animation will freeze or some shit
hearthstone,not_removed,you wont be able to bounce your weasel because it will just enter your opponents deck as soon as you play it
hearthstone,not_removed,flash heal is tgt though isnt it so not in standard but definitely in wild thatd be with no emperor even
hearthstone,not_removed,flash heal is rotating out
hearthstone,not_removed,does it actually most deathrattles that are played summon other shit on the board and if your board is already filled after nzoth umbra you are not doing much or you can heal opponents face with chows and misstresses
hearthstone,not_removed,assuming you only have minion on board
hearthstone,not_removed,with raza and garnison commander you could have ragnaros hero powers in a single turn and heal to that will be fun
hearthstone,not_removed,why wait for quest when you can raza domo your opponent
hearthstone,not_removed,now if priest had ice block
hearthstone,not_removed,i so hope this deck can work at least a little bit
hearthstone,not_removed,sounds absolutely broken
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont know man i still cant see it you know is it smiling what colour are its eyes i need more please think of the children
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think the others are getting that jjfrenchfry was looking for your description not just its boring statscosteffect doing gods work son
hearthstone,not_removed,summon not play big difference think living mana or dreadsteed
hearthstone,not_removed,living mana
hearthstone,not_removed,its an autoinclude in every deck with gvg and nax
hearthstone,not_removed,moat lurker living mana anubisath sentinel
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think tirion would be that bad for a two card combo if they have an answer for tirion the next turn most of the first ashbringer will be wasted
hearthstone,not_removed,bomb squad to get out your moltens faster
hearthstone,not_removed,moat lurker you have to assume you had a board with anything on it anything at all and moat lurker is your answer it immediately duplicates the minion by auto proccing moat lurkers deathrattle if the minion in question also has a deathrattle its immediately busted value so did your opponent leave you with any minion on board even just a kindly grandmother they didnt want to fight since its just a well if they left grandmother you now have a with soft taunt a and with deathrattle summon a grandmother a with summon a and another you just turned a board with minion on it into a board with minions and deathrattles qued one of those minions must die next turn or itll get even worse i think comboing it with moat lurker is the scariest thing definitely
hearthstone,not_removed,weasel rogue incoming rogue plays weasel then shadowstep rogue plays weasel then shadow steps rogue plays weasel opponent cries
hearthstone,not_removed,pours one out for the horde
hearthstone,not_removed,im sure lots of people dont know sylvanas used to cost mana
hearthstone,not_removed,tbh both are a problem having too few good legendaries usually means the meta wont slow down as much since most legendaries are slow and not aggro fuck patches legendaries are meant to be really powerful cards that define decks and are really fun to play karazhan and msog were aggro fests part of which is to blame because of slow legendaries no one wants to playnot viable too many good legendaries makes it hard for players to keep up it is good because it will probably shake up the meta a lot and give rise to lots of deck variety which makes it great for players who buy packs but players fall even further behind because their variety of playable decks is limited without as powerful legendaries that is super not fun theres a middle ground out there of the right amount of good legendaries which imo blizzard got right in wotog so they can get it right theres no certain way to say this expansion has too many good legendaries until the expansion is released and a stable meta forms
hearthstone,not_removed,because the mildly pleased or satisfied people dont go onto comment threads to share their opinion
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel your pain bro
hearthstone,not_removed,its fitting that the best player hearthstone superstar octavian morosan gets to reveal a highly competitive card
hearthstone,not_removed,thats what he said on stream when he brought the video up the icon in the corner of his youtube videos was covering the health
hearthstone,not_removed,thank mr
hearthstone,not_removed,and fandral has nothing to do with deathrattles and his body is not overcosted hence rivendare is better comparison
hearthstone,not_removed,what i hope is that you will pick a minion with moat lurker lets say your own minion destroy it then it triggers umbra and activates the deathrattle resumoning the minion then the moat lurker is still left on the board who will summon the minion again when it dies
hearthstone,not_removed,i hope so because otherwise this card would be really weird and probably not even good enough to see play also interesting with spiritsinger anubarak d
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah thats what im wondering day is certainly gonna be interesting either way though im loving this card i hope they give us more open ended cards like this in the expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,thats utterly crazy deathrattles go off on summoning so dreadsteeds are multiplying everytime one dies thats crazy
hearthstone,not_removed,ummm dont mind me while i go and get my dust for malganisumbra and dreadsteeds for the ultimate demonlock deck i get stomped by pirates and shamans

hearthstone,not_removed,i expect this combo from dane on day
hearthstone,not_removed,mate if you devolve a board of noggenfogger and dreadsteeds you shoud just uninstall after cause clearly you dont know how to have fun
hearthstone,not_removed,emperor is a card still
hearthstone,not_removed,bomb squad it instead for the keks
hearthstone,not_removed,naw unless they hard code it out this is how its going to work hearthstone isnt that inconsistent
hearthstone,not_removed,small if false
hearthstone,not_removed,na they lost to a deathrattle paladin
hearthstone,not_removed,she cant rip thats the point of her entire lore
hearthstone,not_removed,she was seeking to stop a massive undead horde that had just ravaged the most powerful human nation not a lot she could do and she did all she could as rangergeneral to stop arthas but go figure that it was not enough
hearthstone,not_removed,the heck are you talking about she did the best she could defending silvermoon
hearthstone,not_removed,shes an elf of course she was prideful fantasy writing
hearthstone,not_removed,them lore enhancing drugs
hearthstone,not_removed,while its expensive it only matters if you like it hombre i crafted a golden antonidas cuz i like the card and if you like the old shredder is alllll goood in da hoooood
hearthstone,not_removed,boom isnt the best card to combo it with though its better on cards with a small body and huge deathrattle effect and with low cost deathrattles
hearthstone,not_removed,get two ticks for spiritsinger brann boom
hearthstone,not_removed,hello rogue combo emperor thaurissan tick on spiritsinger umbra sylvanas steal two minions and still have two sylvanas effects on board
hearthstone,not_removed,tastes like peanut butter the toast was disguised
hearthstone,not_removed,spaghetti
hearthstone,not_removed,i think at that point the game just achieves sentience
hearthstone,not_removed,umbra then weasel weasel jumps into your opponents deck weasel then umbra the moat lurker weasel is killed then goes into opponents deck but is then resurrected onto your opponents battlefield i think thats how moat lurker worked with the weasel it tested who owns the minion at time of deathrattle
hearthstone,not_removed,uninstalled my overwatch
hearthstone,not_removed,i laughed way too hard at this
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean its a lot of and thats reliable but thats an mana combo in a world without thaurissan maybe think slightly smaller
hearthstone,not_removed,that is sooooo op can you imagine going infinite fatigue with a single card
hearthstone,not_removed,will you accept some reddit silver
hearthstone,not_removed,if im not mistaken that doesnt quite work that way it states shuffle this card not a copy
hearthstone,not_removed,neither you get the next one in the chain the pyros are all different cards
hearthstone,not_removed,well play
hearthstone,not_removed,the more minions that aggro decks cant just ignore the better at the very least itll buy you a turn
hearthstone,not_removed,if u kill all those threats immediately the druid is going to be very behind they cant ramp draw and ramp jade after u answered everything if u did remove those threats u probably developed ur own thrrwts so druid has to stop developing and start removing so u probably win
hearthstone,not_removed,but the less health matters a lot because often the removals people have available around mana tend to do damage excluding priest who uses pain and shamanmage that have access to hex effects and fireball in the later case so i can see this dying often if played on curve and instead be played together with the card you wanna proc like you do with brann with kazakus netherspite etc so the turn umbra into turn living mana will be a not so common occurrence imo
hearthstone,not_removed,that seems too clunky for eggs eggs is a deck that cant even try to get cute with things costing or more its too narrow a deck to try for things like this
hearthstone,not_removed,not entirely sure why youre being downvoted that always made the most sense
hearthstone,not_removed,neutral minion legendary naxx httpwwwhearthheadcomcardsbaronrivendare httphearthstonegamepediacombaronrivendare mana your minions trigger their deathrattles twice callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to
hearthstone,not_removed,that was the intention of baron but it turns out its hard to combo a deathrattle effect the enemy always killed baron first very rude
hearthstone,not_removed,times im guessing assuming baron is still alive when the deathrattle minion dies
hearthstone,not_removed,into amara warden of hope
hearthstone,not_removed,i suspect the reason conceal got axed was because of adapt minions giving rogue consistent and easy access to windfury
hearthstone,not_removed,xaril too plus all the lovely shadowstep shenanigans
hearthstone,not_removed,its not great for jade druid or jade shaman but its amazing for jade rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,wild isnt some safe haven where aggro doesnt exist youll actually find people playing a more refined version of pirate warrior that runs ships cannon if you dont draw the necessary cards early you die
hearthstone,not_removed,i take it you dont play wild much pirate warrior in wild is brutal a lot of the time theyll coin out ships cannon on turn and then nzoths first mate and southsea deckhand to pull patches on turn for damage
hearthstone,not_removed,wild is actually a faster more aggressive format than standard at the moment despite the likes of chow deathlord belcher and healbot
hearthstone,not_removed,have you actually tried ranking up in wild
hearthstone,not_removed,deathlord umbra sick combo
hearthstone,not_removed,i agree its always nice to change up the art style
hearthstone,not_removed,tune singer i get it
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah it seemed op when released but you never know what becomes the meta once the expansion settles out like fandral for instance
hearthstone,not_removed,i wouldnt say control shaman is weak just overshadowed becuase shaman does everything else so good
hearthstone,not_removed,nzoth is mana if your opponent leaves this up for a turn and you havent even summoned nzoth you were already winning
hearthstone,not_removed,at mana you can summon for mana d
hearthstone,not_removed,well shaman had its day in the light time for priest to take over with disgusting combos and value
hearthstone,not_removed,in wild you can use zombie chow instead which does to them which gets you to damage
hearthstone,not_removed,if you could curve it it would be really strong but the combo wouldnt be worth it at mana
hearthstone,not_removed,do you know if the tokens actually have deathrattle the cards text doesnt mention deathrattle and they usually do i believe it just says when they die you get the mana back
hearthstone,not_removed,good thing those sets arent in standard anymore then
hearthstone,not_removed,sentinel is rotating
hearthstone,not_removed,sentinel might be worth playing with this card living mana would be great to curve into but a really bad combo at mana moat lurker could you use it to duplicate one of your own minions then im curious to see how that will work but its also a combo with the card and you would need something to survive on the boar to copy
hearthstone,not_removed,the solution is have an equal amount of viable decks that cost low amount of dust and decks that need a few legendaries but thats impossible to premeditate
hearthstone,not_removed,thats exactly what would happen pick one of your own deathrattles for extra action
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah also interesting in wild with virtually any deathrattles like seriously even this and then haunted creeper neurbian egg etc in egg druid where it wants all these tokens and usually youve already burnt through most of your resources dealing with the tokens they flood the board with and then slam this guy down with some of those and all of a sudden its an instaconcede the only reason this guy wasnt printed earlier is this plus sylvanus would be a broken turn
hearthstone,not_removed,not just multiplying they just fill your board because you summon a new one which in turn summons a new one and so on
hearthstone,not_removed,mass dispel new meta also in wild i guess
hearthstone,not_removed,just for the record people have played this deck basically without umbra of course
hearthstone,not_removed,a devolve whatever shall i do with this and his six buddies
hearthstone,not_removed,play druid hit brann umbra and the good doctor with emperor along with an innervate so much boom
hearthstone,not_removed,true but that relies on getting out of oneofs in your hand at the same time not impossible but not reliable either
hearthstone,not_removed,it likely requires some hardcode to make sure the game do not go into infinite loops though
hearthstone,not_removed,tiny if not true
hearthstone,not_removed,give death knights pls blizz
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean the ranger died she became a different person after she died maybe not technically but you get what im saying lol
hearthstone,not_removed,what joy is there in this curse
hearthstone,not_removed,you brought me back
hearthstone,not_removed,i was going to reply the same thing it was inevitable unfortunately the way she went down could have gone differently and maybe arthas wouldnt have raised her as a banshee but they we wouldnt have our warchief we do now
hearthstone,not_removed,theres always an option to be prideful and you know not die in vain sort of thing she couldve retreated to the city and defended it there with all her fellow elves she did not

hearthstone,not_removed,my deathrattle shaman deck is looking forward to this stuff spirit echo reincarnate ancestral spirit etc
hearthstone,not_removed,the screen just starts flashing like crazy with weasel noises and then garrosh tells you the only winning move is not to play
hearthstone,not_removed,its basically a turing test
hearthstone,not_removed,i welcome our omnic overlords
hearthstone,not_removed,the technology isnt there yet
hearthstone,not_removed,mana its mana for the full combo so you need cairne in play mana in deathrattle decks i think you can have a strong deathrattle in play at some point
hearthstone,not_removed,next thing you know theyll make it cost like mana
hearthstone,not_removed,unfortunately i think youre right its okay infinite mana are probably too powerful to give to druid anyway
hearthstone,not_removed,a taunt for isnt exactly pushing the envelope
hearthstone,not_removed,when did you develop your threats after having to remove something on turns
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i guess baron was strongest when you had a bunch of deathrattle minions in play and your opponent had a board for you to trade them into then you drop baron and go nuts but your opponent would never let that happen where as with this just play it all out from hand in some crazy combo cool card interested to see what people do with it
hearthstone,not_removed,you have to stick the deathrattle which isnt really any easier generally
hearthstone,not_removed,also a mana is really bad stats
hearthstone,not_removed,baron rivendare died first times but oh the plays times thadiusses steal minons baine bloodhoof twins double random legendary
hearthstone,not_removed,total feign death shows that fake deathrattles are still deathrattles by rivendares standards
hearthstone,not_removed,try playing a questing miracle rogue right now and youll see why conceal has to go creating a big board that grows that the enemy cant interact with is just ridiculous the number of times ive won with miracle rogue because the enemy cant wipe my concealed board is ridiculous similarly having played against it leaves you with a helpless feeling if you dont have something like twisting nether
hearthstone,not_removed,im not sure amazing is the right word it still hits less jade targets than brann did for druid and shaman and costs more mana sure you can say its nice for nonjade things like pillager but then brann had really good synergy with azure drake and the like it probably wont be bad but it makes the deck clunky and still less powerful than preungoro shaman and druid so no i dont think its going to be degenerate jade decks are hardly the decks to be worried about with this card
hearthstone,not_removed,well also get all the anti pirate ungoro cards
hearthstone,not_removed,coining out canon is usually the wrong play better saved for coin then drop
hearthstone,not_removed,playing with hallazeal the card actually seemed incredibly strong as you could quite frequently easily combo it with elemental destruction to clear the board and heal hp easily problem was that shaman was the aggro class that won by swarming
hearthstone,not_removed,stealthinnervatediscountwild
hearthstone,not_removed,i like turtles
hearthstone,not_removed,yogg bless you may nzoth have mercy on your soul laddie
hearthstone,not_removed,they do have death rattle it was shown in the reveal video
hearthstone,not_removed,wild still exists as a format ya know
hearthstone,not_removed,or devolve trust shaman to be able to counter the new meta
hearthstone,not_removed,i always carry one just in case
hearthstone,not_removed,but that took set up this is a one turn play
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah like dane
hearthstone,not_removed,dr boom boom boom boom edit get really wacky with baron rivendare in there as well emperor on everything innervate mana
hearthstone,not_removed,but the full board does that
hearthstone,not_removed,sure she died but can she rest in piece nope
hearthstone,not_removed,well according to warcraft lore becoming a banshee is basically the secondworst thing that can possibly happen to a being in azeroth in a world with a confirmed afterlife being permanently banished and confined within whatever rotting corpses you manage to posses is a pretty terrible fate
hearthstone,not_removed,she also got moved to wild which is pretty much the same as resting in peace
hearthstone,not_removed,hey at least she proved she had the smarts to outwit three of the more powerful members of the nathrezim in tft
hearthstone,not_removed,is sylvanas the horde warchief in wow now
hearthstone,not_removed,if spiritsinger umbra follows the usual play order mechanics then yes httphearthstonegamepediacomadvancedrulebook edit for example bloodsail cultists weapon upgrade effect battlecry happens before ships cannon deals damage after summon so unearthed raptor battlecry should trigger spiritsinger umbra after summon
hearthstone,not_removed,crazy talk it wouldnt ever happen
hearthstone,not_removed,and make it summon minions that grow each time you play it damn
hearthstone,not_removed,druids usually cant go with their removal only for the smaller things they go
hearthstone,not_removed,turn umbra innervate innervate darnasus aspirant
hearthstone,not_removed,its easy in jade rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,not sure what you mean with this card you can just play it followed by a deathrattle and itll trigger twice unless they silence the minion with baron you could only do that if you already had a deathrattle minion which could attack and attack into something that would kill it plus that statline for baron really sucked tldr new card can be combod on an empty board baron rivendare couldnt
hearthstone,not_removed,knowing blizzards coding consistency though cant really expect it until we see it
hearthstone,not_removed,the key word is summon you double your deathrattle and i am sure it will work with raptor
hearthstone,not_removed,thats one list that someone ground to legend the consensus was that person doesnt know what theyre talking about
hearthstone,not_removed,heard this a lot is it true in all matchups
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah and therefore aggro shaman was the meta due to expansions im not saying halla is weak its just that other cards deemed stronger meta wise who knows whats gonna happen for this expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,also it often is just too expensive against aggro since you also need to combo it with a spell not as insane against aggro as you might think because of that
hearthstone,not_removed,but the question was about the most broken interaction in standard
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah but youd still be facing down a board full of threedrops
hearthstone,not_removed,two turn play
hearthstone,not_removed,peace
hearthstone,not_removed,still pretty hot for a rotting corpse that doesnt reflect well on me
hearthstone,not_removed,whats the worst thing
hearthstone,not_removed,whats the worst thing
hearthstone,not_removed,since im getting into the lore lately what is the worst thing that can possibly happen to a being in azeroth
hearthstone,not_removed,i cri evrytime
hearthstone,not_removed,idk ive no desire to play wild at the moment but i could see that changing with some of the stuff thats about to cycle out
hearthstone,not_removed,just shoot him please
hearthstone,not_removed,yes
hearthstone,not_removed,depends on how you interpret the card text nzoth only summons back minions that have deathrattle on them permanently this could act the same way
hearthstone,not_removed,so maybe we will find out in a disguised toast video
hearthstone,not_removed,right were on the same page i meant you had to stick the deathrattle with baron
hearthstone,not_removed,most only time i dont do this is if i have cannons in hand and go first cannon then cannon pirate because cannons have a soft taunt that gets them always murdered comparatively if you go second theres no way to get cannons pirate out by and if youre waiting until to drop minions you risk losing out on the control matchup as every turn youre not beating face is a chance for them to stabilize with belcher or board wipes
hearthstone,not_removed,the dread steeds i mean
hearthstone,not_removed,she dresses or better to say blizzard dressed her as a goth prostitute stripper of course she looks hot in reality she would look more decomposing also the smell
hearthstone,not_removed,were here with you brother no shame on those words lol
hearthstone,not_removed,getting artifact power from your bonus roll
hearthstone,not_removed,getting your soul shattered or consumed i would assume
hearthstone,not_removed,what sylvannas is avoiding going to hell
hearthstone,not_removed,not going to happen with the way the power creeps have been happening dr boom is now just an average card in wild
hearthstone,not_removed,wtf
hearthstone,not_removed,but this card doesnt specifically mention deathrattle minions like nzoth does so it should be checking for deathrattle on every summoned minion
hearthstone,not_removed,so are goth prostitutes a thing asking for a friend
hearthstone,not_removed,man wow must smell terrible
hearthstone,not_removed,like a rotting can of tuna mixed with vomit
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,she also lives in a sewer
hearthstone,not_removed,its well deserved so why not
hearthstone,not_removed,does this mean if you play a dreadsteed itll fill your entire board with dreadsteads
hearthstone,not_removed,sure for the right price the sky is the limit
hearthstone,not_removed,wow must smell terrible the undead part of horde would smell like a moving corpsefield
hearthstone,not_removed,sure but she looked something like this in the trailer
hearthstone,not_removed,it makes no sense undead are barely even part of the horde
hearthstone,not_removed,it does seem like it
hearthstone,not_removed,and every time a dreadsteed dies itll fill your board with dreadsteeds
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe tuesday
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont know if its common knowledge either but i do know that a lot of people started learning about it after the nozdormucurse of rafaam trick started popping up
hearthstone,not_removed,sometimes i click on streams when the streamers dont do it themself just click it damn it
hearthstone,not_removed,super common knowledge
hearthstone,not_removed,i remember fondly the past when computers were faster than me when there where no are you sure you want me to do what you told me to dorequesters when people cared about the size and optimized the software they produced when people didnt release stuff until it was ready and you didnt have to patch it every other week most importantly when nobody of average intelligence were even let in the vicinity of a computer
hearthstone,not_removed,whats stopping them nerfing classic or basic cards in the future that are being overpowered
hearthstone,not_removed,why does everyone act like once the nerfs are through blizzard will just sleep and not notice shaman becoming extremely weak why do people think that blizzard dont realise that shaman could become weak after strong cards rotate when they literally stated this in the balance patch notes the point is no one likes losing to doomhammer rockbiter which is damage to the face on turn the card is problematic and its good to see it nerfed also why the fuck are you acting like its the end of the world shaman has a plethora of cheap removal lightning bolt spirit claws stormcrack lavaburst etc so the loss of rockbiter isnt going to hurt that side of shaman too much
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i kind of agree the shaman classic set is among the weakest ones already the reason the class currently has a chance to shine is mostly due to powerful and synergistic early game that will mostly rotate out in the next rotation then they have to either print more early game cards for shaman or the class will be complete garbage again well see though it will take a while till then and many things could change
hearthstone,not_removed,nerf is reducing his health to
hearthstone,not_removed,small time buccaneer the pirate that gets attack with a weapon equipped is being changed from a to a im not sure where a link is atm though
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks guys still weird that there is no preannoucement for the nerfs on the official site
hearthstone,not_removed,i understand downvoting a post when its a question that has been answered but why the hell downvote someone in a comment for saying thanks not that internet points matter just annoyed me a little
hearthstone,not_removed,roses are red violets are blue secret agent coming through
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks it went away midgame just never seen it before
hearthstone,not_removed,credits go to the streamer who can be found at wwwtwitchtvasmodaitv and the op brought to you by your friendly neighborhood bot happy new year
hearthstone,not_removed,while he has board clears and reno in hand okay
hearthstone,not_removed,could be random otherwise i would wait until a could choose the best meta quest
hearthstone,not_removed,there wont be single player campaigns this expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,control meta incoming
hearthstone,not_removed,wait we dont get all the quests
hearthstone,not_removed,why would we each class has their own quest card apparently there is only one cthun he was only given to us cos other cthun cards are literally useless without him
hearthstone,not_removed,blizz pls give free stuff
hearthstone,not_removed,for you and everyone else who doesnt believe me the second expansion of will be our first step into
hearthstone,not_removed,no there wont there will only be single player missions for the second two expansions this year
hearthstone,not_removed,execute in your hand and you would have been fine
hearthstone,not_removed,everytime i play barnes its a frigging wild pyro or onyx bishop
hearthstone,not_removed,wait is priest op
hearthstone,not_removed,not when the priest plays ressurect the next turn
hearthstone,not_removed,its almost as playing a yogg and having the first spell hex it despite having other targets monkas
hearthstone,not_removed,youtube mirror
hearthstone,not_removed,its the end of the month people are trying to get legend pick a deck that is favoured and farm them
hearthstone,not_removed,its all because people at are trying to make their last push at maybe hitting legend from there doubtful many will but theyre probably gonna try
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah it happens
hearthstone,not_removed,actually in noob ranks im rank i didnt queued into a pirate warrior in a pretty long time for me its mostly reno magepriest or jade shaman with chieftains and another midrange stuff
hearthstone,not_removed,swallow your pride and farm those face warriors with shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,id love that even as a renolock my winrate is slightly above versus pirate warrior short games you know if youll win pretty fast and if you lose its over by turn aok
hearthstone,not_removed,its funny because pirate shaman is better
hearthstone,not_removed,you just know theres gonna be a quest to complete a quest
hearthstone,not_removed,tldr wait new patch just hit including all the new expansion the meta will be absolutely crazy and everything will take a while to settle ragnaros is a solid card and prior to today was almost autoinclude in any deck but you may just find something else thats worth crafting in the new expansion ask again in about a month or so
hearthstone,not_removed,i guess it would depend on what cards youre disenchanting rag is one of the best legendaries to have but i wouldnt give up other playable cards for him
hearthstone,not_removed,depends what cards youd be dustingand what other legendaries you still dont have for instance id craft sylvanas or nzoth before ragnaros
hearthstone,not_removed,craft aya blackpaw
hearthstone,not_removed,so this is kind of a bad time to start targeting specific decks were about a month away from three sets brm tgt loe leaving the standard format my recommendation is to just stay away from those sets some people may try to get you to buy a wing to preserve your ability to buy them later but i would advise against that i think that at this point a fairly new player should only buy loe or brm if they feel they wish to be a serious tavern brawl or wild player someone serious enough to spend on content that will be unusable in standard play in a month if youre not able to spend on that content youre basically giving up packs or weeks of progress for about of that same content with the requirement that you do it again four times to complete if its not worth the money its not worth the goldpacks imo since a budget player should stick to standard anyway the problem is that those sets loe in particular has some cards critical to building two of the top decks reno jackson decks and tunnel trogg so what i would do if i were you is just mess around for the month build the best decks you can play some arena pick up some gadgetzan packs and then try to get competitive in april when ungoro comes out ungoro will be a great time to get into the game as opposed to right now since the card pool will be as small as it ever will be again
hearthstone,not_removed,you get a patch you get a patch were all getting patches
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i passed on loe going to make sure i complete brm now though or i still have it i guess after it gets out of rotation but anyway i already have it hmm loeeh guess ill just have to make due not going to buy it didnt really like it i do understand that limits me though not with a new expac coming out thanks again its funny i just sort of gave the same advice to someone else like brm loe and granc championship are all out of rotation in april id consider waiting for the expac but im sure someone else might fill you in better lol thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,yes
hearthstone,not_removed,just run stonetusk boar beast synergy is better than pirate synergy anyway
hearthstone,not_removed,no
hearthstone,not_removed,its gets a lot easier towards the end of the season to climb the ladder i am an arena player most of the time i just get up to rank five at the end of each season to get the good chest reward most really good and ranked grinding players are legend by the end of the season i usually just pick something aggresive just cuz the games are so much quicker
hearthstone,not_removed,ah thats true i didnt even remember that its the end of the month ah well
hearthstone,not_removed,dudes on his a game right now so great to watch his stream right now he has the meta down for sure
hearthstone,not_removed,i think thats his or win just this week absolutely insane
hearthstone,not_removed,was it the mage deck
hearthstone,not_removed,it seems the og meta fits well with kripps playstyle more greedy you can draft decks with minions under mana and still be able to win games consistently plus he plays for a very long time and got a deep understanding of the game mechanics also watching him win is a better experience as he has no reason to moan about the opponent actually drawing cards which he always calls topdecks even if the card is in the opponents hand for a while so its good for everyone for kripp and the viewer
hearthstone,not_removed,personally djinni it starts at hp if you can only steal a and you get double draw from power word shield
hearthstone,not_removed,djinni is better for the memes
hearthstone,not_removed,um what faceless doesnt work at all considering youre not likely to have a charge minion in play
hearthstone,not_removed,you can make any minion a charge minion with potion of madness and then faceless that after buffing it djinni also has the same functional effect since djinni will copy the potion of madness effect and gain charge
hearthstone,not_removed,ah right in the case i would think djinni is better because it has health to start whereas most minions youd steal would have less you also lose the flexibility of playing djinni without a combo and running two faceless manipulators wouldnt be the best
hearthstone,not_removed,i tried it but sadly the deck is really weak in standard there is no healing except farseer and apothecary the problem with nat on is that you dont actually want the opponent to draw cards that soon it achieves nothing else than giving them more options of course he can contest the board really well but even if he goes for if you draw the opponent cards you actually went for at least until you can play coldlight gang upshadowstep and make them overdraw
hearthstone,not_removed,mill is useless in standard because healbot and deathlord are gone even if you would use it i think it would only be useful as a minion to play after you fill up the opponents hand
hearthstone,not_removed,nat is bad in mill rogue the goal of mill rogue is to play a bunch of coldlights in a row to make your opponent discard just slowly giving your opponent cards are just gonna make you die faster which is what the deck is weak to already
hearthstone,not_removed,its usually just worse than dancing swords
hearthstone,not_removed,i think thats just about the only reasonable use for corrupted nat unfortunately i dont really play mill but i suspect that there are reasons why he even sucks in that archetype i think that even mill decks are hesitant to let opponents draw early in the game so dropping nat on turn might not be a great idea
hearthstone,not_removed,well except dancing swords can only be used in wild nat the darkfisher can be used in standard important distinction
hearthstone,not_removed,fair point but mill rogue is probably bad in standard anyway i cant imagine playing it without healbot
hearthstone,not_removed,what the fuck did i just read
hearthstone,not_removed,i was waiting for this disgusting well done op
hearthstone,not_removed,please stop
hearthstone,not_removed,heroes tab in the collection top right button
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah ik but it wont let me equip im new to the game do i have to do a quest to unlock it
hearthstone,not_removed,you have to actually redeem the code in battlenet first
hearthstone,not_removed,i did redeem it on battle net but i cant favorite her in my heroes tab
hearthstone,not_removed,then you didnt redeem the code
hearthstone,not_removed,it shows her in my heroes tab and she has color like i would have like i have my other heroes but i cant equip her and when i started the game when i redeemed her it told me i got her i also got the card back that comes with it
hearthstone,not_removed,thats some high level laziness right there
hearthstone,not_removed,lol can you give me some cash to purchase all the adventures too i promise ill make time to play them
hearthstone,not_removed,theyre quicker than regular games if you just want the cards
hearthstone,not_removed,just do them that isnt something a support ticket is for and youll have fun
hearthstone,not_removed,theyre not too difficult especially the later ones try just rolling it with aggro shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,if its too time consuming for you to unlock the cards it should also be too time consuming to play with the cards after you have them right
hearthstone,not_removed,it is from voting for the bahammas tournament last weekend i got only one because pavel didnt get to move past qualifiers stage
hearthstone,not_removed,asia server nas daily reset is still less than hours away
hearthstone,not_removed,ah right that explains it thanks i also voted for pavel
hearthstone,not_removed,yaa me too
hearthstone,not_removed,this was on eu but it seems the pack is for one of these vote things
hearthstone,not_removed,that article is from february no its referring to the prestandard nerfs
hearthstone,not_removed,going to keep my stuff undusted for sure i wasnt playing this last round of nerfs and missed out on dusting my moltens force of natures and ancient of lore still salty
hearthstone,not_removed,its an old article yes
hearthstone,not_removed,on the iphone no shouldve got a phone with sd slot
hearthstone,not_removed,an option you could go for is to upgrade your icloud storage to and store all your pictures and videos on there so then you can easily access them without the media taking up a ton of space on your phone i believe its only cents a month still as thats what im currently paying
hearthstone,not_removed,i cant even update the app on my phone for some reason
hearthstone,not_removed,ok so comments about buying sd cards and extra icloud storage etc aside i recommend that if possible you always update the app in itunes not on the actual device when you download straight to phone the game has to download the files in an expanded format which then gets streamlined when the update is applied meaning it takes more space sometimes significantly more to update than the actual finished install size if you download then sync from itunes you wont have this download size problem
hearthstone,not_removed,it is the i got it long before i was playing hearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,i personally wouldnt recommend moving files from hearthstone onto sd unless you have a really goodfast sd card as the performance drop is noticeable
hearthstone,not_removed,i got a phone with an sd slot it doesnt help the phone refuses to see it as proper internal storage and moving an app to sd just spreads it around ever so slightly while still making the sd card mandatory to insert and the app slow to use
hearthstone,not_removed,instead of a year of icloud storage you couldve afforded a micro sd and have the storage on your actual phone no data necessary had you not bought such a purposely limited device
hearthstone,not_removed,you dont need to install or move hearthstone onto sd just use the sd for what the op says he has to do without music photos videos and other apps that function perfectly fine on sd
hearthstone,not_removed,root so you can install directly to the sd dont move it to the sd and there shouldnt be a problem or if you dont want to do that simply use the sd to store everything else and use onboard storage for apps that perform poorly on sd
hearthstone,not_removed,which is why i recommended getting a phone with an sd slot and not an overpriced android iphone aka pixel yes people still like sd slots on phones as evidenced by all the people complaining about the paltry storage on their phones s
hearthstone,not_removed,rooting might be the best solution for now in that case might let me uninstall some preinstalled apps too that i dont care about
hearthstone,not_removed,thats my favorite part of rooting samsung phones p
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for the update on things you learned today
hearthstone,not_removed,i thought jaraxxus is a spell
hearthstone,not_removed,what do you mean by score and you had a board full of minions and you couldnt deal with ragnarospush for lethal seems made up
hearthstone,not_removed,i think he only had a couple minions and once sylvanas was played he filled the rest of his board that sounds like the right play
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont remember exactly how much hp we each had and my minions were all cheap mage minions like mirror images sorcerers apprentice etc
hearthstone,not_removed,probably not hunter doesnt really synergize eithbthe pirate package because of the lack of weapons and they already have beast synergy
hearthstone,not_removed,depends what type of face hunter undertaker hunter would focus more on early deathrattle minions the weaponbased face hunter with the unnerfed abusive sergeant leper gnome knife juggler and ironbeak owl would probably be the best bet of where pirates would fit in
hearthstone,not_removed,hunters weapons are pretty ehhh their only good one is glaives bow is ok but you need secrets to really get value out of it you can play pirate hunter in wild and it kinda sucks
hearthstone,not_removed,yes and if hunter gets a or mana weapon any time this year it will exist again
hearthstone,not_removed,charge is a more valuable keyword for high attack minions used to cost mana and was nerfed to because it was deemed to be too powerful in aggro and combo decks edit dont know why i bothered explaining this really youre not a new player
hearthstone,not_removed,you seriously cant tell
hearthstone,not_removed,because five attack charge is leagues better than two attack look to pre nerf leeroy or arcane golem for examples of high attack charge minions being brokadope
hearthstone,not_removed,seriously wtf
hearthstone,not_removed,cant tell if this is supposed to be some sort of joke relating to prenerf leeroy jenkins or if op is actually just making the worst argument ive ever seen in my entire life

hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,answer it depends on the spells
hearthstone,not_removed,this is a task that would take hours upon hours of work do it yourself instead of asking others
hearthstone,not_removed,someone did it already
hearthstone,not_removed,oh good hours of wasting time on reddit work saved
hearthstone,not_removed,ive heard that if you take the tears of the neverlucky and pour them over yourself chanting kappa kappa kappa to a mirror in a dark bathroom youll hear ben brode laugh in the background a tyrande code will appear on the mirror written in blood
hearthstone,not_removed,yes
hearthstone,not_removed,yep
hearthstone,not_removed,i have tried numerous time getting her as priest is my main i have had no luck if someone would be so kind to pm me a code i will pm you a code for a free classic pack
hearthstone,not_removed,did you not hear that when they announced it lol
hearthstone,not_removed,tried it didnt work
hearthstone,not_removed,why is this getting downvoted i died reading this haha
hearthstone,not_removed,i did so where is it
hearthstone,not_removed,whatever you want pick a deck you want to play and craft the cards you need for the deck freeze mage is awful right now
hearthstone,not_removed,a ice blocks pyroblast is dust b since you think that freeze mage runs malygod i would recommend you stay away from it until you learn more about the game
hearthstone,not_removed,it does in reno freeze
hearthstone,not_removed,why are you running ice blocks in a reno deck if you dont have ice blocks or a pyro or a yogg or a nzoth you probably dont have the cards for a reno freeze
hearthstone,not_removed,no what list are you playing
hearthstone,not_removed,reno freeze runs of about cards in its deck because it packs so much stall and draw it also doesnt run nzoth or yogg why would you when you want to sit at hp and play deathrattle minions total here is what is probably the most optimized list
hearthstone,not_removed,there are lists that run it though its just not usual
hearthstone,not_removed,i mentioned nzoth and yogg because someone whos missing those two powerhouses probably doesnt have a fairly complete collection ill be honest ive never seen that list and i dont think itd do amazingly might be wrong but it seems like it wouldnt get the reno off all that often
hearthstone,not_removed,the versions that run maly dont run pyro because youre never getting that combo off
hearthstone,not_removed,laughing is top legend with it its probably the most optimized version of freeze mage out there right now as freeze mage you draw through cards in your deck anyways the chances that you dont draw at least copy of your duplicates are very small and the win condition of the deck isnt reno so it doesnt matter if you dont get reno off every game
hearthstone,not_removed,im not saying it runs both just that there are lists that does run maly
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe the legend ladder is slow enough to let this work thats true for normal ladder play it seems terrible is more what i meant
hearthstone,not_removed,i could craft ice blocks and a pyroblast i have alexstrasza and malygos dont take my comments out of context
hearthstone,not_removed,have you ever made legend its pretty much the same as normal ladder except for the low legend ranks where people mess around with fun decks because they cant drop out of legend
hearthstone,not_removed,rip everyones last minute legend push edit also double rip to all the wow players
hearthstone,not_removed,so is this connect twice feature that has been going on for weeks now their attempt to prevent ddos attacks
hearthstone,not_removed,httpiimgurcomtbvteqgpng how to be a huge dick
hearthstone,not_removed,suspiciously the ddos happened after the opening day of legion launch when blizzard had their smoothest expansion launch yet despite weeks and days before the launch where the service providers were being ddosd constantly i wonder if these script kiddies were too busy enjoying legion to remember they hate blizzard for banning them and then remembered so they resumed their shenanigans
hearthstone,not_removed,it never ceases to amaze that people find it fun to destroy the fun of tens if not hundreds of thousands of othersnot to mention cost a company millions because of these outages how fucked in the head must they be
hearthstone,not_removed,yup fuck my rank
hearthstone,not_removed,rip wow legion players
hearthstone,not_removed,get sombrad scrubs
hearthstone,not_removed,does anyone else think its odd that its always the isps being ddosed and never blizzard themselves are they just so unwilling to admit yes we got ddosed it happens were sorry
hearthstone,not_removed,i lost an arena game to this
hearthstone,not_removed,ive lost like stars the last days to dcs and won like this shit is happening really often
hearthstone,not_removed,i just lost my to buy karazhan then the game loading nonstopi relogin back and found the new wing is still locked and my gold is gone fuck these ddoser
hearthstone,not_removed,legion is actually the smoothest launch of all time nearly no lag whatsoever except downtime yesterday and im playing on the biggest server
hearthstone,not_removed,i am so happy my legend push was a week ago right before all the ddos started
hearthstone,not_removed,its twitter if you dont have something retarded as the top reply then youre doing something wrong
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah say it on reddit and its fact say it on twitter and youre a huge dick
hearthstone,not_removed,is that why you drew a huge black dick over his name image o
hearthstone,not_removed,its sort of amazing this corporation hate two days ago the final expansion for fallout released there was a problem on the playstation store and the dlc was delayed by about hours on there was a class of people who absolutely lost their shit on the subreddit and on twitter over this calling both bethesda and sony the worst companies ever
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah indie company cant afford proxelic
hearthstone,not_removed,they are pretty hated though lots of people didnt like the hardtransition into only hypercasual games
hearthstone,not_removed,my theory is that the basementdwelling neckbeards didnt expect the legion launch to be stable enough to be playable so didnt set up the ddos before hand wut its live and stable fuuuuuu wheres moms credit card
hearthstone,not_removed,cost a company millions probably quite satisfying if you hate the company
hearthstone,not_removed,sometimes they demand a ransom to stop cyber crime is either for money fanaticism or just some kid being a dick
hearthstone,not_removed,contact support
hearthstone,not_removed,so like in every network
hearthstone,not_removed,so youre saying if i said that blizzard is a terrible company because they are getting ddosed i would be upvoted definitely
hearthstone,not_removed,how the hell are overwatch and wow hypercasual games
hearthstone,not_removed,there must be something very wrong in a persons head if they hate a company that makes games so much that they get satisfaction from being purely destructive not only to them but to a lot of other people as well with absolutely no personal gain from it whatsoever
hearthstone,not_removed,then by this logic the top comment in this thread is retarded as well right
hearthstone,not_removed,can probably not be profitably described as hypercasual but overwatch and wow are definitely for hypercazes
hearthstone,not_removed,is an outlier overwatch and wow are pretty damn casual overwatch might actually be the most casual major fps ever made and they make it more casual every patch
hearthstone,not_removed,there must be something very wrong in a persons head its called being bad aka casual trash bad players cheat they get caught and banned then they ddos
hearthstone,not_removed,people who ddos dont really need to have a reason i once worked for a company that got ddosd all the time they would get threats in writing that said things like we will ddos you unless you stop supporting illegal whaling in asia the company didnt even exist in asia
hearthstone,not_removed,yep can confirm
hearthstone,not_removed,wait does this trickle down to the top comments of the top comments or am i safe
hearthstone,not_removed,downvoted just to be sure ohwait
hearthstone,not_removed,have only bought the starter pack and i can confirm it is just fine to heathstone casually
hearthstone,not_removed,yes but youre going to have to be content with playing casually or play quite a bit also if you have the for the welcome bundle at least get that its good value and a nice boost
hearthstone,not_removed,havent spent a penny on this im rank im having tons of fun id say yes of course its tough to compete with the people who can instantly buy the best deck in the meta but its doable and i enjoy the challenge
hearthstone,not_removed,i have been doing a video series on playing for free and have gotten to rank top of players using only free cards so i would say yes
hearthstone,not_removed,definitely but you need to be patient because it takes a long time i was only able to make multiple meta decks after more than half year of playing daily but still unable to make these really expensive control decks
hearthstone,not_removed,if you only play arena and get to rank every month then i estimate it would take about months to play any deck that you want theres a lot of variance because some decks would take months to craft and some decks could take more than a year in my own experience im a free to play player for about years and my collection is substantially better than someone who spends hundreds of dollars on packs
hearthstone,not_removed,yes and no you wont be competing with pros with a small collection but if your arent convinced you should win the nex blizz con and just play for fun you will be fine
hearthstone,not_removed,if you are good at arena then yes if not it will take much longer best to read up and watch arena streams
hearthstone,not_removed,nope
hearthstone,not_removed,no you wont get far you see ladder is parted into halfs those under and above rank and getting to rank without spending any money is almost impossible you can dust everything but one deck but then you wont be able to play for fred in the next meta
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont mind playing casually as i am primarily a dota player
hearthstone,not_removed,wow thats awesome ill have to check this out when i get home
hearthstone,not_removed,what is dusting
hearthstone,not_removed,you can buy adventures with gold
hearthstone,not_removed,thats not true i play for month havent spend a penny and hit rank wild but yes im more then familiar with other ccgs
hearthstone,not_removed,you can turn your cards into arcane dust which can be used to buy individual cards its pretty inefficient it takes five rares worth of dust to craft another rare but its good for getting individual cards
hearthstone,not_removed,wow isnt all thats warcraft we will not be seeing other stuff
hearthstone,not_removed,where are people getting this gadgetzan is as wow as it gets all of the heroes are straight out of wow pretty much all of the card art is wow related and jade is pandaren related i wouldnt mind blizz tapping in to their other games but i dont see where this moving away from wow is coming from
hearthstone,not_removed,id play a diablo deck
hearthstone,not_removed,theres the diablo tavern brawl coming up so theyll be the first intro of another universe into hearthstone hopefully well get more as you were saying
hearthstone,not_removed,no i hope not theres plenty in warcraft and crossover stuff is dumb
hearthstone,not_removed,from the new tavern brawl cardback i guess
hearthstone,not_removed,as far as i have heard they are removing have removed the heroes of warcraft subtitle from the hearthstone name but im not totally sure
hearthstone,not_removed,moo
hearthstone,not_removed,oh kinda makes sense then
hearthstone,not_removed,the cow level mana spell replace your hand and deck with random bovines
hearthstone,not_removed,first rule of yogg dont yogg with lethal or board control and if you have good answers to anything in hand expect an astral communion
hearthstone,not_removed,a lot of the issue is that their tempo is too much for hunter to handle you beat otk warrior as they basically try to stall out until they have their combo and you just put on too much pressure for them to handle but dragon warrior shuts down your pressure pretty well and pressures you too hard so when you get to your power cards youre too low on hp and they can just finish you off with burst other things to remember is otk warrior needs to keep their premium removal for your stronger stuff like a houndmasterd highmane ect whereas dragon warrior can use it more aggressively to clear your weaker minions as they know doing so will get you killed before you get chance to pull off that combo or just have enough board presence or burst by then that they can just finish you off through it as for good techs against it taunts would be good maybe throw in of the that put a on the board as dragon warrior doesnt usually run anything but sit finley or that pirate which if you pull that out is a good thing stops them getting a good hero power or a free weapon but if theyve already used them they get nothing you may want to put in that toad that does damage on a deathrattle im not sure but i think its better than the overall cause of the beast tag and is a big thing currently them trading favourably into that can also backfire which somewhat makes up for you getting good luck with the ive seen freeze trap ran pretty successfully too sure a lot of their minions have charge but the extra mana cost does make them a lot worse and its mostly a delaying tactic so you can get to your powerful midgame or combined with houndmaster to keep your taunts safer the new with deathrattle will also help with this when the next adventure hits in weeks as for what youd take out for them options id take out the jugglers for the toads but im not sure what to take out for trap or the camel thing maybe abusives maybe the infested wolf its hard to say edit oh and maybe quick shot arcane shot more mana but will actually kill a good few of the warriors minions that arcane shot doesnt on its own champion finley ravaging ghoul korkron elite also it can kill twilight guardian perfectly combined with the bow stampeding kodo may also fit in to counter their ichor slimes but i dunno if thats worth it great houndmaster body though
hearthstone,not_removed,thats not a midrange list its a hybrid list the squires abusives and horseriders are the distinctive feature of hybrid the stats show hybrid as vs dragon warrior the extra early game stuff is too easily swept away by a ravaging ghoul would be my guess is the problem plus a turn argent squire is just begging to be answered by blood to ichor its not a huge difference though a proper midrange deck with some is only favored in terms of playing the matchup its very tempo based whoever curves better is probably going to win the key decision youre going to be looking at is when to switch from making trades to going face one more thing with hybrid vs dragon warrior having only deadly shot is probably hurting you that thing is clutch vs the various finishers dragon warrior runs crushers rag grom and its also an efficient way to clear the taunt dragon to keep pushing face damage
hearthstone,not_removed,youre too fast your goal is survival and value you have too many low drops in your list dragon hunter doesnt run brawl so if you get board you keep it stay alive deal with their threats win its still only around at best but you definitely arent running a list to beat them consistently
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for the advice and info ill test out the desert camel and huge toad i might take out infested wolf and sergeants ill just fiddle around with it and see which cards do better against my bad matchups
hearthstone,not_removed,i said midrangey hybrid doesnt run highmane or deadly shot and has hunters mark and tracking ill probably throw in another deadly shot and fiddle around with what ublackelements suggested thanks for the advice
hearthstone,not_removed,the only issue with camel may be that it will make your matchup vs shaman and zoo a bit weaker so be careful with that not sure if you like netdecking at all but i assume is a pretty decent tempo midrange hunter deck like you was aiming for if you need any more ideas i know the huge toad and quick shots though is one thing that glared out to me as a weakness from playing against hunters these last few days rushing to rank i used dragon warrior cause fuck shamans and druids and i only had days to get from rank to rank that quick shot swap in for the arcane shots will do you wonders it costs an extra mana crystal but it can actually kill a lot of the painful minions from dragon warrior and really slow them down until you get in control forgot it originally but i did add that and mention kodo in the edit after looking at the deck i linked to check anything i missed
hearthstone,not_removed,wins early game late game in arena
hearthstone,not_removed,wins you got so little earlygame that your op lategame drops wont matter
hearthstone,not_removed,wins if you pilot it correctly
hearthstone,not_removed,that draft really shafted you on early game you can probably pull off a few wins when you can draw your zombie chows and fiery win axe in your starting hand but if you dont youre so screwed i just finished an win mage arena with only a kvaldir raider and mountain giant for late game and no flamestrike early game is key
hearthstone,not_removed,the deck is good but youre going to struggle with no card in hand starting turn ill say this deck will get maybe if youre not lucky enough
hearthstone,not_removed,excavated evil is a very bad card if you arent playing a mirror match in my opinion
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i think dragonfire is far better in most cases that arent against aggro plus excavated evil is horrible for fatigue matches because it is essentially a dead card
hearthstone,not_removed,its been saving me in aggro matchups where waiting for turn would kill me and from there i go on to develop my own board finally i want to try replacing them with dragonfire and seeing what changes but im happy with aoe for now
hearthstone,not_removed,i love trumps reactions lol he reminds me of a yugioh villain who just got exodiad or something
hearthstone,not_removed,man it just kept getting worse lmfao
hearthstone,not_removed,haha love trumps reactions such a great dude
hearthstone,not_removed,holy shit
hearthstone,not_removed,ooooo humanity
hearthstone,not_removed,despair
hearthstone,not_removed,credit to httpswwwtwitchtvtrumpsc for the content and umrrgrs for sharing it
hearthstone,not_removed,poor trump he looked so happy and then just like in world of warcraft frost shock ruins fucking everything
hearthstone,not_removed,amazing display of skills xd
hearthstone,not_removed,rekt
hearthstone,not_removed,did trump manage to get runs this month
hearthstone,not_removed,out skilled
hearthstone,not_removed,you can do this in the same turn as well without leaving the moat lurker vulnerable its pretty good on bomb squad too although in my experience gives you a big time racketeer
hearthstone,not_removed,combos arent multi card plays that win the game or that do flashy stuff combos is or more cards that work in tandem for a objective the weapon buff is one the master of evolution in the moat lurker is another just simple things
hearthstone,not_removed,quick someone do a redub where they replace actual yugioh villain lines with trumps reactions
hearthstone,not_removed,pure unadulterated skill
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont know for sure but i doubt it
hearthstone,not_removed,the midnight between nov and dec
hearthstone,not_removed,tonight midnight
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks all
hearthstone,not_removed,pacific time
hearthstone,not_removed,piggybacking when can i open chests once i see on reddit that the expansion is release
hearthstone,not_removed,fw druids are running pirates
hearthstone,not_removed,no theyve already said that the quests cant be discovered and it is almost certain that the same will be the case with the rewards there are heaps of cards that cant be discovered eg voltron they would be in the same category as those cards
hearthstone,not_removed,will kabal courier be able to get the legendaries that come from the quests for the kabal classes you cannot discover or otherwise randomly generate uncollectable cards for example will never create an because of this and a golden monkey will never directly give you another
hearthstone,not_removed,of course not

hearthstone,not_removed,oh wow this is pretty cool now i wonder how i missed it before
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for letting us know
hearthstone,not_removed,also water is wet
hearthstone,not_removed,til water is wet
hearthstone,not_removed,for mage cast a spell on their minion eliminates spellbinder but not counterspell when it should eliminate both
hearthstone,not_removed,at spellbinder u can cast even on your minions to trigger so i would change text to cast a spell on a minion
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for the feedback the way its set up now is that when a single action activates multiple triggers the user is expected to mark them both as triggered and then it is i think working properly for instance against a hunter you could attack face with a minion if it lands that eliminates four secrets including the two most popular ones but you would need to mark both actions as completed attack with a minion and attack their hero with your mage example obviously casting a spell on a minion would always require that you cast a spell so it would be possible to to update the logic so that in those few cases where one trigger requires triggering another trigger both are automatically moved to the triggered column do you think that would be useful and less confusing
hearthstone,not_removed,tomorrow
hearthstone,not_removed,tomorrow but we wont know any more cards until the of march so i would wait until then at the very earliest
hearthstone,not_removed,fire up some dragon priest or some shaman pirate either hard control or mega aggressive play usually can blow them up thats my experience anyway
hearthstone,not_removed,sounds like you might be playing a bit too greedy both of those decks are pretty weak and get destroyed if pressure them down
hearthstone,not_removed,most used decks are aggro shaman pirate warrior reno warlock and miracle rogue miracle rogue exists since early hs began so probably you know it with some little variations and pirate warrior is probably the most cheap to craft deck of that list is an aggro deck similar to old face hunter but with weapons face is the place
hearthstone,not_removed,yes it helps
hearthstone,not_removed,if you are on apple device then delete from device download in itunes and sync using cable
hearthstone,not_removed,very much so on android it was on my phone this morning and required an additional to install the update i removed it completely and reinstalled and its or something now
hearthstone,not_removed,i enjoy the rogue a lot its a pretty good tempomidrange with a solid win condition httpiimgurcomvhjhwzipng
hearthstone,not_removed,theres a fotm miraclenzoth rogue deck going around atm thats pretty strong i think sjow made it so jsut google sjow nzoth rogue the optimal build contains thalnos edwin nzoth and preps
hearthstone,not_removed,wild nzoth priest seems pretty good there is a guide for it on rcompetitivehs
hearthstone,not_removed,i like priest in a controlnzoth hybrid heres the list im tinkering with circle of healing flash heal museum curator shadow word pain shadow word death archenai soulpriest shifting shade excavated evil darkshire alchemist cabal shadow priest entomb doomsayer wild pyromancer corrupted healbot cairne bloodhoof sylvanas windrunner nzoth the corruptor the most questionable cards is the corrupted healbots which i cant understand other nzoth priest lists not playing the body is quite sizeable and giving them life is negligible compared to getting control of the board
hearthstone,not_removed,while i cannot recommend any deck in particular i would think carefully about which packs you decide to buy the chance of opening just the legendary you want is really low even in packs and you will likely have to craft it a more imporant consideration is therefore which other cards youre missing from the deck you want to build and what set they are from and if you have already spent bucks on wog cards it may well be that your classic collection is missing more cards than your old gods collection keeping in mind that classic cards will likely be more imporatant than wog cards for other decks you may want to build in the future i would strongly consider buying classic packs instead of wog packs if you have a small classic collection
hearthstone,not_removed,i like this deck a lot ive been wanting to try miracle rogue for a long time now and this seems like a nice mixture between both theres only one thing tho i got nzoth from my packs but i will only be able to craft other legendary what should it be xaril
hearthstone,not_removed,i believe edwin is much more important he can win some games by himself if you already have edwin then xaril yes thalnos is not that important
hearthstone,not_removed,alright i crafter edwin and built the deck the only cards im missing are thalnos and xaril any replacements
hearthstone,not_removed,cold blooddark iron skulkerloot hoarder whatever you prefer
hearthstone,not_removed,ive heard of this bug before and im kinda surprised it still hasnt been fixed
hearthstone,not_removed,time to make a deck that abuses this before blizzard ruins it
hearthstone,not_removed,drafting a rogue card as a shaman might be a bit inconsistent though
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,lotus rsd minion rare msog 🐙 httpwwwhearthheadcomcardslotusagents httphearthstonegamepediacomlotusagents mana battlecry discover a druid rogue or shaman card callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to for more pm
hearthstone,not_removed,exactly my point chance of a rogue card then a very small to actually get headcrack thats what i call inconsistent
hearthstone,not_removed,no you always get card each from the classes the thing is you only get chance at finding the card you want
hearthstone,not_removed,oh wow i never realized it was always one of each class my bad
hearthstone,not_removed,btw
hearthstone,not_removed,they are around rank in na for me theres still that occasional zoo and face hunter but they arent that big of a threat
hearthstone,not_removed,actually i think that is how it would work based on the choose a friendly minion text it would work kind of like the brann blackwing corruptor interaction for example which can deal blackwings damage twice but only to one thing youre getting the battlecry twice but youre only able to pick one target so in this case youve already targeted your one minion and youre getting goyas battlecry of the swap itself twice hopefully that makes sense it sounded better in my head
hearthstone,not_removed,huh i guess that does make a bit of sense its just not what id expect maybe theres a real shot at goya being competitively usable in brann decks now thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,itd be risky business though youd lose any battlecries from anything she pulled couldnt run any minions that board clear like doomsayer but i assume someone will probably make one sooner or later that does work and well get to see videos of the glorious combos haha no problem
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah shes could be like a superbarnes i might mess around with it for fun see what i can do
hearthstone,not_removed,dogs dont have girlfriends silly
hearthstone,not_removed,his girlfriend holds his mouse for him on stream every day
hearthstone,not_removed,why do you care thats really weird
hearthstone,not_removed,well clearly you never saw lady and the tramp kappa
hearthstone,not_removed,cool your jets weve seen one quest thats like saying i ate sushi once and it gave me diarrhea so all sushi gives diarrhea and therefore sucks like wait till they release at least half the cards before bashing the design space ffs
hearthstone,not_removed,ill confess i didnt read this because it just comes off as a whine if you dont like it font buy it
hearthstone,not_removed,personally id like to see a sealed format tempostorm has a tool for it but it requires you and youre opponent to own every card i havent played mtg how does drafting work in it
hearthstone,not_removed,can you explain the draft style youre talking about what is magic style drafting
hearthstone,not_removed,basically you open a pack which contains cards the player that opens the pack chooses the first card and then passes the rest of the pack to the next player wich also chooses a card and so onits quite interesting
hearthstone,not_removed,im confused is he on a pirate or a pirate boat
hearthstone,not_removed,is it because he was killed on a boat
hearthstone,not_removed,not a pirate i dont know the lore also
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe hes on a pirate on a pirate boat
hearthstone,not_removed,oops
hearthstone,not_removed,hes paying the pirates to do stuff for him he isnt a pirate himself
hearthstone,not_removed,or maybe hes on a pirate boat thats on a pirate
hearthstone,not_removed,what about the pirate boat on a pirate boat
hearthstone,not_removed,skål
hearthstone,not_removed,hva er poenge
hearthstone,not_removed,hva tror du det er en møteplass for norske folk hvor man kan diskutere alt innen hearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,i think changing the nature of charge minions in the game is probably unnecessary it would kill otk decks which are actually relatively balanced they have to acquire a lot of resources and generally reach mana before pulling anything off most face decks arent even carried by charge minions unless they run leroy most face decks rely on spells for instance face hunter will very often kill you with weapons quick shots and kill command i think they can use the not attack face the first turn they are played mechanic though when creating new cards as it would help free up a lot of design space
hearthstone,not_removed,blizz didnt make any charge cards in wotog or onik and hardly wont in the future because the charge mechanic is just oppressive like you pretty much said
hearthstone,not_removed,charge minions are not a problem currently and should not be changed
hearthstone,not_removed,i mostly agree spell based otk usually malygos decks are still feasible without charge though face decks not being carried by charge is good because i wouldnt want to kill that archetype it would still work it would just be nerfed a bit
hearthstone,not_removed,theyre not an overwhelming problem because many have been nerfed and new ones are barely printed any more there are some issues with the game currently that they have an effect on though i even listed a few
hearthstone,not_removed,well if you arent trying to kill face decks by needing charge why change them the only thing they really hurt is worgen otk anyfin paladin and leroy burst with leroy being the only extremely frustrating one if you are simply looking for a way to allow for more creative charge type minions to be implemented then dont propose a nerf on all preexisting charge minions propose a new mechanic that it like charge instead does that make sense cause i can see where youre coming from
hearthstone,not_removed,the thing is charge minions have already been nerfed what im proposing and maybe i shouldve been clearer is an alternate nerf the way theyve been nerfed now is both directly eg leeroy used to cost force of nature and arcane golem lost charge and worse by not printing new ones not one since tgt the change im suggesting allows charge to be more than the bastardized halfbanished mechanic that it is now
hearthstone,not_removed,so are you saying you want the charge mechanic to restrict the minion from hitting face its first turn so that cards like leeroy and fon can be restored to their old values cause if not i would just suggest you phrase this suggestion as a possible future mechanic cause if you restrict charge like that now if blizzard ever wanted to make a charge minion that could hit face it would be a hassle since the old charge tag had been reprogrammed
hearthstone,not_removed,blizzard themselves have called charge problematic have nerfed it and have stopped making new charge cards im suggesting a simple change that in my opinion completely fixes it the fact that they could then unnerf old cards is a positive side effect but not the point they just shouldnt ever make charge minions that hit face in my opinion
hearthstone,not_removed,well personally i find that having face hitting charge minions are generally okay for the game charge minions walk a fine line since they do have the potential of being too overpowered too easily the only charge combo that is maybe too overpowered atm is the leeroy power overwhelming combo and that is still more of a problem with po than with leeroy let me try to explain it this way charge minions as they stand serve to make a few fun and fairly balanced decks such as worgen otk and anyfin paladin changing the charge mechanic would destroy these decks now take for instance we create a new mechanic which we will call first strike that performs as a charge minion but cannot attack the opponents face the turn it is summoned adding a mechanic like this would allow blizzard the opportunity to add in new chargelike minions to the game without changing all the charge minions currently in the game they could even add this mechanic to previously nerfed cards like fon and leeroy to restore them to their original values this way these preexisting otk decks dont get punished simply for employing charge minions as in most cases they are on par with or strictly worse than your average freeze mage and you get the new mechanic to open up design space you could even add a minion with the ability to prevent charge minions from attacking face as a defensive tool if you are really looking for a way to counter these otk decks
hearthstone,not_removed,i can see where youre coming from your suggestion of a new mechanic is more likely to happen than mine so you win on that front regardless
hearthstone,not_removed,do you have experience with other card games just wondering if that is what makes you wary of charge minions and the lack of defensive options in hearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,not extensively im no expert on the topic ive played some magic which led me to see the first item in my list is a problem with hs the mechanics of hs inherently favor aggro because the aggressive player calls the shots
hearthstone,not_removed,well to be honest your not attack face for a turn suggestion wouldnt do much to change the aggressive players control of the game as if it did allow blizzard to print better charge minions for the purpose of trading with other minions they would just become very aggressive in gaining tempo the best way to stem the heavy aggro favor currently in the game would either to not release any other charge minions release better taunt minions or release more board clears
hearthstone,not_removed,it could mean nothing more than this game has outgrown the need for a subtitle like how nobody bothered adding orcs and humans to the title of the warcraft movie theres still an incredible amount of stuff to mine from inside warcraft before blizzard might feel forced to go outofuniverse for card or expansion ideas and doing so prematurely would imo be to the detriment of the game as a whole creatively it would be really hard to shoehorn outofuniverse content into the hearthstone game hearthstone is already established as a card game that itself exists inside the warcraft universe you can go into wow and see npcs playing it this means there would be this unavoidable jarring distinction between stuff that is in the game because its sourced from the world of the people who are fictionally playing it and everything else this may seem irrelevant — who cares azeroth isnt real hearthstone is a game were playing on our computers that could be about anything — but this kind of story resonance is actually really important for making people identify with and build an emotional connection with the game theyre playing compare how superficial heroes of the storm feels with the way it handwaves its flimsy premise versus how much mileage overwatch gets out of setting itself in a deep story that is utterly irrelevant to its gameplay i think hearthstone crossovers might be fudgeable in peripheral stuff like card backs and tavern brawls as collectables cross over in all the games but it would be a lot harder to do with cards or expansions without breaking the metaphor of the game in a way that would be really weird for players
hearthstone,not_removed,diablo or overwatch cards no more biker pigmen with bacon guns yes i think hearthstone will create new characters into warcraft universe instead of just copying everything from world of warcraft
hearthstone,not_removed,i think it means nothing more than its just not needed originally it was there so people would be able to connect it to another series of games but now its doing just fine on its own as its own game it reduces the clutter of the logo and just looks better now i wouldnt look too much into the whole hs lost its subtitle and theres going to be a diablo card back omg hype its most likely just coincidence
hearthstone,not_removed,i think it opens more space and room for development the devs dont have to design lorecorrect cards anymore they basically can do what they want
hearthstone,not_removed,sombra confirmed
hearthstone,not_removed,i think it means zenyatta is getting added as a new class
hearthstone,not_removed,i think its big enough now that doesnt need the warcraft association any more and is going to be marketed as a general interest digital ccg from now on rather than that wow card game blizzard have realised that theyre bigger as a company than their three big brands are individually
hearthstone,not_removed,yup this kind of like how irrc hots created the character brightwing and then it was later added into wow
hearthstone,not_removed,i want it
hearthstone,not_removed,overwatch was a part of a failed titan project and had no connections to starcraft universe
hearthstone,not_removed,but fairie dragons existed in warcraft first before hots brightwing is just a few of those who are named same as lunara or sgt hammer they just want to import units from other games but give them a name because its dumb if their names in hots are just dryad or siege tank
hearthstone,not_removed,hmm must have got them confused
hearthstone,not_removed,ive beaten at least two players who dropped that on turn a and a with two death rattle is extremely strong for the mana cost but not unbeatable or game winning on its own if the hunter curves out well on turns as well then theyre very likely to win
hearthstone,not_removed,ive won against barnes highmane and barnes yshaarj multiple times
hearthstone,not_removed,salt
hearthstone,not_removed,stay mad at rank friend
hearthstone,not_removed,i love it when my barnes pulls out a high mane or rag
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah okay you can barnes highmane him back but that doesnt count
hearthstone,not_removed,nobodys playing that deck and naturally stuck at rank
hearthstone,not_removed,you see this paladin flair here theres a card called consecration to deal with savanna highmane hunter almost always forfeits after i keeper of uldaman or aldor peacekeeper the yshaarj
hearthstone,not_removed,its actually called consecration
hearthstone,not_removed,pirate warrior is the cheapest of the decks that can get you to legend only runs or legendaries being leeroy and sir finley
hearthstone,not_removed,httpwwwvicioussyndicatecomdecklibrarywarlockdeckszoowarlock zoo struggles with midrange shaman but its decent against the rest of the meta imp gang boss is really strong but its in brm which rotates out in months building a deck without it is doable but it will be weaker than the average zoo youd need karazhan for this deck but its in the game for another months httpwwwvicioussyndicatecomdecklibraryhunterdecksfacehunter this deck also needs karazhan leeroy jenkins is really good but not essential however since you like aggro decks leeroy will be a good investment for you quick shot is in brm too not quite as important as imp gang boss but still really good especially in a face deck where you empty your hand quickly triggering the draw effect more often this is the only deck in the meta that can hold its own vs midrange shaman and not suck against all other meta decks httpwwwvicioussyndicatecomdecklibrarywarriordeckspiratewarrior this deck can have no adventure cards in it if you want finley is great but not vital leeroy is in the deck but again its optional and itd be a good investment its okay in the current meta but nothing special
hearthstone,not_removed,facehunter easy to pilot can easily get you to the ranks you want very cheap no legendaries necessary and its aggro as fuck
hearthstone,not_removed,i hate to be that guy but your best bet is probably midrange shaman you can pretty much run the deck with a single legendary bloodmage thalnos and even then it can be subbed out for kobold geomancer it is undoubtedly the strongest deck right now although most people have a strong animosity for it other choice is probably aggro pirate and a more aggressive version of beast druid however please note that some cards and legendaries are only available after you get certain sets which might mean they are actually more expensive than other cards
hearthstone,not_removed,play shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,aggro freeze is a pretty good deck to look into not that many people play it so it has a decent surprise factor its also a relatively cheap deck blood mage thalnos ice blocks and doomsayers being the main dust sink
hearthstone,not_removed,plus
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for taking time to write this up
hearthstone,not_removed,i fucking hate playing against facehunter every second game
hearthstone,not_removed,easy to pilot
hearthstone,not_removed,minion neutral legendary classic 🐙 httphearthstonegamepediacomcaptaingreenskin mana pirate battlecry give your weapon callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to pm
hearthstone,not_removed,only some variants
hearthstone,not_removed,its not that difficult to pilot the basic plan is survive early with minionsspell clearing while saving enough spells to kill them draw without dying burn face with possible healing in mind its essentially a solitaire deck granted there are a few matchups that you need to save up an otk combo for like murloc paly or priest but those decks are often slow enough that as long as you have the right mindset you can win i suppose it probably requires more thought than face hunter and maybe dragon warrior
hearthstone,not_removed,when ever i see her i throw my keyboard and say oh boy another aggro deck
hearthstone,not_removed,argent squire does the exact opposite for me especially if its played by a shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,except your idea of fun isnt fun when youre on the receiving end if you want to play a fun game of hearthstone against a non netdeck that isnt aggro or plays op cards why not play against the ai
hearthstone,not_removed,a company has to make money to keep an online game running pay its staff for new content and bug fixes etc theres nothing wrong with the freetopay model as long as there are both patient freetoplay players and some putting their money into the game we are a big and thriving comminuty it sounds like youre in a hurry to get new cards but not willing to pay this is the very balance that freetoplay economies are all about gaining enough gold for fun experiments in casual wild brawls with friends etc is not a big commitment especially now with most brawls its really easy to complete a few daily quests i dont see how removing a monthly reward would help freetoplay players even at the high ranks you gain free cards for a few games however id love to see a quest overhaul too making them more interesting and fun theres hardly any variation of themes today
hearthstone,not_removed,tldrwaaaaaaaaaaaaaah
hearthstone,not_removed,why do people in lol copy rune pages skills builds itembuilds and follow the champions meta why do they play for win instead of playing ap soraka why do people in csgo watch for tactics nades tricks from pro player why do they always try to buy the most efficient weapons instead of going knife mid i tell you why meanwhile its always fun to derp around multiplayer games made players be extremely competetive because you play against each other and our brain usually tells us you must be better than this other guy go beat him theres questionable pleasure of beating ai in a card game or shooter or anything but its extremely satysfying to beat other people at the same time you see you blame you cant play your fun decks with gimmicky combos because other ppl play aggro and you lose so the problem is you dont like losing if you did that for fun you would not care about the score
hearthstone,not_removed,just like they made low cost minions to better than the higher cost minions cthun the most poorly thought out op card in the game overstated minions with zero draw backs so low cost minions are op and should be nerfed theres only one high cost card thats good enough for you and cthun is op and should be nerfed cthun servants like mana or mana are overstated minions and should be nerfed you basically want to nerf all the decent cards just so you could play gimmicky unstable cards like beneath the grounds and mistcaller its like saying i want to enter the running competition by doing cartwheels ban running with legs by the way ive never heard anyone else call cthun overpowered
hearthstone,not_removed,i aint reading this mountain of salt maybe ill use as a copy pasta
hearthstone,not_removed,in any ccg collectible card game ive played netdecking has been a thing people want to win and they will go to the allmighty internet to look up how to win i cant think of any reasonable implementation blizzard can put in place to prevent people from mostly playing the deck they think gives them the best chance to win if you want to play fun theme decks against non meta decks id recommend finding friends interested in the same thing and playing with them thats how it works with other card games

hearthstone,not_removed,tldr i tried playing games as zoo and lost im btw
hearthstone,not_removed,can i see the decklist and ur rank playing this im a low rank pirate warrior player and i want to see if that could give me some hints for improvement
hearthstone,not_removed,hes playing in wild and is running blood warriors those two things you can be sure of
hearthstone,not_removed,great observation indeed in wild
hearthstone,not_removed,or faceless
hearthstone,not_removed,good point
hearthstone,not_removed,no
hearthstone,not_removed,well that didnt last long
hearthstone,not_removed,say goodbye to pirates
hearthstone,not_removed,in a world where weapon classes have two weapon slots max this meta doesnt blow quite so hard
hearthstone,not_removed,the salt levels lower in kripps streams

hearthstone,not_removed,not a single pack but back to back opened cenarius and bloodmage thalanos
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,sorry tried to add text not sure how to add both to a post this vid is from about a month ago first time i have ever gotten legendaries in one pack what is the best you guys have opened has anyone gotten legendaries in one pack anyone get gold in one pack post pics
hearthstone,not_removed,probably the best ever opened
hearthstone,not_removed,httpimgurcomzntennl
hearthstone,not_removed,damnnn golden grom is legit
hearthstone,not_removed,its okay i dust almost all the gold
hearthstone,not_removed,lmao id be rock hard after that
hearthstone,not_removed,shit man double gold legendaries is the best legit pack ive seen so far grats to you man
hearthstone,not_removed,ya but golden gorehowl is fucking badass man
hearthstone,not_removed,its your call but king krush doesnt see any play right now it may in the future though i think almost anything with charge may eventually become playable
hearthstone,not_removed,why do you want to play freeze mage its not very good and certainly not playable without key cards emperor is not craftable though you need brm for it king krush is the only legendary i would dust
hearthstone,not_removed,i was under the impression that freeze mage was strong and stayed strong despite the meta changing i also play aggroshaman
hearthstone,not_removed,freeze mage is good against zoo and rogue these days thats pretty much it
hearthstone,not_removed,freeze mage is not strong you should check tempostorm rankings
hearthstone,not_removed,freeze mage is always strong in tournaments but ladder is another story it comes into and out of the meta whenever board focused decks like zoo and greedy control decks like renolock and priest are popular but comes out of it whenever warriors and hyper aggressive decks like face shaman are popular youll probably notice that there arent a lot of greedy control decks around and while you could probably farm zoos youll have trouble dealing with shamans and especially warriors theres certainly worse decks for laddering with but i wouldnt recommend it for this meta if your local meta is all priest zoo renolock or rogue though by all means bust it out for the ladder
hearthstone,not_removed,it has seen zero play so far i dusted a golden one and have never regretted it
hearthstone,not_removed,it hasnt really seen play in years so i have my doubts itll see much in the future only reason to hang onto it is because it has a pretty cool entrance animation
hearthstone,not_removed,call of the wild and leeroy outclass it massively tbh maybe if there were a way to cheat it out or give it windfury itd be played but otherwise king krush will likely never see play
hearthstone,not_removed,would you know a deck that is likely to stay in meta for a while if there it one
hearthstone,not_removed,zoo has been in the meta for a very long time shaman and warriors are likely to stay meta till the next expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,whirlwindexecute
hearthstone,not_removed,doesnt that just play you into a turn ravaging ghoul
hearthstone,not_removed,bit of a card disadvantage
hearthstone,not_removed,ok sure but why wouldnt you hold on to the monkey
hearthstone,not_removed,whats the fun in that
hearthstone,not_removed,at this point theres not really a need to hold on to it because theres no way your opponent can outpressure legendaries per turn
hearthstone,not_removed,ok
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont understand
hearthstone,not_removed,please stop sharing every dumbass thing that happens in this guys games
hearthstone,not_removed,feelsbadman
hearthstone,not_removed,its probably safe but i would still suggest waiting a bit to see how things settle im skeptical of the rogue quest but it could turn out to be competitive depending on how the rest of the cards play out
hearthstone,not_removed,its a classic legendary its either always going to be good off youll get your hall of fame dust back
hearthstone,not_removed,well we dont know if hell be good we havent seen all the new cards yet
hearthstone,not_removed,edwin is one of the better class legendary cards if you play rogue he is a must
hearthstone,not_removed,wait until the entire set is revealed and give things a couple of weeks to see what cards are considered must craft
hearthstone,not_removed,i crafted him in january and i love using him he will probably be used in most rogue decks i would wait till expansion comes out though just to be sure you dont want to use the dust on something else
hearthstone,not_removed,i think hes gonna remain a staple in most rogue decks no matter what
hearthstone,not_removed,really i mean will he be worth crafting
hearthstone,not_removed,literally nobody knows most of the cards arent out yet
hearthstone,not_removed,yea we dont know weather he sees play or not completely depends on the cards coming out which we wont know for another hours
hearthstone,not_removed,no one can answer this he may be amazing in less than a month he may be completely useless
hearthstone,not_removed,more you can say a month or so yeah we will know all the cards but its really hard to evaluate all the cards and say which ones are good and which ones are bad
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe its their subtle way to encourage people with ocd to play more arena personally id rather have the occasional extra gold then for them to suddenly listen to the complainers and start rounding it down
hearthstone,not_removed,there is you play arena again and you get another for that bonus after runs
hearthstone,not_removed,yes they can have a use for
hearthstone,not_removed,theres no use for gold either but somehow i never see people complaining about that
hearthstone,not_removed,win games and you can get that to gold but gold increments cant do that
hearthstone,not_removed,that just doesnt make any sense
hearthstone,not_removed,i was still kinda asleep what im trying to say is with enough increments of gold you can get exactly enough to buy a pack and have gold left over
hearthstone,not_removed,right thats true for as well though
hearthstone,not_removed,but to get you have to play an arena run while can be gotten from ranked wins for free
hearthstone,not_removed,i had a guy who did the exact same move like you did it was probably the best all out move ive witnessed although i replied by using deathwing he rage quit
hearthstone,not_removed,nice this guy wasnt so lucky and was the one who ended up rage quiting
hearthstone,not_removed,no heals no early game you have weapons aldor uldaman and pyromancer and forbidden healing even acolyte can trade with like of their weaker stuff
hearthstone,not_removed,adapt your control deck to include heals and drops also learn that midrange hunter is not an aggro deck
hearthstone,not_removed,you want to clear their board as much as possible and you also want to put bodies on the board to trade with theirs generally your minions will be higher quality than aggros past turn and being able to repetitively remove stuff means you wont run out of removals as quickly it can also crucially stop them from hitting your face which buys you turns to stabilize people at lower ranks tend to over trade which you can use to your advantage other than that try changing up your mulligan a bit mulligan hard for doomsayer like toss everything if you dont get one hard and sometimes aldor since you wont care about it getting value against aggressive decks and you just want a on the board more than anything
hearthstone,not_removed,whats scarecrow harvest golem you can try taunts like senjin or the new infested tauren i assume you have pyros and equalities and consecrates truesilvers are useful too humility and aldor forbidden healing is an epic but its good for pyro trigger too
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean ways to combat aggro are heals early game taunts and board clears so saying no heals no or drops is basically saying i know what cards counter aggro but i dont want to run them
hearthstone,not_removed,they took out everything that countered aggro healbot and chow are the main things
hearthstone,not_removed,man no more chow into bot into muster how am i supposed to play learn to play a real deck you dumb paladin abuser
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,doomsayer aldor peacekeeper equality humility keeper of uldaman consecrate wild pyromancer
hearthstone,not_removed,you still have forbidden healing and lay on hands whispers gave paladin ragnaros lightlord if you want to go more budget guardian of kings could work although is obviously not optimal

hearthstone,not_removed,relevant name
hearthstone,not_removed,as long as no rewards are in it i am ok
hearthstone,not_removed,some of the cards all of the time nice phrase d
hearthstone,not_removed,it would be a nice feature if most brawls were permanent game modes the problem is the more game modes there are the longer matchmaking will take because there will be less players in each mode
hearthstone,not_removed,httphearthstonegamepediacomhearthstonewiki just search for the card and towards the bottom of the cards page youll see the full artwork
hearthstone,not_removed,sick thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,zoo is a counter to jade druid
hearthstone,not_removed,that card would have to be pretty expensive it can be broken in so many ways
hearthstone,not_removed,i meant as control class
hearthstone,not_removed,that just means youre bad even for a shaman congratulations
hearthstone,not_removed,its called being bad or being on tilt
hearthstone,not_removed,be super greedy with your mulligan you also shouldnt keep drops
hearthstone,not_removed,while i appreciate the need to vent now and then if youve been climbing all month and only reached by now then unless you have significant card limitations which allow you to not play the best decks for the meta the issue could well lie with your skills
hearthstone,not_removed,watch streamers who play shaman at legend there are plenty of them analyze why they play like they do and why your own ideas at the same board wouldnt work given your hand and every draw try to imagine a world in which these cards can win try to pursue most likely scenarios in games of chance you create your success by imagining it
hearthstone,not_removed,you need to venture into the mountains there you will meet thrall now a hermit after being replaced by morgll if you pass his three tests he will teach you the ancient art of getting good and not sucking at playing the simplest deck in the game
hearthstone,not_removed,soo whats your decklist read that guide on how to play aggro shaman and learn the matchups i got to rank with it yesterday but i can tell you its not that autopilot as you might think you have to know what your opponents are gonna play maelstrom by shaman twilight drake by priest blablabla
hearthstone,not_removed,that just means youre a dick and irl too nice job i was venting because when i try this stupid fucking deck that makes you dumber the longer you play which i can tell you do for hours a day i either draw my pirates way after i could have used them in the early game or i only had or minions to play until turn and gave whatever deck i was playing way to much time to react it was fucking awful no matter how many burn spells i mulliganed away i either got more back or arya blackpaw and no other jade cards it was fucking disgusting how poorly i drew cards and had nothing but small minions to play in the later stages and hella searing totems all day it doesnt matter because im a pos for even trying this stupid ass deck and youre a pos just because thats who you are have a nice day
hearthstone,not_removed,and this type of comment is exactly what nobody needs doesnt help at all
hearthstone,not_removed,i didnt just reach i deranked to after switching to aggro shaman i play mostly everyday but only a couple games im not casual but i climb ladder casually
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks those are some awesome points ill try that out today although i dont know if ill keep trying with aggro shaman i always do so much better with control decks maybe i began the game frustrated because i never had the crazy good starts aggro always against me especially yesterday so i probably played worst with tilt but in hindsight with the cards i began my hand with i only ever had tiny decision making in the minions i could play for example in one game yesterday i had tunnel trogg with no totem golem but lava burst lightning bolt in hand i either wait more turns for a totem golem which i didnt draw till turn instead on playing trogg turn for nice early board presence what i did that game was play trogg immediately because i had all burn and i drew into jade claws but even turn jade claws didnt help me from losing my board presence and hero powering until turn when i drew totem golem thats just the one game from trackobot that i thought i was going to win but i just didnt draw any more minion threats for so long i cannot just be bad because i dont draw anything i can actually play
hearthstone,not_removed,um just the one that runs sir finley and one azure drake because i try to mulligan for anything i could use early game but trust me you guys have no idea how terrible my starting hand always is i mean i play against aggro shaman for months now i do really well against it as priest and ive always maintained a positive winrate against shaman except yesterday when nothing worked and know what cards are needed from the start but i never got them im convinced i am super unlucky when i play it and there is nothing i could do about the order i drew cards or the cards i got after mulliganing burn spells i didnt need
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah blame the card draw guess what some people actually try to have fun when playing card games and when the same two decks are dominating ladder and you see nothing else well maybe that starts getting to you you know why theyre dominating because theyre easy to play if you have a winrate thats not bad luck thats just you giving people like me the satisfaction of justice i dont play that deck guess why because i actually want to play not be on autopilot with saliva drooling onto my keyboard am i a piece of shit for criticizing someone who cant even play the most basic braindead of decks am i a piece of shit for not liking the fact that the starting turns of every gane are the same maybe but in this case i really dont care you yourself aknowledged that you hate the deck and there was no reason to take what i said the wrong way just look at it as another way to encourage you to improve im serious send me one of your games if you use hs deck tracker and ill tell you how you can improve your game
hearthstone,not_removed,are you on eu if yes pm me your battletag and ill spectate you
hearthstone,not_removed,thats exactly what im trying to say every single game i play is the same exact start but when i try to play aggro shaman i never have that same start no matter how hard i mulligan for itbut rather the opposite i have everything in hand you hope i have because it doesnt help me having at all id love to show the history for each turn by turn play but on trackobot its on a scroll which i dont feel like screen capturing each turns then transferring to imgur to post here ive reviewed of the games and some of them really dont show how i could have taken any other course of action considering this is an aggro deck i definitely lost the mirror matchup tho just because the guy i was playing definitely knew how the mirrors go when i didnt but im not really complaining about that l because i know what went wrong
hearthstone,not_removed,karma
hearthstone,not_removed,what do you call not drawing a single stb in games or even having the sick combination of tunnel trogg and totem golem in any game together ever like how can you be considered good or bad when it feels like it all depends if your opening hand and first couple draws dude fuck i just tried aggro shaman again and lost another mirror match up where all i had was a finley totem golem and flamewreathes and i eventually drew into southsea deck hand but no weapons to activat him on a board after arya and jades i know i could have probably played it better but fuck that i never had even a half way decent start for any game besides the games i won im just gonna go back to my minute games where i belong edit sorry for the way i came off i was heated about the way these games played out of course and i lashed out on ya so for that im sorry it was petty
hearthstone,not_removed,the hand in the mirror match you just described dosent sound that bad finley turn is finegood depending on the outcome and you cant beat turn two golem maybe theres skill involved in the deck after all lol either way the world will be a better place if you go back to not playing the same deck everyone is playing
hearthstone,not_removed,sure why not you get lots of cards from adventures anyways
hearthstone,not_removed,do loe if possible great cards there
hearthstone,not_removed,thats horribly inefficient after youve got like of the cards
hearthstone,not_removed,nerfed cards have always got a full refund when the updates rolled out i doubt it would be any different with yogg in the next update
hearthstone,not_removed,someone got a response on twitter indicating that it would receive a full refund
hearthstone,not_removed,this may not count as a nerf in the same way didnt count
hearthstone,not_removed,regarding the mekgineer thermaplugg nerf are you referring to the leper gnome nerf that also nerfed thermaplugg since i couldnt find any other nerf to him i havent been playing since betarelease
hearthstone,not_removed,minion neutral legendary gvg httphearthstonegamepediacommekgineerthermaplugg mana mech whenever an enemy minion dies summon a leper gnome callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to pm
hearthstone,not_removed,but blizzard called yogg nerfednot fixed
hearthstone,not_removed,you got it
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah but i read somewhere that mekgineer was indirectly nerfed by the leper gnome nerf so it doesnt deserve a full refund while yogg was directly nerfed and was included in the patch notes while mekgineer wasnt
hearthstone,not_removed,if the new behavior was always supposed to be yoggs behavior but a bug resulted in what we have now blizzard fixing that bug would not be considered a nerf it just shows more inconsistency from them
hearthstone,not_removed,i personally think that blizzard have designed yogg to continue casting spells even after its death but too many people complained and they had to do something
hearthstone,not_removed,no youre right that is exactly what happened im just saying they could have called this a bug fix and and it would be the exact same situation for the card its not a stat or written effect change it all happens back end so it is the same if it is called a nerf or bug fix
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah that is true but i guess this way those who didnt want to see yogg nerfed will get some kind of compensation this isnt only positive for those who hate yogg
hearthstone,not_removed,considering cabalist can give doubles you have a better chance with conjurer
hearthstone,not_removed,tome can give you duplicates so considering the fact that you are looking for that one specific spell conjurer would be better
hearthstone,not_removed,conjurer because lets say you need to find fireball out of mage spells to have lethal conjurer gives you chance of fireball being your first card if its your second card and if it is your third on the other hand tome gives you only a chance of getting fireball because order does not matter and cards can repeat themselves so in theory conjurer is better
hearthstone,not_removed,if you need one and only one spell eg ice block then conjurer is better if your out is direct damage a la fireball tome is better because you can potentially get frostbolt or frostbolt icelance
hearthstone,not_removed,you can kind of think of cabalists tome as giving you all three discovery options of coarse this isnt exactly true because you can get dupe cabalists tome spell but not in discoveries
hearthstone,not_removed,by ice block you mean fireball right
hearthstone,not_removed,yup got confused thanks for pointing it out
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah but what is the deck
hearthstone,not_removed,we knew that the next expansion would be coming out in though
hearthstone,not_removed,theyve confirmed that we are getting two expansions and one adventure a year
hearthstone,not_removed,might be too strong can make for some broken combos
hearthstone,not_removed,i think thats a cool idea for a change in the card obviously would need some play testing also would the other cards be discarded or returned to your deck unfortunately blizzard probably wont make any changes to the card for a long time they seem much more fond of nerfing cards than buffing them
hearthstone,not_removed,no need for a buff they are just going to make powerful new druid cards
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i guess its supposed to be funny with everyone calling him a sellout and all that still looks to me as if hes gone full on greedmode these last few weeks definitely lost a viewer in me
hearthstone,not_removed,this text to speech stream is literally once a year for his birthday lol
hearthstone,not_removed,its the annual sellout kripp birthday stream not a normal thing
hearthstone,not_removed,calm down its a one time thing lighten up
hearthstone,not_removed,there have been too many one time things as of late i dont mind him doing the sponsored stuff once in a while but as of late whenever i tuned into his stream he was playing some sponsored garbage game
hearthstone,not_removed,that was fixed in a patch the first days after wrathion was out you could mill yourself to death
hearthstone,not_removed,if you mill a card you dont draw it so as effect stated he will stop
hearthstone,not_removed,wait i thought that wrathions card text was just taunt battlecry draw a card is this not the case
hearthstone,not_removed,you draw cards until the card you draw is not a dragon
hearthstone,not_removed,its a joke the joke is that wrathion will always hit a non dragon card first
hearthstone,not_removed,joke went right over my head as always d
hearthstone,not_removed,did you vote for one of the finalists in the hearthstone winter championship
hearthstone,not_removed,i only got so like the other guy said its the championship packs probably
hearthstone,not_removed,i voted for pavel and only got one i got the one for the daily login so does that mean i dont get a reward for voting for pavel
hearthstone,not_removed,yup i just had the same for voting packs one of them had a kazakus dust
hearthstone,not_removed,got from pavel
hearthstone,not_removed,is this only on eu at the moment i didnt get anything on my na or asia accounts
hearthstone,not_removed,probably havent rolled them out to everyone yet they do it gradually you get one for voting for pavel
hearthstone,not_removed,for top yes it should stick for top or even top probably not but as long as you only want top you can camp it till am tomorrow
hearthstone,not_removed,you can camp easy my friend youll easily make top
hearthstone,not_removed,na legend elegiggle
hearthstone,not_removed,ah alright i think top is probably good enough thanks for the reply d
hearthstone,not_removed,nice thanks d
hearthstone,not_removed,its just as easy to get legend on eu hahaa
hearthstone,not_removed,comment what rank you end up getting hopefully you dont play and just campd im curious
hearthstone,not_removed,rank d nice top without playing since monday night
hearthstone,not_removed,gratz man
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,legend here grind tournaments and trust me getting legend once doesnt mean anything i tried a competitive team and ended up getting taken advantage of after my time and was underappreciated and they wanted essentially a week free work for exposure grinding tournaments isnt fun it costs a lot of time and money you make no money from hearthstone until youre at a staggering level sorry to burst your bubble but one time getting legend means nothing when anyone can copy and paste a shaman deck and grind it
hearthstone,not_removed,congrats and good luck
hearthstone,not_removed,win a few tournaments make a name and start streaming if youre lucky people watch it and you can make a living out of it you cant expect to keep competetive the whole time so id suggest to go this way if it is something you want to do
hearthstone,not_removed,sorry to hear about your toxic experiences with bad organizations i know how it must sound when some new kid on the block hits legend once and thinks hes the shit and i know i have a long way to go before ill ever be the shit but hearthstone is something ive come really far with and i know to stop here and to not try for anything bigger then just hitting legend means all those hours of practice were for nothing my dream isnt to be the next reynad or kripp but someone who goes after something with of their effort and hopes for the best to me legend was never the last step but just one of many that i had to reach as i venture into the world of tournaments and true competitive play my only hope is that i can continue to reach the next step
hearthstone,not_removed,just signed up for zotac na i think thats the right way to go as well thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,best of luck just fair warning ive done what youre trying and ultimately my career was more important sadly out of college i cant grind as much and my other hobbies take up time to where i dont really want to copy paste a strong deck and grind if the meta isnt boring i make a new deck and grind legend like if you google nethervex zoobot a couple places did articles on me
hearthstone,not_removed,hey thats pretty cool man and that sucks about not being able to commit as much time into the game as youd want hopefully im not imposing but would you consider adding me battlenet to maybe practice or exchange ideas if that answer ends up being yes my tag is
hearthstone,not_removed,sure man i dont really do grinds anymore but plenty of brewing
hearthstone,not_removed,sounds good the fact that you dont grind cant talk away that fact that youre a good player with both a lot to teach and learn i look forward to talking to you in game
hearthstone,not_removed,just to be clear if you had an amazon prime membership already twitch prime is a free benefit and there is no monthly fee
hearthstone,not_removed,finally a psa that is actually a psa
hearthstone,not_removed,fyi even if you do get charged you can cancel your membership and get a refund i did it the same day so i got the whole amount i dont know if its actually prorated
hearthstone,not_removed,jokes on you i already had amazon prime before the giveaway
hearthstone,not_removed,you could have canceled them minutes after you signed up the trial stays active until it expires regardless if youre set to renew or not
hearthstone,not_removed,jokes on them theres no money in my account anyway
hearthstone,not_removed,well i have this in my account next payment on november your card will not be charged and your membership will end so i am assuming im in the clear
hearthstone,not_removed,or keep it because amazon prime is an amazing service
hearthstone,not_removed,im keeping mine for a while and cancelling netflix instead got a few shows i want to watch only available on amazon might as well get through those then switch back
hearthstone,not_removed,feelsbad for all the streamers who will lose thousands of subs over the next week or so
hearthstone,not_removed,jokes on you i didnt manage to get tyrande and will probably never have her sincerely illidan
hearthstone,not_removed,i was contemplating keeping my membership but ultimately decided that it wasnt worth keeping for a year monthly is not an option in canada
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you
hearthstone,not_removed,i already used my prime trial but i still signed up got my free priest hero then cancled my prime and they gave me a refund
hearthstone,not_removed,or keep it because its actually a really great service
hearthstone,not_removed,jokes on you i canceled it the day i got it
hearthstone,not_removed,cancelled it right after grabbing the code
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks dude
hearthstone,not_removed,amazon refunds the money even if you cancel after being charged thoughhappend to me once d
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks man
hearthstone,not_removed,excuse me but you shouldnt charge me for service that you dont provide to my country thats just wrong
hearthstone,not_removed,honestly this was a major incentive in joining amazon prime or amazon student for me which is off prime all the benefits it included for such a low price tag really drew me in but the free subscription was really the deciding factor tryande was just an added bonus
hearthstone,not_removed,youve just saved my bucks thanks mate
hearthstone,not_removed,oh holy crap thank you so much for reminding me they actually charged me the € for the next year but i canceled it and im getting it refunded because i didnt use any prime service phew i almost got a heart attack lol prime is an amazing service but i dont use amazon nearly enough for me to warrant spending that much for it in a year
hearthstone,not_removed,wait ive been missing out on this the whole time thanks for the psa
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks boys saved me the money i needed this week
hearthstone,not_removed,or you know just keep amazon prime because its awesome sponsored comment
hearthstone,not_removed,or keep it prime is awesome
hearthstone,not_removed,anyone knows what to do if you deleted your credit card info but not the subscription i got a mail stating this due to a problem with your card we have been unable to charge your account xxxx and applicable taxes for your next month of amazon prime your membership benefits are currently suspended is there anything wrong regarding my blizzard account if ignoring it
hearthstone,not_removed,also i have a friend who works for amazon and he assures people that if you forget and end up getting charged a simple call to amazon will get it refunded as long as you havent bought anything with prime
hearthstone,not_removed,i love that twitch now has prime attached to its name i always felt bad at never donating and now i can pay it to the streamers
hearthstone,not_removed,already did right away d
hearthstone,not_removed,fyi even if you cancel it after they charge tou they will give you back the amount for the days remaining i paid them today and cancelled just after so i got a full refund
hearthstone,not_removed,but what if i like it why you make me get rid of prime
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,but im not finished catching up on mr robot yet
hearthstone,not_removed,i did right away after getting my code no reason not to if you didnt want prime since you still get to use your membership until the day trial ends streamers sub count is probably gonna take a big hit this month after the spike from last month
hearthstone,not_removed,hi i know it doesnt fit here but does anyone have left some tyradne code it would help my a lot
hearthstone,not_removed,i learned the hard way this morning down the drain
hearthstone,not_removed,yo you the realest for this heads upthanks bro cant be wasting with new set coming
hearthstone,not_removed,fyi be sure to check your bank account even if you canceled the renewal even though i canceled it the day the promotion came out i got charged regardless today id taken screenshots and got a confirmation email beforehand but thankfully even if it does renew after a cancel you can get a full refund anyway within business days by going to your page and canceling again so long as you havent used any of primes services
hearthstone,not_removed,fuckin sellouts fuck amazon i hate this market domination strategy with twitch prime
hearthstone,not_removed,you are no longer an amazon prime member
hearthstone,not_removed,no
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks man you just saved me what i dont have
hearthstone,not_removed,i could never get it work apparently your card has to be international and its not
hearthstone,not_removed,im keeping amazon prime is twitch prime free with my subscription to amazon or is it an extra charge
hearthstone,not_removed,and for anybody thinking of keeping it this next months twitch bonuses are this war of mine punchclub and an item for watch dogs
hearthstone,not_removed,will tyr be available for a while or is this going away soon
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for reminding me that i would never get twitch prime due to amazon now identifying the country of the registered account its my fault for doing it late were there any updates to the viable countries that can get twitch prime
hearthstone,not_removed,next months benefits are good as well
hearthstone,not_removed,the hero we need but do we deserve
hearthstone,not_removed,what i had amazon prime for a year my membership ended two weeks ago i am also a big twitch fan how did i not know they were the same thing all along
hearthstone,not_removed,if i already have amazon prime will i still get tyrande
hearthstone,not_removed,wish i understood the abbreviation
hearthstone,not_removed,you shouldve psaed that comment
hearthstone,not_removed,they will issue a full refund no matter how long its been if you didnt use the service
hearthstone,not_removed,they just clarified what psa is above you would you mine telling me what fyi also means
hearthstone,not_removed,€ a year it feels good to be a student sometimes
hearthstone,not_removed,i didnt but my fiancé did so now i have tyrande
hearthstone,not_removed,probably my highest value subscription overall its more than paid for itself every year on the shipping alone
hearthstone,not_removed,eh then i might as well cancel now then
hearthstone,not_removed,this is the comment people need to read
hearthstone,not_removed,if you have an active abonnement and they try to collect the money but cant because you dont have any youll get a reminder from them and theyd be in the right considering your abo so no jokes still on you
hearthstone,not_removed,fun story even if there isnt any money in your account they still get to take it out anyway and let your bank charge an overdraft fee recurring charges like that generally cant decline unless the account is frozen source work at a bank
hearthstone,not_removed,so you acting like of all governments and bank institutes living on a debt
hearthstone,not_removed,btw
hearthstone,not_removed,itrt ppl dont know how to take a joke
hearthstone,not_removed,i see i had the same message on my account too thanks for the info
hearthstone,not_removed,if it expires on the you should even be able to sneak in another twitch prime subscription before it runs out
hearthstone,not_removed,probably if you live in one of the countries blessed with their services meanwhile us dutch people are stuck with bolcom
hearthstone,not_removed,especially with the grand tour real top gear coming soon
hearthstone,not_removed,most will still see a good increase compared to months ago since the number of people with amazon prime is reasonably high
hearthstone,not_removed,you only get one sub a month and it only lasts for that month some streamer i forget who also said that the amount you get is the same as they get from a normal sub so if you want you can be permanently subbed to a single streamer but you have to reup every month
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah theres a lot of streamers who are going to be in for a very rude awakening
hearthstone,not_removed,the amount of amazon shipments i make far outweighs the cost for me so works out well worth of new apartment stuff shipped in less than hours to my door is wonderful
hearthstone,not_removed,there is literally no point if youre in a country where you cant officially get it
hearthstone,not_removed,thats hella expensive for a lot of people
hearthstone,not_removed,man i usually never get those codes in time thanks a lot you brighten my day
hearthstone,not_removed,i assume it cant be used twice right
hearthstone,not_removed,nothing its fine
hearthstone,not_removed,wrong regarding your blizzard account do you mean your twitch prime account because that will be suspended too but blizzard has nothing to do with amazon dot com
hearthstone,not_removed,haha
hearthstone,not_removed,if you havent used it they should refund it no matter the time
hearthstone,not_removed,free
hearthstone,not_removed,around a week till
hearthstone,not_removed,when i read tyr i thought of the titanic watcher tyr i was wondering how i missed something like that and how could he be a hero lol
hearthstone,not_removed,good lord you must like being the center of attention if you think a reddit post is directed only to you
hearthstone,not_removed,because they werent until a month ago
hearthstone,not_removed,thats a recent update amazon partneredbought twitch a few months ago only since then are they packaged
hearthstone,not_removed,yes you just need to link it to your twitch account
hearthstone,not_removed,jesus this comment is all over the place
hearthstone,not_removed,ive gotten two free trials of amazon prime and they charged me right after my trial was up i am canadian thoughso maybe that had something to do with tos difference i have no idea eh edit sorry forgot to mention i asked for a refund and they gave it to me i have to assume it was because i didnt buy anything using the prime service i buy stuff off of amazon probably times a year and two of those occasions they offered free day shipping with a free trial prime so i took it actually i got a free trial the month before the twitch prime and lost out on tyrande because i wasnt paying that much money for the soul reason of getting a skin
hearthstone,not_removed,someone is skim reading too much
hearthstone,not_removed,downvoted to try and break world record
hearthstone,not_removed,just how many downvotes does this post need to be automatically hidden jesus christ
hearthstone,not_removed,you do realize that you can cancel on day one of the trial instead of waiting right
hearthstone,not_removed,please stop abbreviating
hearthstone,not_removed,penis sandwich absolutely edit please dont make this my top upvoted comment
hearthstone,not_removed,post shaman agony

hearthstone,not_removed,public service announcement basically any post that potentially helps the community ie we know many would have tried amazon prime for free reminding them to cancel and not get charged is a service
hearthstone,not_removed,polan space attempts
hearthstone,not_removed,i see thanks for the clarification
hearthstone,not_removed,fyi fk you instantly
hearthstone,not_removed,same here first month are free and afterwards you only pay half the price compared to the normal amazon prime
hearthstone,not_removed,full price totally worth it
hearthstone,not_removed,€ in spain without student discount although we have less products than most of the other amazon sites
hearthstone,not_removed,€ its a year for me and im a student what the fuck
hearthstone,not_removed,how
hearthstone,not_removed,the fuck my student discount lasted about a month then they started charging me for full
hearthstone,not_removed,surely it feels good to be a student all the time damn downvoted for remembering how much i enjoyed being a student
hearthstone,not_removed,hate to ruin your day but its always good to be a student wait to you hit the real world and realise that youre still broke and the dream that when you leave school you will be financially sound is gone the only thing that is left is the living nightmare years of a shit job that you need in order to have enough money not to starve to death but on pretzel day i like pretzel day
hearthstone,not_removed,obviously they could take legal action and tigerdidnothingwrong knows that that has nothing to do with the joke of having no money
hearthstone,not_removed,any letters they send to me will get sent to blizzard hq thougj 😂
hearthstone,not_removed,being broke is expensive
hearthstone,not_removed,well thats rude
hearthstone,not_removed,itrt pls
hearthstone,not_removed,havent even heard of that what do you mean real top gear is top gear not a thing anymore i havent watched in a while last i heard matt leblanc was on it though
hearthstone,not_removed,this the only one who get screwed are the ones who saw the huge increase last month and made large budgetary changes as result
hearthstone,not_removed,also there will be people that will choose to stick around for them
hearthstone,not_removed,only dumb ones
hearthstone,not_removed,same once i got prime i pretty much stopped shopping in stores if it delivered groceries in canada im sure id never go to a store again
hearthstone,not_removed,even ignoring shipping costs there are actual discounts attached to a lot of items and if not looking for a particular brandmodel of something you can cater your shopping around picking stuff that qualifies for a discount also amazon videomusic though worse than their counterparts netflix spotifyetc still free with the service also the free shipping also two days or less shipping depends on your location also off new video games have to buy physical but free release day delivery its such a good deal
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i used to have prime until i moved countries now theres pretty much nothing i can still see on it that i am interested in so i cancelled it
hearthstone,not_removed,its a nice thing if you buy constantly on amazon but really you should buy a lot like if you need some milk order it from amazon
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,oh ok thanks ill try that edit doesnt seem to work using the american express
hearthstone,not_removed,ok thanks i was worried it was only free for people who had amazon prime before twitch prime came out
hearthstone,not_removed,amazon bought twitch two years ago but twitch prime didnt exist until a month ago
hearthstone,not_removed,talking out your ass must be reddit
hearthstone,not_removed,but do it today since the deal changes to something else tomorrow
hearthstone,not_removed,yet you read it all
hearthstone,not_removed,aight man downvoted to help out
hearthstone,not_removed,upvotes to go boys
hearthstone,not_removed,now youre just asking for it
hearthstone,not_removed,penis switching authority
hearthstone,not_removed,inconceivable
hearthstone,not_removed,now thats just ridiculous
hearthstone,not_removed,stop trolling dude
hearthstone,not_removed,by the holy light
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks a lot dude pretty new to reddit and i need to learn things like that
hearthstone,not_removed,i live in san francisco amazon has everything here the other day i ordered a toothbrush and it got delivered in under hours
hearthstone,not_removed,same maybe the conversion is the same cant check right now edit turns out its almost a quarter of what normal amazon prime is
hearthstone,not_removed,just look up amazon prime for students
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah actually my job prospects look pretty good working something around a week for decent pay when im done with my masters in or years not everything is shitty especially when you have the right mindset
hearthstone,not_removed,a shit job as you describe might be referring to something like say retail or in the service industry traditionally jobs that are lower paying on the base wage and rely on tips andor commission to make up the difference but shrug ive known people who by their words oh ill always go to school i love school different strokes for different folks
hearthstone,not_removed,ill be sure to remember that as im still a student and still making a year of course thats a conscious decision on my part but im still sick of hearing how awesome being a student is
hearthstone,not_removed,lul good luck suing me in my country paypal arleady is spamming my mail for years because they think i owe them because of a false chargeback
hearthstone,not_removed,so is not paying for stuff p
hearthstone,not_removed,in this reddit thread
hearthstone,not_removed,so after jeremey clarkson got fired and hammondmay quit the bbc and amazon decided to sign them and produce their own car show
hearthstone,not_removed,i hope none did that i hope they are all intelligent people who will wait that the money gets in their bank account
hearthstone,not_removed,we are talking about hearthstone streamers here d
hearthstone,not_removed,oh god please dont remind me luckily a couple grocery stores in my area do either pickup or delivery the pickup option offers the same dealsprices as in store and costs after the orderso for them to do my grocery trip for me amazon does have grocery delivery in some areas known as amazon fresh
hearthstone,not_removed,also some products are kept and only sold to prime members when stock gets low its a great service too bad i dont live in a country that has access to that i know about the benefits because i used a prime trial one time i was in new york got lota of stuff i couldnt find in stores and had day free shipping
hearthstone,not_removed,retarded psa are ones that remind people to cancel stuff so they dont have to pay money for something they possibly forgot
hearthstone,not_removed,theres no need for you to make psa threads if you just wanted to make retarded posts
hearthstone,not_removed,okay didnt know how long ago they had been bought out either way twitch bonuses through amazon prime is a recent addition
hearthstone,not_removed,did twitch get rid of twitch turbo or something like that
hearthstone,not_removed,until nov p
hearthstone,not_removed,you said things that are off topic and one thing thats exactly what op said im guessing you got downvoted because you brought no new pertinent information to this conversation
hearthstone,not_removed,youre a few tendies short of a happy meal
hearthstone,not_removed,bullshit i did one of those trials about years ago when i ordered a bunch of stuff to put a computer rig together and forgot to cancel it was pretty surprised when i forgot about the trial and saw a year of membership charged unexpectedly
hearthstone,not_removed,you were also downvoted because your reply had nothing to do with the comment you replied to
hearthstone,not_removed,the psa was a reminder for people who only signed up for the amazon trial for tyrande to cancel since their trial is almost up its not about policies its about reminding people to cancel before theyre charged for membership
hearthstone,not_removed,please stop analyzing
hearthstone,not_removed,some more ftfy fixed that for you tldr too long didnt read lol lots of love
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks a lot guys hope in humanity restored d
hearthstone,not_removed,just google it ffs
hearthstone,not_removed,got the same in madrid but its in like a beta phase so its just for some products
hearthstone,not_removed,€ is
hearthstone,not_removed,enjoy your stay in the dark cells of guantanámo bay awaiting your trial for one count of conspiracy to fraud one count of malicious attempt to destabilize the national financial system three counts of terrorism courtesy of the house one count of theft of identity and one count of embezzlement with malicious intent if you are lucky you will serve your years in maximum security prison and will be free again btw transport is free of charge via a black helicopter kidnapping and torture fees generously at the expense of the us government
hearthstone,not_removed,if people grow up thinking they can do this or that its ok they are all kinds of fucked up
hearthstone,not_removed,if they try to charge you a subscription for the next months service and there is no money you dont owe them anything your service will simply be cancelled you and the other comment are the other comment responding him are actually misguiding people it does not affect credit score in any way its this kind of fear of the tax man and the evil collector that hinders your ability to think rationally and get the most out of your financial prospects
hearthstone,not_removed,i also wish for world peace and civilized understanding for all
hearthstone,not_removed,turbo still exist but just a worse version of twitch prime imo
hearthstone,not_removed,cool i didnt see an official date int he announcement yesterday so i assumed at the beginning of the month does that mean i have to wait til the end of the week for punch out
hearthstone,not_removed,please stop abbreviating
hearthstone,not_removed,iirc if i recall correctly ianal i am not a lawyer
hearthstone,not_removed,not safe for lunch its meant to denote super gross stuff that might make you queazy
hearthstone,not_removed,lol lots of love wat
hearthstone,not_removed,holy shit us amazon is hating on us
hearthstone,not_removed,its okay just tell the fbi you didnt intend to break the law and also run for president i think you still have time
hearthstone,not_removed,at the expense of the us taxpayer ftfy
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah failing to make payments on services is my way of getting the most out of financial prospects too
hearthstone,not_removed,actually turbo is discontinued in countries where prime is available if you already have turbo you can elect to keep it but they do not accept any new turbo signups
hearthstone,not_removed,ianal i am not a lawyer ohhhh
hearthstone,not_removed,damn it really grinds my gears when people try hard to explain something even though its wrong sometime your wrong answer will be the firstonly one to show up and you will misguide people
hearthstone,not_removed,my mom just died lol
hearthstone,not_removed,us might get more features not sure what the difference would be
hearthstone,not_removed,also dont pay taxes and let all your businesses fail then run for president
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont know about everyone else but i racked up cc debt because i had expenses pop up temporarily that i couldnt afford to pay and didnt have the option to not pay i just meant the idea that its ok to simply not pay things and get sued etc
hearthstone,not_removed,well if you receive a warning about a failed payment and your reaction to it is taking a loancredit card debt or borrowing money from friends to pay for it instead of simply cancelling your subscription im sure you would be putting yourself at a financially disadvantageous and more risky position the narrative of they will be after you is highly biased towards putting yourself last not first like you most of the time should in life lets not forget that this whole thread is about exploiting an offer to get a freebie in game
hearthstone,not_removed,monica lewinsky was hilary clinton disguised they were just roleplaying
hearthstone,not_removed,this post itself is cancer
hearthstone,not_removed,um have you ever even played yugioh
hearthstone,not_removed,yugioh is very far from slow dude this post feels like a waste of my time tbh
hearthstone,not_removed,youre the hero hearthstone deserves but not the one we need
hearthstone,not_removed,wait wait wait did you just call yugioh slow you realize that everything has chaaarge and taunt spells traps and special summons have no cost associated to them and there are tons of ways to kill your opponent on if going second
hearthstone,not_removed,itt people trying to justify pirate warrior literally the easiest legend capable deck in the history of hs if you dont hit legend this month with how big of a freebie this meta is to aggro then gg what is sad is some of these people still ropeturn drop the blood sail like i predicted seconds agohow hard is simple math working backwards from
hearthstone,not_removed,when hearthstone first started out it had fast decks but not like the ones we have now aggro decks are fine and fast paced play is cool and all but you can only really enjoy winning if you play a long game and make meaning full decisions you can only play aggro for so long till it gets boring same goes for all the other archetypes
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,can we just call it kara we said con with naxx
hearthstone,not_removed,im not sure on the inclusion of the pit lords and felguards are you trying to make a kinda hybrid midrange deck if you were to go for a zoo style deck id recommend something more like putting in lower quality cards just as discard fodder just isnt worth it since if you dont discard them they just fuck you over though i could see felguard maybe fitting in if you need the taunts that bad also fist of jaraxxus is an iffy one for me it works well with the mechanic which is why its in there but i dont really think it should be over dark iron dwarf if youre instead trying to make more of a late game deck im not sure how itd look at all since a lot of the handlock and renolock decks currently rely heavily on the super premium cards to stabilize and combos like leeroy po po faceless to win and discarding some of them is just too risky as for midrange im not too sure about how those decks play even but based on popular one i could guess you may be able to do something like the only problem with this deck is that it really feels more like a gimmick slapped onto a current deck that made it weaker not even sure how to fit in the doomguard or the two tiny knights to really take advantage of it
hearthstone,not_removed,sorry for this guys i discluded all loe cards as i thought it would be removed on the release of karazhan
hearthstone,not_removed,because waiting on other cards to be revealed is hard
hearthstone,not_removed,agreed didnt think about that
hearthstone,not_removed,i was thinking more of a tempo style though however it might not work out thanks for the advice
hearthstone,not_removed,im just excited thats all even though the deck only contains one new card it makes a big difference and im not sure what card they could release to make this deck any better but hey blizzard are full of surprises
hearthstone,not_removed,zoo is a tempo deck its just a very high tempo deck that tends to start murdering the face earlier than normal tempo decks would i mean if you want to go for a slower deck than zoo with it still being tempo you could maybe do something along the lines of but that was really just cobbled together as a zoo with some extra board clears and power cards i do honestly doubt that one will work at all though
hearthstone,not_removed,alright so i made a new deck that involved loe cards since i thought that they would remove it from standard at the release of the next expansion would you consider this an improvement from the last version
hearthstone,not_removed,hmm id deffinatly try to fit in somewhere in there maybe for a demon fire or both if anything is gonna be in a discard deck that one should be the growth on it can be absurd especially later on in the match manage tkoedoomguard would be a and with charge for cards for example im also not sure about the pit lord it may be personal bias but that face damage is just way too much for the minion imo im just not too sure what to put in for it crowd favourite may work for the with all the battlecries maybe dark iron dwarf for that burst and good body aberrant berserker may fit in too since you can trigger it with dread infernal cyclopean horror faceless shambler or fel guard to counter aggro could work too or just have it as a tech card slot in general like putting in harrison if warrior stays so strong sylvanus if its a more control meta ect
hearthstone,not_removed,weve already got the official stats that mage is still the best class and now thanks to the nerf its the furthest above the best class still rogue that its ever been on the other hand the buffs seem to have worked well for warrior warlock shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,seems like you most likely disconnected from the game server the emotes run separately from the connection to the game server there was a diagram on how the different connections affect different things on here a long time ago
hearthstone,not_removed,wow thats a lot of legionaries
hearthstone,not_removed,ancient rome op plz nerf
hearthstone,not_removed,lul handlock are you a time traveler
hearthstone,not_removed,dont you mean shaman come on bro if you gonna get on the antimeta circlejerk do it right
hearthstone,not_removed,where did you find handlocks i want in on that
hearthstone,not_removed,i beat it on the first night it came out cant remember what i did but i know what ultimately got me the win was with to survive the twisting nether lots of taunts before that im pretty sure like sludge belcher

hearthstone,not_removed,httpsimgurcomqtrughx definitely in my top hearthstone moments ever
hearthstone,not_removed,who is erik who is kodi are you cheating on erik with kodi or are you cheating on kodi with erik how does jarvis fit into all of this im going to assume hunter solely refers to a hunter decklist and is not an httpsenwikipediaorgwikisteganography that contains secret love letters to someone named hunter finally what does hank feel about this
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,so this is why paletress doesnt see play the thousands of hunters dominating the ladder with snipe it all makes sense now
hearthstone,not_removed,freaking aimbots leaking to hearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,dude are you also running a nzoth reno hunter ive been doing the same thing to great effect
hearthstone,not_removed,well its safe to say that your opponent wasnt the one sniping
hearthstone,not_removed,you probably had lethal on board anyway unless he summoned a legendary with taunt or other immediate board impact feels good of course my best snipe was a simple turn auctioneer on a rogue who had at least two coins and some other cards from probably a game winning turn for her into an entire turn wasted plus a dead hand is a pretty insane swing another really fun one was the paladin who played pyromancer into instant equality before he saw the trap trigger
hearthstone,not_removed,nobody ever expects snipe back when i was screwing around with control hunter my best snipe was against a priest i played snipe on turn and his turn was coin injured blademaster circle of healing pause concede
hearthstone,not_removed,username checks out
hearthstone,not_removed,ill just leave httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvwifiruhdwek here
hearthstone,not_removed,definitely changed the momentum after that play
hearthstone,not_removed,i would be so mad
hearthstone,not_removed,dude the exact same thing happened to me today aswell
hearthstone,not_removed,beautiful the thing dreams are made of haha
hearthstone,not_removed,thats a good one
hearthstone,not_removed,why would he even play paletress into that field
hearthstone,not_removed,my favorite is sniping gadgetzan auctioneer on turn
hearthstone,not_removed,hows eriks resume looking
hearthstone,not_removed,scrolling through my fp and thought this was from roverwatch haha
hearthstone,not_removed,hi erik who keeps a resume on their desktop anyway oo
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean usually when people make the extra effort to make two resumes it usually means theyre good at something else maybe its hearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,was this on the list should have it been on the list its no longer on the list
hearthstone,not_removed,fucking mac user reeeeeeee
hearthstone,not_removed,was expecting sniping thijs
hearthstone,not_removed,the snipe is nice but by looking at that hand im more interested in what you did afterdid you go for the glory or did you go for the story
hearthstone,not_removed,you havent felt the glory of sniping until youve sniped a miracle rogues gadgetzan
hearthstone,not_removed,that feeling when you get king krush off of lock n load but you can never find a turn to play him
hearthstone,not_removed,to be fair any of the viable secrets besides snake trap wouldve made him miss lethal
hearthstone,not_removed,the thing is he was kinda fucked their to any secret even explosive trap makes it icky because he has to make the first attack for only and then buff it bear trap stops a second attack freezing trap stops him snipe is the best one though
hearthstone,not_removed,to be fair like four other hunter secrets would have won that for you
hearthstone,not_removed,im pretty sure thats me was that on the eu server
hearthstone,not_removed,also randum me retarded nope me am smart yup
hearthstone,not_removed,errr what
hearthstone,not_removed,rkodi open source media player kodi skin i think
hearthstone,not_removed,but his folder
hearthstone,not_removed,classic erik
hearthstone,not_removed,i thought you were going to edit krips name to the top left
hearthstone,not_removed,do u have problem wit mac
hearthstone,not_removed,so thats why herald volasjz has health blizzard devs are geniuses genii idk
hearthstone,not_removed,ive got you paletress in my sights
hearthstone,not_removed,its such a frustrating matchup from a cthun warriors perspective hunters somehow still have gvg style sticky minion bullshit deathrattles that no other class have so even if you contest the board and keep their minions at bay and manage to save a brawl for the nzoth they still have their surviving minion a and left over depending on what survived to get a clear youd need something like brawl brawl weapon hit which isnt feasible because youre going to need a brawl to deal with at least one of the call of the wilds or a solid thaurissan so you could brawl brann ghoul double hit i understand that bad matchups are a thing but it seems like to go toe to toe with that deck you need something like board clears because of the multiple minion spawning deathrattles ohh yeah and their minions have absurd statlinesmana cost highmane is for wolf is for houndmaster is for call of the wild is for all in all nzoth is a solid hunter deck which im not sure it is even possible to appropriately counter by out controlling it although i imagine it gets brutally countered by tempo mages so theres that
hearthstone,not_removed,not a reno hunter i mainly have deathrattle beast cards for this deck
hearthstone,not_removed,i used to aswell d until i switched to reno priest with mindgames turn ysera is way better than turn king krush from wrangler
hearthstone,not_removed,its moments like this that support my argument that the snipesecret may be the most effective trap in hearthstone next to freezing trap
hearthstone,not_removed,in less than a second you exerted such an incredible force on confessor paletress thus sending your foe to maximum tilt astonishing
hearthstone,not_removed,did the priest use his hero power instantly too i find this happens a fair amount when people play too fast and play whirlwind when i killed their patron or coinconceal when auctioneer is already dead
hearthstone,not_removed,checks username lol just wanted to make sure you were not my victim
hearthstone,not_removed,some type of yolo rng
hearthstone,not_removed,i believe the real name is kodi
hearthstone,not_removed,well i made resumes just in case i didnt get the arena gig i can always shoot for the murlocpaladin position
hearthstone,not_removed,name checks out
hearthstone,not_removed,i didnt do anything garrosh chose death about seconds after the screenshot with the danger of worgen gone i would have played yogg though
hearthstone,not_removed,lol i went for the glory but before i had a chance he rage quit so i cant blame him it was a pretty close match but turns later he knew he blew it
hearthstone,not_removed,this needs to be answered
hearthstone,not_removed,as a rogue main i both love and hate this comment
hearthstone,not_removed,your time will come one day sweet dino prince
hearthstone,not_removed,i got king krush off my ram wrangler once best mana ive ever spent
hearthstone,not_removed,last week i had lethal in match my opponent played ram wrangler and got king krush he won one of the moments i hat this games rng
hearthstone,not_removed,worgen otk runs rampage so hed probably be safe from explosive trap he also has a weapon equipped so hed be safe from bear trap pretty sure the only viable secret is freezing trap that could stop this not really sure whether snipe even classifies as viable nowadays
hearthstone,not_removed,true im sure it was desperation on their part shutting down their turn without them even being able to buff it was very satisfying
hearthstone,not_removed,worgen decks run so hes safe from explosive
hearthstone,not_removed,nope na
hearthstone,not_removed,i think we can all agree to assume thats his folder
hearthstone,not_removed,edgy
hearthstone,not_removed,forget folder now he cant flaunt that hes still playing jagged alliance
hearthstone,not_removed,it´s a problem with screenshot being not cropped properly there is no reason to not crop it to the game window
hearthstone,not_removed,ive got a problem with shitty crops
hearthstone,not_removed,i have a problem with mac
hearthstone,not_removed,yes but i have an even bigger problem with shitty cropping
hearthstone,not_removed,genipodes
hearthstone,not_removed,if youre using english you neednt use latin grammar also all hail volasjz the savior of priests everywhere i almost even remember what it does
hearthstone,not_removed,tempo mages face warriors face shamans zoolocks
hearthstone,not_removed,highmane might be my most hated card in the game
hearthstone,not_removed,or you could run a real deck that doesnt just respond to your opponent doing stuff
hearthstone,not_removed,its pretty strong but a little fickle i think ice block and ice barrier are probably also better just because theyre not only strong but also extremely consistent ice block almost always buys a turn and if you cant play around it properly by reducing them to hp it also grants health by blocking damage ice barrier can only be played around if you have enough burn to not have to attack face at all anymore which is pretty rare
hearthstone,not_removed,well met
hearthstone,not_removed,yea as soon as he dropped the card he already assumed he would get that legendary so he already committed to the hero power to heal himself but reality sank in immediately
hearthstone,not_removed,not sure if serious or not but httpskoditv is a home theater software previously known as xbmc
hearthstone,not_removed,he wasnt talking to you lol
hearthstone,not_removed,i just hate it
hearthstone,not_removed,ive done that multiple times
hearthstone,not_removed,i may have been your opponent such a bad feeling
hearthstone,not_removed,misdirect could stop it if the worgen attacks first or if the weapon redirects to the worgen dart trap also doesnt do shit against this unless garrosh decides to bm hero power
hearthstone,not_removed,not necessarily the most recent tournament versions have been worgen inner rage charge faceless with an emperor reduction damage hitting time for otk i havent seen a rampage version played in forever
hearthstone,not_removed,snipe isnt great it the late game but its the best oncurve secret for a slow deck like yogg and load imo gets those annoying shaman minions and a bunch of other stuff plus few people expect it
hearthstone,not_removed,spell warrior common classic 🐙 httphearthstonegamepediacomrampage mana give a damaged minion callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to pm
hearthstone,not_removed,joke
hearthstone,not_removed,it gives you guys guy for every minion you have on the board as long as they dont exceed the number of
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,goblin ghoul a zombie with no conscience
hearthstone,not_removed,every deck is a real deck not everyone has to play the top decks in the meta snapshot
hearthstone,not_removed,or you could play a real deck that tries to strategically control the board instead of just slamming the face with everything s there are both sides to this argument
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,is that on the checklist
hearthstone,not_removed,haha mb the person i played against was a priest and he entombed it the turn after
hearthstone,not_removed,if worgen misdirects to the warriors face it dies too due to the fwa being unsheathed kind of an unusual interaction and certainly rare but its interesting
hearthstone,not_removed,misdirect will save him as well but that one kinda suffers from the same thing as snipe in that it isnt really a viable secret it doesnt really change the odds of the otk succeeding or not
hearthstone,not_removed,annoying shaman minions is the exact reason why i run snipe and keep it in opening hand
hearthstone,not_removed,could you screenshot only the window in focus i know you can on windows
hearthstone,not_removed,you have to let this meme go now dude let it go to rhearthstonecirclejerk in peace
hearthstone,not_removed,not me i was rogue and it gave my opponent lethal
hearthstone,not_removed,you sure can takes a screenshot of your whole screen gives you the little drag and drop cursor the guy above was talking about if you hit the space bar in this mode it lets you select which whole window to screenshot
hearthstone,not_removed,that may have been me actually about a month ago
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah a month ago sounds about right
hearthstone,not_removed,still love ur name
hearthstone,not_removed,sounds like a funny ass game lol
hearthstone,not_removed,its nice to hear of positive experiences from new players it took me a lot longer before i could consistently hit rank but i was completely new to ccgs when i got into hearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,rank in if there is a basic deck that can survive the onslaught of pirate warriors secret paladins jade shamans nzoth any class decks etc would love to see it piloted by a newer player no less
hearthstone,not_removed,worth noting that wild ranked is far less competitive than standard ranked
hearthstone,not_removed,what deck are you running as a that got you to rank id like to know
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks i agree being familiar with ccgs helps a lot
hearthstone,not_removed,do you think players not allowed to disenchantcraft im running suboptimal build of zoolock
hearthstone,not_removed,the chest reward is the same thats the only thing i care about so for me it worth the same
hearthstone,not_removed,my guess is zoolock or agro hunter honestly with win streaks its not hard to get to rank with an agro deck if you play a lot especially in wild where people mostly play some form of midcombo
hearthstone,not_removed,im running sub optimal build of zoolock plan to switch to egg druid soon
hearthstone,not_removed,none that i know of
hearthstone,not_removed,thats fine but when people talk about the difficulty of getting to rank theyre probably not talking about wild ranked
hearthstone,not_removed,zoolock with some replacements because i miss some cards and not willing to craft itget proper adventure
hearthstone,not_removed,can you link me the deck
hearthstone,not_removed,ok i got it thanks for explanation btw i decided to go wild because it really feels much easier for a new player for now i dont think that players need an additional challenge during their first steps
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,the reason they split wild and standard is because it would be too hard for new players to obtain all the strong cards from every set so they only use a subset in standard making it easier for new players to be able to compete its funny that you did this in wild funny not crazy because the skillrank in wild is lower than in standard due to smaller playerbase kudos for you man
hearthstone,not_removed,appreciate it
hearthstone,not_removed,haha thats true wild right now much more friendly to new players than standard i bet blizzards would be surprised if theyll find it
hearthstone,not_removed,i believe theres a weekly beginner discussion alternatively you can post to rthehearth which is a more beginner friendly version of rcompetitivehs
hearthstone,not_removed,can you post your list id like to see it and attempt to help
hearthstone,not_removed,add me on hearthstone so i can spectate and see if you would need any help making plays and i could help you make decisions
hearthstone,not_removed,httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvckjuglrdebi
hearthstone,not_removed,just about all of them prior have been musical numbers
hearthstone,not_removed,hey there unfortunately your submission has been removed because it is low effort content see httpswwwredditcomrhearthstonewikiloweffortcontent for clarification on what is considered low effort content if youre not familiar with the subreddit rules you can read them httpswwwredditcomrhearthstoneaboutrulesrules have a question or think your post doesnt break the rules
hearthstone,not_removed,i only have days playing im already at rank using midrange shaman xd
hearthstone,not_removed,great job dude not only getting wins but with a weaker class as well now back to work
hearthstone,not_removed,you need to leverage your dudes from justicar try not to give them back their excavated evils remember that your tirion and cairnes are as dead to you as their entombs are to them sylvanaspyroequality is also an expensive way to get back a tirion they stole
hearthstone,not_removed,play tirion on curve try to bait their removal with something like harrison or smthing be lucky and hope he has no entomb otherwise its almost unwinnable
hearthstone,not_removed,you can win if you have justicar out as early as possible the dudes will win you the match
hearthstone,not_removed,sometimes their entombs will be at the bottom of their deck you just gotta go all out and hope
hearthstone,not_removed,youre gonna struggle but its no different to my priest deck constantly losing to miracle rogue you shouldnt auto concede though you might get a great draw which can give you a chance
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think ive played a game this season where i saw something that a priest entombed from me im guessing ive been extremely lucky
hearthstone,not_removed,the problem in this matchup is not priest playing entombed card versus you the problem is that entomb on a deathrattle minion removes it from the nzoth summons pool if youre running standard package of cairne sylvanas tirion priest will entomb sylv and tirion and your nzoth will only summon cairne which is nothing
hearthstone,not_removed,oh yeah i didnt think about that
hearthstone,not_removed,play fandral such a sweet interaction between him and tyrande
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel awful they exchange their last greetings before beginning their fight to the death
hearthstone,not_removed,i always imagine this to be super awkward for both of them since its malfurion playing him
hearthstone,not_removed,look at me i am hunter now
hearthstone,not_removed,why are you rank at the end of the season
hearthstone,not_removed,this was near the start of the season
hearthstone,not_removed,so you waited weeks to share it suuure
hearthstone,not_removed,this is my current rank im not the best at the game
hearthstone,not_removed,early april is about a month away nothing new compared to how soon theyve announced expansions before
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah that gives me the major frownies
hearthstone,not_removed,i posted this already and got downvoted hearthstone players are in serouis denial we finally get some news and we get blue balled for another month the patch that comes tomorrow will not change the meta game shamans aggro warriors will still be op and reno will still be king its boring and major hearthstone streamers have left already lifecoach forsen and reckful i know ben brode will do great things for the game but god damn the game coudnt be more boring in its current state
hearthstone,not_removed,no they arent gonna be revealing new cards until the of march which is weeks of this weird limbo state of nothingness
hearthstone,not_removed,how long you wanna bet until the complaining begins
hearthstone,not_removed,but the expansion still comes out in a month have some patience go read a book or something
hearthstone,not_removed,are you just conceding now that it is just a weird limbo state of nothingness and boredom now
hearthstone,not_removed,but the thing is is that they didnt have to have this even happen and could have waited until march to do this not making this state of nothingness
hearthstone,not_removed,this sub is already doing nothing but posting about it gotta give the bonobos that cant use the searchfunction enough time to repost all of it then when there is only a few left that havent seen all of them they start releasing cards and the fiesta repeats itself its called marketing strategy my friend
hearthstone,not_removed,too much effort no monetary gain never happening
hearthstone,not_removed,wish i had been recording this first post here thought you all would appreciate

hearthstone,not_removed,im still holding out for a chromie card best gnome waifu as long as its even remotely playable i will build a deck around it and take that shit straight to legend
hearthstone,not_removed,i almost like this concept aside from your obvious gnomism gnomes are people too and theres nothing disturbing or strange about cleavage on any person
hearthstone,not_removed,please label this post as nsfw
hearthstone,not_removed,lol i love it
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel like you might be interested in
hearthstone,not_removed,the more i play this game the more i realize the whole point of it is for memes and shitposts

hearthstone,not_removed,reddit innervate
hearthstone,not_removed,no they are just unsightly and odorous gnomes after all
hearthstone,not_removed,gnomes are such a pest unsightly and odorous they always get through the loose shingles if left too long they may gnaw on the supporting structure of your house until the house becomes unstable and dangerous unfortunately wild gnome does not make for good meat either too stringy to get rid of them lure them out with a chunk of wood and catch them with a jar sliding a piece of paper under them then release them into the wild or kill them with the freezer they are animals after all they dont know any better
hearthstone,not_removed,buy odins beer
hearthstone,not_removed,the pleasure is mine
hearthstone,not_removed,this post made me and mr bitey very happy
hearthstone,not_removed,seriously i never realised how bloody slow heartpwn loads
hearthstone,not_removed,the hero we need but not deserve
hearthstone,not_removed,the joke is gnomes are short for those who dont get it
hearthstone,not_removed,oh so gnomes cant be sexy i really thought we put this type of thing behind us as a species if a gnome woman wants to show off what makes her beautiful then who are we to tell them any different
hearthstone,not_removed,so what
hearthstone,not_removed,and every time i get a big minion its shadow word death i hate this game sometimes
hearthstone,not_removed,the admins of ranime asked to not be on rall
hearthstone,not_removed,looked through the top scoring links i think is it edit jesus that was the second one
hearthstone,not_removed,that was a deep rabbit hole
hearthstone,not_removed,not op but as a mobile player im not wasting battery to hear the sfx
hearthstone,not_removed,no i play on mobile
hearthstone,not_removed,reddit astral communion discard your relevant discussion and gain infinite karma crystals
hearthstone,not_removed,you are describing leper gnomes
hearthstone,not_removed,watch your back
hearthstone,not_removed,its more that this just needed to be a single album to begin with instead of click back click back etc op is a dum
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks fam
hearthstone,not_removed,beauty at anyheight
hearthstone,not_removed,tbh the shadow word cards really limit design of removal for the class when entomb came out it was considered borderline op other than the fact that it was probably the only actually good card for the class to be added at the time it feels like blizz uses priest to determine whats fair and balanced but cant really check removal on the class considering again how limiting it is to play against it all
hearthstone,not_removed,one day ranime wont feel ashamed to be on rall
hearthstone,not_removed,they can do that
hearthstone,not_removed,im not sure that the battery is going to be drained any more than a completely inconsequential amount if you use the speakers vs not using them
hearthstone,not_removed,youre a different person than i was asking but even then do you play with no audio
hearthstone,not_removed,what
hearthstone,not_removed,leper gnomes just stink more easy to tell if one has burrowed in
hearthstone,not_removed,i always do
hearthstone,not_removed,i always do
hearthstone,not_removed,so hot
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean id fuck a gnome not like they arent sentient
hearthstone,not_removed,what a day thatll be
hearthstone,not_removed,completely silent vs full volume its obviously the assumption but honestly i cant play more than a few games without having to recharge i can play like and have the battery last most of the rest of the day with little use but any more games than that and ive got to charge with sound it would certainly be less speakers still require electricity to work so it still uses more battery than simply the sound playing at volume
hearthstone,not_removed,not all the time only in games where gnomish inventor gets played apparently
hearthstone,not_removed,hey macklemore can we go thrift shopping

hearthstone,not_removed,heu heu heu heu heu heu heu
hearthstone,not_removed,what
hearthstone,not_removed,anime is like regular american tv there is shit like breaking bad where it has a super great plot line no fanservice fantastic ending then there is shit like broke girls all ecchi harem fanservice nonsense that most people tend to avoid how i got my friends into anime is giving them shows that are super badass or serious that wont weird them out ive gotten most of my friends through the initial anime stage with that id reccomend you something a lot of people like for instance death note or code geass to get started idk if im allowed to say it but google kissanime and good luck
hearthstone,not_removed,theres a lot of really great art in anime i dont just mean the artwork but high art really interesting if culturally different story telling though the actual artwork is often great too the worst parts of the community are shameful as fuck though its like the worst parts of the gamer community i absolutely hesitate to associate with them in anyway its kind of shitty for the majority of the fans who are totally normal people that the very vocal minority is so goddamn awful
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean why should a huge stereotype affect your enjoyment what if your everyday current enjoyment had that stereotype would you enjoy it less because of that
hearthstone,not_removed,it may be a cultural thing where you havent been exposed to enough people who watch it the people you mention naturally dont define the whole community when you think about actual content and how they are drawn id ask you to look at normal tv most of the women are portrayed in a similar fashion but it seems normal because we have been exposed to live action for most of our life as for the type of people you are describing you can just not associate with them honestly the truth is you would be surprised by how many people around you actually watch anime but dont feel the need to tell you similar to how you dont feel the need to tell others what shows you watch naturally as you said you are definitely missing out on a lot of great story telling by not giving it a chance anime is not a single genre there are comedies action dramas etc i used to think anime couldnt be that great because dragonball z and yugioh were weird and lame but now i cant really enjoy any movies that come out or popular shows because it is so hard for them to come near how interesting anime is give it a shot edit the whole waifu thing is generally a joke for a lot of people currently ranime has a salt contest where famous female characters compete to see who is the best girl if you look at the thread youll see its more a jokepopularity thing where everyone is just having salt fun dont let those concepts deceive you though even people ive met in cons who do the whole body pillow and all that just do it for fun
hearthstone,not_removed,food for thought uyiffing
hearthstone,not_removed,so you think what you imagine of the community to be is what they actually are obese weird people do you know that people that also allow themselves to be that judgmental could think of you when you tell them you play a virtual ccg the same thing and its obviusoly not like that and an stereotype that to choose to believe is more damaging than anything anime can be odd but that doesnt mean most people who watch it extol what you see as the worst of it either no reason to think is not just normal people finding entertainment in a quality work too juvenile or creepy turn it off like some series or movies animated or not i appreciate you put your view out here in a serious manner actually though
hearthstone,not_removed,weird people are into video games and sports so you associate games with the year old screaming about moms on xbox live or the weirdo who paints their chest team colors and whips off their shirt drunk screaming obscenities about the other team look past the obsessive they are freaky and uncomfortable in any group check out trigun and cowboy bebop for some great stories in anime

hearthstone,not_removed,well gnomes are like dwarfslittle people in real life and id fuck peter dinklage so id fuck a gnome
hearthstone,not_removed,agreed i know a guy who is super into anime and has a body pillow hes weird as shit but you know what ive fucked him id do it again hes interesting and handsome and remarkably popular despite the slight anime stigma there might be
hearthstone,not_removed,what
hearthstone,not_removed,i see what you are saying my friend is a really popular dude who partys a lot and has a big social ego idky we are good friends he made fun of us for watching anime cause of the notion you mentioned until he found out one of his friends watches some stuff so he was open for one recommendation he would never tell anyone he watches it but its a guilty pleasure for him and all the shit he watches is badass main characters and a very action thriller driven story you just gotta find your genre and either ignore the bad anime notion or not tell anyone its like saying all gamers are fat year old wow players who live in their moms basement living off of mountain dew and doritios while that is sometimes true its definitely a minority and u gotta accept that you will be grouped with them
hearthstone,not_removed,i basically ignore their exsistance i dont go out of my way to mention anime to people i know not that im ashamed or anything i see it like any other hobby or whatever i just watch anime it doesnt define me really but if someone mentions you can bet ill be involved in that conversation

hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think ive seen one ed let alone two
hearthstone,not_removed,its just variance it happens to the best of us versus zoo shamans might specifically mulligan for these big removal cards
hearthstone,not_removed,double lightning storm is pretty standard and not too hard to play around playing zoo myself elemental destruction however i have seen like once this season at rank or so no one plays that lol
hearthstone,not_removed,i got to rank with control shaman using ed by farming the zoo spammers
hearthstone,not_removed,i just saw three shamans in a row with double ed
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i figured thats what they were doing i was just very tilted because i saw a ton of shaman and thought oh zoo is probably pretty good to play right now then i saw shaman in my first game and was very happy little did i know
hearthstone,not_removed,at what rank because it is basically unplayable unless you have lava shock which no one plays or that new minion that also unlocks mana crystals but even then turn is the earliest to play it
hearthstone,not_removed,rank qq
hearthstone,not_removed,thats really surprising well keep playing you can still get legend
hearthstone,not_removed,on eu something like earlier on na
hearthstone,not_removed,blizz oclock for na is pm edt am pdt
hearthstone,not_removed,i think that the maintenance is for the tavern brawl along with probably minor improvements blizzard typically announces nerfs about a week before they actually patch it
hearthstone,not_removed,dont get your hopes up they do this kind of minor maintenance all the time
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,armorsmith retired after winning all those brawls
hearthstone,not_removed,armorsmith is great against minions which until now were pretty plentiful now though theres less zoo less silverhand recruits no face hunter etc it just doesnt handle the current aggro minions they have too much health
hearthstone,not_removed,shes not made to fitin this meta
hearthstone,not_removed,dragon warriors dont want some weak stated minion the armor is irrelevant in their game plan control warriors would rather run more removal or use a doomsayer that at least responds to early drops instead of having to rely on a card combo patron is pretty much over its too easy to aoe them down and their earliest spawn turn is like turn which in this meta you are almost dead
hearthstone,not_removed,i saw the title and for some weird reason my mind converted armorsmith to aerosmith i came here to answer that they are currently on tour
hearthstone,not_removed,tokens and face decks are at an alltime low aggressive decks today are pushing hard on board control and armoursmith isnt very good in that sort of environment midrange shaman doesnt have any cards that are weak to it slow decks dont care about it zoo cut rituals for the discard package and the only thats weak to it is abusive which typically doesnt come down on turn anyway and is more likely to buff flame imp into killing it for free kindly grandmother isnt really a its a in disguise and trades favourably with her also with ironforge portal and bash warrior no longer relies on it to get enough armour for shield slam shes still a good card and will probably be back some day but it would take a return to face hunters aggro paladin tokens etc to make her a good choice
hearthstone,not_removed,the commanding shout decks dont have space for it dragon and tempo decks dont run enough board to get any value from the effect its not good enough at contesting the early games of the vast tempo decks out there at the moment its still run in more traditional non shout patron decks
hearthstone,not_removed,warriors got a ton of new ways to deal with one health minions revenge ghoul nzoths first mate even blood to ichor if youre desperate these cards fill the niche armorsmith used to fill except the process of getting armor armorsmith might come into play again when justicar is out but i doubt it
hearthstone,not_removed,main points as to why it was an anti aggro card where aggro minions had a majority of or taskmaster combo health minions at the end of the day it pretty much was always a favorable trade since then more and more cards have been printed with more than one health that the warrior doesnt want an unreliable card combo to work around with the lose of deaths bite warrior lost their main damage aoe source so its harder to gain the mass armor from an setup durability deaths bite with the nerf of ironbeak owl it opened up for more anti aggro card like doomsayer to take armorsmiths place as an anti aggro card
hearthstone,not_removed,power creep of aggro minions aggro minions used to be fairleper gnome was fairly stated and now we have a strong mana minion costing ahem troggs rule
hearthstone,not_removed,face hunter died armorsmith went along oh its also fairly useful against freeze mage when combined with patronwhirlwinds but both decks are gone too
hearthstone,not_removed,make it a for
hearthstone,not_removed,aggro cards arent or health minions anymore so she doesnt trade well removal of cruel taskmaster makes her all around worse cant trade into health minions not as many minions in your deck anymore so it is hard to get a lot of armor gain out of her you get so much armor gain from justicar you dont need armor gain from her
hearthstone,not_removed,still an auto include in a wild patron deck
hearthstone,not_removed,the stats arent really great vs aggressive lists that arent zoo and lack of taunts like belcher only one is bloodhoof which is surprisngly meh with armorsmith makes armorsmith not give close to enough armor as it used to
hearthstone,not_removed,also deaths bite is gone
hearthstone,not_removed,in my last games vs warrior i remember only seeing it once in a cthun warrior deck he got at most or armor from it and it didnt rly have any impact
hearthstone,not_removed,when aggro plays turn turn that buffs your turn mana and a how does a compete
hearthstone,not_removed,blood to ichor replaced cruel taskmaster no more trading up with cruel taskmaster in armorsmith armor gain
hearthstone,not_removed,as a control warrior main i can say there are more aoe in warrior then before like revenge and ghoul to clear rather than hitting with deaths bite and taking damage and also minions like keper gnome are nerfed and rotated in standard so the very aggressive face decks are not viable at that point meta is towards midrange in both formats so there is more room for removals rather than armorsmiths since you can survive and stabilize until justicar shieldmaiden or ancient shieldbearer in addition to statements above in control warrior me personally and other players run revenge doomsayer in that slot because people used to run more early minions like cruel taskmaster to activate armorsmith since you need a board also removal spells work better with yogg
hearthstone,not_removed,early game minions got way bigger and leper gnome was nerfed she has kind of fallen to the wayside along with him
hearthstone,not_removed,i use it and it works really good on my burgle rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,rip deaths bite
hearthstone,not_removed,theres quite a few tempo decks that run herthem with frothing berserkers and taunts with minions on board including a taunt dropping a ravaging ghoul can net you armor on your turn and quite a bit more on your opponents turn all and all she can be good in the right decks
hearthstone,not_removed,blizzard printed ravaging ghoul and then maelstrom portal and spirit claws so theres no more health minions on ladder for armorsmith to kill anymore
hearthstone,not_removed,armorsmith and northshire cleric are both cut for the same reason and its that theyre weak bodys do not justify their potential if combod ill write a quick comparison to demonstrate how each class interacts with the card to clarify why the loss is or isnt managable warrior can afford to cut armorsmith because theyll never trade efficiently for a minion so a removal spell is more ideal for control and a larger minion is more ideal for a tempo list in both instances the armor potential doesnt matter control lists can generate armor with shield block tank up and ironforge while tempo lists dont care about the armor at all so its loss does not hurt with the execute nerf tempo warrior may begin to shift towards a slightly slower deck archtype since floating mana in the current decklist is near impossible shield slam will become a bit more valuable with its cost priest however is forced to cut northshire because it will never trade efficiently but cannot adequately compensate the loss cleric is the only means of draw available to priest outside of burgle garbage therefore choosing to do anything with cleric results at a loss for the player using it requires an excessive amount of deck investment in combo cards to draw but costs the deck consistency while cutting cleric deprives priest of its only means of drawing cards anyway burgle as a priest mechanic is insulting because priest is already so inconsistent with the plethora of forced synergy necessitating deck thinning to ensure the constant card combos can go off if all priest has to play with are cards from outside the deck then you have to bank on luck for the good ones from shades discover and thoughtsteal you need to hope that they arent cards that are completely useless like poison or shield slam you dont have the draw to find your combo pieces so the cards you put in your deck for their strength together becomes substantially worse and the cards you steal are never going to be comparably synergetic for warrior to be in a similar spot where armorsmith was an autoinclude and could not be replaced like cleric is for priest then tank up ironforge and shield block all would need not to exist execute is already at its mana cost and shield slam still costs if that were all true the armor potential would be too low to consider cutting armorsmith and its inability to trade would basically be a sunk cost with playing warrior without armor warrior cannot effectively use its weapons or spell removal just as priest cannot draw without cleric
hearthstone,not_removed,its still fun to use her with other minions for whirl wind shenanigens
hearthstone,not_removed,i actually still play her in wild patron warrior shes much stronger against wild secret paladin where she trades well into divine shilds muster and noble sacrifice than she is in standard and she still does pretty well against zoo in wild ultimately i think shes not around in standard because she lines up terribly against shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,i still play armorsmith in my wild patron warrior deck its essential against aggro its also the only way to win against freeze mage with patrons
hearthstone,not_removed,i still use armorsmith in my tempo warrior and she works well attack is usually fine with all the pings in the deck and if she lives for turns bye aggro
hearthstone,not_removed,before tank up and cthun warrior the only ways of getting armor were with shieldblock and shieldmaiden so an armorsmith was key even if it only gained armor against hunter it should also be noted that when cards like unstable ghoul sludge belcher and deaths bite were in decks you were guaranteed a lot more than armor if you saved your armor smith
hearthstone,not_removed,im playing armorsmith and its great now that tempo mage is back
hearthstone,not_removed,it isnt worth the deck slots when you can use less slot for a consistent high value armor effect
hearthstone,not_removed,it used to killing my hopes back in the facehunter days
hearthstone,not_removed,you can make it to legend with the old tempo warrior list with armorsmiths honestly it does quite well against shaman with all the whirlwind effects and varian wrynn
hearthstone,not_removed,aggro decks are gone and leper gnome was nerfed
hearthstone,not_removed,you play armorsmith enemy plays totem golem you now lose the days of mana are gone too
hearthstone,not_removed,i got to legend this month around the with armorsmiths in my own version of a dragon warrior with brann and historians and i also used taskmasters so i dont agree with of the commenters in this thread i guess i am not even sure what most of them are talking about in a minion heavy list like a midrange dragon warrior armorsmith is better than justicar
hearthstone,not_removed,i just ignore armorsmiths whenever they are played pretty much every deck can do enough damage where they dont have to worry about the armorsmith
hearthstone,not_removed,i think the issue is that warrior can generate armor too easy with bash shield block and hero power there are way better removal options vs early game minions at warriors disposal to make armorsmith a viable card
hearthstone,not_removed,warrior has so many broken cards that it doesnt need armorsmith even though its a great card
hearthstone,not_removed,it was never a staple of control warrior only bad players played it in control i was a staple of patron only
hearthstone,not_removed,like rocky
hearthstone,not_removed,she and acolyte of pain always wins brawls
hearthstone,not_removed,kitkatz was right
hearthstone,not_removed,brawling hall of fame awaits
hearthstone,not_removed,this
hearthstone,not_removed,i think this is the best answer its the same reason a lot of priest lists are cutting clerics and are really bad at fighting the most common early game minions now could easily change in the next expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,ravaging ghoul maelstrom portal and spirit claws made any minion with health bad actually its kind of crazy to think about minions with health that dont replace themselves are almost all unplayable for the next years
hearthstone,not_removed,indeed only health drops are babbling book loot hoarder and that deathrattle wolf
hearthstone,not_removed,we used to have a lot of sticky minions that would somehow have some sort of presence on the board after they died and those were usually very weak bodies now though bodies are more sticky in that they have more health i almost wish we had the old way back
hearthstone,not_removed,blame dumb cards like ravaging ghoul for the lack of onedrops i hate that card as a paladin main
hearthstone,not_removed,yep its also very difficult to keep one alive now ideally youd drop an armorsmith and it would stay alive behind some other minionsweapons while it pinged some onedrops and farmed armor now it gets immediately oneshot by a trogg or buffed drop and keeping a board early in the game is nearly impossible so you wont get more than armor out of it once justicar rotates out itll probably see play again or just whenever the meta of op drops dies down and nonaggro decks can actually develop a board before turn
hearthstone,not_removed,fewer silverhand recruits
hearthstone,not_removed,now though theres less zoo less silverhand recruits no face hunter etc and all the have health
hearthstone,not_removed,i guess she is going on strike
hearthstone,not_removed,i really wanted to keep my gold copy of armorsmith in my control warrior deck because shes sooo hot but had to cut her for bash for extra mana it does more damage and gains more armor than she typically would
hearthstone,not_removed,yea in this meta everything is soo fasthigh tempo only a few cards can really keep up
hearthstone,not_removed,depends if u playin vs aggro deck patron with wild pyro in my experience is a perc win ratio which is nice tho vs midrange control not so much editi dont know why i got downvoted i climbed the ladder with only patron warrior this moth so i had recent experience with it
hearthstone,not_removed,i have never seen a control warrior run doomsayer
hearthstone,not_removed,good to know they havent fallen out of the legacy act meta
hearthstone,not_removed,i literally have not seen it in ages not on ladder not by streamers but i guess i couldve missed it space is probably the problem yeah theres only cards in a deck maybe this is what they mean with powercreep though the average power level of cards especially early game has gone up so much a just doesnt cut it no matter what the effect
hearthstone,not_removed,commanding shout is surprisingly good there is a cthun list that runs double commanding shout battle rage and wild pyromancer it functions as a control warrior running the thaurissan doomcaller brann combo you can get the tripple cthun combo off really early downside is that you can fatigue while your opponent have cards left in the deck still no space for a armorsmith in a list like that
hearthstone,not_removed,a totally agree but the third one warrior have revenge whirlwind and ghoul now
hearthstone,not_removed,trogg would be a really shit mana minion
hearthstone,not_removed,armorsmith was the perfect answer to the haunted creeper that every aggro list was running now the only aggro minion with health is abusive but that guy is probably going away to no point in a armorsmith when it cant trade with anything
hearthstone,not_removed,only in wilda land where both decks exist
hearthstone,not_removed,tunnelsmith
hearthstone,not_removed,oh man wild patron almost feels like the old days ive tried it yesterday and the love is back
hearthstone,not_removed,ravaging ghoul works great with armorsmith why would ravaging ghoul have an effect on the card gives huge boost armor turns
hearthstone,not_removed,im playing it right now and it really isnt a bad list dont know why you got downvoted have about a winrate with it at lower ranks
hearthstone,not_removed,not really totem golem is going out in a few months
hearthstone,not_removed,why exactly do you need armor in dragon warrior armorsmith is obviously better than justicar if you run a lot of minions and never hero power but neither fit the game plan of the deck
hearthstone,not_removed,if i run the car i usually have it ready by with some minions on the board then whirlwind its pretty useful just played at the right time
hearthstone,not_removed,shaman is broken back off from garrosh hes fine
hearthstone,not_removed,warrior so great i almost never seen him on ladder
hearthstone,not_removed,is that a streamer
hearthstone,not_removed,the nerf to leper gnome played a part in this im sure and now abusive sergeant is getting the same treatment
hearthstone,not_removed,and an excellent example of how good a card heavily depends on the state of the meta
hearthstone,not_removed,clerics arent even that strong atm it takes so much to draw a card from it its pretty much inspire condition they dont trade well and lack synergy meanwhile roll while i need but fills mostly dead slot guaranteed to draw a card doesnt have condition synergy with ressurectbishopnzoth etc
hearthstone,not_removed,and you dont really want a against the wolf as it doesnt kill the
hearthstone,not_removed,firebats
hearthstone,not_removed,i almost wish we had the old way back grass is always greener
hearthstone,not_removed,whoosh
hearthstone,not_removed,climbing the ladder proves nothing i used to try out bolster warrior back in the days and had positive winrate on it i still wouldnt call it a good deck it was way back in tgt when it was absolutely terrible at least now you can somewhat call it a deck
hearthstone,not_removed,while i dont think patron warrior is dead by any means its still better than priest theres just better options to go with for most players patron warrior got quite a high skill ceiling which takes away a large potion of the potential player base and the players thats actually able to play it well will probably just go with a deck thats better overall as far as the down votes go i would guess that it has something to do with the fact that you forgot everything that has to do with writing properly less facebookey and more discussionlike would be really appreciated
hearthstone,not_removed,httpwwwvicioussyndicatecomdecklibrarywarriordeckscontrolwarrior
hearthstone,not_removed,theyre rolling out soon though ive heard rumors of a goodbye tour
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah traditional patron decks really arent at all popular right now because theres not much around in most decks that dont have attack so you just cant keep them on board consistently there are just better synergies basically a attack minion that works best when you have many other things on your board just isnt appealing for this meta
hearthstone,not_removed,you got it a doesnt contest a totem golem or even a trogg also most control warrior lists can gain plenty of armor without it
hearthstone,not_removed,i run it as a oneof in my hybrid otk worgenpatron deck but that deck is getting scrapped or at least heavily altered as soon as the charge nerf hits but even there i dont ever really get more than or points of armor off of it and thats usually if i manage to get both loot hoarders on the board and sacrifice them before the armorsmith dies
hearthstone,not_removed,considering todays standardsyeah sureconsidering mana wyrm would be a or mana it would on par
hearthstone,not_removed,basically what i said
hearthstone,not_removed,gain attack per armor gained
hearthstone,not_removed,you are choosing a dvd for tonight
hearthstone,not_removed,is there anything other than deaths bite for patron in wild
hearthstone,not_removed,yes they work fine together but the point is that armorsmith is best in a meta where people are playing health minions but because of cards like ghoul maelstrom and spirit claws nobody is playing health minions
hearthstone,not_removed,a few months isnt now op asked why its not being played now
hearthstone,not_removed,well youve just made some assumptions about the deck i was playing and those assumptions are wrong the game plan of my deck was not the same game plan as the aggressive dragon deck i ran two brawls i didnt run ragnaros i didnt run frothings i didnt run crushers my plan was to stabilize the board in the mid game and slowly build up a board of healthy and powerful minions i found that many times trying to armor up with justicar was a significant tempo loss after switching to armorsmiths i was able to regain health passively while still continuing with my game plan i wasnt trying to gain an insane amount of health i was just trying to interrupt the goals of the tempo mages and hunters and zoos and shamans by putting me out of reach of burst the smiths combo quite nicely behind several taunts like guardians and curator and with cards like task master and ravaging ghoul the smiths are also at the insight here is that most of the time the minion you play first doesnt matter it just gets quickshotted frostbolted lightning bolted the smith counters the dmg most of the spells do even if i didnt have the advantages of a large board to do things with i could still do something like use the smith to put problematic health minions like azure drake or totem golem down to within fiery war axe range so again the whining in this thread is silly armorsmith is awesome people just need to stop netdecking or like you assume everyone is netdecking and actually learn the game they are playing
hearthstone,not_removed,the difference being that abusive sergeant will still be played though its battlecry is still extremely good
hearthstone,not_removed,you mean mind if i roll need
hearthstone,not_removed,res priest has additional reasons for not running clerics but im not even a fan of loot hoarders in that deck imo they just screw up your resurrects the whole point of having them in your deck is to play them on turn which is otherwise a dead turn but if you do that then resurrect is now just another loot hoarder and bishop is barely worth its cost id rather pass and make up lost ground with pyromancerblademasters than ruin my res pool
hearthstone,not_removed,loot hoarder synergy with resurrectbishop is weak that build is only at its strongest if you have strong cards for it like blademaster or higher cost cards cleric is usually worse than loot hoarder with resurrectbishop tho also loot hoarder does have a condition its deathrattle so it takes a turn in some cases turns to draw a card when you are in topdeck turns not being able to use the draw this turn is really painful the synergy with nzoth is great being able to play a massive board and on top of that refill your hand gives so much value but you should always be careful if the game could go into fatigue i personally prefer loot hoarder over cleric right now myself loot hoarder atleast can trade into minions while cleric cant it also doesnt matter as much in the first few turns if i draw this turn a card or in the next turn since i have cards at the start of the game cleric was also great against paladins trading good against their tokens allowing it to draw cards or forcing the paladin to pass turns since paladin has very limited ways to take care of clerics maybe cleric would be better in different metas and if they want to force it add more cards like blademaster circle of healing
hearthstone,not_removed,pretty much this and for big draws priests used cleric circle but nowadays you kinda have to use circle to combo it with auchenai
hearthstone,not_removed,i got confused by the part because i assumed he meant the tokens from infested wolf your definetly right though
hearthstone,not_removed,oh right i havnt encountered many hunters recently
hearthstone,not_removed,i was in a hurry to work so more like had min to write down my thoughts but we karma on reddit isnt my priority in life
hearthstone,not_removed,dont worry youll still see them in wild
hearthstone,not_removed,by any standards in classic days we had knife juggler and starving buzzard in naxx we had nerubian egg mad scientist and haunted creeper in gvg we had mechwarper snowchugger annoyotron shielded minibot those are all the sets that arent included in todays standard trogg and mana wyrm would both be unplayable at mana
hearthstone,not_removed,seems kind of slow id much rather have a win axe on turn than to armor up
hearthstone,not_removed,shredders and boom to smooth the curve also belcher if you are into a more anti aggro setup nzoth as an additional win condition vs control
hearthstone,not_removed,you should reread your last two comments because in one you say that youre playing midrange while in this one you clearly describe a control deck
hearthstone,not_removed,brawls in a midrange deck lmao
hearthstone,not_removed,well youve just made some assumptions about the deck i was playing and those assumptions are wrong midrange dragon warrior again midrange dragon warrior does not rely on armor it actively wants to ditch its hero power as fast as possible what youre describing seems like control dragon warrior in which armorsmith makes sense but thats your fault for not being able to communicate properly
hearthstone,not_removed,exactly the idea is that you can trade with higher mana costs with it giving huge tempo board control
hearthstone,not_removed,im doubtful about that i think when it is no longer a threatening minion in its own right it becomes a lot less appealing it will at least be seen significantly less than it is now
hearthstone,not_removed,probably only in zoo and face hunter
hearthstone,not_removed,nicknames based on sound effects are really annoying if you normally play with the sound off
hearthstone,not_removed,you mean mind if i roll weeeeeeed
hearthstone,not_removed,same just run blademaster and four drops im running auchenai feast and holy champion and this makes rez priest really consistent
hearthstone,not_removed,should i also mention that velens chosen is gone and cleric was damn fine target for it especially with coin on
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah but if they were for they would be more balanced and playable
hearthstone,not_removed,gain attack equal to your weapons
hearthstone,not_removed,wrong i am playing a midrange dragon deck grow up
hearthstone,not_removed,ok at this point you are just a troll i am done with you
hearthstone,not_removed,it will be played in zoo but not aggro huntershamanpaladin i think
hearthstone,not_removed,dude give me a big hug
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,agreed i dont even like to run pyromancers on my rez priest
hearthstone,not_removed,they definitely wouldnt be more playable more balanced maybe but theres a fine line between amazing and unplayable when it comes to
hearthstone,not_removed,i can see why all your posts have points youre absolutely delusional midrange decks hope to seize the board and keep it brawls make the deck control you can call it midrange but its obviously control grow up
hearthstone,not_removed,guess everyone else on this subreddit is trolling too huh notice how other people are agreeing with what im saying and disagreeing with you
hearthstone,not_removed,go away i dont want to catch leper
hearthstone,not_removed,haha it was worth a try
hearthstone,not_removed,pyromancer is pretty necessary when against shaman mage hunter or zoolock kills a lot of their board especially with a holy nova
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i go back and forth on it but wind up not being real happy either way
hearthstone,not_removed,nzoth hunter ships cannon ganngup pirate rogue nzoth priest
hearthstone,not_removed,egg druid popped up recently with synergies with nerubian egg dragon egg and mark of the lotus
hearthstone,not_removed,ships cannon ganngup pirate rogue is that a competitive deck or a meme deck cause it sounds pretty memey
hearthstone,not_removed,egg druid has been around it just never transitioned into standard because it lost jeeves
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,ships cannon gang up rogue is like a more dignified tempo mage
hearthstone,not_removed,its strong with all those new pirates ships cannon is like a mana flamewaker
hearthstone,not_removed,didnt someone take it to legend
hearthstone,not_removed,a lot of people took it to legend i think it was even tier at some point but dont quote me on that
hearthstone,not_removed,this happened to me before im not sure how to fix it but i did re log and waited an hour or so and it was gone
hearthstone,not_removed,i had this issue with one of the adventures this was the fix i used
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,i just tried to make a new account and started the transaction and then cancelled it thinking it would help but i still have nothing ill try that and see if it works thank you
hearthstone,not_removed,this is what i tried and still nothing unfortunately ive been keeping at what they posted there but im thinking ill have to open a ticket and see if they can fix anything unfortunately thanks for the help though
hearthstone,not_removed,its been about two days everytime i go to it it just spins i even put my phone so it wouldnt sleep and i went to bed hoping it would be resolved sometime through out the night and it was still doing it when i woke up i generally sleep for hours so ill take your advice for opening a ticket and hoping i can get it resolved by the morning thank you for the suggestion
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,do you have any idea how much money theyd lose if they did that
hearthstone,not_removed,just do what everyone else does and google a deck then play them non stop you know they work to legend as they all say and its fun apparently

hearthstone,not_removed,murloc knight is amazing in paladdin but nobody plays paladdin and those that do ive never seen use it working on a custom murloc spammadin deck for fun with lots of buffs and summons

hearthstone,not_removed,ive seen them all
hearthstone,not_removed,ive gotten it off of malkorok a fair times every time the thought process was oh cool perditions blade wait what does that deathrattle do oh tentacles for arms is the weapon you think about so little that its mistaken for an unplayed card from another class until the malkorok animation finishes

hearthstone,not_removed,ya rip priest standard is not a nice place anymore
hearthstone,not_removed,hes pretty op in wild thoughbut sheshi want to play him in standard

hearthstone,not_removed,next time try saying please no angry chicken
hearthstone,not_removed,pro tip dont play hungry dragon
hearthstone,not_removed,is this suitable
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,why would you run doomsayer in a deck that also runs yshaarj thats just asking for trouble
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe keep that rage a little bit bound yshaarj
hearthstone,not_removed,at least it thinned your deck to improve your draws
hearthstone,not_removed,why not faceless the rag lol
hearthstone,not_removed,wow
hearthstone,not_removed,lol midorima
hearthstone,not_removed,if you dont mind me asking what were you playing
hearthstone,not_removed,howd her get yshaarjs
hearthstone,not_removed,gone wrong gone sexual
hearthstone,not_removed,so you can live the dream and the nightmare
hearthstone,not_removed,because the deck is too slow and this counters aggro decks and most turn plays form your opponent
hearthstone,not_removed,and making it double
hearthstone,not_removed,well you usually run copy to cover your weak early game his opponent got too greedy i guess and tried to go for the early yshaarj
hearthstone,not_removed,the meta forces it you need it for the early game but if you dont pick it out of your deck by the time you want to play yshaarj then you may just be in trouble
hearthstone,not_removed,cuz you need to survive till turn to play your giant minions doomsayer just helps you do that
hearthstone,not_removed,just a lil bit
hearthstone,not_removed,thats one spicy reference
hearthstone,not_removed,and theres also a nefarian as the card just been having some fun with it its confusing sometimes still learning it like that if you play reno with auchenai soulpriest out its a terrible mistake and making tweaks here n there
hearthstone,not_removed,probably with
hearthstone,not_removed,roller coaster druid
hearthstone,not_removed,spicy edit and downvoted for asking a question really what a friendly sub
hearthstone,not_removed,to do damage to face and reduce the chance to draw the doomsayer in the first place
hearthstone,not_removed,claim on a better warlock holds no bearing lol i know theres gonna be a troll that comments on it just some dark magic
hearthstone,not_removed,if you have auchenai out and are on hp and play reno do you take damage or
hearthstone,not_removed,i keep waiting for someone to answer im curious too lol
hearthstone,not_removed,its just a joke
hearthstone,not_removed,you take your max hp as damage so
hearthstone,not_removed,if renos battlecry can pop youll take a full there was also a match where it was going to be a loss and had auchenai out had stolen a tree of life made it a draw the deck can be tragic sometimes have accidently done damage to self at least twice with out spawn of shadows out
hearthstone,not_removed,httpbmkgamingcomunderstandingfelreaverhearthstonetheory that was on the front page the other day talks about how cards like tracking thin your deck so that even when they give you bad cards theyre improving your draws later on edit it was actually in
hearthstone,not_removed,no but whats the reference
hearthstone,not_removed,i assumed so i just didnt what reference you had in mind that would be described a spicy
hearthstone,not_removed,httpbmkgamingcomunderstandingfelreaverhearthstonetheory that was on the front page the other day talks about how cards like tracking thin your deck so that even when they give you bad cards theyre improving your draws later on edit it was actually in
hearthstone,not_removed,i just thought it was funny
hearthstone,not_removed,i actually didnt see that article was thinking of secret paladin thinning the deck with mysterious challenger same idea though
hearthstone,not_removed,use hero power attack majordomo
hearthstone,not_removed,i was expecting some level of difficulty
hearthstone,not_removed,a card that swaps your deck with your opponents
hearthstone,not_removed,mana charge windfury think thalnos im a combo player and you would have to give this attack with faceless to so i dont think it would be too broken but pulling it off would be extraordinarily fun
hearthstone,not_removed,a decent taunt
hearthstone,not_removed,a card that puts a copy of every card in you opponents hand into your deck it would have to be mana or more
hearthstone,not_removed,mana priest card silence all minions then destroy all minions
hearthstone,not_removed,ysera awakens
hearthstone,not_removed,i would add two neutral spells mana damage to an enemy and mana damage to all enemy minions
hearthstone,not_removed,priest still wouldnt be viable
hearthstone,not_removed,depends on the class definitely broken if it is a neutral and accessible to all classes
hearthstone,not_removed,so attack in mana with no thaurissan procs all classes abusives alone is burst which is pretty crazy for a card combo without thaurissan reminds me nerfed super combo which was damage but requires an innervate this is probably less versatile but abusives by themselves are arguably better and the opponent has to deal with both of them and you can run them in a faster deck in order of effectiveness warlock po is pretty easy with assorted burst with soulfire requires on average of either abusive po abusive or soulfire you would run this in zoo cus everythings there already its very powerfulop and you dont need all of the combo pieces because youll deal lots of damage by turn rogue just cold blood or cold blood conceal this will be run in miracle rogue and its very consistent op with just a single coldblood and faceless paladin blessing of might can do the with abusives seal of champions and abusives can do and you have to deal with divine shields or you die basically you have to have sources of damage and you cat really use your face blessing of kings burst and you have to deal withe the its pretty powerfulop because you can feasibly run all of those cards in a tempo based deck youll likely deal like damage by turn ten not really any viable tempo based pally decks in standard right now but this card can probably push one out druid innervates mark of nature yshaarj wild very powerful but starting to get less op i can see it in token druid useless mage shaman priest warrior hunter basically i believe its op because it can just be added to existing tempo based decks with little to no harm to the tempo of the deck
hearthstone,not_removed,above below or the same power level as belcher
hearthstone,not_removed,pretty much useless in every matchup except fatiguecontrol vs fatiguecontrol like gang up or is this to read the other persons hand or to play cards you dont have
hearthstone,not_removed,i think that the cost of the card could be affected by the number of cards in you opponents hand make it cost more for more value
hearthstone,not_removed,i first thought that what doom was going to be
hearthstone,not_removed,stronger because of how strong the aggro cards are getting the aggro cards are so much better these days than the antiaggro cards a taunt that would help bring priest back is my dream
hearthstone,not_removed,i agree mana for every card
hearthstone,not_removed,oh right forgot about rockbiter and flametongue with rockbiter it would be good better than doom hammer with faceless
hearthstone,not_removed,please no i feel like that would just be too powerful against midrange hunter and zoo shaman the class who got the best cards can always tech in earth shock
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,which server though otherwise
hearthstone,not_removed,most likely ten pacific time for na
hearthstone,not_removed,now
hearthstone,not_removed,pt
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,nothing yet the expansion comes out pretty soon so i would wait a bit to see how the meta settles
hearthstone,not_removed,it depends if you are a competitive player or not if you are more competitive on a limited budget you should wait and see what decks are good and what the top decks are it also depends how good or bad you are at arena if you are better at arena you should just play a lot of that when the new set comes out and get cheaper packs assuming you win at wins on average
hearthstone,not_removed,hero powers
hearthstone,not_removed,paladin bubblehearthstone implementation become immune at the end of your turn leave game and go to lobby no loss while spamming emotes
hearthstone,not_removed,as in actual mechanics or themes because classes are supposed to have specific weaknesses like druid doesnt get good aoe hunter doesnt get good draw and priest cant easily answer attack minions
hearthstone,not_removed,we already have shadowform for priests we could have similar cards for other heroes you could have a priest minion which boosted the damage of their hero power it would only be useful with shadowform sir mrrgl so do it in more of a cthun way than forced specs just add in some cards which work well together but against some of the core cards you could give warriors fury cards which had a powerful effect but removed all their armour say give warlocks some powerful affliction spells but they reduce the stats of all demons in your deck and hand druids could get some better shapeshifting spells maybe even one to permanently give them a weapon stiches hook style but with a downside of lowering their spell damage im thinking of essentially renolike cards which you build your deck around but have a powerful effect
hearthstone,not_removed,that sounds like a good idea im thinking something like this using hunter as an example marksmanship deal damage to the enemy hero beast mastery summon a beast with charge it cant attack heroes survivalist discover a secret
hearthstone,not_removed,mechanics three different hero powers or the same hero power but a different passive for each spec balancing would be a nightmare i know but would enable varying deck choices like control hunter with survivalism idk
hearthstone,not_removed,i like this
hearthstone,not_removed,nice discussion so helpful
hearthstone,not_removed,i was thinking more on the lines like different hero powers or keep the hero power but have a hero have possible passives to choose from within the flavor of their spec these are of course just minor passives
hearthstone,not_removed,that survivalist one sounds broken af
hearthstone,not_removed,it would be cool but in all likely hood too hard to balance multiple hero powers
hearthstone,not_removed,hero powers should be similar to mana spells which draw a card such as shiv or novice engineer your survivalist once is a little overpowered
hearthstone,not_removed,even draw a card is overpowered warlock downside deal damage to yourself etc they are always worse than a spell of the same value arcane shot mana deal damage hero power mana deal damage to enemy hero
hearthstone,not_removed,the original warcraft tcg had hero specializations that didnt over complicate things at all you just had different hero powers to choose from dont be so dismissive
hearthstone,not_removed,im sure theres a way to simplify them even if class specializiations was a card power up like shadowform they have introduced cards like jaraxxus before jaraxxus could easily be a card that said something like battlecry replace your hero with restoration druid or something idk im not a card designer but reddit is about discussion and even just spitballing some fun ideas is better than rudely dismissing it out of hand
hearthstone,not_removed,what im saying with draw a card is find a spell with draw a card that effect without the draw a card is appropriate as a hero power novice engineer mana draw a card recruit mana no draw a card shiv mana deal damage draw a card fireball mana deal damage no draw a card so the warlock hero power needs to be equivalent to a spell which draws two cards arcane intellect mana draw two cards life tap mana health draw one card what mana value is well flame imp is mana cheaper than it should be for health so life tap is undercosted in that sense if it was health would it be balanced
hearthstone,not_removed,i get what youre saying so hero power is discover a card draw card that card you then have to play which is more mana still thats a pretty cool power
hearthstone,not_removed,it was until blizz canceled it to make hs yes is it really that unlikely that theyd be able to implement aspects in to this game from the game it was derived from
hearthstone,not_removed,so he disappeared and was never summoned
hearthstone,not_removed,i think its absurd to say that priest is dead because you dont recognize the current priests decks that are played on the ladder to be priest decks you say that priests needs to do something yet you just cut out the methods that are clearly effective and used on the ladder by that theory no class is in a good state because i can just say that warlockmage are bad because zootempo mage are bad now even though renolockrenomage are clearly used very effectively on the ladder
hearthstone,not_removed,isnt the point of rotation to make sure that decks come and go though i see no problem with control priest phasing out of the meta id like to contribute by saying that shaman is still in a sorry state not jade aggro shaman not midrange shaman just malygos shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,what about control warrior he is in shithole with control priest
hearthstone,not_removed,something to do early how about the taunts when holding a dragon
hearthstone,not_removed,honesty until blizzard does something drastic control priest is dead for good they basically said fuck you all to all grindy comboless control decks which is literally the only kind priest can make when they released the jade archetypeidol on top of that aggro is even more aggressive than before who could have guessed that with even less decision making i tried making a slow grindy control priest focused on inversion effects and the like it has hozen healer and lots of combos that actually arnt as clunky as you would think its fun as hell and really interesting it also sucks it gets smashed by aggro since it just doesnt have the early game to hold on and even when you tech your deck to deal with it you can still draw like crap it auto loses to jade cause blizzard i guess if you tech to deal with one you lose to the other at one point i made so many changes to it i realized it wasnt even fun anymore why you ask cause at that point it was a fucking dragon deck i knew this was going to happen when they announced all of the cards but i still dont like it all of my favorite games have been control warrior vs priest or control shaman vs priest or priest vs priest now all i play is control priest vs pirate shelljade deck and the occational warlock which is pretty unfavored as well thanks to it being warlock i think this meta is easily better than the last but i dont see why we had to sacrifice the slow control decks to get here honestly imo if just one of the two jade or pirate werent a thing control priest would be in a way better spot priest decks are notoriously inflexible
hearthstone,not_removed,honestly i agree with op that dragon priest isnt really a priest deck its a dragon shell whose hero power is restore health yes a lot of the included cards are priest cards in name but what is priest like about dragon fire potion twilight whelp or the taunt dude if they were rogue cards or paladin cards it would make no difference
hearthstone,not_removed,the only problem i see with that is that control priest is a whole archetype which sucks now and not just one deck if you arent running dragon nzoth or reno than you are sol i dont think this is a very health deck building philosophy than again this problem is more of a wide spread problem with the set across multiple classes paladin warrior mage and shaman all have the same problem
hearthstone,not_removed,yep thats a damn shame too
hearthstone,not_removed,eh you still see control warriors because of all the defensive tools and jade druid pretty scarce at high ranks
hearthstone,not_removed,didnt read the post eh
hearthstone,not_removed,not dragon priest not even reno priest just control priest read the post before you comment next time
hearthstone,not_removed,if they were rogue or paladin cards then it would be a roguepaladin card class minions are also part of what makes a class good classic example of this scenario are flame imphighmane which are just high stat minions that about any class would play but cant because the minion is not in their class if you force an archtypestyle onto a class then no its never going to stay for example handlock is dead and has long since changed to reno control warrior are no longer running a lot of high end game threats anymore but focuses more on removal and just enough late game to finish
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think you understood my point flame imp is a demon something mostly unique to warlocks highmane is a beast that spawns more beasts a hunter thing if someone took any of the three cards i said above and put them in any other class you wouldnt know the difference there is nothing inherently priest like about them no healing no reviving and no copying if they were in rogue you wouldnt think hey whats this doing here where you would if highmane or flame imp were priest cards
hearthstone,not_removed,if you are going by what type of minion it spawns then priests has the most synergy with dragons ofc i wouldnt know the difference a good minion is a good minion it doesnt matter what class it belonged to one would use it anyway
hearthstone,not_removed,i still dont think you understand my point im talking thematically there is nothing about dragons that fits priest thematically if blizzard had put all of the dragons into any other class no one would go that doesnt belong because the only things that the dragons naturally synergize with is each other thus most dragon decks play very similarly just with different hero powers edit it should also be noted that dragons play out the exact opposite of how control priest plays control priest is combo oriented with niche cards and reactive plays dragons are by design proactive flexible cards that are giant stat sticks which encourage holding dragons
hearthstone,not_removed,so why cant dragons be thematically you say that beasts is a hunter thing yet they been adding a whole lot more beast support to druid that if highmane was there now no one would bat an eye either
hearthstone,not_removed,i honestly dont get how this is so hard yeah if you put a highmane in druid it wouldnt be out of place since druids have beasts too plus theyre naturey and shit but if you put a highmane in paladin or any other class that would make no sense why is a beast a knight for light and justice dragons dont automatically fit in any of the classes thematically no one thinks priest or any other class and then goes dragons blizzard just used the archetype to prop up a class that they had no idea what to do with on top of that dragons play opposite to how control priest plays being proactive flexible and focusing on minion combat combine the two and you have the reason that some old priest mains like myself see dragon priest as just another oncurve dragon deck honestly if you dont get why dragons seem thematically out of place this time then i just give up it seems you are willfully ignoring my points
hearthstone,not_removed,thats fine however i disagree with the fact that one should attach any sort of archtype to a class in the first place blizzard can make priest into whatever playstyle they like and force it to they can just add a bunch of aggro cards to priest to make it the next best aggro deck its silly to think that any archtype of deck should stay alive decks like handlockmech mageetc all died thats it people adapt and change to the meta
hearthstone,not_removed,pre orders start tomorrow iirc patch hits with the new season
hearthstone,not_removed,any guesses or official statements how long the prepurchase will be available
hearthstone,not_removed,this guide is too detailed the only real guide you need for shaman is httpiimgurcomtueearspng
hearthstone,not_removed,you can see what tempostorm thinks about the matchups there you should be more specific than hunter and mage though for mage at least there is more than one deck seen on ladder
hearthstone,not_removed,its pretty safe to assume hes talking about tempo mage i dont think freeze mage would give any decent control warrior much trouble
hearthstone,not_removed,but hes just lumping mage together at maybe all of his wins were against freeze and all his losses against tempo
hearthstone,not_removed,personal experience mid hunter stomps all over cthun control warrior just too damn fast
hearthstone,not_removed,yes well what about warlock zoo trump lost his last game to one
hearthstone,not_removed,its an obviously terrible matchup for midrange hunter
hearthstone,not_removed,how many classneutral minions can be discovered dont know what it is but for example sake lets use chances are reasoning discover happened you need to calculate the chances of the discover first minion is for that minion second minion is since the first cannot be discovered again third is since first minions cannot be discovered again
hearthstone,not_removed,the chances of discovering those exact cardsin any order is so doing that twice in two different games is now for them to be in those positions exactly the chances of doing that in the first place is and double that for it happening twice
hearthstone,not_removed,from what i just counted there are minions discoverable by raven idol in standard so i calculated the chance to be to get that exact raven idol result
hearthstone,not_removed,did you include all classes or just druid
hearthstone,not_removed,x x x youre off by about percent sign but your number is also slightly different did you just cube edit oh you just skipped over a digit
hearthstone,not_removed,druid and neutral minions
hearthstone,not_removed,well this is in arena so its wild even
hearthstone,not_removed,oh my bad a lot less chance then
hearthstone,not_removed,losing justicar will hurt control warrior
hearthstone,not_removed,goodbye dragons my old friends
hearthstone,not_removed,totem golem deserves a mention i reckon
hearthstone,not_removed,there will always be powerful cards im more sad of the novel effects that are rotating out things like loatheb this year i hope they put in something similar in the future maybe not but more or something on a non legendary along those lines justicar thaurissan reno elise finley hopefully they readd those effects or something similar to newer sets anything that creates new decks or opens up new styles of play
hearthstone,not_removed,i will really miss the loe legendaries i think that may have been the best adventure content the games ever seen its really a shame that they rotate the set every calendar year instead of keeping exactly the last two years worth of cards in because since loe came out at the end of this means that in my opinion one of the single best card sets in the game is going to get the least amount of standard playing time thats pretty shitty im actually bummed about losing justicar too ive been fiddling around with different controlshadow priest archetypes without her control priest of any variety not named dragon is just so underwhelming ill also miss thaurissan as he really did create some hilarious gameplay and made things that were never thought possible become reality even though i didnt personally use him much the three cards ill miss the least are without a doubt keeper of uldaman flamewaker and tunnel troggtotem golem keeper ruined arena in its early days making it a common card was absolutely absurd flamewaker is just a bitch of a card to deal with and it always seems like whether youre the one playing him or youre the one playing against him the cards rng finds a way to lose you the game trogggolem is just one of the most disappointing openers to play against whenever thats my opponents opener i just sigh and think to myself really thats as creative as you can be that feeling is magnified when im playing my silly yogg mage deck in casual for questing i see enough aggro shaman in ranked why does it have to pollute casual too anyway thats my rant good post op
hearthstone,not_removed,minions in this list are quite powerful no doubt but the ones that stand out are the ones that have shaped certain archetypes justicar trueheart flamewaker emperor thaurissan dark peddler and these will have the most impact when they leave standard
hearthstone,not_removed,certainly there are a lot of powerful cards here that are going to be felt going but the card im going to miss most is reno rip you beautiful bastard
hearthstone,not_removed,museum curator entomb even in this kind of thread priests apparently dont exist
hearthstone,not_removed,op if you want to show it the other way you need to add a backslash in front of the period youll also need a double space at the end of a line living roots keeper of uldaman imp gang boss justicar trueheart dark peddler flamewaker tunnel trogg grim patron the league of explorers finley brann elise reno emperor thaurissan living roots keeper of uldaman imp gang boss justicar trueheart dark peddler flamewaker tunnel trogg grim patron the league of explorers finley brann elise reno emperor thaurissan
hearthstone,not_removed,honestly thaurissan is one of the cards that opens up a lot of different playstyles the funniest being ships cannon and tentacles for arms the most common being in freeze mage im going to miss it also the exit of all the discover cards are going to make decks like zoo and tempo mage a lot less optimal the ability to discover reliquary seeker or even bloodsail corsair or counterspell when you know they have a board clear was very strong and made decks very versatile decks will have to tech more and rely less on discovering counters
hearthstone,not_removed,priest is gonna get hit like a truck no more excavated evil no justicar trueheart no elise and no entomb blizzard really needs to pump out some incredible cards for the class or otherwise it will be another full year without anduin on the ladder
hearthstone,not_removed,how is tomb pillager not even on the list this is literally the one card that made miracle rogue possible again
hearthstone,not_removed,no more broken majordomo mages eerie statue handlocks and burgle rogues feelsgoodman
hearthstone,not_removed,in my opinion blizzard is cutting in its own flesh by rotating out adventures out of standard making them unavailable to playpurchase by new players not only the cards are awesome and its sad that this interesting card design is leaving standard but blizzard could make more money by keeping all the adventures availableviable in addition the complete loe card set gives many good cards that do not limit the possibilities of further card design like master of disguise another topic is justicar trueheart introducing the mechanic of changing hero powers which should be preserved by designing similar cards eg
hearthstone,not_removed,justicar brann and reno
hearthstone,not_removed,gang up goodbye mill rogue you were too beautiful for this world
hearthstone,not_removed,next year will be a whole different hearthstone for standard im half excited and half sad
hearthstone,not_removed,fuck flamewanker
hearthstone,not_removed,justicar will be a great loss
hearthstone,not_removed,i honestly think the expansions that are going to be removed are super balanced compared to gvg gvg had so many things that were just broken dr boom mechwarper ect and the cards removed werent really missed my me nor my peers its clear that their design philosophy at the time has changed in a great way
hearthstone,not_removed,control are gonna have an even harder time once reno elise and justicar is gone p in fact i would not mind if the four explorers were made evergreen
hearthstone,not_removed,not even mentioning tomb pillager which is like best in the game after deathbite and shredder gone the card just put rogues on another level and made auctioneer playable again
hearthstone,not_removed,this just makes me happy with blizzs decision to switch to formats cards like flamewaker justicar imp gang boss tunnel trogg etc even though i like the archetypes they enabled im glad to see them leave after playing against them so long
hearthstone,not_removed,my favorite card holy champion is rotating out as well i might play wild full time
hearthstone,not_removed,i think this in turn begs the important question should standard be curated and use a mix of cards from all previous sets rather than just a yearlyset cutoff
hearthstone,not_removed,priest loses excavated evil museum curator flash heal and entomb dragon priest loses twilight whelp wyrmrest agent and twilight gaurdian since priest is already in rough shape the next adventure and expansion will be a make or break point for the class
hearthstone,not_removed,is league of explorers rotating out i thought it was confirmed to stay in until
hearthstone,not_removed,rip renojusticar a saltysad control player
hearthstone,not_removed,in my innocence i thought we would lose set when a new one comes out and so on we will lose cards to gain in the beginning very classic focused play in the beginning of each year
hearthstone,not_removed,priest is going to need some love in the next sets because were going to lose the dragon deck and entomb come next rotation jesus christ just thinking about that is such a bummer please notice us blizzard holy shit
hearthstone,not_removed,notice how almost all those cards are from adventures maybe not that surprising as tgt has been the lackluster expand so far blizz better had come up with an amazing adventure next cardwise
hearthstone,not_removed,no love for entomb
hearthstone,not_removed,my criticism your list it definitely misses the rest of shamans early game ie totem golem and tuskar totemic thank god for this rng bs being gone in the future im not sure how exactly youve picked the cards grim patron sees next to no play currently being overshadowed by more powerful warrior decks but if youre still going to include it based on its past then you might as well include mysterious challenger that sees just as much play nowadays and has influenced meta just as much in the past tomb pillager lets be honest with ourselves zoo for example is going to survive without dark peddler and imp gang boss but without tomb pillager the newly resurrected miracle rogue may easily die again if no viable replacement is provided other than that the list looks solid some more opinions unpopular ones if anyone is still reading p im glad that emperor is leaving its a cool effect but it is too hard to balance the game around as blizz showed us time and time again its arguable but completely possible that the main problem with some of the most problematic decks grim patron midrange druid freeze mage was emperor all along even more unpopular opinion im glad that finley and elise are leaving yes we all had our fun with them especially with elise but i think that them leaving will help the classes to become diversified again without finley shamans will stop pretending to be druids warriors will stop pretending to be mages and everyone will hopefully stop pretending to be hunters and without elise you will actually have to consider again how much late game to put in your deck since you can not transform your useless revenges into legendaries no more with monkey rng gone a lot of lost skill will return into control decks matchups like how do i line up my removals with his threats and come out on top not oh well he got tirion and anub i guess i lose ¯ツ¯
hearthstone,not_removed,bye shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,wasnt it confirmed loe would stay for an extra year i thought i read that somewhere
hearthstone,not_removed,entomb excavated evil honestly i think that at least entomb should be included into classic set
hearthstone,not_removed,i for one cant wait to see the back of justicar play far to many games vs priest and warrior where their win condition seems to be outlasting the opponent based on draw ill be sad to see thaurassian go the card is far too unique imo to remove so i think they should create a card which does a similar effect otherwise some decks just disappear like freeze mag and my personal favourite yogg and load
hearthstone,not_removed,i think it is a bit early to have this discussion considering that it is months away at minimum before cards get rotated out probably more like months away
hearthstone,not_removed,special mention dreadsteed
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont want to loose brm i love playing dragon decks of all sorts warriorpriestmagepala im playing all of them and with blackrock gone we ate loosing the most important and drop for the archetypeas well as the twilight welpdragon consort and nefarian so either the next expansion will be dragon centered bringing a new pace to the archetype but making people think why remove brm in the first place at the same time or blizzard is trying to passive agressively remove the archetype entirely not to mention that we are loosing the dragons from tgt aswell chillmawtwilight guardianwyrmrest agent now im sad thanks obama
hearthstone,not_removed,i thought standard only rotates the oldest sets not
hearthstone,not_removed,on another tone it saddens me to see how my collection slowly loses its valor all my good cards rotates out of standard and i barely have any good wotog card since its clearly imppossible for me to pickup the pace ill be farming quests and tavern brawls until wild somehow gains prestige
hearthstone,not_removed,but flamewanker will still ruin brawls for decades to come
hearthstone,not_removed,gonna miss brann the most i think playing cthun priest and tossing down a twin emperor in conjunction with brann and then following up with cthun when the enemy cant clear the taunts has been a lot of fun
hearthstone,not_removed,to be blunt im a priest player and i think losing entomb can actually be a good thing if priest kept it it would be the ultimate late game class and blizzard would not give priest anything to prevent his power to skyrocket now it gives priest more design space for cool cards granted they actually choose a direction for anduin maybe around things like resurrect
hearthstone,not_removed,this is going to kill dragon priest i am so sad
hearthstone,not_removed,dreadsteed died with baron rivendares rotation
hearthstone,not_removed,tomb pillager that card single handedly brought miracle rogue back into the meta without it rogue is garbo and would need another solid coinlowcostcard generating mechanic to see play
hearthstone,not_removed,no entomb feelsbadman
hearthstone,not_removed,losing reno hurts a lot it prevents an entire deck type from being relevant same but to a lesser extent the other explorers finley for this deck doesnt fit my class archetype decks elise as a win condition in ultracontrol and brann for interesting battlecry shenanigans same goes for thaurissan but for certain combo decks though that is both welcome and sad to see leave i suppose
hearthstone,not_removed,where the hell is kodorider riot
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont even play control warrior but it feels just wrong to not have justicar in the game
hearthstone,not_removed,priest will be super dead too
hearthstone,not_removed,we still get at least more expansionsadventures before they fall off though right
hearthstone,not_removed,there are also a lot of cards that have a cool concept and will be rotated out without having seen much play im thinking of resurrect and its crazy otk combo inspire decks everyfin is awesome the only murloc deck we got since loe was the paladin combo deck lock and load and summoning stone
hearthstone,not_removed,itt people acting like were losing these cards in a month not nine months
hearthstone,not_removed,i recently crafted justicar doesnt matter ill still have fun in wild
hearthstone,not_removed,and brann are major mistakesor risk they ve made the rest standsout but not really harmful to the game
hearthstone,not_removed,i will miss reno mostly and justicar because its great on my paladin not warrior i am happy that imp peddler and trogg are out cancer cards
hearthstone,not_removed,going to miss emperor lots of combos depends on him
hearthstone,not_removed,other special mention is mysterios challenger aka dr we might see some cool new paldin secrets i hope so
hearthstone,not_removed,im already getting sad over justicar and the members of the league of explorers leaving standard reno bran and elise are all a ton of fun
hearthstone,not_removed,feeling bad only for justicar and patron
hearthstone,not_removed,tuskar totemic argent horsrider quick shot kings elekk arcane blast dr flame juggler pretty much all the dragons corrupter twilight guardian etc
hearthstone,not_removed,pardon me while i cry in a corner at my patronless patron decks
hearthstone,not_removed,were losing the league of explorers and not blackrock mountain
hearthstone,not_removed,when is the official phase out date
hearthstone,not_removed,noooo not brann and reno
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah no priest cards suck it wait
hearthstone,not_removed,grim patron emperor thaurissan hello darkness my old friend
hearthstone,not_removed,twilight guardian should be in the top
hearthstone,not_removed,im fairly new and recently played through league of explorers and had fun with it is it worth putting gold in to blackrock mountain or save it up for the next expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,damn maybe i will eventually play wild
hearthstone,not_removed,the whole set for shaman tgt is pretty essential cant wait to see how they replace all that delicious value
hearthstone,not_removed,tomb pillager im scared for miracle after it rotates out
hearthstone,not_removed,i would reorder this significantly for one thaurissan is no longer the force he once was hes certainly not the most impactful card loss id put the top three at trogg flamewaker and patron each of which straight up defines a very powerful deck archetype id put as reno who also defines many deck archetypes but is waning in popularity at the moment then finley an important piece of many decks followed by brann
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont wanna think about it the dust just isnt the same
hearthstone,not_removed,hopefully they add more discover cards in the next sets since the majority will rotate out with league i really like the mechanic
hearthstone,not_removed,just play pirate warrior blizzard definitely added a lot of cards to help the tempoface warrior decks become competitive i would venture to say face warrior is a tier one deck up until rank or so also cw will live on just fine with cthun or the old school alex ysera baron combo
hearthstone,not_removed,new player here is it still worth it to get these adventures via gold or otherwise i already grinded the wing of brm
hearthstone,not_removed,goodbye zoo
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel like entomb is better than half these cards
hearthstone,not_removed,twilight guardian a neutral earlyish game defensively statted taunt dragon is both unique and predicted as a requirement to make dragon decks viable dragon warrior will be okay probably but dragon priest will be gone especially with the loss of twilight whelp and wyrmrest agent
hearthstone,not_removed,im going to feel the pain of losing entomb that is by far my favorite card and in my opinion the strongest priest card at present
hearthstone,not_removed,god im going tomiss emperor
hearthstone,not_removed,losing arcane blast is going to impact tempo mage that card can be so efficient at clearing while still leaving mana open forgotten torch will also bring the amount of burn down in both tempo and freeze mage archetypes it will be interesting to see what cards are made in the upcoming expansions to fill the void
hearthstone,not_removed,emperor rotating out will be a final blow to kill all combo decks
hearthstone,not_removed,man a lot of those are going to really suck to lose mostly the loe legs emperor and living roots mostly all really interesting and deck enabling too but then at least no ones going to miss flat out over budget cards like flamewaker gang boss golems and troggs
hearthstone,not_removed,from a design perspective my favorite two cards in the game are reno and dreadsteed losing both my favorite cards at once will be a big hit reno forces creativity and has terrific flavor plus he isnt an insta win card if not in combination with some way to retake the board well balanced and unique dreadsteed while far less viable is a slow control players dream the minion that cant be removed especially with nzoth warlock since wotg has been the most fun ive ever had with the game very sad to see these two go honorable mention to elise the cheapest way to have every legendary in the game
hearthstone,not_removed,really going to miss finley brann elise reno great cards flavorful not oppressive reno and elise even have decks built around them
hearthstone,not_removed,remember by the time these cards rotate out we will have new sets added more this year plus the first one next year
hearthstone,not_removed,im literally saving up for the last gold i need to get elise haha ok but i still get months with her
hearthstone,not_removed,unless you have a blizzard source to quote i dont think we are losing loe its a november launch and cards are suppose to be out for years with thier rotations before they leave with the rotations i assume being the same tie they were this yearjust blackrock mountain and probably tgt so the list isnt nearly as bad as this justicar leaving im mixed feelings about same with emperor grimm patron is too high as he doesnt even see that much play in current tempo warrior decks from my experience flamewake leaving im very happy about thoughthe card was not very fun to deal with and rarely felt fair living roots will be missed as it was a pretty fair card fandral value withstanding imp gang boss im also mixed about on the one hand it was crazy value on the other hand it rarely saw ore than imps pop out of it which meant it was never something broken in the way flamewanker was in the spotjust an above average drop with stickiness not mentionedtotem golem kings elekk chillmaw and the rest of the dragon synergy and my dear forgotten friend refreshment vendor which has been a reno staple for a while
hearthstone,not_removed,rip freeze mage
hearthstone,not_removed,aggro shaman tempo mage control warrior and any dragon decks will be hit pretty hard i think that rotation will change the meta more than the first one did
hearthstone,not_removed,im going to miss the league most of all none of them finley brann elise reno are obscene but made for some really really fun games flamewanker and justicar ill be glad to see go
hearthstone,not_removed,i guess ill be playing a lot of nzoth paladin after next years rotation
hearthstone,not_removed,all of the dragon synergy cards blackwing tech blackwing corrupt twilight guardian that priest taunt nefarian
hearthstone,not_removed,its niche but losing blackrock will pretty much end dragon decks and if it doesnt losing tgt will finish the job
hearthstone,not_removed,while its important to note what will be lost in months we still have several releases to go before the cycle ends who knows what cards will come out in the next expansion or adventure and what their impact on the meta will be
hearthstone,not_removed,and i just opened justicar last nightugh
hearthstone,not_removed,special mention – dreadsteed
hearthstone,not_removed,im pleased to report that these changes will not affect my hunter deck whatsoever
hearthstone,not_removed,only of those cards are from tgt shows how bad that set is
hearthstone,not_removed,arent we just losing blackrock and tgt why are loe cards on this list
hearthstone,not_removed,i cant wait to see flamewaker die
hearthstone,not_removed,its funny because on my legend climb this season i saw a total of emperor thaurissan when you think about it only renolock and freeze mage play him and you never see freeze mage on ladder due to the abundance of warriors renolock is also pretty scarce as i didnt face one in games i personally dont think grim patron and thaurissan deserve to be that high on the list
hearthstone,not_removed,tempo mage seems like complete trash without flamewaker would turn into a lackluster midrange deck
hearthstone,not_removed,my hope is that reno is moved into classic thing is reno jackson is not like loatheb or thaurassan in that both those cards are good enough to fit into a lot of decks drops slot loatheb and thaurassan are powerful enough to decrease deck variety by squeezing out competitions drops reno does not occupy a permanent slot in any deck and can only be put in if you build entirely around him reno jackson is one card that only increases deck variety and does not decrease it
hearthstone,not_removed,and sometimes are really only the ones i will miss loe has been such a boon to this game with elise and reno it is a shame they will be going
hearthstone,not_removed,good riddance
hearthstone,not_removed,totem golem and tuskar totemic thunder bluff valiant aggro shaman might be dead the problem is that even midrange might be dead will see tho
hearthstone,not_removed,losing league cards and emperor thaurissan is really gonna fk me over
hearthstone,not_removed,wait what so next year were losing tgt brm and loe that doesnt seem right we only lost gvg and naxx last time so we should only lose brm and tgt next time right or did i miss the memo
hearthstone,not_removed,the return of face hunter
hearthstone,not_removed,thank god flamewanker will be gone flamewanker coin sorcerers apprentice arcane missiles arcane missiles mirror entity means i lose my entire zoo board on turn while they get a board broken as fuck
hearthstone,not_removed,league of explorers rotates out with whispers of the old gods so numbers and are all wrong the only adventure that rotates out is black rock mountain
hearthstone,not_removed,hopefully shaman and tempo mage will suck now
hearthstone,not_removed,i play wild and standart because of this reason
hearthstone,not_removed,losing justicar is going to hurt priest pretty badly its a key part of clawing back from near death from the early game beat down even if youre crhuning lol emperor t kills all the novelty decks but will also hurt slow control decks too not looking good for poor mr priest at least ee is rotating out they cant give us a worse aoe clear can they
hearthstone,not_removed,are loe and brm rotating at the same time i thought we had another year of loe
hearthstone,not_removed,can someone combine this with the tempostorm meta snapshots and that card crafting listmashup that came from that analysis should surf this subreddit ucgmcnama did a graph on this to check out which cards from the brm tgt and loe set pop up
hearthstone,not_removed,every time i ladder with my zoo deck i hope that a suitable replacement for both igb and peddler will arrive in the new adventure because im not sure what i would replace with right now
hearthstone,not_removed,i think ben stated that loe will be out until
hearthstone,not_removed,runnel trog totem golem flamewalker these ruin my life
hearthstone,not_removed,runnel trog totem golem flamewalker these ruin my life
hearthstone,not_removed,no living roots well druids its time to come back to zombie ch im going to change to wild now
hearthstone,not_removed,im so excited that emperor will die combo decks that otk you arent a problem right now but they have been ever since he came out patron was an obvious one but malygos decks druid double combos etc were all popular and infuriating and all due to this awfulforthegame card
hearthstone,not_removed,fuck these cards tunnel trogg flamewaker justicar trueheart keeper of uldaman
hearthstone,not_removed,damn you i wanted to be first ah time to make a topic about cards leaving standard in two years i guess what the fuck is going on in this sub really
hearthstone,not_removed,control warrior is dead they lose juaticar and elise
hearthstone,not_removed,im really only sorry about the justicar the rest doesnt really matter to me never liked reno never really used thaurissan tempo mage mage in general is not really suited for me because i find it not that brainworthy facemidrange shaman the same welp i also like the change i hope for a new interesting year maybe with less mindless aggro and more control
hearthstone,not_removed,didnt bbrode say loe wasnt rotating out until
hearthstone,not_removed,oh yes no more annoying reeeeeeeennoooooo when the opponent is at hp on turn no more hella annoying justicar hero power welcome to the grand tournament champion hero power no more annoying troggs no more annoying flamewaker hella happy about all of this
hearthstone,not_removed,thank fucking god justicar is leaving standard welcoming to the grand tank up fucking bullshit
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,loss of igb and peddler pretty much makes zoo useless
hearthstone,not_removed,i wish auctioneer would be in rotated sets broken card
hearthstone,not_removed,lol dark peddler it never changed anything in the meta zoo wont even miss it
hearthstone,not_removed,loe isnt rotating out till its being let into the club on a technicality because they announced it during the sets lifespan not whispers
hearthstone,not_removed,cthun warrior can work without justicar since its more proactive
hearthstone,not_removed,what worries me is that the cthun shieldmaiden might hold back warrior from getting too many defensive options if they add more defensive options theyre going to have to be mediocre cards like bash so that cthun warriors dont splash everything in
hearthstone,not_removed,and priest possibly even more
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think it will that much cw was strong and estabilished archetype long before truheart was a card
hearthstone,not_removed,warrior needs to be hurt right now
hearthstone,not_removed,dont know about cwarrior but priest will definitely be rip without justicar cwarrior can finish the game with stuff like grom but priest who goes to turn until they can maybe finish you only healing for is quite harsh not to mention entomb will be going away so blizz really has to step it up with priest unless they want it to remain in the dumpster for eternity
hearthstone,not_removed,control warrior was fine before justicar and it will be fine in the future the classic set sets up the archetype so well
hearthstone,not_removed,not by that much control warrior existed before brm and we got the cthun synergy now
hearthstone,not_removed,nothing can hurt control warrior unless you take away gromm and all their removal its always going to be a thing lol
hearthstone,not_removed,oh im ready so many long games against warrior right now
hearthstone,not_removed,good
hearthstone,not_removed,kinda but not really cthun will just be the best option by far as you it has ample armor generation already
hearthstone,not_removed,water is wet
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah as a lover of dragon priest and currently tinkering with dragon warrior and paladin it sucks they never quite reached the upper echelons of competitive play just seems to me like dragons should be a little op rather than a little up
hearthstone,not_removed,ive come to take your eggs again
hearthstone,not_removed,the only important dragon card leaving i see is twilight guardian and maybe chillmaw but yeah we will miss the blackwing corruptor and technician hopefully well get new cards for dragon synergy and theres always wild
hearthstone,not_removed,too true this and trogg will ruin all the progress shaman made with wotog need replacements in the and spot
hearthstone,not_removed,and tuskarr totemic
hearthstone,not_removed,tuskarr totemic is the card in shaman decks that makes me rage the hardest
hearthstone,not_removed,we do need a new counter to spells losing to double fireball or double lava burst is still very frustrating and no bolf doesnt count
hearthstone,not_removed,i also really hate that they rotate at the calendar year for one it makes some sets more valuable than others and two it means that we lose some cards in january and only get about new ones to replace them so the beginning of each year will be very classic focused which sucks especially for classes with crap basic and classic cards
hearthstone,not_removed,on the notion of rotating sets out every calendar year it really seems logical to me that they keep a set amount of expansions in standard so when a new adventure comes in the oldest one goes away i really dont see any reason it should be otherwise
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah losing loe in standard is what will make me favor wild once that happens the legendaries are all really good in their own way finley is a good onemana legendary that fills unfilled holes for some decks brann is useful is all sorts of decks elise has a cool effect that control decks can utilise and reno can make for some really interesting deckchoices
hearthstone,not_removed,the loe legendaries are just so well designed powerful cards in the right deck but none of them can just be tossed into a deck without thought
hearthstone,not_removed,thaurissan was a little too powerful but i agree it enabled some cool combos
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah though the real tragedy of keeper of uldaman and flamewaker is that they basically will never rotate out the game modes they most ruin arena and tavern brawl respectively will never kick them i want to suggest to all new players to get loe but then i remember they would only get to use the cards for months
hearthstone,not_removed,i also agree loe gave us many awesome cards and it really shook the meta in an interesting way when it was released i will miss reno coming back from hp against a hunter has never been more satisfying
hearthstone,not_removed,nobody else has said it but ill miss a bad enough dude on his own and he gives you several options for how best to close the match
hearthstone,not_removed,i see enough aggro shaman in ranked why does it have to pollute casual too i use shamanzoo in casual only for my quests i dont want to ladder with them
hearthstone,not_removed,im the tempo mage player in ranked going to be sad to see my golden flamewaker go
hearthstone,not_removed,i personally think imp gang boss will be a bigger loss for zoo than dark peddler
hearthstone,not_removed,dont forget reno tunnel trogg and patron
hearthstone,not_removed,id add tomb pillager to that list with thaurissan leaving as well miracle and malygos rogue archetypes take a massive hit
hearthstone,not_removed,the rotation out of gang up is also removing an entire rogue archetype
hearthstone,not_removed,i really wonder how combo decks will function without thaurissan this seems like the biggest loss to me
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah me to he lets me play other fun cards that would never be viable in competitive otherwise probably my fav card in the game its just a shame more classes cant make good use of it besides lock
hearthstone,not_removed,reno justicar elise thaurissan entomb unless they reveal very good priest cards the class is pretty much dead next year
hearthstone,not_removed,i agree how could they not mention this card it is pretty much the only card that can single handedly remove sylvanis or tyrion off the board the best options polymorph or hex leave behind a token and are other classes in any case it also gives you card advantage for fatigue games entomb is a very unique and powerful card that should certainly be on this list
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,entomb good riddance
hearthstone,not_removed,living roots keeper of uldaman imp gang boss justicar trueheart dark peddler flamewaker tunnel trogg grim patron the league of explorers finley brann elise reno emperor thaurissan
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you sir edited
hearthstone,not_removed,thaurissan is a card that needs to exist with tempo decks being so strong in hearthstone trying to play decks that just outvalue or combo your opponent is pretty difficult its not even that good its in deck out of the first tiers on tempostorm but a lot of fun or just combo decks are straight unviable without it for example dog has made a controlcombo shaman with leeroy windfury rockbiter and faceless this isnt the best shaman deck but dog likes control and combo decks the most and prefers to play these types of decks getting good results with them i also use it on ramp druid and cthun warrior im going to miss this card the most followed by grim patron and justicar
hearthstone,not_removed,one thing i am hopeful of is some mechanics might make a comeback in the future the god mechanic in duel masters is a good example it was taken down for a few years and then came back for a year or so hope they bring back discover back sometime for another stint in the standard meta thaurissan will be dearly missed there are so many ridiculous combos regardless of viability that can be pulled off might consider going to wild just for those satisfying combos
hearthstone,not_removed,entomb is the most underrepresented card in this thread priest is gonna need some huge cards to recover from losing entomb
hearthstone,not_removed,well wotog kind of sucked for priest but there are more releases before this happens and last year wasnt exactly a year of powerhouse cards for priests id say the hit priest took from losing gvg and naxx is harder than last years sets
hearthstone,not_removed,just play rank you see cthun priest all the time
hearthstone,not_removed,watch priest become the new shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,the meta is saved
hearthstone,not_removed,minion paladin epic og 🐙 httphearthstonegamepediacomvilefininquisitor mana murloc battlecry your hero power becomes summon a murloc callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to pm
hearthstone,not_removed,from your perspective maybe but imagine the new player who logs on and sees that there are adventures for bucks a pop thats a little overwhelming besides you will still be able to craft the cards from old adventures
hearthstone,not_removed,brann was a little too powerful imo if you had no way to deal with him it was an autolose for sure allowing dark peddler to discover pos is very very dumb
hearthstone,not_removed,mill rogues been dead ever since it lost deathlord and healbot tbh
hearthstone,not_removed,if rogue ever had a control deck this card wouldve been op
hearthstone,not_removed,gang up is honestly such a valuable card not just for mill rogue imagine having tirions in your deck but yeah mill rogue lives forever if only in our hearts
hearthstone,not_removed,mill rogues only in wild anyways
hearthstone,not_removed,mill rogues been dead ever since it lost deathlord and healbot tbh
hearthstone,not_removed,im glad gvg came out it was a learning experience for blizzard as to the power of their own mechanics
hearthstone,not_removed,agreed loe more than any other expansion made entirely new deck types possible think of all the archtypes we are losing control warrior is getting gimped without justicarelise every reno deck is gone priest is losing some of its few removals dragon decks are rip the worst part is that aggro decks will survive intact because they can just throw in whatever new low cost trash gets added i might just be a bit salty as a dragon control deck player
hearthstone,not_removed,flamewreathed faceless
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah will be interesting if miracle rogue will even be a thing if they dont make any new auctioner synergies
hearthstone,not_removed,no i think it makes it more interesting if its a cut off unless they reprint flamewaker tempo mage is essentially gone as is mech mage from the current standard rotation secret paladin is gone too that will allow other decks to prosper instead aggro shaman nzoth paladin pirate warrior finally a pirate deck i think it may be an idea when the set is big enough to include previous expansions for instance say in rotation when wotog whatever rotates out to put gvg or naxx back into the rotation
hearthstone,not_removed,no i like that the meta will change so drastically itll keep the game fresh im not really interested in playing against the same decks forever
hearthstone,not_removed,if they wanted to do this loatheb would be in the classic set its safe to say that everything will rotate
hearthstone,not_removed,id say they could be the next shaman but shaman already had totem golem and tunnel trogg what does priest have going for it in whispers just cthun priest and embrace the shadows
hearthstone,not_removed,it should stay blackrock is out next year
hearthstone,not_removed,youre currently in such a period more sets will rotate in this year without anything rotating out
hearthstone,not_removed,tgt was definitely underwhelming it only really had top tier cards in justicar and mysterious challenger one of which is nowhere near as good without a gvg card it did have new mechanics in joust inspire though so i can appreciate blizzard trying to create something new
hearthstone,not_removed,thank god
hearthstone,not_removed,not as relevant as you think entomb is awful in anything other than control vs control
hearthstone,not_removed,i agree with you on elise im glad heavy control decks will have to actually play lategame again instead of just removal
hearthstone,not_removed,dont worry the first set of will include our shadow word horror for entomb itll look something like mana summon a copy of a minion and silence the original
hearthstone,not_removed,i play yl more than anything else the emperor will be missed but i dont think that hes essential at least i hope not
hearthstone,not_removed,as a fellow dragon deck aficionado i agree while brm may be described as the birthplace of the dragon decks they wouldnt work without the anti aggro cards that tgt gave them twilight guardian and chillmaw are just too crucial against aggro
hearthstone,not_removed,thats how card games work fam mechs got their sick expansion warlock players had a sick demon expansion dragon players had their sick expansion palladin got everyfin to make controlcombo murlocs the next set could have its own cool tribal theme or no tribal theme at all dragons mechs murlocs demons will never leave the game entirely and tribal players will eventually play wild look at magic for instance while there are always goblins merfolk elves treefolk and literally like other tribes in any given standard the eternal format has allmost of the fun toys for said tribes with the exception of whatever tribetribes are featured in the most recent expansions
hearthstone,not_removed,everything that was released in the year in this case
hearthstone,not_removed,but between the classic set which are normally a set of extremely strong cards and legendaries and a small handful of you should be able to play several viable standard decks im a free player and thats what im doing
hearthstone,not_removed,im not that worried about entomb even so sure its amazing in control games but its a dead card against all these aggro and zoo decks and mediocre against mid range because often youre too far behind on board in invest to remove a target
hearthstone,not_removed,axe flinger doesnt work bc when you feeze his hp at one taking more dmg will not activate his ability
hearthstone,not_removed,minion warrior common brm 🐙 httphearthstonegamepediacomaxeflinger mana whenever this minion takes damage deal damage to the enemy hero callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to pm
hearthstone,not_removed,youve got a while
hearthstone,not_removed,whenever the first expansion of releases could be january could be july who knows
hearthstone,not_removed,save up unless you desperately want to play dragon decks in wild after it rotates out
hearthstone,not_removed,triggered
hearthstone,not_removed,yes it is worth it if you get cards needed for your preferred decks after the cards rotate out you can dust them the dust value from brm is around of the dust value of the same gold value of card packs and loe gives slightly more dust of course with packs you can get cards you keep so they can be worth a lot more so even loe will only be worth it if you intend to use the cards from it
hearthstone,not_removed,also brms priest challenge allows you to play with a premade deck full of legendaries its great to experiment with them before you craft one on them
hearthstone,not_removed,it was posted by ben brode days ago it rotates out in loe then he clarified later and said its you can check his twitter yourself
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,to be fair aint much to miss for tgt lol but yeah i think this enable them to have a more cohesive plan with releasing cards and gives them a more reliable image of the meta to release new cards with a card pack going and coming at the same time would be it much harder to predict and therefor balance new cards
hearthstone,not_removed,you missed the memo hard boy
hearthstone,not_removed,when the first set old gods came out blizzard rotated out all of the cards thats naxx and gvg when the first set comes out blizzard will rotate out all of the cards thats brm tgt and loe
hearthstone,not_removed,zoo utterly crushes tempo mages and that rare initial draw rng to pull a massive flamewaker combo is the only way the mage can ever win i get it that it sucks to lose to that coming out of nowhere but really the mage is the underdog in that match and from his point of view absolutely everything about zoo is broken as fuck as a mage fan im happy to see flamewaker go if it means that they can design mage in a less initial card draw rng direction because right now too many match ups come down to lets see its turn did i draw flamewaker and a bunch of cheap spells no bah might as well concede then
hearthstone,not_removed,it was posted by ben brode days ago it rotates out in loe then he clarified later and said its you can check his twitter yourself he clarified on reddit as well
hearthstone,not_removed,it looks more like a lot of control decks will suck now p
hearthstone,not_removed,honestly i think people underestimate ee the fact it gives it to your opponent is honestly a good bonus and the damage is the perfect amount against most decks you need aoe for patron pirate shaman hunter and zoo mostly have health minions or less it also puts a dead draw into aggro decks which can actually win you games
hearthstone,not_removed,i think a lot of priest lists dont run justicar if not most although they are the second most beneficial class from justicar i have a feeling priest will be getting a lot more than they lose
hearthstone,not_removed,yes they are
hearthstone,not_removed,he did but it was a typo loe rotates out with brm and tgt when the first expansion of releases
hearthstone,not_removed,he clarified later that its going out in it was a mistake on his part
hearthstone,not_removed,yes because being put to hp on turn is a wonderful play experience that encourages people to continue playing the game
hearthstone,not_removed,renos battlecry is actually were gonna be rich not reeeeeeennooooo
hearthstone,not_removed,zoo will never be useless the main idea behind the archetype will be the same and as long as there are strong early game minions and synergy cards it wont go anywhere
hearthstone,not_removed,miracle rogue only players a lot
hearthstone,not_removed,dark peddler was a fantastic drop both in zoo and every warlock deck its no surprise its ran in every warlock variant good drops for classes are somewhat of a rarity its why tempo mage runs cult sorcerer for instance its spellpower is good but half the cards effect the cthun bit isnt used priests have been dying for a drop that doesnt suck minion wise theres very few good class drops that arent situational cards
hearthstone,not_removed,good one
hearthstone,not_removed,loe is rotating in with brm
hearthstone,not_removed,bbrode clarified it is rotating out in the tweet was a mistake i might be wrong if something was announced after this this is from days ago
hearthstone,not_removed,in fact superjj plays a version where he has removed it for skeram cultist
hearthstone,not_removed,new taunts could compensate for that
hearthstone,not_removed,until she gets rotated out that might be true
hearthstone,not_removed,in what world is bash mediocre damage kills almost any drop and gives you armor bashshield slam is a guaranteed damage for mana that gives you armor
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think hurting priest matters when priest is clearly one is the weakest classes
hearthstone,not_removed,yea but the armor each turn is huge
hearthstone,not_removed,it hurts the fatigue match ups but really the only fatigue match ups you were gonna win were against warrior or priest paladins dudes will overwhelm you and most other decks wouldnt run to fatigue probably see alextrasa come back to help close out matches
hearthstone,not_removed,yes but deathsbite and shield maiden helped a lot
hearthstone,not_removed,cw will just have to go back to having win conditions other than just elise justicar not a bad thing if you ask me
hearthstone,not_removed,not the control variants cw is one of the last competitive control deck remove that and well all have the pleasure of enjoying a aggrotempo meta im not ready to see hs die of cancer so young
hearthstone,not_removed,yeh how dare they have multiple viable decks we dont want that also how dare a control deck actually work in ladder nerf nerf nerf
hearthstone,not_removed,not control warrior though tempo warrior deserves a hit
hearthstone,not_removed,i disagree warrior is probably the best class right now but i wouldnt call it op its just as good as it is because it has like legend viable decks
hearthstone,not_removed,more cheap class taunts is all priest needs as soon as we could make by with the taunt it was a competitive class again its what makes dragon priest okay the conditional taunt and the conditional taunt made it viable not op or top tier level but at least working such a simple thing denied to the class that wants minions to heal the most and we dont get it
hearthstone,not_removed,dragon warrior is arguably right now scroll down to power rankings
hearthstone,not_removed,not quite the upper echelon but i hit legend for the first time ever with a midrange shaman list corruptors and fire elementals are pretty damn good in the midgame
hearthstone,not_removed,blackwing corruptor is the reason to play dragon decks in the first place the card is pretty bonkers
hearthstone,not_removed,you just named all the cards that make playing dragons worth it so the only important cards were losing are all of them
hearthstone,not_removed,i would put blackwing corruptor on twilight guardian level definitly
hearthstone,not_removed,ummm blackwing corrupter
hearthstone,not_removed,please no more troggs i am with kripp on this regard cards like mana wyrm or trogg are way too strong for their cost and are extremely dangerous to the game
hearthstone,not_removed,how about tunnel golem and totem trogg
hearthstone,not_removed,how about a mana with mana overload it couldnt possibly be broken
hearthstone,not_removed,i hope they dont continue to push shaman in the aggro direction
hearthstone,not_removed,i really hope they give us a good new totem aswell as something that benefits from overload but isnt the same as trogg
hearthstone,not_removed,or a ton of other good cards if no real good or drops
hearthstone,not_removed,priest treatment youll lose your strong cards and get nothing in return not that i mind fuck aggro shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,no class needs and liek that not even shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,naw no fucking replacements to make the class aggro oriented let them die or switch to control
hearthstone,not_removed,yea but its mainly because it summons totem golem xd
hearthstone,not_removed,one of those cards that never quite got a full chance in standard happened to some naxx and gvg cards too
hearthstone,not_removed,technically they rotate when the first set of cards comes out so around spring not january
hearthstone,not_removed,on the plus side it makes their design way simpler because they can just throw down the theme at the beginning of the year and gradually expand on it also rotating it simply by set age would kind of pigeonhole them into making all the sets fairly independent
hearthstone,not_removed,the reason they go by years is so they can change the amount of expansions released per year and not really ruin anything whether that is more or less per year remains to be seen but imagine if they currently kept the last expansions in standard which fits their per year what if they were able to amp up production of expansions to per year now you have significantly less time to play with them
hearthstone,not_removed,honestly im quite looking forward to it when loe emperor have rotated out wild will start to live up to its name because there will be a lot of things that only work there
hearthstone,not_removed,wild will probably be the only place i play afterwards reno is just too much fun
hearthstone,not_removed,especially reno imho reno decks are really fun to think about and play because there is so many possibilities
hearthstone,not_removed,are cards possibly going to be promoted in that way
hearthstone,not_removed,really ive always thought of reno and elise as the more rng legendaries of the reno makes draw rng much more prominent than other decks and elise promotes the answers elise kind of decks that use her as their sole win condition i much prefer finley and brann
hearthstone,not_removed,i wouldnt mind seeing justicar added to classic as well without that card control warrior and control priest just dont work very well it is also really good for mid range paladin
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think reno is well designed a lot of games come down to did he draw reno early enough which is unhealthy for the game imo
hearthstone,not_removed,depends what kind of deck you play if youre playing a combo deck like me maly hallazeal harrison that isnt too interactive it wont matter much
hearthstone,not_removed,yep it never was going to be super big this year anyways losing sets that had op and semi annoying cards but looking at the list this is a lot of cards people love and its going to drive the hype for the wild format
hearthstone,not_removed,you do realize loe is in wild already right
hearthstone,not_removed,minion neutral legendary loe 🐙 httphearthstonegamepediacomarchthiefrafaam mana battlecry discover a powerful artifact callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to pm
hearthstone,not_removed,why are you scared of climbing up the ladder
hearthstone,not_removed,how is roflstomping newbies in casual any better than laddering with annoying decks
hearthstone,not_removed,if you really have to please just play them on ladder
hearthstone,not_removed,dark peddler is arguably stronger than inp gang as it makes it more likely you have a strong curve rather than just being a body dont get me wrong imp gang is an amazing card its just he feels super slow nowadays where as peddler can give you strong tempo plays with soulfiremortal coil or provide strong board presence with flame imppossessed villager
hearthstone,not_removed,i really like tempo mage but i do think it could do with losing flamewaker and being given something a little less infuriating any minion that interacts with spellcasts is a fine replacement hopefully it wont be as rng based
hearthstone,not_removed,too bad brawl is still wild format
hearthstone,not_removed,so long trogg you miserable bastard
hearthstone,not_removed,without tomb pillager gad based decks are basically gone
hearthstone,not_removed,and with reno gone there probably isnt going to be a viable control warlock strategy anymore unless it gets serious help from another set which sucks
hearthstone,not_removed,i love entomb but for mana i would never add more than one to a deck i think its cost is what limits its appeal
hearthstone,not_removed,entomb is mana and is only useful against other control decks
hearthstone,not_removed,i remember when the card came out a lot of people were saying that very few decks would not benefit from running thaurissan tournaments the first week of brm had him featured in basically every deck its funny to think that a card that was seemingly op at launch turned out to be necessary to keeping combo style decks relevant
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean it is that good there just arent any viable combo decks if a combo deck exists it will run thaurissan miracles is the exception only because all their spells cost pretty much nothing already
hearthstone,not_removed,on the other hand maybe thaurissans existence is why blizzard hasnt been printing other good combo cards
hearthstone,not_removed,the card will be missed in malyrogue also controll warrior will be a lot weaker without justicar very curious to see how those two classes work out
hearthstone,not_removed,i just had a massive nostalgia rush after digging into duel masters that was some good shit
hearthstone,not_removed,hope they bring back discover back sometime for another stint in the standard meta they did print more discover cards in wtog a light in the darkness journey below so i think they intend to print a few more with each new expansion inspire looks like its done now tho
hearthstone,not_removed,tog had two discover cards journey below and a light in the darkness i think blizzard really likes the mechanic so i doubt it goes away im surprised inspire is looking like it will go away its a good uncomplicated way to have ondemand triggered effects from minions without add something to the interface to spend mana on a card effect rather than playing a card or pressing the button
hearthstone,not_removed,i think the combination of losing entomb and the entire dragon priest archetype will be one of the largest loses of any class to date
hearthstone,not_removed,finally no more mana for warlocks
hearthstone,not_removed,of all brann too powerful really i had a brainfart i wanted to write justicar elise and reno
hearthstone,not_removed,and blade flurry with the nerf of blade flurry mill rogue doesnt even work in wild
hearthstone,not_removed,shouldve been priest
hearthstone,not_removed,i loved getting one out of spellslinger on my yogg mage
hearthstone,not_removed,thing is youre throwing away a card and mana for an effect that doesnt even benefit you right away getting tirions in your deck sounds nice on paper but its actually not that amazing unless youre winning already compare to cards like forgotten torch and elise starseeker which shuffle beneficial cards in your deck but have an impact when theyre played as well those cards actually see play
hearthstone,not_removed,i think ultimately naxx was a better experience it really taught them what the powerlevel of cards should be as just about every single card in naxx was used in a toptier deck gvg was an experiment of well what if we make cards that are just as strong but random and it proved that no no you cannot
hearthstone,not_removed,arguably better but much weaker to hard removals
hearthstone,not_removed,like freeze mage and zoo
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think you will play the same decks forever unless a card or subset of cards is so strong that it defines a deck in which case it would almost certainly be dropped from standard the counter argument is that if you cull the card pool so heavily then the game becomes stale through a lack of choice its fun being able to build new inventive decks and if the card pool is too small then the variety of decks becomes limiting
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe continue the deathrattle angle with nzoth and shifting shade this would make sense from a theme standpoint since priest should be all about life death and positivenegative healing
hearthstone,not_removed,tgt had far more than top tier cards in it pal
hearthstone,not_removed,avenge is from naxx but yeah
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean you can live without it but can you say youre satisfied to you core without a card lock and load i for one will miss it dearly and think they should make a card which reduces spells cost by every turn or as a battle cry just a thought
hearthstone,not_removed,holy smokesthat post was months ago yousir are either a stalker or a digger
hearthstone,not_removed,so far my favorite tribe is squirrel
hearthstone,not_removed,yeahim already planning on a large deathrattle hunter deck in wild with things like feign deathbaron rivendareundertaker and so on
hearthstone,not_removed,agreed entomb is basically a tech card against control my main issue with basing priest on cards like entomb is how rng based those revive mechanics are thats what i like about revive effects like kel thuzad and nzoth
hearthstone,not_removed,you can still do it but you have to use rampage to increase his hp the real reason it doesnt work is that it requires an emperor tick on cards most viable otk decks malygos worgen etc only require cards for their combo
hearthstone,not_removed,ah that does make sense thank you
hearthstone,not_removed,the point is that flamewaker by itself is incredibly op weather its vs zoo or anything else no other mana card can unleash a fury of offense like he can if the card text read battlecry deal damage at random enemies it would never even get made of course thats exactly what he does and in my experience its closer to than on an empty board flamewaker coin arcane missiles arcane missiles damage to the face the mage just unleashed an upgraded pyroblast a unit on turn please tell me what other mana minion even comes remotely close to doing this
hearthstone,not_removed,for some reason i was expecting set and adventure to come out and the same amount to rotate each year oh well
hearthstone,not_removed,reeeenoooooo jaaaaackkksoooooon
hearthstone,not_removed,i perfectly understand what you say still if i remember correctly when loe came out dark peddler only replaced other dire wolf alpha haunted creeper it never created archetypes now tell me how dark peddler rotating out of zoo and reno decks will change the meta please
hearthstone,not_removed,the absolute madman
hearthstone,not_removed,list opened a golden skeram i been wanting to use
hearthstone,not_removed,well elise is also going away but shaman and zoo are losing some early aggro tools and no other control class comes close to warrior control warrior existed without elise and justicar before surely it can adapt after the new expansion no doubt that armor each turn is really good value but cw will still be good i think
hearthstone,not_removed,true i think it will really hurt the more standard control variants but cthun will probably still see a lot of play you just dont need justicar when you can gain armor in a single game without even pushing the button
hearthstone,not_removed,alex grom will always be there
hearthstone,not_removed,considering everybody brings tempo warrior to tournaments yeah its pretty op
hearthstone,not_removed,i know but its doing so without any of the cool legendary dragons i shouldve been more clear in my comment i always wished there was a top level deck that ran ysera chillmaw nefarian cards like that its ok to drop a on turn but its just not the card i was hoping to be my lethal damage
hearthstone,not_removed,tier really i havent been impressed by the dragon warriors ive come across other than when they turn coin blackwing corruptor turn blackwing corruptor which is all the time still zoo feels way scarier
hearthstone,not_removed,trogg is a way worse offender by far imo spells are mostly reactional and they are oneuseonly overload comes with anything mostly minions that just stick to the board until theyre removed
hearthstone,not_removed,they are extremely dangerous and we must deal with them hydraulic press sound in the background
hearthstone,not_removed,trogg is worse because it takes the balance from too many cards and makes it an advantage wyrm is strong but more balanced because it doesnt make other cards unbalanced grows at a smoother and more manageable rate and you need a lot of spells to get the best effect
hearthstone,not_removed,i like the darkshire councilman route although maybe not health then again the balance is so tricky undertaker probably the easiest of this type of minion to grow is completely unplayable with a single health fewer i know undertaker was once broken as hell im comparing the current iteration to trogg and wyrm
hearthstone,not_removed,should only have two overload you have to make sure that its undercosted even after you add the overload
hearthstone,not_removed,they kinda have to shaman is a board control class similair to pally so unless youre playing a hardcore control list in a class with an awful hero power for it and low healing ability you have to go for board which means the deck has to be fast in order to get and hold board and a fast deck will tend towards aggro look at how shaman evolved even post wotog we had the slower totemmy midrange shaman as top dog for a bit off of super strong cards but it was eventually completely supplanted by the faster version this has been a truth since beta with shaman mirrors and decks in general the faster shaman deck will almost always win the mirror and will generally have a better match up spread
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,edit replied to the wrong comment
hearthstone,not_removed,also it causes minimeta shifts once or twice a year with the or expansion in a year and one huge meta shift the first expansion releases and old expansions go out not sure if this is on purpose but is certainly a sideaffect
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe they will release cards that are as well designed as reno and elise
hearthstone,not_removed,i wouldnt say i dislike him but this is the problem i have with reno a lot of matchups feel like draw reno win dont draw reno lose the nature of the decks of each card also makes draw variance more prominent even apart from reno it feels bad when your opponent draws the card they have to answer you multiple times in a game
hearthstone,not_removed,its not restricted to it
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont want to make the ladder worse than what it already is
hearthstone,not_removed,we must have very different casual mmr i see meta decks and the occasional person who is probably playing a nonmeta deck for fun but clearly isnt new
hearthstone,not_removed,igb and villager are the sole reason that zoolock works so good and is almost impossible to properly boardclear against
hearthstone,not_removed,imp gang boss is super strong man its one of the cards that can swing a match the turn its played cus it demands so much from your opponent to clear it damage in one hit at that point in the game is hard to come by and even if you do you still need another action to remove it completely its the card i hate seeing most if im on warrior it almost always sticks and gets a value trade with a buff next turn
hearthstone,not_removed,any minion that interacts with spellcasts is a fine replacement you mean
hearthstone,not_removed,im hopeful that will be addressed in the next expansion besides the boring zoo deck lock would be totally dead in the meta otherwise
hearthstone,not_removed,handlock already has its tools from old gods the deck is solid people not experimenting with handlock is not a fault of the deck rather a testament to how strong reno is
hearthstone,not_removed,i play decks with copies but it is fun when people think you only have one and you use it on something underwhelming because you have the second and then they play something really good for the second one
hearthstone,not_removed,if you set out to build a deck and need an extra card thaurissan can just be shoved into the slot and work out perfectly well as decks get more tuned cards like this lose their place in lists
hearthstone,not_removed,compared to pallys early game
hearthstone,not_removed,hes like thaurrisan or malygos but a drop if he survives one turn you just know something bad is gonna happen
hearthstone,not_removed,with the blade flurry nerf rogue just barely works in standard i often wonder if rogue with mana blade flurry would have brought balance to constructed as a counter to zoo and shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,rip oil rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,i frequently played mill rogue without flurry preog and it worked nicely swap in doomsayers and drakes instead
hearthstone,not_removed,this card costs just mana i think this is a fairly decent card to use in a close control matchup but then again how many control rogues do we see out there
hearthstone,not_removed,except dr boom because he was even stronger and the rng effects only help you
hearthstone,not_removed,i guess but it had very few argent horserider and flame juggler are probably the only neutrals apart from justicar that were top tier some of the dragons were fine but dragon decks have always struggled other than that living roots and arcane blast i guess count kings elekk maybe flash heal totem golem and tuskarr totemic i suppose are up there as well as bash the problem is that most of those are not much better than their alternatives in terms of meta defining cards justicar and mc were the main two
hearthstone,not_removed,i wont deny that im just saying that its not essential to the deck even after et rotates out we should still be able to have fun with the deck thats all
hearthstone,not_removed,was trying to find an actual list of cards rotating out in found a list misread the date i am very smart
hearthstone,not_removed,is the golden paradigm for combo decks worgen does it with chargeinner ragefaceless malylock did it with malyrogue has always been janky precisely because it requires a very large emperor proc without having a great way of achieving the time needed for the large proc its really sad to see emperor leave though by far the coolest card theyve released and one that showed they werent scared of releasing crazy powerful cards
hearthstone,not_removed,it would never even get made clearly you werent around for goblin blastmage lol which is exactly the text you described with a way better stat distribution too its nothing special for cards to be broken when played with a bunch of cards that synergise with them arcane missiles and mirror image are both really bad cards on their own and really good with flamewaker but flamewaker isnt broken just because it has really good synergy with low cost spells what mana minion comes close to doing this a certain rogue legendary comes to mind also questing adventurer and mana addict
hearthstone,not_removed,i bet hed even lay down on the floor if you told him to what a nutter
hearthstone,not_removed,but shaman and zoo are losing some early aggro tools didnt i heard this in march when people said the meta would slow down
hearthstone,not_removed,no other control class comes close to warrior it depends on how do you see it its defnitely the best antiaggro control deck out there but headsup against other control decks warrior is probably the worst he loses to most variants of control priest and nzoth paladin which also is a control deck and even renolock is slightly favoured against them
hearthstone,not_removed,have you tried nzoth dragon pala deck ive been fooling around with it around ranks these days and its surprisingly successful of course with such a high curve surviving the early game vs aggro is a bit hard but if you manage to stabilize around turn you win of the time also control decks beside priests are pretty much an auto win the downside is that is a bit expensive
hearthstone,not_removed,big problem with spells however is that the coin is a spell this makes mana wyrm go absolute nuts in the early game
hearthstone,not_removed,mana wyrm will stick around forever though and it can be quite the bullshit card
hearthstone,not_removed,both of those minions put you on a clock they need to be killed asap or they get ridiculous value tempo mages curve has gone down anton not even played flamestrike is a tech choice so its really not that uncommon for a mage to have spell that costs or less on turn
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah but spells make it easier to keep the wyrm alive unless shaman plays tauntusually only feral spirits or taunt totem that early in the game any answer to trogg will clear it that is not the case for mana wyrm as the tempo mage will keep you off the board and frostbolt your face so you cannot clear it with anything except direct removal
hearthstone,not_removed,for todays bonus content we have this annoyotron that is very dangerous we must destroy it hydralic press sound
hearthstone,not_removed,right i would recommend it being a with overload instead drop them to hp by the time they even have a chance to remove it gg if you have coin on turn and both in hand seems fair
hearthstone,not_removed,what that would just be a double buffed totem golem
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean theres already some shadow cards
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean if they take reno justicar and elise away from me im going aggro priest for sure fuck that shit
hearthstone,not_removed,i play midrange shaman mainly and cant agree more my worst wr is against shaman due to most on ladder being aggro i like the concept of shaman as midrange however and they can continue to push it hopefully it curves out nicely and has the tools needed to hold out against slightly faster decks imo totem golem is a bigger loss than trogg golem is good solid board that can trade well to allow for your biger minions trogg is a make or break card if you dont have lots of overload its a mana with a huge target on its head golem is consistent you know how you curve out and you know what its impact is and for midrange that consistent curve and having strong reliable minions is key
hearthstone,not_removed,unbound isnt really the same for one its a mana so it gets removed super fast because when you play it the opponent probably knows you got an overload or two up your sleeve
hearthstone,not_removed,minion shaman common classic 🐙 httphearthstonegamepediacomunboundelemental mana whenever you play a card with overload gain callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to pm
hearthstone,not_removed,what are you talking about
hearthstone,not_removed,yogg and nzoth are a nudge in that direction though right i dont think anything can replace reno elise at one point every single one of my decks included both they were a fantastic starting point for someone just starting the game interesting decks for nearly all classes spectacular
hearthstone,not_removed,they do need to keep at least one if your deck has only one copy of any card do extremely op effect in standard at all times
hearthstone,not_removed,the good part about reno is that it enables new deck archetypes
hearthstone,not_removed,i realize this but the point was made that loe entering wild would make wild more interesting thats what i was replying to
hearthstone,not_removed,you arent making the ladder any better you are just making casual worse
hearthstone,not_removed,starting with the stats the card is so much worse than flamewaker mage is going to certainly need something
hearthstone,not_removed,minion mage rare og 🐙 httphearthstonegamepediacomdementedfrostcaller mana after you cast a spell freeze a random enemy callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to pm
hearthstone,not_removed,the problem with df is that a its inferior to flamewaker and tempo mage isnt that strong so i dont think it would remain top tier without fw and b it is still rng based i think making a card that interacts with spell casts that has minimal rng is far healthier for the game for example a more expensive card that discovered spells each time you cast one i know this is likely op but the sentiment remains
hearthstone,not_removed,indeed personally i anticipate that either a slower list running tomes yogg and antonidas i think losing arcane blast and flamewaker will result in a much weaker early game of course with new sets maybe mage will become the new face deck either way change will happen
hearthstone,not_removed,no slow warlock decks must have a lot of healing to make up for the unavoidable life loss which is why reno is so popular the reason handlock is not played in standard was the absence of good healing effects now after the molten giant nerf i dont know if the deck would even be viable with healbot
hearthstone,not_removed,never thought of that before that would have made a much different meta
hearthstone,not_removed,it would be a totally different ballgame current aggro decks can fearlessly flood the board against rogue knowing it has very few ways to punish doing damage aoe is nearly impossible for rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,the card is a much higher cost than mana if it drew a card in addition to its effect i could see it seeing play outside of dedicated mill decks but asis no way
hearthstone,not_removed,totem golem is having a much bigger effect on the meta than justicar is right now
hearthstone,not_removed,true just so in love with the deck ill be sad if they break it
hearthstone,not_removed,i have no problem with vancleef because at least i have a turn to deal with him it would be broken as all hell if he had charge though and goblin blastmage was broken as all hell too one broken card doesnt justify another
hearthstone,not_removed,rmadlads
hearthstone,not_removed,and it did we lost face hunter almost completely and face shaman is much weaker than midrange shaman which is slower and zoo well zoo is eternal
hearthstone,not_removed,well the meta didnt slow down because stuff like trogg is still around and the late game threats dont really exist and they get run down by aggro but when shaman loses trogg and totem golem there will be a loss in early game power the meta thing was hypothetical based on a meta shift the shaman thing is not hypothetical they will lose trogg and golem we just have to see if they give shaman any more early tools
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe but will priest be as good against control warrior without entomb prior to loe the priestwarrior matchup was in warriors favor entomb shifted that due primarily to fatigue implications that card has its hard to say which will be better in a world without justicar or entomb edit spelling
hearthstone,not_removed,depends on how you tech the deck control warriors right now play and baron geddon and a lot of them also run bash ghoul and bloodhoof right now its geared towards gimping decks that rely on gaining early tempo advantage in a control heavy meta cw would run sylvanas alex varian and the like and there also cards like shield slam and execute that are malleable enough to be used in either matchup
hearthstone,not_removed,he loses to nzoth paladin really not disagreeing i dont play either of those decks so have no experience in the matchup but i assumed that so long as you hold back one of your brawls it would be relatively simple for control warrior to take on nzoth decks why is this so good for paladin
hearthstone,not_removed,well fair enough cw loses to some other control decks i would say that cw beats priest though but loses to nzoth pally but overall matchup spread cw does very well and crushes aggro which is why i would say its the control deck
hearthstone,not_removed,he loses to most variants of control priest and nzoth paladin which also is a control deck and even renolock is slightly favoured against them a control warrior shouldnt be losing very often to nzoth paladin brawl completely negates the win condition and control warrior has a better fatigue advantage nzoth paladin is only effective when your opponent doesnt understand the deck which is why is was super effective for a couple weeks then fell off dramatically
hearthstone,not_removed,ive been toying with something very similar kibler was playing i found it was getting wrecked by pretty much every shaman and zoo i faced gave up on it quickly even though it seemed like it could be great
hearthstone,not_removed,also flamewalker is a bit op nothing like getting shot up by flamewalker after mage plays coin and then magic missile
hearthstone,not_removed,as a mage going second if you draw the wyrm you can usually get a wyrm coin mirror image on your first hand and have a on the board with two protectors its quite powerful early on
hearthstone,not_removed,the thing is it basically enables a tempo mage without flamewaker to exist its something very uniquely mage and thats ok trogg is not just not thematic its boring it fills a gaping shaman weakness in a way that makes the class less interesting councilman is a similar card i have zero problems with because it is also a very fitting warlock card that encourages zoo to play how zoo should play
hearthstone,not_removed,before flamewaker tempo mage wasnt anywhere near as strong so i wouldnt worry about mana wyrm after fw leaves standard
hearthstone,not_removed,imo should be a id also nerf secretkeeper the same way they nerfed undertaker tbh i realize neither of those cards are as strong as undertaker was or even trogg is now and i know tempo mage isnt the strongest deck but i just dont really believe that you should be able to buff a cost minion into a gamewinning monster
hearthstone,not_removed,when you compare the two its kind of crazy unbound is two more mana but only gets even if it can gain health as well as attack making it more durable its still a testament to tunnel trogg
hearthstone,not_removed,oh im stupid and replied to the wrong comment should have been to the parent of that
hearthstone,not_removed,he means he is not very good with those decks and thus he uses them merely because win or lose the matches are quick which is reasonable imo considering they make it so you have to play ranked or casual or tavern brawl for your quests regardless id recommend d ppl use the wild ladder instead of casual for such things top fast decks will fair just as well over there you gain wins towards your gold characters that say
hearthstone,not_removed,you severely underrate imp gang boss its a in stats for minimum right now and can easily end up being a tokens are super valuable in zoo with argus and po and reliquary and sea giant and darkshire its one of the best cards in the deck just from a value perspective if it can tank one hit without dying its worth more than a yeti
hearthstone,not_removed,imo its still the strongest drop in the game right now just hard for most classes to clear and basically guarantees the warlock player board presence for the next few turns
hearthstone,not_removed,also flamewanker kills instead of freezing death is then best cc
hearthstone,not_removed,a mage lock n load with a body
hearthstone,not_removed,agreed without the threat of moltensomething andor some solid healing itll be tough for handlock to come back to even a shadow of its former self it doesnt have to dominate i just want it to exist in a decent fashion even though i also like zoo
hearthstone,not_removed,healbot rotating out hurt the game there needs to be a strong hero heal on an understatted card at all times teching it in for effectively extra health is what keeps facehunter at bay
hearthstone,not_removed,faceless shambler is a potentially nuts card that still hasnt had its day in the sun chogall is a card everyone knows would be nuts if warlock had cards like implosion or darkbomb which likely they are to get that power level of spell at some time in the future nzoth and cthun both add a completely new lategame option if you favor their styles to lord j handlock was done when leeroy was nerfed so was miracle rogue druid was the worst class when they lost their combo patron warrior was unplayable without warsong commander strong archetypes will always be around the class with a card drawing hero power will always have a control deck the class with combo as a mechanic will always have a miracle deck the class that gets mana ramp will always have a deck that just cheats out some kind of unfair board state the class that gets a mana charging pig will always charge pigs at your face some things never change
hearthstone,not_removed,doing damage aoe is impossible for almost all classes aggro boards are just so damn sticky now you need two card combos to have a shot auchenaicircle equalityconsecration or equalitypyro etc the only decent board clears minus any they may add are flamestrike which comes too late to save you and excavated evil which is for priest
hearthstone,not_removed,your statement of it would never even get made is just factually incorrect though since they did make that card and will continue to make similar cards rogue can easily give vancleef stealth btw
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you so much
hearthstone,not_removed,umm all top shaman lists are the aggroface variant now midrange things from below tbluff valiants fire eles whatever else costs and isnt a doom hammer lists are incredibly rare nowadays most lists curve top at doom hammer and play for damage unless very good trades are presented
hearthstone,not_removed,zoo malganis
hearthstone,not_removed,it really depends on the state of both decks postrotation we cant tell that yet because theres new cards to come
hearthstone,not_removed,whenever we lose loe entomb is easily one of the top cards being lost its just such strong spot removal silence remove and avoid the graveyard is such a strong effect even before you actually get the card placed in your deck and the card is always helpful as you picked what to use it on
hearthstone,not_removed,no probably not before loe warrior was priests second worst matchup after rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think cw would run varian in a control meta because it overextends into aoe and draws closer to fatigue but yeah generally i agree control warrior can be built to beat other slow decks cthun warrior in particular is very good at this right now
hearthstone,not_removed,justicar wins fatigue
hearthstone,not_removed,priests are kings of lategame with their current card choices namely entomb and ability to grind out almost anyone the only situations where they absolutely fold is early jaraxxus because they have no burst and constant spam of is impossible to overcome warriors best shot at beating priest is either having a much better monkey outcome or being able to go for surprise burst from grom because otherwise both players will trade removal on their threats but priest will come out on top with entomb
hearthstone,not_removed,its not nzoth that wins this matchup for paladin its the justicar with dudes that outclass warrior in fatigue game
hearthstone,not_removed,if you think control warrior wins vs nzoth paladin you are incredibly misinformed nzoth paladin properly played can force a warrior to use both brawls before slamming the titular win con and make monkey a null card by threatening a devastating nzoth turn if you play against a nzoth paladin who plays the card before seeing both brawls then you are playing vs bad players
hearthstone,not_removed,they just wake up fire they dont walk on it
hearthstone,not_removed,this was my game plan for last weeks brawl
hearthstone,not_removed,mana wyrm is definitely powerful but trogg is even more insane in most cases when you consider that shaman has insane and drops that buff it the minion you get from overload also gives sustained value as opposed to a single use spell and then on top of that if you overload for more than you get an even higher buff to trogg
hearthstone,not_removed,i had that opening recently and got rekt on turn by auchenai circle the counters are real
hearthstone,not_removed,amateurmuch better is going first then on turn sorceress apprentice and either free missles to instantly kill their minion or the mirror image then turn a secret usually the minion one and a frost bold plus plus whatever your opponent plays next which is almost a guarenteed gg unless warrior
hearthstone,not_removed,you know thats something that actually scares me about the game the large amount of cards people would like to see nerfed to me a much healthier thing would be to see a greater degree of counter play introduced normally im not happy with any nerfs really i think the nerf to pyroblast was alright back in the day as well as those made to shatteredsun cleric and some of the other classic cards back in the day but those are the exception i liked undertaker patron miracle rogue the mana buzzard and i wasnt happy to see them go but hey at least those all did extremely powerful things either by allowing insane card draw or damage with little to no board set up now the moment the game cant handle something on the power level of the mana wyrm thats sad to me im not saying the card isnt strong the truth is that to me its a really good card but i wouldnt say its broken regardless even if it were id be much happier seeing some counters to it introduced rather than nerfing it to the ground as a solution cause they tried to do that against undertaker bringing in cards like lil exorcist and the paladin one that targeted minions with deathrattle in gvg maybe they didnt work well enough i wouldnt know as i played undertaker so wasnt really looking for a way to counter it but i had the feeling that people werent even trying them my guess is that people shied away from those because of the fear of loosing against the nonundertaker decks maybe the counters werent right maybe they didnt want to go overboard and end up with another bgh still with refinement i think counterplay should be the way to deal with annoying cards rather than nerfs as it allows the potential for powerful plays but keeps them in check i t may be a tricky thing to do properly but i think blizzard has now the experience required to do it right ps sorry for the rant but this is a touchy subject to me
hearthstone,not_removed,theres also the fact that the elemental doesnt gain its buff per overload but per overload card played which makes it worse
hearthstone,not_removed,in stats for minimum keep in mind that all my comments are strictly looking at minion combat not stuff like silence or aoe against high damage increments it is more like a attack overkill overkill health minion it never behaves as if it has attack against those targets just like how it would be misleading to say that cthuns chosen will behave like an if cthuns chosen is taken out by a and a it behaved like a softtaunt would have if cthuns chosen kills a before dealing damage to an however it behaved as if it were a sticky things take more hits and can only attack with one part of the body at a time these guys can be looked at as having enough health to tank all of that overkill even vanilla bodies can be expected to tank around damage of overkill but they will always have only their attack stat in terms of pressure on the other hand something like stand against darkness behaves like a cross between a lightspawn and a minion with megawindfury it has all of its pressure all at once yet within each instance of minion combat it deals only damage its sticky in that a few can die while others remain yet it loses some of its damage potential with each recruit that dies silver hand knight is tricky to evaluate because of this it can sort of be represented by the description with windfury yet it loses that fauxwindfury after a bit of combat savannah highmane and wobbling runts are headaches because they use both concepts the first half of wobbling runts is a but the latter half is like a lightspawn so i dont have any idea how i would go about represent the cards combat potential as a whole
hearthstone,not_removed,im not saying the card bad its just the inability to po a imp gang boss by itself hurts a lot compared to most cards zoo plays at any given mana cost its fairly weak a zoo decks mana cards go basically uncontested and can trade up really well peddler basically insures you keep pressuring the board in future turns imp gang trades up but he just does it so much slower than any other card in the deck it takes turns to get full value out of an imp gang where as most card provide immediate board threat
hearthstone,not_removed,it is the strongest drop i feel thats primarily due to the drop slot being quite weak overall with imp gang standing out i just dont think it does as much compared to what cards do for there mana costs
hearthstone,not_removed,found mordekaiser main
hearthstone,not_removed,you dont play tempo mage then flamewanker always goes face if minions on board s
hearthstone,not_removed,handlock in its previous form cannot exist without a strong heal the deck always had a weak matchup against aggro but without healbot its unwinnable while it is possible the deck can survive the molten giant nerf it must have a heal you compared it to miracle rogue and patron warrior but those decks only expefienced a nerf to the power level of a single card while handlock had one of its crucial tools completely removed
hearthstone,not_removed,there has never been a mana minion with the battlecry i described if there has please show me stop bringing up vancleef its a horrible example and doesnt prove anything a better example is prenerf warsong commander
hearthstone,not_removed,i think what he means is that even faceaggro shaman run tuskarr totemic and thing from below which the most aggressive versions of face shaman didnt run when the expansion first released
hearthstone,not_removed,the most popular and effective aggro shaman list right now is xixos which tops out with thing from below and plays for board a bit more and i saw a good amount of midrange shaman on the climb and at low legend last month so i wouldnt call it incredibly rare but in general i agree aggro shaman is stronger than midrange right now
hearthstone,not_removed,may i ask where you look at decklists im not questioning your claim i just want the reference for my own shaman climb
hearthstone,not_removed,this is soooo true its all about context
hearthstone,not_removed,my reasoning behind varian is that it also draws your removal spells besides playing other minions but yeah i get your point
hearthstone,not_removed,makes sense thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,nzoth paladin is usually so far behind by fatigue that it doesnt matter there comes a point where the paladin either falls way behind in card advantage or goes pretty far ahead in fatigue its probably around for control warrior with justicar the warrior can also steal tirion and win on the spot in some games usually card combos
hearthstone,not_removed,i already had this discussion funnily enough earlier today about priest vs warrior i assumed that because you can stack as much armor as you want early while priest can only go to hp that you win the fatigue you dont really have to do anything proactive as warrior against priest because control priest doesnt really run any large threat or finisher so you can just grind it out with tank up
hearthstone,not_removed,or just dont be dumb and dont play into his entombs you know he has entomb and he knows you have huge bombs so just dont play them and dont play your draw he will be forced to save entomb while you can press that tank up button as much as you want he has no pressure you have zero reason to ever draw or apply pressure yourself when you are allowed to have health and he cant go past i win very often against cwars who just drops bombs on curve and draw like mad without any thought but autolose to every cwar who knows how to play around entomb just wait
hearthstone,not_removed,running justicar doesnt really work though if the deck in general works at all which is dubious every other matchup represents a desperate survival problem even without a dead card like justicar ive been trying a lot of paladin lists because im going for the golden hero and its pretty grim
hearthstone,not_removed,he just spent cards and you were going first small team mentality you have
hearthstone,not_removed,ive never had anyone concede on me at that point but most of the time that wyrm only last turns maximum as it becomes a huge target immediately
hearthstone,not_removed,lets not pretend that priests are viable mmk
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah you feel really good when you get it out but then theres always a counter it only has hp
hearthstone,not_removed,amateurmuch better is going first then on turn sorceress apprentice and either free missles to instantly kill their minion or the mirror image why not both
hearthstone,not_removed,no worries about the rant its an interesting point i agree with you that people want everything to be nerfed and its a bit ridiculous mana wyrm certainly doesnt need a nerf nor secretkeeper my main point was that if you nerf trogg then i dont see the rationale for not nerfing those cards you just have to draw the line somewhere i think the key idea is what do you balance around winrate or how something feels because let me tell you mana wyrm coin mirror image on turn one feels like bullcrap if you dont have an answer in your hand even if the stats show that tempo mage is not overpowered
hearthstone,not_removed,what villager is the same it takes turns to get full value peddler you play it on curve and you dont get to play the cost card it gives you until next turn in the mean time you have a knife juggler you play it as a you dont get the value darkshire where is this immediate board threat you are talking about imp gang boss is one of the strongest turn plays in the game it trades well with every drop in the game except thrillhouse it trades up against trades well with and trades evenly with what are you going to play in response to it that makes it a weak play and why wouldnt you power overwhelm it if you think imp gang boss isnt amazing its because you dont know what zoolock is about dont understand its win conditions and probably dont understand hearthstone in general
hearthstone,not_removed,having stuff on the board is your win condition as a lock if he sticks for turns youve probably already won youll miss that card believe me
hearthstone,not_removed,nah im actually a support zed main
hearthstone,not_removed,mordekaiser es numero uno huehuehuehuehuehuehue
hearthstone,not_removed,handlock existed before healbot
hearthstone,not_removed,never been a mana minion with the battlecry i described well now youre just moving the goalposts since i proved you wrong lol plus combo ability is stronger than random damage and about tied with random damage so youre still wrong powerful conditional effects are everywhere in hearthstone flamewaker is the norm not the exception
hearthstone,not_removed,tusmar yes thing from below is mostly out of the lists though
hearthstone,not_removed,meta snapshot and if you go back and look at the last large tourney i think it was play america summerspring championship almost all the lists were aggroface shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,this used to be the case the priest would usually need a good thoughtsteal to win entomb singlehandedly changed that matchup and basically forced control warrior to run fewer threats and more answers
hearthstone,not_removed,you ability to stack up armor doesnt really matter as at the end of the day priests will be ones who have board and having a board can beat up any amounts of armor really unless you are very deep into fatigue
hearthstone,not_removed,sounds about right every game vs priest as cthun warrior takes me minutes minimum as we both clutch our precious cards in our bosom
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont really count coin as a full blown card
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks ronaldo
hearthstone,not_removed,yes but by the time you get the card or the mana to answer it you lost quite a bit of tempo and the mage often snowballs out of control
hearthstone,not_removed,i agree its a strong opener provably the strongest turn im not sure how oppressive it is compared to others though since mage often doesnt have much more to develop the board afterwards except form novice into flamewanker but thats your golden starting hand already overall i dont think either that or trogg should be nerfed maybe im a little biased on the latter since im a shameless face shaman player but whatever still if they were to be nerfed id love to see it happen with a new card that did something like silence all mana minions or destroy target mana minion or take control of target minion this costs more for each mana that minion costs or something of the like im not sure on the details and people can provably come up with better ones than those still thats my idea that way the strong cards arent so problematic anymore essentially if enough people play the new counter cards they can become quite weaker and possibly unplayable depending on the amount of counters as you still have to draw the answer in time for it to be effective yet the card is never dead from the start of a game as it would be the case with warsong for instance the card still has the potential to be as strong as ever its only less likely besides if everyone wants to counter something then you wont play that anymore so the counter becomes less appealing and you go back to the start that way you either eventually reach a point of balance people who still like the card will keep playing it people still annoyed by it will counter it or you get a more shifting metagame both options seem fine to me
hearthstone,not_removed,upvoting for thrillhouse
hearthstone,not_removed,harsh but correct i think i saw someone else say flame imp is the best one drop get after him
hearthstone,not_removed,how is bronze treating you
hearthstone,not_removed,what have they cut for it im still seeing a ton of thing from below in shaman around rank with totemic and totem golem its pretty easy for them to get it for cheap
hearthstone,not_removed,i think its back to the way it was at least in standard priests removal is very inefficient whereas control warrior can take board with midgame threats while also removing things the priest plays for mana priest needs to curve out near perfectly to be able to stop it its different in wild where priest has deathlords to help reach fatigue belchers to be sticky and lightbomb to take care of midgame threats plus museum curator has access to better options than in standard
hearthstone,not_removed,this was true before loe but now priest really cannot afford to run as much greedy value as before so their lategame suffers seriously just play justicar and hold all of your lategame legendaries press that button and win play your midrange threats if you have them soon as he is forced to entomb your mana cards feel free to drop your huge bombs when i play priest i win consistently against warriors who dont do this but lose every time to warriors who actually make any attempt at playing around entomb
hearthstone,not_removed,but priest isnt able to mass any largemedium board due to brawl and large threats get removed by execute or shield slam
hearthstone,not_removed,nonentomb priest just loses double entomb priest wins but theres the option to not play any entomb targets and try to fatigue the priest its how cthun warrior plays against priest successfully
hearthstone,not_removed,they will also play flamewanker on turn guaranteed
hearthstone,not_removed,bloodhoof brave is pretty sweet
hearthstone,not_removed,villager needs buffs to trade with most drops which are played while a lot of drops are now instead of so pebbler doesnt trade with most of as well
hearthstone,not_removed,im only there because of shitty feeder teammates and toxic ragers
hearthstone,not_removed,a reno that restored hp to my hero how
hearthstone,not_removed,simple didnt happen
hearthstone,not_removed,are you saying that is dumb
hearthstone,not_removed,nope unless you had at least one wing unlocked already its gone for good
hearthstone,not_removed,damn that sucks thanks tho
hearthstone,not_removed,never under any circumstances open an alt account pack because if i did get legendaries i know id be so salty
hearthstone,not_removed,this has happened to so many of my friends it happened to me too i got a golden legendary of all things only the second one ive ever seen in a pack i know its bordering on conspiracy theory territory but i wonder if the first packs for new accounts have a higher chance of getting better cards or something
hearthstone,not_removed,i also got legendaries herald and illidan but yours are meta too
hearthstone,not_removed,i got gruul in my acc kinda sad that i spent my luck of the day on an alt but at least i got tge shaman hero in less than an hour for anyone who has yet to get it its best to unlock all heroes and get each one to level your mage will probably be almist level if you use it to unlock heroes and playing against bots would be the best
hearthstone,not_removed,harvest golem did you buy a gvg pack for some reason
hearthstone,not_removed,oh im definitely salty especially after opening over packs on my main and most are from actual cash ill just use this one as my account i guess
hearthstone,not_removed,i made an arena practice account for my weak classes then when i had packs i couldnt resist now i have a full time job doing quests
hearthstone,not_removed,ive heard that conspiracy a lot though i made different accounts and only got the legendaries on one account who knows
hearthstone,not_removed,harvest golem is from the basic set and you cant get gvg packs anymore
hearthstone,not_removed,nope literally only got it to level for the referral and then opened these packs havent spent anything on anything yet
hearthstone,not_removed,full time job doing quests ehh hey boys i found kripps smurf reddit account
hearthstone,not_removed,well ill be damned
hearthstone,not_removed,flamewaker miracle rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,i cant believe no one mentioned this but innervate in basically any class that is not druid
hearthstone,not_removed,ghazrilla lol easy as fuck otk with out thaurissan in warrior strong in mage too and rogue flamewaker archmage sorcerers apprentice mana wyrm arcane intellect in rogue naturalize in rogue mind blast fiery war axe kor kron elite in anything aggressive

hearthstone,not_removed,prep in magehunterdruid
hearthstone,not_removed,orgimmar aspirant in shaman hello doomhammer and mana overload arcanite reaper lovely to see you today
hearthstone,not_removed,call of the wild anywhere
hearthstone,not_removed,embrace the shadows in paladin prophet velen in mage
hearthstone,not_removed,please dont repost this question had been asked a million times
hearthstone,not_removed,mind blast fiery war axe and kor kron hunter sounds pretty cancer
hearthstone,not_removed,varian in other classesexpect priest
hearthstone,not_removed,and now we have more cards to expand the discussion whats wrong with that
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i guess you could say its quite the anomalous
hearthstone,not_removed,its fairly rare ive had it happen once before cant for the life of me remember what they were chance of getting a legendary in a pack is so gives us a chance of getting two congrats on the pull
hearthstone,not_removed,wow the two best legendarily in the game to boot
hearthstone,not_removed,very rare yes ive played since beta and never had in pack or even in packs to be honest since youre new i would consider dusting them they arent great legendries and using that dust to build a cheap deck the best cheap decks atm are zoolock and midrange shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,pretty rare yes
hearthstone,not_removed,awesome thanks guys
hearthstone,not_removed,yes most people who played since beta hasnt gotten legendaries in one pack
hearthstone,not_removed,ooh could you advise me i started about three days ago and received two legendaries as well mine are hogger doom of elwyn and ragnaros the firelord what deck would you suggest i was starting to build a cthun deck but im new so maybe im just heading in the wrong direction
hearthstone,not_removed,hogger doesnt see much play atm but thats not to say its a bad card rag is very good i would be hesitant to dust either of those cards however since your new there is no point having good legendries and nothing else youll ultimately need to make your own call but i would consider dusting them both only if you dont have enough dust already and making good top tier cheapish deck if you can save rag though my suggestion would be midrange shaman there are a few different types but just start with one that best suits the cards you have and then swap them out once you find your own play style there are plenty of guides that will explain better then i can on how to play mid shammy but just make sure its up to date the other deck i would recommend is zoolock again just find an up to date guide and youll be fine zoo is probably a little easier to play and more forgiving if you make a mistake
hearthstone,not_removed,i would definitely advise you to keep ragnaros it will always be a good legendary and will always be playable in standard higher doom of elwynn is a decently good card for a warrior deck and is a great anticthun card to have dont dust them but i personally wouldnt say necessarily to include rag in a cthun deck hogger you could make use of
hearthstone,not_removed,i have a cthunzoolock deck that i play in casual that has the new hogger simply because he spawns minions he makes a good panic target too ive had people go for him and ignore my councilman
hearthstone,not_removed,excuse me sir but what exactly does pot of greed do
hearthstone,not_removed,and its banned since ever one of the most broken cards in the game
hearthstone,not_removed,whats it do
hearthstone,not_removed,pretty much makes every deck a card deck in traditional format
hearthstone,not_removed,its a magic card tat lets you draw cards from your deck
hearthstone,not_removed,you need to run single cards and no duplicates which can significantly cut down on your decks consistency and power level while you arent forced to run dupes every one you include makes it harder for reno to go off without duplicates its less likely you grab the card you need when you need it
hearthstone,not_removed,its a trade off when youre forced to play one card of each your mana curve becomes weaker which can make you struggle a lot vs fast decks because youre less likely to have a card you need at hand the card draw is what made reno warlock so good especially before kazakus
hearthstone,not_removed,because when you cant run duplicates your odds of drawing any card go from to it may seem like a small thing but its not
hearthstone,not_removed,everything above and life gain isnt everything in this game if you dont have the board reno wont save you its not like the agro decks instalose if you reno you also have to clear their board first
hearthstone,not_removed,it is above average but the game isnt balanced around card balance tirion is more broken without the condition the condition no duplicate cards in deck is a significant cost to pay it is a legendary so you can only have and hence less influence to break the game
hearthstone,not_removed,because it requires you to build your entire deck around him and without him all you would see is aggro decks
hearthstone,not_removed,of each card doesnt hinder anything at all
hearthstone,not_removed,try a reno deck before saying that because it makes a huge difference in consistency and play
hearthstone,not_removed,have you ever played a reno deck i suspect you havent if you think thats not an issue
hearthstone,not_removed,of each card doesnt hinder anything at all i guess your statement didnt come out as a good representation of what you actually thinking reno is a good card limited to of each card is a disadvantage but the value more than overcomes the down side and thats why there are decks that build around it and being competitive mana extra cost to heal to full is awesome value if it doesnt hinder anything at all why doesnt jade druid run it why doesnt pirate warrior run it why doesnt miracle rouge run it
hearthstone,not_removed,just posted but i literally have a reno mage renolock and reno priest deck having one of each cards makes for alot more plays and doesnt hinder at all unless you like spamming multiples of every good card in your deck with no thought for skilled combos etc
hearthstone,not_removed,literally have a reno mage renolock and reno priest deck and can say it confidently
hearthstone,not_removed,youre right i didnt really express how i think about it correctly basically not any type of deck can run just one of each card like your example with jade but at the same time you can build a deck around of each card if youre a smart deck builder and those cards all flow together with individual class sets of cards plus a large neutral pool for every class this idea isnt unthinkable mtg has decks that are built around only having one of each card that goes up against a deck with many duplicates and its no advantage or disadvantage its just a different style of deck in hearthstone there are a few cards that take advantage of the of each card in a deck strategy raza reno kazakus etc which makes a deck with only of each other card better because of the effect of the minion there is no doubt that just running of a bunch of random cards with no synergy means nothing specific styles of decks will always require specific cards but a of each card style deck is actually just a different style of deck im sure they will continue to print more cards not full health from like reno that take advantage of it it sucks that you all took my comment so negatively when im just trying to say that the style of deck itself is not a hinderence it just obviously works out much better with cards that take advantage of it reno being the biggest game changer currently
hearthstone,not_removed,doesnt hinder at all getting stuck with a bad muligan is just the start it also means you have only half the chance of drawing into your answers no offence but its hard to take that reply seriously edit nm
hearthstone,not_removed,how many skilled combos are there in the game if anything people point to miracle rogue most often for skilled combos and thats a deck that definitely wants to run duplicates if it really isnt a hindrance why dont you run reno in literally every deck ever
hearthstone,not_removed,and you think theyre just absolutely fine and wouldnt be better with duplicates honestly if that were true every deck would be a reno deck
hearthstone,not_removed,do you still have guldan for hots by any chance
hearthstone,not_removed,sorry that ones for myself p
hearthstone,not_removed,waitwhat did i do
hearthstone,not_removed,a quick flick though his post history and i dont see anything that implies karma whoring
hearthstone,not_removed,believe what you wantalsoyour comment makes no sensei didnt participate in the giveaway post
hearthstone,not_removed,why should they make a new engine when the one they have works perfectly fine
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont know what is perfectly fine in ur eyes but text fixes at gb and a half year waiting for card slots just its not about working fine its about future of the design unity is great dont get me wrong however it limits the development example nozdormu took one year to fix due to the code of the rope
hearthstone,not_removed,unity is not the problem you have to fix a bug to fix it shocker i know that is the same in unity or in any other engine have yet to hear about an engine that fixes bugs on its own one of the few possible gains would be smaller patches but thats a minor thing in these days of always on cheap internet
hearthstone,not_removed,blizz should give priest an mana since the high health synergizes with priest hero power
hearthstone,not_removed,they should give them a mana lose health per turn
hearthstone,not_removed,i think a mana for priest would work wonders no special effects or anything just an overstated drop that works well with priest hero power
hearthstone,not_removed,what priest really needs is some decent early minions when tgt was introduced dragon priest was being heavily played with a successful winrate because of the early drops that protected the priest player enough to continue his game plan currently priest has no early game so it loses to rush decks which deal damage by turns easily
hearthstone,not_removed,i think war golem is a bit better than that p
hearthstone,not_removed,yeag but its op because now you can have in your deck
hearthstone,not_removed,httpwwwhearthpwncomcardsfiltergoldeny this
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,no like an imgur album with them all that i can directly download
hearthstone,not_removed,this is the one i said i knew about im looking for the full collection
hearthstone,not_removed,yes at least for liadrin for morgl it is clearly stated that recruits have to be on the same region for you to get it
hearthstone,not_removed,like hungry crab
hearthstone,not_removed,i do this too this feels so satisfying thats cruel for those trying to rush to rank but i cant help doing this oh youre on a winstreak to the next rank floor im sorry mate but the only legend youll get this month is the legend of the control warrior try again
hearthstone,not_removed,cthun sees play and rag is seeing a lot more play than he did pre wog
hearthstone,not_removed,a lot of rag nefarian light rag nzoth cthun all see play
hearthstone,not_removed,the meta slowed down with everyone adding mana stuff to their decks it was actually worse to play fewer big minions before since one bgh basically hard countered the one threat approach on the other hand if you did you would get rushed down
hearthstone,not_removed,i once had the beast in mah sights
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean yeah sure people are playing the mana and also earth elemental in crusher shaman taunt as well as rag deathwing yogg cthun and because bgh retired people also use more class removals like deadly shot mulch and polymorph
hearthstone,not_removed,dont tread in his own shitpile dude comment hunting isnt cool
hearthstone,not_removed,reno deck disciple blade choosen more meta viablebetter either be reno or cthun but you cant be both or you can keep the deck as is and stay gimmick tier
hearthstone,not_removed,i would drop a cthuns chosen for the mana cthun card giving you more early options and a more consistent reno blades is too much too slow try including tomb pillager instead he can enable cthun shadowstep brann coin cthun in slower games and its another card you can play on curve shadowcaster on brann can also enable the second half of the combo
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah after more testing thats kinda how i feel will probably go for just the cthun build thanks for your input
hearthstone,not_removed,didnt think about the mana advantage with the coin only thought about combo thats a good idea thank you
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe you have to convert it to standard
hearthstone,not_removed,one you can play paladin the other you cant
hearthstone,not_removed,standard is classic set most recent few sets only sets that came out during this year and last year wild is all sets allowed
hearthstone,not_removed,last spring they implemented years its like chinese new year every spring new animal year release last year was kraken now mammoth coming soon when that happen all cards which released before years will rotate out those rotated out cards only usable in wild on the other hand on standard mode you only can use cards which released within last years purpose is simple they trying refresh meta
hearthstone,not_removed,httpstandardhearthcom
hearthstone,not_removed,that makes sense thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,why buff a card when they can just print a new card for the class
hearthstone,not_removed,because new cards arent released for many months and in order to bring the classes that were low tier out of it they have to print some very disgusting cards thats why shaman has been so dominant recently their classic set always struggled so to make the class more viable they printed some over the top cards and the result is the class being oppressive meanwhile priests classic set also struggles a lot but they didnt get the aggressive strength increase from new cards so priest is still extremely low tier if they give a couple buffs to the core sets these classes have to work with then instead of needing to print stuff like tunnel trogg spirit claws or thing from below they can print cards that arent retardedly over powered
hearthstone,not_removed,if you are sure it is wrong you arent missing anything chances are youll gain stars from your next win or wont lose any from your next loss since you lost while dcd it maybe temporarily lost track of your stars it should sync up again after your next game
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i knew winning that game would have put me at with one star and then i saw two stars disappear ill play another one to see what happens edit lost another game and another star it evened out eventually when i hit rank with all of the stars i had a win streak should have already been rank won that game and got a win streak bonus star even though i dont think you are supposed to get those when you pass rank
hearthstone,not_removed,keep in mind it does look like you lose stars when you drop down a rank but you arent rank with no stars with stars you need wins to get back to rank so some people think they lost
hearthstone,not_removed,they mentioned somewhere they intend to fix this the problem was that the claw was going to be animated but they didnt have it done by the deadline for the wotog card art so they had to ship it without the animation initially
hearthstone,not_removed,interesting source
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont have one i dont have the time to go dig it back up im pretty sure it was a blizzard response on a forum but it may have also been ben brode on a blizzard stream
hearthstone,not_removed,why does someone make a new post asking this question every minutes
hearthstone,not_removed,probably because of gang up shadowstep the new brewmaster except requires being combod and raptor on jade swarmer
hearthstone,not_removed,i actually just found this vid on my recommended on yt and now im opening hearthstone reddit and yeah its there xd
hearthstone,not_removed,extended bm
hearthstone,not_removed,he lost if i remember correctly
hearthstone,not_removed,the thing about the drinks is that there are four random drinks he can give you which he pairs with one of several random names the namedrink combos are always randomized this isnt really a hint you can reliably count on although the blizzard accounts might be however its also likely its just trolls or that its just blizzard employees who choose the names based on locales they like
hearthstone,not_removed,we also see the red mana crystal in this picture at least it looks like one close enough
hearthstone,not_removed,it seems interesting but do expansions need as deep of a story and script behind them as this i thought thats basically necessary only for adventures
hearthstone,not_removed,no expansions do not need a deep backstory but that doesnt mean blizz should keep it that way after all args are a good way to build hype and hype is a good way to sell a product
hearthstone,not_removed,there is a waaay cheaper minion coming that gives you a copy of a friendly minion so herald will be no staple at all
hearthstone,not_removed,i like story would read a sequelseries p
hearthstone,not_removed,theres something magical about seeing your writing in a contest best of luck to all authors
hearthstone,not_removed,story was the cleanest among them nicely done read like a journal entry from malazan
hearthstone,not_removed,where do i find the content
hearthstone,not_removed,im poem d edit c
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks if i were to do a sort of followup it would be stories under the same style showing the cards in action in azeroth
hearthstone,not_removed,when you open the form there should be a link to it on the first page
hearthstone,not_removed,lol its the best one
hearthstone,not_removed,gee thanks poem author
hearthstone,not_removed,its the taking part that counts p
hearthstone,not_removed,wait i just looked at the results for now and apparently im not just taking part for some reason im winning
hearthstone,not_removed,damn well i think poem is far more innovative and creative
hearthstone,not_removed,deal with it bitch jesus always wins
hearthstone,not_removed,that escalated quickly
hearthstone,not_removed,if by that you mean poem score then yeah fucking asshole
hearthstone,not_removed,httpwwwhearthstonetopdeckscomcardsviewtable
hearthstone,not_removed,this will work kind of thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,it was never in your store its only available to purchase on the website
hearthstone,not_removed,only available through httpgadgetzancom
hearthstone,not_removed,you should really be favoured against zoo tbh not shaman mind but you have so many sweepers that zoo gets in a lot of trouble wait until their hand is near empty and then evil them and try to save pain for their dropsstuff that wont die to evil
hearthstone,not_removed,excavated evil holy nova and pyromancer
hearthstone,not_removed,make sure you draw whatever multiple card combo your deck relies on before you get run over thats basically priest in a nutshell maybe its highrolling a resurrect combo maybe its auchenai circle maybe its pyromancer and shield you have to hard mulligan for a way to clear the board or cheat out
hearthstone,not_removed,hard mulligan for auch and circle
hearthstone,not_removed,concede and counter queue them with a real deck
hearthstone,not_removed,i play a control priest i run an abomination which is a hugely unpopular card but its excellent against zoolocks and aggro shamans against warlocks they will often end up with only health or so because they think that is safe some burst healing with embrace the shadow can finish them pretty effectively
hearthstone,not_removed,you know what thats exactly why my list doesnt run pyro i dont need the novas but the pyros should do serious work i run evil already
hearthstone,not_removed,if you are trying that strategy warrior is a good pick to counter queue both as well as zoo if youre good at the mirror
hearthstone,not_removed,lol control priest is insane its real deck bro
hearthstone,not_removed,zoo can just trade in their low health minions and keep their other minions alive then refill the board so abom is kinda useless
hearthstone,not_removed,well you could have sea giant zoo thats good in mirror
hearthstone,not_removed,if youre losing to zoo evidently not
hearthstone,not_removed,if you really want to go all out theres always the shadowflame tech but yeah sea giant should be enough
hearthstone,not_removed,okay dude
hearthstone,not_removed,too small to be worth calculating or even thinking about
hearthstone,not_removed,you wont there are legendaries and you have a chance for a legendary per pack i think around packs that might start to become possible
hearthstone,not_removed,i think the minimum is usually about to get enough cards and dust to either unpack or get everything the maximum is about with perfect luck im sure you might do a bit better but who is planning on getting legendaries in a single pack multiple times
hearthstone,not_removed,its easy when you equal the chances of getting commonrareepiclegendary then it is edit ok this is too rough appriximation in fact the chances are way smaller
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean there is a nonzero possibility
hearthstone,not_removed,check out twitter mate
hearthstone,not_removed,what
hearthstone,not_removed,how you tried faceless manipulator allows you to copy many high value minions and keep the effects
hearthstone,not_removed,any replacements for the one mulch and one shambler
hearthstone,not_removed,i know this is real but the combination of the name solegit and battletag number make it seem like the perfect photoshopped troll deck list seriously though the deck looks interesting enough to get me playing druid again plus one of my copies of shambler is golden and i havent had a chance to even use it for a long time when renolock used to be decent
hearthstone,not_removed,i find it funny how this post gets hardly any attention on this sub congratz on your rank and your innervative deck
hearthstone,not_removed,that decklist really seems so legit any thoughts on faceless manipulator it costs one more mana but it has a lot more versatility a lot of your minions already have taunt and you can copy things like rag
hearthstone,not_removed,i am going to take your list and try to find a way to fit in ysharraj i think he might be a great fit here with the one exception of ancient of wars
hearthstone,not_removed,nice guide my only problem with this guide and most others is that i feel like youre overestimating what theyre favored against as is the deck has no bad matchup except rogue and has some really good ones against a lot of meta decks if that were the case then i think pros would have picked it up
hearthstone,not_removed,what are your thoughts on making it more rampy by cutting a raven idol for a mire keeper and maybe the other one for a fat minion dark arakkoa maybe or sylvanas
hearthstone,not_removed,any suggestions for a fandral replacement i know he is a solid card with a unique effect that is hard to replace but i currently dont have him
hearthstone,not_removed,played against a control warrior that got justicar and keeper of uldaman from my mulches
hearthstone,not_removed,a little late to post but how do you decide whether to use nourish to ramp or draw is it if you have a big threat in your hand aow you ramp but if not then draw
hearthstone,not_removed,great guide ill surely try this out i have been trying to make something like this work for a while but i am not as good a deckbuilder as you so im glad someone had the same idea d
hearthstone,not_removed,this is a good comment and one i planned on making myself having an taunt is nice but in many cases id prefer having an extra ragnaros instead my guess is that the mana cost for manipulator over shambler is a big deal on swing turns
hearthstone,not_removed,the extra mana really does matter i mostly find shambler more reliable when it comes to swinging a turn and rag is probably the only good manipulator target without changing the deck yeah having a second rag would be nice but faceless manipulator cant copy it on the same turn without the use of two innervates or several emperor ticks also i feel like the taunt aspect really does matter i find myself using shambler most of the time with my arcane giants or ancient of war compaered to manipulator shambler is better on giants since youre paying one less mana for the same amount of stats with the addition of taunt and better on aow since its one less mana for the same thing
hearthstone,not_removed,second feral rage for mulch and faceless manipulator for shambler
hearthstone,not_removed,the only replacement for mulch is naturalize for single target removal its druids major weakness do you have faceless manipulator one extra mana and not a taunt but it might be great to hit the ancient of war or rag with it
hearthstone,not_removed,my tag is i tought tags were unique
hearthstone,not_removed,it got a buttload of attention in rcompetitivehs though
hearthstone,not_removed,ysharraj doesnt have any good targets other than your rag giants and maybe emperor it even has the possibility of pulling out a naked faceless shambler which would pretty much do nothing i think if you want to play ysharraj you should be playing a completely different deck
hearthstone,not_removed,noted the matchups were based on my personal performance on ladder so its mostly opinion
hearthstone,not_removed,add a mire keeper id say bur as you know hes a very unique card go craft him hes so fun
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks but i dont have manipulator either
hearthstone,not_removed,name tag together is whats unique if it was only a digit number that could be unique there could only be players but there are way more right
hearthstone,not_removed,i know thats why i find it funny
hearthstone,not_removed,i tried games small sample i know and i absolutely agree with you ysharraj doesnt fit here i didnt consider the faceless shamblers when i commented here out of the two times i got ysharraj out on the board he pulled one shambler and one azure drake
hearthstone,not_removed,alrighty thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,i didnt know there were only numers i always tought it was sequential
hearthstone,not_removed,oh i didnt expect it to get much attention here i dont see too many guides here but just wanted to share with more people that cared
hearthstone,not_removed,if you made another meme guide it would probably have gotten more attention on this sub tbh p i played a dozen games with this deck and maybe its my inexperience with it but a record gives me the impression that this deck gets destroyed if you get tempod out by deadly shotsaphexetc quite fun if you do get rolling with the ramp though
hearthstone,not_removed,i cant look at his stream right now but you usually wears goodies from intotheamcom
hearthstone,not_removed,tempostormcom be sure to use the code tempo for your hoodie

hearthstone,not_removed,why do players whine about not having access to all the cards its not a charity dude either craft them or cough up the dough just because its possible for a game to be btw doesnt mean youll be able to have access to every deck right away tldr either put up the cash or shut up
hearthstone,not_removed,you probably wont be able to craft the quest cards for each class as but youll be able to try some of them
hearthstone,not_removed,if they want to seriously entice players to try out the quest mechanic perhaps there will be some sort arrangement similar to how cthun was given for free but uncraftablecannot be dusted
hearthstone,not_removed,well weve only seen one quest card perhaps the other quests have different rarities
hearthstone,not_removed,i am not completely ftp player i spend about in but never before the such a big piece of game mechanic was entirely represented as legendaries or may be kazakus but it was a single triclass legendary
hearthstone,not_removed,isnt it feels unnatural to pay so much for quest not for tools of achieving its goal
hearthstone,not_removed,no its confirmed that all quests are legendaries
hearthstone,not_removed,damn didnt see that that does suck hopefully blizzard has more daily rewards that allow us to get more packs i think they said they were doing daily login bonuses and maybe the new adventure like parts of the new expansion will help with that problem
hearthstone,not_removed,it wont be able to attack unless his target minion has charge
hearthstone,not_removed,wasnt sure thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,why was po put into the equation though
hearthstone,not_removed,just a buff card i guess i was playing a leeroy version of zoo with manipulator and realized that it prolly wasnt very good if copying a card that can attack without charge didnt work out the way i had hoped
hearthstone,not_removed,fuck off
hearthstone,not_removed,not sure if making fun of other guy or this is the new thing thats happening
hearthstone,not_removed,a little late are we
hearthstone,not_removed,for prepurchase yes sadly
hearthstone,not_removed,dust for me
hearthstone,not_removed,i also got legendary some shit but we dust is dust
hearthstone,not_removed,golden epic epic rare commons dust for me not bad pavel btw i got dust from thijs
hearthstone,not_removed,best part is i got the same legendary but golden a few weeks ago so its worth dust for me
hearthstone,not_removed,no thanks ricardo
hearthstone,not_removed,you can only ask for help here you should remove this one because if the mods catch it you can be temp banned
hearthstone,not_removed,is easy to grind an account for the hero reward
hearthstone,not_removed,deleting and reinstalling did the trick on my ipad
hearthstone,not_removed,keep it definitely a good card worth putting in literally any shaman deck
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,just keep it you wont get much value from dusting it
hearthstone,not_removed,keep him
hearthstone,not_removed,keep it you can build a good deck around him or at least with him
hearthstone,not_removed,its a good on the same level as ragnaros in the recent midrange jade shaman id say definitely keep it i believe even with the coming rotation shaman will still be a powerhouse
hearthstone,not_removed,monster finisher for midrange shaman strong in most board states think hell move in and out of meta decks for a long time to come
hearthstone,not_removed,i would keep him never know when he could make a comeback even though you dont see him much in the meta right now the next expansion can always change things
hearthstone,not_removed,i hit top with mid sham with alakir in it hes mvp
hearthstone,not_removed,dusted him because i thought i would never play disgusting shaman but i would like to try it in my controlshaman now
hearthstone,not_removed,in the next rotation a lot of cards are going to be rotating out of the aggro shamans core set opening up a lot of space for the more midrange cards so tentatively i expect to see a lot more alakir and hazeal in the shaman decks
hearthstone,not_removed,k then jk youre totally right fault on my part lol
hearthstone,not_removed,sorry if this gets answered all the time in the sub but is tog rotating out too or is it just the campaign cards before karzhan
hearthstone,not_removed,im not google there are at least a half dozen links to blizzards official site and various gaming magazine articles that answer that exact question on the first page learn some basic research skills
hearthstone,not_removed,est on nov
hearthstone,not_removed,it ends in hours and min
hearthstone,not_removed,i honestly believe if streamers could find a game that would bring them figure viewers like hearthstone does most of them would quit playing i watch mostly kripp and its obvious he doesnt like playing the game nearly as much as he used to even though he says he still has fun just look at the amount of sponsored content he does now i have no problem with it but he only started doing it once he said the game was going downhill its not about the money but it gives him a break hell i can barely play two hours at a time let alone five every single night but at the end of the day it is their job and the game brings tons of viewers which gives them tons of money
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for updating us on that
hearthstone,not_removed,im assuming you probably only watched kripp and youre generalizing all streamers to have that opinion
hearthstone,not_removed,most of your cards are extremely op compared with every other heal card currently in the game with the exception of earthen ring farseer because that card will always be strong for example your hunter secret heals for which is not quite the same but performs almost the same function as ice barrier except it gives you extra life for less mana cost
hearthstone,not_removed,go over to rcustomhearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think hunter and rogue will ever get class specific heal cards they will have to rely on neutral healing options
hearthstone,not_removed,hearthcardsnet you dont need editing skills just use this website
hearthstone,not_removed,hunter and rogue dont get heal
hearthstone,not_removed,k
hearthstone,not_removed,dont really see a reason for it lots of decent decks dont even run legendaries
hearthstone,not_removed,a game mode no a game yes most arenea matches will not have legendaries plenty of competitive decks do not need legendaries and if your sick of what i presume you actually mean to be boom bots why are you playing wild or tavern brawl
hearthstone,not_removed,sorry mate your best bet is to get to level and then you can access tavern brawl otherwise try arena at least from a card quality perspective its more equal it does take a bit of skill but after a few runs youll get the hang of it watch adwcta on youtube and listen to the lightforge podcast for solid arena advice
hearthstone,not_removed,my next phone will be at least
hearthstone,not_removed,most mobile games dont have as many assets as hs does nor do they usually have continual substantial updates they could stream more assets instead of hosting them on the device but that would cause slow down and increased data usage which hs is surprisingly good at its not as unreasonable as you might think considering its actually just a platform port from a full fledged desktop client also reinstalling the app helps because theyre patching method is broken and forces you to redownload a lot of data
hearthstone,not_removed,its gb on my android phone after the last update
hearthstone,not_removed,that after deleting and reinstalling its only for me i reinstalled the whole thing and have done for the last few months of patches and i thought was bad
hearthstone,not_removed,on the iphone
hearthstone,not_removed,just buy a new phonetablet for every update kappa
hearthstone,not_removed,the app is not you could try uninstalling the app then redownloading it completely upon updates it seems like when a hs update comes out on mobile that it redownloads almost the entire game you have to have space for the app twice before it cleans up the old data edit also you could just have it installed to the sd card on your phone id only recommend this if you have a good sd card but android can move apps to and play from the sd card
hearthstone,not_removed,mine is only gigs i suggest deleting the whole thing and reinstalling it
hearthstone,not_removed,this doesnt excuse blizzard but since you need to download the entire app anyway the best way to ensue you have space is to first uninstall the app completely and then reinstall it there seems to be a lot tempuseless files that the app creates that build up over time when you uninstall these get deleted and the appsize is actually more close to what it should be
hearthstone,not_removed,oh so youre complaining i only have internal memory on my phone and its ridiculous i have a card but it doesnt help much since i can move basically nothing there lg user here with android
hearthstone,not_removed,this type of topic pops up every time there is an update i think its safe to think blizzard dont really give a fuck about the size of their game on mobile
hearthstone,not_removed,try uninstalling it deleting your cache with google play services or using some other account resetting your phone it should be anywhere from some place in your phone its trying to keep memory of the size last thing you could do is look for an apk file on the internet of the recent patch
hearthstone,not_removed,i would recommend reading this thread where people arent armchair oversimplifying the problem and purporting to have everything figured out that stupid blizz doesnt
hearthstone,not_removed,blizzard thanks for the fix i can play other games now best fix
hearthstone,not_removed,the fix is to never play on mobile how fucking hard can it be seriously though the mobile emulator puts my toaster on its knees playing with friends
hearthstone,not_removed,you have either have a ghetto phone or you updated wrong my hearthstone app with the update is only it even says in the description i have an iphone btw
hearthstone,not_removed,gb really isnt that bad imho i have larger games on my iphone but op is on android and on android the app size blows up because the game has to recompress textures depending on what formats the device supports on ios they can just ship something that works on all ios devices so it stays at currently around gb
hearthstone,not_removed,i have a gb sd card which should be enough to store just about anything but the option to use it as internal storage is mysteriously absent on my phone its hardly my fault for informing myself about how to expand storage before buying a phone with a microsd slot only to find out that some random android update removed the option due to performance issues of course i wasnt expecting full speed off an sd card doesnt mean i shouldnt be able to use my phone as i want
hearthstone,not_removed,hearthstone and magic duels both take up that is the game size but it has external sources that you might not be counting on i have hs with without the new patch and cache
hearthstone,not_removed,i like to use my things until they break hearthstone got too big for an empty phone does not count as my phone breaking that counts as hearthstone breaking
hearthstone,not_removed,the point is that hearthstone has much more assets than it needs to have easy ways to reduce hearthstones size remove the pc versions of things the hearthstone app is coded to scan your screen size and switch between phone mode and tabletpc mode so theres all the interface files all the boards everythings on there twice my phone wont suddenly decide to change its screen size so i will never ever use these files remove unwanted language files looking through my app thats full translations on the game available to me at a single tap not downloading any new files thats fourteen times the file size for its voice files alone plus the rather minor impact of card text remove adventures how often do you think wow id love to replay naxxramas right now for me that number is approximately zero id love an option to delete all the adventures off my phone that is all encounters all encounterspecific cards all encounterspecific voice files and translations of all encounterspecific voice files and its just going to get bigger with the next expansion remove wild mode now this one i wouldnt do as i rather like playing silly wild decks but its another thing someone who doesnt want to play wild could do im not going to bother looking at the card numbers here but thats probably between and of cards card texts voice files and again those voice files in translations removed remove high definition textures for smaller phones im already not on the big side with my screen and a lot of my friends have actual shitty phones and not a one year old € budget phone reducing the textures of everything can make the app smaller again albeit shittier option to remove golden card animations sure they look fancy but if your phones running slow because of them wheres the fun in that a golden border gets the message across show the regular art instead of the animations save some storage space again im just starting to list things that actually make the game a bit worse so ill stop here im sure people can think of many examples of cut out this feature i dont want to make the game worse but smaller like for example deleting all sound files for people who play on mute anyway but the first couple points arent going to matter if all you want to do is make decks and play ranked
hearthstone,not_removed,based on previous threads on reddit app size on android seems random some report as low as gb and some above gb the advice to just delete and reinstall the game that always pops up never seemed to help me at this point i dont know what is going on but something needs to be done
hearthstone,not_removed,gb was after patching i deleted rebooted the phone reinstalled now its gb instead
hearthstone,not_removed,but id rather throw my money at blizzard i need those packs and spansion xx
hearthstone,not_removed,i did try uninstalling the app earlier as someone else suggested i even rebooted my phone inbetween deletion and download it fixed the problem now instead of gb it only takes gb of space how do i install it onto the sd card it never seems to work when i try i tap move to sd card and then it just kinda moves mb of files and pretends to be helpful
hearthstone,not_removed,gb was after patching i deleted rebooted the phone reinstalled now its gb instead
hearthstone,not_removed,gb was after patching i deleted rebooted the phone reinstalled now its gb instead
hearthstone,not_removed,i am complaining about something that bothers you as well yes
hearthstone,not_removed,i know it does i figured id make it this time around making a topic to keep complaining about an issue seems better than hey that thing we cared about last time it happened yeah not complaining anymore you can ignore it
hearthstone,not_removed,how do i delete the cache with google play services does that just mean uninstalling hearthstone then clearing the google play services apps cache
hearthstone,not_removed,before they made an app i just installed teamviewer onto my phone and played hearthstone on my pc through my phone at least it didnt take up all the space that way
hearthstone,not_removed,some people cant just not play mobile i love the game but im not home much between work and school so whenever im on a lunch break at work or breaking between classes i squeeze in a match or if im relaxing in bed at the end of the night i play hearthstone because i generally only have time for mobile games and its one of the best ones sure i have a pc at home but im only able to sit down to play games on it maybe once a month and how am i going to hit legend times if i play it that sparingly
hearthstone,not_removed,thats because iphones and androids update differently iphones are designed for ease of use so of course a popular app doesnt cause you trouble it would be against apples design philosophy
hearthstone,not_removed,go to apps manager like you are in the image click the app you want to move and then click storage and you can change it from there i just figured it out today myself
hearthstone,not_removed,i am not going to buy a new phone just for hearthstone either apps are getting bigger so storage is becoming more important
hearthstone,not_removed,hs can fit on an empty phone no problem mine until upgrading to a this weekend if you want more than just hearthstone you need to keep up with more modern phone trends which have moved past
hearthstone,not_removed,i agree with most of those sans removing adventures and wild mode even if i dont play wild or finished the adventures those need to be there
hearthstone,not_removed,try restarting your phone after you delete hs before you reinstall it i do that and it stays at
hearthstone,not_removed,i think this feature was removed from newer versions of android for apps its on android but removed in i think can reenable it on a rooted phone though
hearthstone,not_removed,what version of android are you running
hearthstone,not_removed,sorry android doesnt handle apps like hs very well seems to unpack everything instead of just what is needed like ios
hearthstone,not_removed,it definitely does haha b
hearthstone,not_removed,thats my guess yeah i remember reading a lot of forums and such when i had to do it because i had a phone that didnt have a lot of space ive upgraded my phone since then and i dont have that issue so i dont remember completely
hearthstone,not_removed,i can do that but that does almost nothing im not sure why
hearthstone,not_removed,the problem is just that its such a fixable problem plenty of things could be cut out of the hearthstone game after the download if i was just given a delete unwanted features option
hearthstone,not_removed,the point is that it could be so much smaller theres lots of stuff one could take out and both pc and iphone versions are significantly smaller than the one on my phone too the languages and adventures alone would make a huge difference and i dont think anyone wants more than one language installed maybe for language learning purposes two or three at best but otherwise it seems completely reasonable to ask you once its installed hey you just picked english instead of german want us to delete all the other voice files to free up space and i dont ever replay adventures either more space to save
hearthstone,not_removed,at least allow us to decide wether download full content or just the basics
hearthstone,not_removed,usavvsillybug is saying that blizzard should give us the option to remove them from the client that way the user can decide to have an even smaller client because those two things take up a lot of space
hearthstone,not_removed,im not saying delete wild or adventure by default im saying give the user an option to delete those after installing them edit um who would downvote a reasonable clarification reddit confuses me sometimes
hearthstone,not_removed,ill try that maybe it helps
hearthstone,not_removed,i tried it size changed from gb to gb fuck
hearthstone,not_removed,i did literally that and mine shows gb
hearthstone,not_removed,android on a sony xperia compact
hearthstone,not_removed,no idea what its doing really but something needs to be done about it people are always complaining whenever a patch comes out and for good reason as far as i know ios just redownloads the entire app instead of downloading a quick patch this ends up in a lower file size with some apps
hearthstone,not_removed,you sound pretty confident that you know this is a fixable problem can you justify this claim
hearthstone,not_removed,i totally agree i have an iphone gb its basically brand new i export all photos to google photos so they arent on my phone but still have to delete other apps to use hearthstone plus shouldnt force people to spend an extra to € etc to upgrade to the higher memory options just for app
hearthstone,not_removed,use a cleaner app my phone has one by default and it detects and deletes of trash each week once you unpack the hs update it is kept on your temporary folder for while
hearthstone,not_removed,screams internally
hearthstone,not_removed,ouch
hearthstone,not_removed,sure here are some easy ways to reduce hearthstones size remove the pc versions of things the hearthstone app is coded to scan your screen size and switch between phone mode and tabletpc mode so theres all the interface files all the boards everythings on there twice my phone wont suddenly decide to change its screen size so i will never ever use these files add an option to delete those files after your phones screen has been detected remove unwanted language files looking through my app thats full translations on the game available to me at a single tap not downloading any new files thats fourteen times the file size for its voice files alone plus the rather minor impact of card text add an option to delete language files you never use in my case anything but english even though i speak german remove adventures how often do you think wow id love to replay naxxramas right now for me that number is approximately zero id love an option to delete all the adventures off my phone that is all encounters all encounterspecific cards all encounterspecific voice files and translations of all encounterspecific voice files and its just going to get bigger with the next expansion add an option to delete adventures you dont want to replay remove wild mode now this one i wouldnt do as i rather like playing silly wild decks but its another thing someone who doesnt want to play wild could do im not going to bother looking at the card numbers here but thats probably between and of cards card texts voice files and again those voice files in translations removed add an option to remove old cards that rotated out of standard remove high definition textures for smaller phones im already not on the big side with my screen and a lot of my friends have actual shitty phones and not a one year old € budget phone reducing the textures of everything can make the app smaller again albeit shittier add an option to remove high definition art if your small phone screen cant show them properly anyway offer a low resolution version to replace it remove golden card animations sure they look fancy but if your phones running slow because of them wheres the fun in that a golden border gets the message across show the regular art instead of the animations save some storage space add an option to remove golden card visuals and animations only keeping the borders im just starting to list things that actually make the game a bit worse so ill stop here im sure people can think of many examples of cut out this feature i dont want to make the game worse but smaller like for example deleting all sound files for people who play on mute anyway but the first couple points arent going to matter if all you want to do is make decks and play ranked and especially not if you make them optional someone with a gb phone wont care if hearthstone is gb or gb but those who do could get buttons to remove optional files
hearthstone,not_removed,i downloaded a cleaner app once trying to uninstall some built in programs hint didnt work and it didnt detect noticeable amounts of trash hearthstone had something like mb uninstalled it again i need the space
hearthstone,not_removed,what android version do you have running probably is the phone model or the android
hearthstone,not_removed,i have some software engineering experience but i dont know how easy it is for an android app to delete parts of itself someone with appropriate experience in those things could probably hack together a version without those files and give people on reddit the file though even if an inapp deletion is hardimpossible
hearthstone,not_removed,there are ways to make different versions of the game or when you build for release each different release type can be automated to include certain files or not so what blizzard could do is release type pc it gets everything minus changing screens release type tablet gets only resolutions for tablet and ability to switch if the screen gets turned release type englishmobile english only version only resolutions for phone small versions of boards cards collection etc release type frenchmobile french only version only resolutions for phone small versions of boards cards collection etc etc what they are currently doing is just including everything in all releases
hearthstone,not_removed,android on a sony xperia compact
hearthstone,not_removed,the only thing i would say is that the issue is much more complicated than you are making it out to be and i would look at that other thread i linked in this thread or just google around to learn about what goes into these apps and the way the play store and android localization and apks work i think its more appropriate to ask oneself why the file is so big first and then decide if its appropriate to declare the injustice of its size im an android developer its my job but im relatively new not an expert by any means but i dont claim to have superiority on the issue i just think there is constructive stuff out there that speaks to why the file is so big and i think that kind of discussion is more productive than this you could be right but my strong suspicion is that there are valid constraints preventing what you are characterizing as a common sense solution
hearthstone,not_removed,so you think they should have like hearthstone apps on the play store
hearthstone,not_removed,also do you have a source on blizz not using different apks for different device configurations including everything in all releases
hearthstone,not_removed,same android version as me must be something with sony xperia then i have read in forums and other people are complaining about same issues with xperia and i recomend you to download some kind of storage analyzer app and in paralel verify the cache of your apps with a phone you should not be having problems i got hs in my previous nexus with only i wouldnt discard reinsstalling android or restoring to the original version i think you have some sony app to accomplish that
hearthstone,not_removed,we can argue back and forth whether its possible or not but a blizzard response would be nice even a quick we know its annoying but this is why we cant fix it sorry would satisfy me but right now its just an entirely unaddressed issue thats keeping many people from playing this isnt even an ugh shaman so stronk im never playing again until this is nerfed kind of issue this is a literal i wish i could play but this game cant share a phone with pokémon go and seven photos kind of issue it seems like the most important kind of issue a company should care about its confusing that this thread pops up every update and nobody ever says anything
hearthstone,not_removed,to achieve a client absolutely of course the better way would be to choose your language the first time the application starts and then the appropriate patch the language preference and extra size preferences downloads from the store
hearthstone,not_removed,i have absolutely no idea im guessing at what they could do
hearthstone,not_removed,i didnt know you could do that with the play store additional download from the play store after install source on this feature edit you talking about apk expansion files
hearthstone,not_removed,i have no idea if this is possible just talking theoretically
hearthstone,not_removed,exactly there are real constraints here that people arent recognizing that have to do with android application structure and distributing files on the play store
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for letting us know you think so really moving stuff
hearthstone,not_removed,you complain about aggro about it not taking skill while liking yogg aggro decks are best counter to yogg playing aggro takes more skill than playing a card that randomly does something if as you say you were ok with yogg screwing you over you can continue to play it
hearthstone,not_removed,what makes you think any of us care
hearthstone,not_removed,otk warrior actually had nothing to do with competitive play competitive players were generally fine with it new players are the reason charge was nerfed blizzard knows that new players hate losing to a big combo from the hand it seems unfair to players who dont understand how hard it can be to save a specific set of cards until theyre ready to be comboed together yogg was op whether you pretend it was or not it was a card that can negatively impact you but in competitive decks yogg is stacked where the majority of the time it was massively beneficial yogg very often can clear a massive board heal you a lot and give you a bunch of secrets too thats ignoring the times it kills the opponent from life yeah it can hurt you but its far more likely to help you if you cast a bunch of spells since the average spell is good if this very good patch hurts the game for you to the point where you have to complain about it youre probably better off playing a different game
hearthstone,not_removed,just to point something out even if you are casual and maybe a big part of the playerbase as well this game is a competitive one due to its pvp system and focus on wins for rewards due to the pvp system the game needs to be balanced the matches arent one sided where one player is playing an overpowered card cause its fun when the other player feels punished for the rng outcome as long as you have two real players in one match the game has to be balanced and without gamewinning rng this is not candy crush where you play a solo game and hope to get an firework of randomness just to entertain you if you want a game like that then hearthstone is maybe the wrong one
hearthstone,not_removed,i like yogg when im able to see the random stuff happen good or bad not to see it potential die once its drop for mana also it takes skill to survie to turn to begin wirh aggro just goes face
hearthstone,not_removed,you care enough to post here
hearthstone,not_removed,token druid
hearthstone,not_removed,token ramp or cthun
hearthstone,not_removed,if you dont have enough dust for the other decks in this thread beast druid is a decent cheap option id go to httpwwwvicioussyndicatecom for deck lists
hearthstone,not_removed,edit im looking for a list
hearthstone,not_removed,im looking for a list
hearthstone,not_removed,token is in a bad spot since the midrange shaman era began maly is by far the best druid deck if not possible due to dust then id go with cthun
hearthstone,not_removed,criticism not liking hearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,even better find a midpoint people can complain but not just spam pirates r gay this game has issues and though people take it too far complaints are okay
hearthstone,not_removed,what a terrible approach to a player base good thing you arent in charge of anything a player base makes a game you telling people to leave instead of attempting to improve the game wouldnt leave you with a very good game people spend money people invest time and then they ask for a few changes and your solution would be to tell them to just fuck off im glad you like the current state of the game but its no more your right to say its fine as it is than its anyone elses to say it needs some changes
hearthstone,not_removed,if everyone who wasnt loving the game right now left hardly anyone would be playing hearthstone what you dont understand is some of us who have played for years and invested lots of timemoney are pissed off that the game is still in such a bad state and want to see it get better were unhappy that blizzard hasnt learned and keeps repeating the same mistakes with every new set that balance changes still arent happening in a timely manner that deckbuilding doesnt exist anymore we want the game to be better so we can like it again
hearthstone,not_removed,i wish i could give you negative gold
hearthstone,not_removed,if you disagree with me please leave its so terrible to read other peoples opinions
hearthstone,not_removed,dont disagree with that
hearthstone,not_removed,now if only they could make the gameplay more enjoyable its getting pretty tiring playing nothing but aggro shamans and warriors all day
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont care this post isnt about that
hearthstone,not_removed,wow ok then way to start up a conversation
hearthstone,not_removed,this post isnt about it i dont care
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont know its pretty connected to making hearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,no
hearthstone,not_removed,there is no discussion if you want to moderate it to the point where everyone have to agree with you just make sure to include information that this is announcement and not thread and all will be cool p
hearthstone,not_removed,tbh thats pretty impressive
hearthstone,not_removed,insert joke about rank
hearthstone,not_removed,tbh thats preeeeety impressive ftfy
hearthstone,not_removed,i was really happy that i got it but sadly i won before i could even play of them
hearthstone,not_removed,strong hero power strong board clear strong class minions mana pot of greed which allows me to draw two cards from my deck and add them to my hand
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe its finally at a tipping point where they will address arena imbalance i hope so because arena is my favorite part of the game or rather it could be if it wasnt so stupidly imbalanced
hearthstone,not_removed,is there a problem
hearthstone,not_removed,whoever decided flamestrike should be a common card definitely never played any arena screw him blizzard not giving any fuck about arena balance really remind me about wow arena balance where it was obvious you were considered a second zone citizen compared to pve or even battlegrounds even though they kept saying it wasnt the case only a few changes would help but they still dont even want to bother well i dont care i play mainly constructed now but still blizzard never changes
hearthstone,not_removed,i love the arena but im really frustrated with it lately all of the ridiculous cards mages have gotten in every expansion have built up to the point where arena is just dumb for every other class flamestrike is a top tier card but it alone isnt the big problem the big problem is that not only do they have far and away the best hero power for arena they also have top tier cards for just about every mana cost no other class even comes close to the minion consistency at every drop the board clears or the removal options look at this goddamn roster of cards and with every expansion they get another one of the best cards in the set mana wyrm snowchugger fallen hero twilight flamecallerarcane intellect maybe not top tier but a level above the comparable priest and rogue cards fireballwater elementalpolymorph ethereal conjurer faceless summonerblizzard flamestrikefirelands portal
hearthstone,not_removed,the frustrating thing is that the problem this video demonstrates actually has been fixed over time by the growth of the card pool back in the early days the big problem with arena was that it was very common to draft an arena deck with or or more flamestrikes or swipes consecrates etc i remember brode saying in interviews that they expected this problem will go away as more cards are added into the card pool making it less likely to draft so many copies of one card and thats true its very unlikely now to get more than or flamestrikes in an arena deck unfortunately they have added lots of other common cards for mage that are almost as good in arena so the old flamestrike problem has just morphed into the new flamestrike firelands portal faceless summoner ethereal conjurer twilight flamecaller and unstable portal problem
hearthstone,not_removed,other videos in this thread videocomment greed is good in ben brodes purify video he says that theyre working on a system to allow cards to show up in arena thats unrelated to rarity they have stats on class winrates and a way to evaluate how well each card does with that information it wouldnt b im a bot working hard to help redditors find related videos to watch httpsnpredditcomrsubtletvwikimentionedvideos get it on httpschromegooglecomwebstoredetailmentionedvideosforreddfiimkmdalmgffhibfdjnhljpnigcmohf httpsaddonsmozillaorgenusfirefoxaddonmentionedvideosforreddit
hearthstone,not_removed,we had no idea what was blizzard capable of doing
hearthstone,not_removed,what i need in my life is a minute video of strong boards being wiped out by flamestrikes in arena
hearthstone,not_removed,all that shit about how they work tirelessly to have an amazing ui and how its one of their top priorities and then you just had that giant nothing where the tavern brawl button wasnt
hearthstone,not_removed,greed is good
hearthstone,not_removed,wait what i dont get it what does pot of greed do
hearthstone,not_removed,are you joking what balance problem has ever been addressed by the hearthstone team in a swift and timely manner they approach every balance issue the same way step insist that there is no problem step wait for the next expansionadventure to magically solve everything step begrudgingly admit there is a problem fabricate some excuse as to why the hearthstone team was the last group of involved individuals to recognize the severity of the problem step nerf the problematic game elements into complete irrelevance to make sure that they dont have to get up from their chairs twice step pass around the bin of social media earplugs to deafen the anger of the community for their slow response coupled with their complete inability to balance in a moderate fashion step make the same problem again in months
hearthstone,not_removed,hi ben brode
hearthstone,not_removed,well to be fair with flamestrike its a common basic for a good reason its the mage boardclear that they wanted all of the noobs to have for when they make their own constructed decks like how paladins all get consecration and all the warlocks get hellfire and all the priests get holy nova sure its a really good card but having good cards in the basic set is pretty important imo new players should start with some playable cards
hearthstone,not_removed,in ben brodes he says that theyre working on a system to allow cards to show up in arena thats unrelated to rarity they have stats on class winrates and a way to evaluate how well each card does with that information it wouldnt be too difficult to adjust card offer rates based on the class average winrate
hearthstone,not_removed,dont forget frostbolt flamecannon on two
hearthstone,not_removed,you left out flamewaker even in arena with the lack of spells its still good mana isnt bad
hearthstone,not_removed,the card called pot of greed grants me the ability to take the first two cards on top of my deck and put them in my hand allowing me to have more cards than i had before
hearthstone,not_removed,in yugioh spells dont have a cost and you just play it and you just draw cards just like arcane intellect back in the day you could run pot of greeds and if you ran out of cards youd just play pot of greed to replenish your hand from nothing the card is banned now yes a card that just says draw cards is banned
hearthstone,not_removed,one arcane intellect is excellent in arena two is alright any more than that is probably bad
hearthstone,not_removed,you are right i dont really understand the downvotes arcane intellect is an alright card but not great
hearthstone,not_removed,card draw in any deck arena or not is always good people sometimes take cards like gnomish engineer just for the card drawcycle
hearthstone,not_removed,heartharena gives it a and the lightforge gives it a but youre right reddit this guy is clearly an idiot for finding it an odd choice of example for why mage is op in arena
hearthstone,not_removed,guess your arena average is purty low
hearthstone,not_removed,are you joking what balance problem has ever been addressed by the hearthstone team in a swift and timely manner the crushing of sheepseedslumbering control druid was swiftly dealt with nerfed within days i mean fuck i dont blame them a new deck archetype that wouldnt even be a part of standard in weeks time needed to be handled asap read highly inconsistent but fun
hearthstone,not_removed,step nerf the problematic game elements into complete irrelevance to make sure that they dont have to get up from their chairs twice sometimes worse than complete irrelevance warsong nerf was like salting the weeds on the lawn so arena players have to step over this big dead patch every time theyre trying to play
hearthstone,not_removed,relevant flair
hearthstone,not_removed,hahahahaahahha
hearthstone,not_removed,in case you dont know its also a popular from hearthstone circle jerk
hearthstone,not_removed,they could still do that and make it rare the base cards are given as rewards for playing as the class
hearthstone,not_removed,they could make flamestrike an epic or rare card only in arena and still be a basic in constructed
hearthstone,not_removed,very true both great cards
hearthstone,not_removed,more to be specific
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,not sure why this is being downvoted everything he said is true yugioh is a broken game with many broken spells and cards pot of greed being a prime example its banned in every format and the card would still be played today if people had the chance
hearthstone,not_removed,draw two cards for no cost is op imagine a zero cost draw two in hearthstone super op
hearthstone,not_removed,so you are comparing arcane intellects effect to activating the magic card pot of creed which allows you to draw two new cards from the top of your deck to refresh your hand
hearthstone,not_removed,i still laugh at that seven flamestrikes video
hearthstone,not_removed,marry me
hearthstone,not_removed,i have never been saltier about a change than the poison sheep debacle i guess i should have said what actual balance problem
hearthstone,not_removed,it took until standard to nerf combo it took seven days to nerf sheep seeds think on that
hearthstone,not_removed,this is what reminds me every day that they have never dont and will never give a fraction of a flying fuck about what we actually want regarding these issues and i wish and hope i wasam wrong on this one the entire reddit community coulndnt have possibly said any louder that we loved the ineraction and wanted it to be part of the game at literally no cost beacuse its so fringe and niche theres harm in letting it work that way well thats it of course we reddit are just a minor part of the playerbase we are also the only vocal one that expresses its opinion in a way that reaches the dev team so yeah thanks blizzard
hearthstone,not_removed,that combo was a bug though i agree that it was cool and gave that deck a powerful play but theyd have to make serious changes to poison seeds to make that combo work and also make the card work properly without it being inconsistent
hearthstone,not_removed,hi jaraxxus
hearthstone,not_removed,ah
hearthstone,not_removed,it was a real post before they started using it as pasta though
hearthstone,not_removed,fuck
hearthstone,not_removed,either its the runon sentence or apparently a woosh but honestly neither seem adequate
hearthstone,not_removed,your missing the point almost all yugioh spell cards have no cost dark hole is not a mana twisting nether raigeki is not a mana damage flamestrike trap hole is not a mana damage snipe trap that you choose which summoned target gets hit in yugioh you interact with the other player at almost every step of both of your turns you can counter magic cardstrap card and even prevent their use altogether compared to hearthstone unless you have counter spell or are running loatheb in wild you have almost no control of what your opponent plays card draw in any tcg is overpowered but using the mana as the prime reason its op makes no sense in a game like yugioh
hearthstone,not_removed,starting every post with lol does not make it any more intelligent
hearthstone,not_removed,i did not say insane i say its always good arcane intellect is almost always the best of the choices in arena
hearthstone,not_removed,no it wasnt the way that poison seeds interacted with explosive sheeps deathrattle was consistent with the way all other deathrattles interacted with poison seeds with deathrattles like blecher and shredder the minions are destroyed the treants are summoned and then the deathrattles for the shredderblecher are summoned explosive sheep is the only deathrattle that will trigger during the spell before the treants are summoned
hearthstone,not_removed,that goes for every copy pasta on hs circlejerk
hearthstone,not_removed,very few memes come out as intentional i suppose
hearthstone,not_removed,just try to explain it to me again put all the pieces together for me
hearthstone,not_removed,im dumb fuck
hearthstone,not_removed,and yet it was still banned its almost as if drawing cards is powerful hmmmm
hearthstone,not_removed,please do
hearthstone,not_removed,thank you kind stranger that really cleared things up
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,its a good card but its not close to being as good as cards like flamestrike fireball or frostbolt
hearthstone,not_removed,thats not true poison seeds has a forced death phase which means deathrattles happen in the middle of the spell httphearthstonegamepediacomadvancedrulebookforceddeathphase
hearthstone,not_removed,i play pot of greed which allows me to draw two cards from my deck
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah alot of hearthstones problems come from its commitment to simplicity the devs need the casual audience so will never insert hugely complicated cards or mechanics they tend to opt for random effects more as they allow any player regardless of skill to win every once in a while mtg and yugioh kinda go the other way in which some of their sets are insanely complicated and have paragraphs of text on the card however i believe that is one of the reasons they are still played after so many years a casual audience is hard to keep around but the people who seek highskill and complex games tend to stick around for years
hearthstone,not_removed,which is exactly why i said card draw in any tcg is overpowered i never argued it wasnt
hearthstone,not_removed,how many cards do you have more than you started with though know what im sayin
hearthstone,not_removed,you have just one more card in your hand than you had before because by playing pot of greed you draw two cards from your deck and put them in your hand but you already played pot of greed the card which allows you to pick two cards from your deck and put them in your hand
hearthstone,not_removed,so lets make the game worse because of montage videos
hearthstone,not_removed,whaaaat
hearthstone,not_removed,he said you have just one more card in your hand than you had before because by playing pot of greed you draw two cards from your deck and put them in your hand but you already played pot of greed the card which allows you to pick two cards from your deck and put them in your hand
hearthstone,not_removed,okay okay calm down i didnt even get the port of greed card i think its too complicated
hearthstone,not_removed,i think players might be somewhat justified in making this criticism at around rank to if they believe their opponent is intentionally keeping a low rank to get easy wins no idea why theyd think that unless their opponent flat out told them rank and higher though they should stop being scrubs at that point its full on competitive so just because you hate a deck type doesnt mean you should attack a person who played it complain to the devs if you think its bad for the game sure but accept that its a good deck for being competitive and as such people are going to use it a lot more people need to read sirlins series on being a scrub and competitive gaming
hearthstone,not_removed,😂 hahah nice
hearthstone,not_removed,i love coming home from a hard day of work or school and hearing busy night but theres always room for another and then the nostalgic music plays and i relax and feel good aaaahhhhh then i que into a midrange shaman ffs
hearthstone,not_removed,not just hearthstone but all blizzard games have amazing attention to detail
hearthstone,not_removed,i love the quirkiness and casual tone hearthstone has you can have fun with cool characters in a simple enviroment
hearthstone,not_removed,i think that hs being easy to learn hard to master kind of game backed up by blizzard fanbase and lack of major competitor on market made it extremely popular but the games interface is nothing short but awful by usability standpoint yes it is beautiful but if you play a lot and focus on game you dont notice that what you notice is that it doesnt show you amount of cards in hand so you have to manually count them to avoid overdraw doesnt show you amount of cards in deck left unless you mouse over a deck why not put a number on a skull cards art is so small you can barely tell what it is and in a lot of cases its a cropped out art from their previous tcg small things like red text color on red blood drop are also bad from interface design standpoint oh yeah and the fact that there is no proper timer chess like so you can rope every turn and yet have not enough time to think out the play in critical situation i play hs quite a bit and i find all voice replies annoying after hearing them for thousand times so i play with sound disabled ps let the downvotes pour
hearthstone,not_removed,that one is probably my favorite it makes you feel like youre apart of something
hearthstone,not_removed,i never really noticed the red over red before now ill never unsee that so thanks the time issue is something that i completely agree with in my old apartment i had internet that would be patchy at random times and i would think i had plenty of time to make my turn and then suddenly my opponent would be playing cards there were a few times i wanted to scream i count down would have been great back in those days the artwork being cut out really upset me the first time i found out that there was a tcg before hearthstone its awful for the artists who put in all the work into creating those images on the other hand i dont know how well the cards would read if more of the image was displayed games like magic yu gi oh and cardfight vanguard little known but a good one have beautiful images but their text is tiny which is why i dont actively play them cards like forbidden ancient shadowflame or harrison would be even harder to read is the image was extended length wise with smaller images on the board you can play more which is pretty cool ps i like your opinions have an upvote
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i love it and i love the radish growing map as well
hearthstone,not_removed,red over red isnt really a problem when you play the game but when i watched tournament in bad resolution i found difficult to make numbers out rope isnt that problematic either most of the time until some people abuse it by roping a lot or you run into difficult turn that needs more thought sometimes animations take a turn time too the problem with cards is that they just generally small as they take little screen space even board itself is small the playing space is narrow and a lot of it taken by decoration its also in all the time and doesnt scale with resolution it seems like they wanted to design simple game and didnt expect it to blow up like that ps thanks for an upvote
hearthstone,not_removed,rtitlegore
hearthstone,not_removed,i actually think discover is one of the worst mechanics its great for the discoverer but awful for the opponent because how do you play around a discovered card it could be practically anything id consider this much less of a problem if either the discovered card were revealed to your opponent or maybe better reveal your three choices but not your actual choice to your opponent that said the adapt discover seems to be better than normal because of the limited possibilities and because i assume the discovered effect is immediately applied to your minion
hearthstone,not_removed,it was great when it came out but just like the burgle mechanic its reached a kind of critical mass where theyve printed too many viable discover cards now were just getting wrecked by lucky discoversburgles
hearthstone,not_removed,discover sucks because of rng imo it sucks losing a game just because the enemy happened to discover your best card
hearthstone,not_removed,this feels like a copy pasta
hearthstone,not_removed,its insane how fun the discover ability is whenever i discover anything im immediately anxious and curious about it what will the courier give me today what does sir finley offer whats the peddler peddling
hearthstone,not_removed,discover is a pretty good mechanic but some of the cards i dont really think are great for the game cards like dark peddled or ivory knight which have a fairly limited card pool that your opponent can play around is good stuff like courier which can procure hundreds of thousands of wildly different cards as fun as it is to play i dont think its good for the game
hearthstone,not_removed,you misspelled kazamikus
hearthstone,not_removed,and down there lies inspire tossed away before having a chance to shine
hearthstone,not_removed,oh wow lol i am sorry for this massive fail
hearthstone,not_removed,you can tell the mana cost of the kazakus card by looking at where the redorange outline is before the first card is played probably the same with spell or minion from raven idol and there are probs some other examples i cant think of
hearthstone,not_removed,how many discover cards are actually played in the current meta operative and nether spite are pretty much and both have a healthy range of choices that allows you to predict what they could have gotten and play around it outside of that you have the mage spell guy sometimes just play around burn and aoe most of the time and a few discover deathrattle guys which also provide a play around range of things kazakas can be played around the ones i dont like are cards that have such a wide range of choices that its impossible to play around everything like raven idol and paladins mana discover card fortunately these arent used a lot in the current meta
hearthstone,not_removed,then its not discover that sucks its discover a card in your opponents deck that sucks
hearthstone,not_removed,i believe all discover options are scrambled for opponent so he has no clue about your choises
hearthstone,not_removed,raven idol spellminion is choose one not discover
hearthstone,not_removed,kabal courier is used quite often as well thats got a massive range of possibilities
hearthstone,not_removed,discovered sucks period it sucks to lose a game because your opponent discovered a card that you had no chance to play around
hearthstone,not_removed,true thanks for pointing that out although it may still work
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah thats a good point but what im saying is that theres a healthy way to use discover and an unhealthy way and i think most viable discover cards are healthy
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean thought steal is a card you have to play around the possibility of a discover card discover is a slow mechanic and can be punished with smorc and it can also brick and give you nothing good for every pyroblast ive gotten from the mage discover card ive been stuck with shatter arcane missiles and dragon breath as my choices as well
hearthstone,not_removed,thats your opinion then
hearthstone,not_removed,its not gonna survive in the current meta but it does result in some entertaining matches if youre lucky along with kripp does have a pretty good list in his video
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,why are aggro shaman and miracle rogue played much more at higher ranks
hearthstone,not_removed,had the highest in last week
hearthstone,not_removed,from my personal experience you see much more shaman than rogue mage warlock priest and rogue dont feel overly represented on ladder shaman on the other hand is everywhere edit if youre referring to legend i guess that people really enjoy playing rogue its been ages since its been viable and its been a ton of fun playing it
hearthstone,not_removed,its close to the season end so strong and quick decks would be preferred adding to this some people tend to switch to miracle rogue since he hits legend
hearthstone,not_removed,nerfs are about as frequent in hs as mtg nor should a tier deck cost hundreds
hearthstone,not_removed,what golden legendary did you get first of all
hearthstone,not_removed,nerfs are wildly infrequent youre completely fine to invest in those decks especially since its only been a month since a set of nerfs with the suggestion behind that being that nerfs would be even less frequent from now on than they were zoolock also has the advantage of a lot of it being from classic and thus always in standard
hearthstone,not_removed,you dont need to worry about investing in cards that get nerfed later in hearthstone first off nerfs are very very rare and we just had a big bout of them and secondly you get full value back from nerfed cards
hearthstone,not_removed,the golden legendary is kinda irrelevant im planning on dusting it its a golden king mukla
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah he kinda sucks id de him you could make a decentmoderately good zoo deck with the dust and dont worry about it becoming irrelevant zoo will most likely always be good
hearthstone,not_removed,always squelch on curve
hearthstone,not_removed,nah its not there are so many douchebags its perfectly understandable personally i only squelch when my opponent clearly tries to bm me but i can still understand you
hearthstone,not_removed,nope i do it too i squelch right after mulligan and double check before conceding
hearthstone,not_removed,yes
hearthstone,not_removed,happy new year
hearthstone,not_removed,no one uses that chat buttons anyway chill
hearthstone,not_removed,i squelch as soon as the game starts even if my opponent doesnt bm i dont need to be distracted in the middle of my turn or when im trying to do math
hearthstone,not_removed,happy new year
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel so tilted after someone bms me
hearthstone,not_removed,lol i also check when im about to concede
hearthstone,not_removed,you have never palyed against someone who uses the emotes d
hearthstone,not_removed,to be fair i wouldnt have realised this was the current greetings emote if i hadnt missed a squelch on curve so its not always necessary
hearthstone,not_removed,astonishing
hearthstone,not_removed,i have but i dont normally see it as them being negative like maybe games i get someone being a dick with the emotes and thats not enough for me to shut down the other especially so immediately as the thread implies
hearthstone,not_removed,druid vs henter legend
hearthstone,not_removed,i think those classes might be better of without those jade cards rogue and shaman dont need help anyways
hearthstone,not_removed,finally the cthun counter we all wanted
hearthstone,not_removed,this problem has popped up a couple of times now and as far as i know it is not a bug and therefore wont be changed no matter how much attack cthun has bolf will always tank all of it
hearthstone,not_removed,working as intended bolf will eat all cthun damage make sure to clear bolf before dropping cthun
hearthstone,not_removed,i wouldnt have thought so either thanks for the info the more you know shooting star
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i never meant to say its a bug it makes sense that this happens thats why the til instead of fix pls d
hearthstone,not_removed,yup thus the til in title really caught me off guard though didnt even remotely consider this possibility until it happened and i realized i fd up
hearthstone,not_removed,same with most people honestly not an intuitive interaction
hearthstone,not_removed,how isnt it nothing dies until after cthun has finished his battlecry
hearthstone,not_removed,goons arent great hancho is good
hearthstone,not_removed,as far as the goons go yes they are pretty bad but i wouldnt dust dhc just yet unless you desperately need specific cards right now it definitely has potential in some sort of deck down the line there have been several instances of a card being bad when it was first released only to become a cornerstone of a tier deck several months later
hearthstone,not_removed,nah not worth dusting might get some card buffs and nerfs which could help hancholo
hearthstone,not_removed,is there a specific card youre stocking up on dust to get
hearthstone,not_removed,ive found a fantastic replacement for leeroy is the mana spiked hog rider a ton of decks rn use at least a few taunts a little more situational but still a with possible charge
hearthstone,not_removed,its to prevent botting
hearthstone,not_removed,the limit is there to prevent people from botting and its set arbitrarily high enough that youre unlikely to hit it regularly i think its fine
hearthstone,not_removed,oh i see
hearthstone,not_removed,no thats the rotation in classic hearthstone
hearthstone,not_removed,no they didnt
hearthstone,not_removed,another website cards post
hearthstone,not_removed,probably you are not on the same version as your friend only one of you two has the latest update
hearthstone,not_removed,nope my friend and i restarted we had the same problem i think maybe the servers are kinda fked right now i had problems buying something too
hearthstone,not_removed,so is this a complaint or a compliment
hearthstone,not_removed,tldr rng cards are indeed fun and the underwhelming feeling msg gives is because it has very little rng game feels somewhat worse because the inherent draw rng is more important than ever
hearthstone,not_removed,there is only solution we all have to play nothing but pirates pirates everywhere i desperately want to know what happens once blizz radar shows pirates together we can do it
hearthstone,not_removed,i am feeling the same so i just went on reddit it feels like a job i dont want to do just to get my dailys done
hearthstone,not_removed,ive been playing cw exclusively for a while now and i have a very diffrent view on the meta i keep queueing into the greediest decks and it triggers the hell out of me considering how fast the meta is supposed to be my last games were against reno mage with archmage medivh dragon priest with ysera entonb and fucking midrange jade shaman sometimes the game tries to piss you off
hearthstone,not_removed,dont play at the start of a season cuz everybody plays fast decks to rank up as fast as possible dont play at the end of a season cuz everybody plays fast decks for the final sprint i feel you man my salt is real too
hearthstone,not_removed,i am having more fun than ever playing kibler shadow priest in wild currently rank with my all time favourite deck pirate warrior is one of my easiest matchups and the games are fast
hearthstone,not_removed,end of season push people trying to hit rank for that dust
hearthstone,not_removed,im on the same boat with you playing mainly druid and reached rank at best but no i am totally done all games starts with smalltime and ends with lava planning not to play untill they fix this
hearthstone,not_removed,as a reno mage player druid is more annoying for me than pirate warrior or shaman i agree the meta is lacking diversity atm
hearthstone,not_removed,well ive been playing an anti agro reno mage and druids are the bane of my ladder experience but yeah regardless if you feel frustrated by the game you should take a break it can only help
hearthstone,not_removed,playing druid is more cancerous and braindead than any pirate deck
hearthstone,not_removed,update up to games still no other classes i love being punished for not having enough dust to craft patches
hearthstone,not_removed,patches is run because he is good i dont like pirate warrior because it takes no still all you do is go face but with miracle rogue patches is normally used as a board clear or something like that
hearthstone,not_removed,been playing exclusively miracle rogue because its literally the only fun yet viable deck for me rn could be a lot better though
hearthstone,not_removed,i find that i have much more in when im doing play x quests winning is so hard when youre just trying to finish a quest or you plays minute game just to lose all any possible progress
hearthstone,not_removed,agreed thats why ive been playing almost exclusively arena and tavern brawls since msg i tried doing the regular ladder and it just wasnt fun that said ive had some success in wild still and am doing most of my quests there give that a shot if you take a long break you will be far behind or have to spend money to catch up
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel you ive been playing pretty much exclusively renolock which doesnt have the best matchups against aggro but is extremely satisfying to win with especially when you topdeck reno on turn
hearthstone,not_removed,pirate pirate pirate aggro shaman pirate that are my opponents now
hearthstone,not_removed,i put the game down last night at rank after playing nothing but pirate warrior piratejade shaman pirate rogue about games in a row theres no fun there
hearthstone,not_removed,are you playing jade infinite cards is also frustrating the problem is the game forcing you to an extreme because the two new strategies are too efficient at what they do
hearthstone,not_removed,went on reddit cause i am just so frustrated with this stupid meta all aggro cant play any fun decks and just annoying face damage all day even when i succumb to aggro it is always whether i should hit face and pray that i get a charge weapon or spell for damage to get lethal or not i may just be rambling a bit but i havent hated this game more and i have played since beta through every nerf and every op deck this expansion is the worst
hearthstone,not_removed,i gotta admit rank are all pirate warrior and aggro shaman but then once u hit rank u realize there are no more pirate decks its all reno mage control shaman jade druid they all want their enemies to be pirate decks lol wait for a week before taking ur long break they r nerfing pirates tmr
hearthstone,not_removed,i actually had the opposite experience last night grinding to rank with mid jade shaman i ran into anyfins a zoolock a few dragon priests and warriors as well as renolocks and renomages i feel like there are plenty of viable decks at the moment people are climbing with unfortunately you can still hit long streaks of turn one pirates
hearthstone,not_removed,still better than the undertaker meta back in the day but i agree i would love to see blizzard buff control decks and weaken agro but they never seem to do so expansion after expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,played wild for the first time with patchescannonwarrior winstreak from to disgusting think i never hit turn or on then i lost to apiratewarrior
hearthstone,not_removed,i am seeing the opposite lol i am trying to play a midrange hunter because it is my favorite class gotta love that highmane if i draw ok then pirates are nothing but control warrior is the bane of my existence
hearthstone,not_removed,sorry but im one of them
hearthstone,not_removed,i only ever run into new players with bad decks in casual yet everyone always says that casual is flooded with net decks i guess you should do wild casual i dont know
hearthstone,not_removed,welcome to the blizzard entertainment experience edit dont worry you can also change the job to another game with the same routine chores
hearthstone,not_removed,i know this feeling play aggro aggro aggro aggro think oh maybe ill give my heavily antiaggro cw a spin first game jade druid
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel ya just recently i lost a game at rank with reno mage my opponent was a reno priest that ran i kid you not the following cards shadowform cthun nzoth yssharj ysera and ragnaros after i had dealt with all of that and now both of us in fatigue i start flooding the board i thought what else could he have left in his deck he must be out of threats and then bam deathwing not from a discover either straight up from the deck i have to give this guy props for running a shadowformdragondeathrattlecthunreno deck at rank and it beat me soundly
hearthstone,not_removed,im running into the same kind of thing including lots of control warrior i actually kind of want to see pirates at this point as my deck is antiaggro where are all these pirates people speak of
hearthstone,not_removed,this so much its like the matchmaker wants to piss you off sometimes play my renolock greediest of the greedy mages and priests switch to my aggro shaman control warrior
hearthstone,not_removed,the end of the season isnt nearly as bad as the beginning if you are gridlocked at a rank by the end of the season its probably the player not the deck or opponents deck
hearthstone,not_removed,its a pity its so expensive and the expensive cards are from tgt
hearthstone,not_removed,thats the right attitude
hearthstone,not_removed,cant complain as miracle roge they are free wins overall this season
hearthstone,not_removed,honest question how do people lose to this deck its so slow and cumbersome
hearthstone,not_removed,play dragon priest its extremely cheap and stomps most pirate decks with the exception being miracle rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,just take a break i got to rank or about days into the season playing an hour or so a night and just got bored with it play something else for a few days and come back fresh if its still the same take a few more days
hearthstone,not_removed,i went from rank to in wild these last days then hit a wall of pirate decks lost straight reached rank then said fuck it for this season
hearthstone,not_removed,you had my empathy until this comment you hate them but want to be them
hearthstone,not_removed,really i was there for undertaker and i dont remember one class like shaman being of the ladder it was bad but shamanstone is unprecedented in hs history
hearthstone,not_removed,why always been curious as to why people play tier decks in casual
hearthstone,not_removed,i wonder if you get matched with your heros mmr instead of your account mmr it would make sense
hearthstone,not_removed,thats true but my list is a little different it has nzoth instead of paletress for instance and voljin isnt good in this meta but you probably wont use garrison commander and kodorider in any other decks no
hearthstone,not_removed,jade druid is basically an autowin in some matchups
hearthstone,not_removed,as a dragon priest main right now im super happy when i see jade druid or pirates because i know i have a really good chance against both decks right now
hearthstone,not_removed,because you can play oversized minions ahead of curve for holding a dragon
hearthstone,not_removed,pretty much this when i play pirate warrior i know the first card priest will play is twilight whelp well i should just autoconcede but i play it out anyway probably against dragon priest and that was pure luck or they just really misplayed
hearthstone,not_removed,hahaha exactly the same here around rank i fully ran into the pirate wall whats even more infuriating is that you hit them in casual as well
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont like playing aggro i never playplayed shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,imo shaman not warrior is destroying the meta tight now one class can play aggro to midrange to control and throw in a combo finish for completely free with no seriously bad match ups or consistency problems sure hyper aggro is frustrating when youre new but if you actually learn the match ups and mulligan correctly its not that bad yes dae turn dae doomsayer dying dae face and all that garbage but thats just random bitching from people who have become use to the free wins against aggro and dont realize how terrible aggro has been for a year or so disco lock was a terribly inconsistent deck zoo devolved into a midrange bord control deck and face hunter was over escalated by tempo storm as because people would jam the shitty deck to we need more anti aggro cards that are not reno or combo based but we already got great hate and have great hate in classic shaman on the other hand all can correctly play the same early to mid game threats and change just enough to destroy you if you over extend cards or dont put the correct flex cards on the correct deck
hearthstone,not_removed,whenever i resort to playing decks its because i made a funwacky deck and got shat on by tier decks five or six times in a row so im continuing the cycle because im a bad person
hearthstone,not_removed,sometimes i dont want to spend too much time worried about every move i make as a player getting back into the game after a couple year break it let me grind out games faster for arenamore cards
hearthstone,not_removed,i think some people just honestly play to have fun and dont care about ranked at all although i only do that on overwatch with hearthstone ill play most of my decks on ranked bc why not
hearthstone,not_removed,damn it im getting downvoted i just want my coins
hearthstone,not_removed,no sorry theres no big conspiracy that keeps you down beyond most people sucking absolute dick at this game
hearthstone,not_removed,brode said its purely by stars and rank not mmr
hearthstone,not_removed,which ones i play reno priest and havent had a problem with this
hearthstone,not_removed,yes i do believe thats how it works
hearthstone,not_removed,worst is if you play a reno deck and its a struggle to make it to turn even after reno they still might have enough damage on board and topdeck damage to kill you in the next turns
hearthstone,not_removed,flex card on the correct deck sorry but if your deck has that many flex spots it needs refining also from an aggro shaman perspective there are many more counters to aggro than to wallet warrior renoblock mage or the eredar lord of the burning legion also shaman has good cards but if you dont combine them according to a purposeful gameplan the deck falls apart
hearthstone,not_removed,then why casual and not ranked you can grind the gold all the same plus you can increae your rank for better season rewards
hearthstone,not_removed,so why are you playing pirate decks in casual instead of ranked theyre already the strongest decks for laddering so its not like youd be losing ranks with them
hearthstone,not_removed,then play a fun deck recently in casual i have played nzoth paladin buff paladin token druid and beast druid add some variety to the game play something fun to play as and against
hearthstone,not_removed,control warrior is the most obvious one but jade druid stomps reno mage as well although some archetypes do better than others antonidus can be your savior if you can get enough burn from it im surprised youre doing well with reno priest against druid too because thats another of the really strong matchups what build are you running
hearthstone,not_removed,indeed it is
hearthstone,not_removed,dragonreno priest player here wild or standard im getting pre lethalled mostly by warriors im nearly at the fight fire with fire stage
hearthstone,not_removed,he just explained it he doesnt want the pressure of ranked when i make a stupid mistake in casual i just feel dumb but move on in ranked it feels much worse to lose a game because you made a dumb move
hearthstone,not_removed,there is nothing to lose in casual so many players come here to try decks and play nonmeta stuff that would probably get destroyed or unfun to play in ranked theyre easy preys for decks like pirate warrior or aggro shaman and will often concede fast no punishement better go straight to the next game so fast deck easy matchups more concedes more gold
hearthstone,not_removed,because theres no punishment for losing in casual
hearthstone,not_removed,decklist i got off of trumps youtube vids
hearthstone,not_removed,its sad when turn is lucky if you are not dead yet
hearthstone,not_removed,why its the exact same thing except you get rewards and dont ruin people trying to do quests
hearthstone,not_removed,tldr they are bad people
hearthstone,not_removed,and to think reno will rotate soon whilst pirate decks lose almost nothing we are fucked if some major controlhealing cards do not get released i am bloody tired of all these charge minions and every weapon going face there is no way to interact or avoid it
hearthstone,not_removed,muh stars
hearthstone,not_removed,some people care about ranked perhaps hes comfortable with his end of season rewards and doesnt want to risk losing them by playing a deck hes unfamiliar with or by playing a game when not paying that close attention
hearthstone,not_removed,i hope reno gets cycled into the classic set
hearthstone,not_removed,you dont lose your reward once you hit rank you get reward for highest rank you hit
hearthstone,not_removed,sure but you can drop ranks let me give an example personally i dont care for warriordruid even though i currently believe those are very powerful when i play ranked i play decks im comfortable with shaman mage lock when i get a daily quest thats win x games with warrior i believe i can win x games with warrior but im not comfortable enough with the deck to play ranked with it so i will build a strong warrior deck like pirate for the quick wins and shift to casual so that i dont have to worry about dropping ranks and losing my ladder progress im aware awards can stay by tier but ladder progress does not lock
hearthstone,not_removed,rank depends two things winrate and games played the higher the winrate the fewer games are required to archieve a high rank on the other hand playing lots of games allows you to get to a high rank even when playing at a lower skill level in summary its hard to answer without knowing how much you played on top of that ladder ranks are fairly insignificant outside of the endofmonth reward if youre new spend your time building a collection and learnimg basic mechanics instead of going fullon competitive for the time being
hearthstone,not_removed,its tough to give an average because theres a large amount of people who just do dailies or do well enough for the cardback set goals for yourself like aiming for rank is really where the rewards just about cap out with a golden epic legend is just for the cardback
hearthstone,not_removed,if you gonna push for ranks either push for or thats where significant increase in rewards happen rank for a week old player seems pretty good there are no average ranks for decks because some stubborn and crazy dudes may even try going legend with shit decks so it depends on how much time you are willing to spend and your skills
hearthstone,not_removed,winrate depends on skill and deck quality people like trumpsc do legend in one month challenges and pull it off because theyre great players others dump hundreds of dollars and end up messing around on rank legendaries are cards like any other but more specialized and slightly more powerful due to being restricted to one per deck ultimately reaching rank can mean that you got a lucky winstreak played well played a ton of games had bad opponents or a neat deck or any ombination of the above no more no less if youre wondering wether reaching rank in two weeks makes you a good player we cant answer that anywho theres no point to this thread
hearthstone,not_removed,did you buy the welcome bundle
hearthstone,not_removed,welcome bundle should be purchased other then that only time will increase a mostly account i know this first hand been doing it for years and even some of the best accounts ive created are still missing a ton of stuff the best advice i can give is try to get play quests as its much easier to finish those without having to actually win other then last ill see you in about six months to a year
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel scummy saying this but it will either be time or cash does work for hearthstone but you either had to start a long time ago or got really lucky with your pulls think of it like this do you want to have a large collection of cards to make decks from or do you want to collect with the goal of making a certain deck collecting for a certain deck will be both cheaper timewise and monetarily should you go that route its far more expensive to collect in hearthstone than it is to win
hearthstone,not_removed,money lots lots of money
hearthstone,not_removed,heres the standard advice i give as a new player your magic number is youll want to unlock and get all your classes up to level which will allow you access to all the basic cards when you get one class to level youll unlock the tavern brawl which is a weekly event that will earn you a prize each week typically a classic pack after youve unlocked all your classes be sure to level up and httphearthstonegamepediacomquest in ranked play getting to rank by the end of each month will unlock a prize pack with dust gold cardbacks and golden cards classic packs should be your first priority they will never rotate out and there are a lot of key cards like the welcome bundle is the best value if you want to spend money the httpsplaygooglecomstoreappsdetailsidcomgoogleandroidappspaidtaskshlen can be a good way to get the cash if you have an android amazon coins also may have a deal im free to play so im not sure there will be a lot of bitterness in posts here on reddit from people who take games way too seriously and to them grinding and leveling up has become a chore level up your classes to and use this as an opportunity to test out the different classes learn your own play style and have fun with it happy hearthstoning
hearthstone,not_removed,dont take it too seriously and realise its just a game take your time with quests you dont have to finish one everyday you can let it stack to clear on the day soon youll have your own large collection too
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for all the advice guys
hearthstone,not_removed,i have bought the welcome bundle i got al akir and malygos im currently at dust still have both legendaries should i save up for a top tier legendary like bloodmage sylvia as or rag or should i start crafting impactful cards that arent necessarily legendaries
hearthstone,not_removed,neutral minion rare classic 🐙 httpwwwhearthheadcomcardsazuredrake httphearthstonegamepediacomazuredrake mana dragon spell damage battlecry draw a card callhttpswwwredditcommessagecomposetohearthscanbot me with up to for more pm
hearthstone,not_removed,yeh save for one of them
hearthstone,not_removed,which on specifically im thinking rag as he can be game changing or bloodmage for the utility
hearthstone,not_removed,thalnos is my favourite
hearthstone,not_removed,oh ok i was strongly favoring thalnos and rag maybe ill just get thalnos
hearthstone,not_removed,depends what kind of plays you like to make
hearthstone,not_removed,elaborate
hearthstone,not_removed,thalnos is good for technical plays with spell power also good if you dont run much card draw sylvanas is great in control decks and ragnaros as a finisher
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for the reply now that i think about it though im not really sure what my play style is
hearthstone,not_removed,also make sure you get staple cards like azure drake rare and consider doing the latest adventure karazhan
hearthstone,not_removed,i have one azure drake only and when is onik being rotated out just curious
hearthstone,not_removed,years time its the most recent adventure so definitely worth playing
hearthstone,not_removed,oh ok thanks so how would i go about trying to figure out my play style
hearthstone,not_removed,depends what you enjoy fast aggressive games or sitting back and playing tactically
hearthstone,not_removed,oh ok i see playing slowly with bloodlust on shaman hand buff paladin and spell power mage counts as tactically right i think i prefer a slower play style versus classes like hunter guessing this means thalnos would be a better choice for me correct
hearthstone,not_removed,definitely thalnos is great with shaman and paladin boosts their aoe board clears and spot removal
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for all the help i really appreciate it
hearthstone,not_removed,karazhan is another fun expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,rng is basically the key differentiator for hearthstone compared to other ccgs and tcgs theres never going to be a norng expansion
hearthstone,not_removed,not saying that rng is good in a competitiveeven though its mostly casual game but it inherently equals out every time flip a coin times you might be lucky but a coin flipped times results in luckiness give or take
hearthstone,not_removed,so you see cards and think over average all cards are gonna involve rng
hearthstone,not_removed,no karazhan is another rng adventure
hearthstone,not_removed,weve only seen cards
hearthstone,not_removed,its a ccg so yes maybe check out chess
hearthstone,not_removed,nothing is rng if youre skilled enough
hearthstone,not_removed,only tier deck im jealous he hasnt encounter pirates yet
hearthstone,not_removed,i have a homebrew warrior deck way more sucessful than my homebrew divine shield paladin buff deck because face is da place
hearthstone,not_removed,who would spend money on a service that is consistent just to be ignored or not informed apparently you would
hearthstone,not_removed,your opinion isnt unpopular it fits right in with the entire subs circlejerk it just seems unpopular because the anticirclejerk circlejerk has been strong as of late edit spelling
hearthstone,not_removed,i am confused on why you think that there have been plenty of interviews designer insights twitterreddit replies etc while i do wish they write articles about game design every week or so like developers of mtg i mean look at this he really goes in depth on how the design team created new cards i honestly dont think team is not communicating
hearthstone,not_removed,well the game currently has an alltime high number of active users and double digit revenue growth but im sure the concern about angry preteens and neckbeards like yourself complaining on the internet will cause them to rethink their entire strategy
hearthstone,not_removed,no you are not entitled to anything when you spend money on hearthstone be that on packs or arena or whatever you are receiving exactly what you paid for in that transaction you are not entitled to anything else beyond the existing guarantees around that purchase eg that the game wont just suddenly shut down taking your cards with it you can of course try to speak with your wallet if youre not happy with how the game is run and it is up to blizzard in the long term to gauge the playerbase to see if they are heading in the right direction but they dont owe you anything beyond what youre already paying for
hearthstone,not_removed,and judging by the fact that youre in the hearthstone reddit apparently so would you
hearthstone,not_removed,how dare i spend money on something im passionate about that i want to see succeed
hearthstone,not_removed,thats a lot of circlejerking
hearthstone,not_removed,aww look at the baseless insults and unprovenfacts maybe next time you can have a reasonable debate without acting like your in high school
hearthstone,not_removed,buying the cards whether it be by adventures or packs is the equivalent of buying a game completely imagine every expansion of cards as a diablo or wow expac ofc ones content is completely planned out while the other is player driven when it comes to how that content is used but that is besides the point you are purchasing said content to be used as expected if the content is not up to par with what is expected especially in a mendable environment like this one is then you are not getting what you paid for way too many games that are developed currently are given free passes as to having sub par content due to then being or casual focused which is completely inappropriate in a consumer focused environment every game should have the highest quality of qol changes and interaction between devs and player base unless devs want to start making set titles aka pre era where patches werent a thing

hearthstone,not_removed,this promo was priceless
hearthstone,not_removed,🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨🚨
hearthstone,not_removed,you can either both here also thats completely missing the point of the post because no one came here for lordofturtles complementary english course
hearthstone,not_removed,no how it looks like or replace look with another verb is always incorrect httpsjakubmariancomhowvswhatdoesitlooklikeinenglish
hearthstone,not_removed,the guy didnt say your post is shit and i hate you because your grammar is wrong he just offered a bit of correction on ops grammar so that op doesnt make the same mistake later he didnt miss the point just posted a comment
hearthstone,not_removed,yep youre right alternatively he couldve just excluded the like in the title as its unneccesary but honestly its not like it matters here
hearthstone,not_removed,you want to draw through your whole deck anyways mana draw and you have to include a dragon too wont be played when they already have lay on hands the issue is that paladin has no way to beat and aggromidrange deck that plays smartly and doesnt overextend into its board clears since consecration no longer kills most of the minions played in the meta paladin is really stuck with only pyro equality as a reliable board clear drawing a mana card combo that clears the board doesnt that seem similar to another faltering class
hearthstone,not_removed,anyfin is different from nzoth because you have an active win condition you win by proactively killing the opponent meanwhile nzoth can only win based on the opponents inability to deal with your nzoth board not being forced to play deathrattles gives you more leeway to play cards like humility and kodo also nzoth is card while anyfin is you can play anyfin to clear the board the problem right now is that if you only draw charger you second anyfin wont kill the other guy so it takes about turns more to draw that which gives you less time to live and your heals have less value because you dont want to lay on hands when youre almost fatigued if murkeye didnt get rotated out the deck would be really really good
hearthstone,not_removed,pretty sure nzoth runs peacekeepers as well as kodos you never really want to run humility by itself look at it nzoths package is cairne sylvannas corrupted healbot nzoth tirion infested tauren cards anyfins package is anyfin warleader bluegill cards they have the same shell sure you can anyfin to clear the board but you can also drop sylvannas to force inefficient trades nzoth works if you only draw tirion anyfin doesnt work unless you draw at least murlocs

hearthstone,not_removed,they havent been given out yet later this week im guessing
hearthstone,not_removed,should be coming tomorrow i logged in via europe region and they showed up sadly i dont want them in that region
hearthstone,not_removed,everyone got them already must be a bug you should raise a ticket with blizzard
hearthstone,not_removed,i accidentally logged into my europe region account and they showed up there
hearthstone,not_removed,they were packs from which extension
hearthstone,not_removed,it appears they are out in eu but not na yet keep society informed bert macklin fbi
hearthstone,not_removed,wotg bro got myself a sick golden nzoth
hearthstone,not_removed,bert macklin is always on the case
hearthstone,not_removed,only you were supposed to get a golden card for each win
hearthstone,not_removed,that was the hgg vote hct vote is msog packs
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,no wonder sylvanas was rotated out
hearthstone,not_removed,its summon too man it is good that sylvanas and dreadsteed are rotating out
hearthstone,not_removed,your opinion on it doesnt change anything it is actually just rng with a smidge of confirmation bias if you dont like drawing dead heavy drops in your opening hand sometimes then you shouldnt be playing control
hearthstone,not_removed,i usually play my cthun priest and i swear cthun is always a starting card or he is somewhere between last
hearthstone,not_removed,anecdotal evidence worst evidence
hearthstone,not_removed,nozdormu mode
hearthstone,not_removed,its a cool idea and i dont think its that hard to implement kinda like speed chess blizzard pls
hearthstone,not_removed,an aggro festa
hearthstone,not_removed,its been said before here i think we all agree it would be a nice addition
hearthstone,not_removed,i guess lifecoach wouldnt dare touching it d
hearthstone,not_removed,i think you could make a whole new gaming mode something hearthstone needs in my opinion anyway out of it something like speedstone where you have per turn the decks only have cards stuff like this some mor variety in general
hearthstone,not_removed,yep this would be super fun every now and then honestly id love a blitz mode where each player ropes from the start of their turn the issue with it is that animations eat up too much of your turn when they are that short blizz would also have to disable or speed up animations for this sort of mode and that likely increases the complexity to implement andor makes it something they would never do every card they release would need to be looked at how it might break blitz mode it ramps up the complexity of future development
hearthstone,not_removed,ok but remove all animations thx
hearthstone,not_removed,weve actually had nozdormu mode for a tavern brawl once so the technology is there the problem is the animations sadly we have not advanced that far yet
hearthstone,not_removed,blitzstone nozdormode
hearthstone,not_removed,have fun in your aggroonly meta yes even worse than ladder in a nonexpansion month control decks often not always require at least seconds of thought per turn when half of that is panic by rope theyll end up not making the optimal play or they just dont want to put up with the stress
hearthstone,not_removed,rip anyone with a bad connection
hearthstone,not_removed,i wait the day i lag in this mode
hearthstone,not_removed,i found this to be my problem too im always pretty quick but my opponents end up roping every turn which is why i put nozdormu in my deck lol makes them panic every time
hearthstone,not_removed,i like it just like streetfighter
hearthstone,not_removed,just mulligan for nozdormu
hearthstone,not_removed,so isolation for cancer
hearthstone,not_removed,great idea suggested it a while back but it got buried
hearthstone,not_removed,how about a game mode that limits the total amount of time you can spent on your turns in one game for example say the limit is minutes that means your total amount of turns cannot exceed minutes but each turn can be as long as you want it the more time you used on the early turns the less you have later in the game that would add a new facet to the game as you have to be economical with your time if spent minutes one turn then you have to kill your opponent in the remaining minute and if you used up all your time by say turn each consecutive turn after that would only last seconds rope and you take regular fatigue damage
hearthstone,not_removed,rexxar versus rexxar
hearthstone,not_removed,that would be amazing isnt there a card that gives your opponent seconds to act
hearthstone,not_removed,if only there was some card you could play that would limit turns to seconds that would be pretty neat
hearthstone,not_removed,the time limit is already if you want fast paced game just play aggro
hearthstone,not_removed,sounds like a great idea for a tb
hearthstone,not_removed,strict nerf to nozdormu
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe for a tavern brawl mode but it doesnt sound fun since its just faster turns im sorry you cant get even faster games with your aggro deck
hearthstone,not_removed,nozdormode
hearthstone,not_removed,that would be a cool tavern brawl idea only give players seconds to take their turn
hearthstone,not_removed,blizzard pls but first give us a choice to disable animations then try thinking about speed
hearthstone,not_removed,my guess is that blizzard has their netcode set up in a way that actually does make it hard to implement nozdormu has been bugged on and off since closed beta they probably guess at clientside animation times and add those back in to the rope timer which doesnt really matter when you have a full seconds but it gets hairy when youre talking seconds
hearthstone,not_removed,as soon as i saw this post chess came to mind immediately
hearthstone,not_removed,sounds pretty good
hearthstone,not_removed,if everyone was playing aggro on it suddenly taunt warriors would show up just to piss them off
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah what they really need is an option to disable animations
hearthstone,not_removed,then wait turns or hope you get innervates
hearthstone,not_removed,its not about how fast op plays its about how slow his opponents play which wouldnt change based on the deck op plays
hearthstone,not_removed,its not supposed to be more fun but its nice for people who dont rope every turn i for one would play this mode
hearthstone,not_removed,i play pretty much exclusively control and id play this mode in a heartbeat
hearthstone,not_removed,modormu
hearthstone,not_removed,then blizzard would find every single buggy interaction with nozdormu in one week and fix them all at once
hearthstone,not_removed,i hear if you click on the picture of the card as its played it cancels the animation at least in some cases
hearthstone,not_removed,nozdormu has been bugged on and off since closed beta you mean on an on
hearthstone,not_removed,it will still cause an aggro meta control decks often force you to think out your entire turn before playing a card as once you take one line of play you dont have mana to change your mind so they would effectively only have seconds per turn
hearthstone,not_removed,not sure about the fixing part but theyll find them
hearthstone,not_removed,its true but honestly sometimes thinking through and executing your full turn takes way more than seconds if you play a deck that has a lot going on for example divine shield paladins etc not to mention piece of shit yogg eats up turn timer when blizzard announced he wouldnt
hearthstone,not_removed,theres a version of this game in every language its part of blizzards press release kit
hearthstone,not_removed,heh the turtle should be the warlock legendary and his intro can be i am i am a turtle would craft
hearthstone,not_removed,tbh a lot of these cards never actually make it into the game i think we saw a mana in the karazhan trailer and the closest we ended up getting was red riding hood which was uncollectable and mana to boot
hearthstone,not_removed,the wasp is a mutated silithid which do exist in one corner of ungoro think of but way more suitable for the jungle
hearthstone,not_removed,member original turtle
hearthstone,not_removed,karazhan showed archmages insight julianee and romulo all cards that one way or another made it into the expansion think thats the only time blizz showed uncollectible cards in the beginning

hearthstone,not_removed,oh yea golden monkey dummy ect well at least it most will probably end up in the game not the set
hearthstone,not_removed,instead of playing saltshaman you should just salt yourself i´ve got some salt you should listen to you would do everyone a salt inclouding your salt you dont have to learn to salt a deck that takes salt to play since you already about to salt yourself d you would be salt and people could continue playind ladder with salt d so mr saltshaman you´ve got to admit i got some salt there so go on and just salt yourself ddd thanks d
hearthstone,not_removed,time to lay off on the sodium intake too much salt coming from you right now
hearthstone,not_removed,probably not viable but the coolest new deck for me will most likely be gang up patches cannon otk
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel like the new paladin drop might fly under the radar he should be really good for secret pally in wild
hearthstone,not_removed,pirate warrior for sure i dont think secret paladin takes anything its stronger with nzoth
hearthstone,not_removed,what cards do you think secret pali will use i dont really see anything myself maybe a couple of hand buffs
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah its a shame that cannon was a gvg card its so flavorful in the theme of pirates rather than mechs that it should be in classic
hearthstone,not_removed,whatever happens mage will still be pure cancer
hearthstone,not_removed,sure they will still suck at least the fun kind of priest slow full control priest if there will be any tier priest it will be some dumb aggro or maaaybe some weird combo deck and that kind of priest is no priest at all and can just go fuck some elements and respec into shaman or something
hearthstone,not_removed,controlreactive decks will never plague the ladder unless they buff priest in a way that completely changes the identity of the class
hearthstone,not_removed,downvoting is expected but i will have the last laugh in a years time
hearthstone,not_removed,and warlock

hearthstone,not_removed,this is common dont accept friend requests unless the game was obviously good and enjoyable andor something really cool happened in it and the guy just wants to talk about it that is rarer though
hearthstone,not_removed,nobody fucking cares sory u got triggered because of some pleb
hearthstone,not_removed,welcome to hearthstone enjoy your stay
hearthstone,not_removed,i do oh well expected nothing more for the thread to to hit zero votes and fade into oblivion
hearthstone,not_removed,i guess its the first time anyones added me after a game so i wasnt quite expecting it i guess i should have kinda expected it especially after spending years seeing it happen on starcraft
hearthstone,not_removed,i was really rooting for chair that second game
hearthstone,not_removed,its was on the competitive hs subreddit a couple days ago rcompetitivehs it was called top na tempo deathrattles rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,great idea now i have a place to cry about how my opponents always draw reno thx op
hearthstone,not_removed,this is a pretty good idea actually knowing reddit a similar idea probably exists but if not might just bookmark that subreddit you planning for it to be hearthstone only or all games
hearthstone,not_removed,hell yeah man
hearthstone,not_removed,it could be for anything i suppose i mainly meant it for hs though if it doesnt take off who cares but it would be a nice facet of the community and could be an appropriate place to vent instead of here
hearthstone,not_removed,righto id suggest stretching it out to all games if it does take off though every gamer has their share of salt
hearthstone,not_removed,thats true well ill post on a couple other subreddits in a bit
hearthstone,not_removed,looks like you attacked with an acolyte of pain but didnt draw a card off it given that that guy has a grotesque dragonhawk in his deck i dont think it would be unreasonable that he also has mass dispel as well which would explain why you didnt draw an extra card or freeze the bog creeper
hearthstone,not_removed,should have done damage must be a bug
hearthstone,not_removed,ah that makes sense i wasnt entirely paying attention and i think youre correct
hearthstone,not_removed,dont get rid of maly one of the most fun cards in the game
hearthstone,not_removed,there are quite a few legends you could disenchant but malygos isnt one of them in my opinion its such a cool card and is even in some pretty good decks as someone with few cards in their collection as well dont do it
hearthstone,not_removed,malygos is better than nozdurmo for sure but unlike the other dragons he fails at staying relevant on the meta for months and this is the problem with him he comes and goes if you really like the card keep it since its not forbidden to play malygos when he phases out of the meta which brings the second issue malygos lists will be a pain if you are since its harder to make substitutions in combo decks i wouldnt dust him but it would probably gather dust if i had a account no pun intended on a account i would build a cthun priest and i would never look at priest cards again on the current meta since a lot of cards would go into cthun warrior its less dust wasted despite the awful winrates i like cthun priest because it has minions to play as a i like to play dragon priest for the same reason the cheap mage deck is so cheap that it doesnt require a lot of planning iirc if you dont want to reroll single class quests i would invest a little bit on priest because it actually needs the investment since priest is trash period mage is actually solid compared to a lot of budget priest decks i would run something like this for mage or yes you want to run do the prologue of kharazan for firelands portal brmloe buying the first wing for before the rotation is a must since you will still have the adventure after the rotation in or so i wouldnt invest resources on it as a due to the iminent rotation arena considering the state of arena i would buy classic packs instead if you really want to play arena if you arent using an hearth arena overlay or grinning goat tierlist you are at significant disvantage
hearthstone,not_removed,id argue that blackrock and league of explores is worth saving for at least buying the first wing of both with gold they contain a lot of cards that are widely used they do rotate out next year but if you do want any other cards from any of the other wings you will still have access with gold to the rest of the wings if you do ever decided to play wild it will be very worth it as for malygos keep him his ability is unique and could become useful in decks to come it is also present in decks in the current meta i wish i had him im also and this is from my personal experience playing the game
hearthstone,not_removed,hmm try building a mally rogue deck
hearthstone,not_removed,dont dust that malygos
hearthstone,not_removed,saving for blackrockleague of explorers isnt really worth it because they will rotate out of standard in months as for malygos he is used in few decks but will be kinda useless without emperor and dust can give u some important cards
hearthstone,not_removed,excuse me sir i was expecting copypasta
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,you face baaraxxus eredar sheep of the wooly legion
hearthstone,not_removed,hopefully we can become a sheep for meme purposes it will have health but it would be funny as fuck if they gave it a megaop hero power for a joke at mana
hearthstone,not_removed,we all want to know
hearthstone,not_removed,you will have the sheep and also jaraxxus hero
hearthstone,not_removed,ben brode needs to make this happen
hearthstone,not_removed,but bear in mind repentance and sacred trial trigger
hearthstone,not_removed,seasons are monthly so the new season will start february
hearthstone,not_removed,why
hearthstone,not_removed,there is no coldarra or dreadsteed for standard after the release
hearthstone,not_removed,in wild
hearthstone,not_removed,dreadstead rotates out for standard
hearthstone,not_removed,classic is always good
hearthstone,not_removed,it depends what you have and what you like classic are classic msg are new and decently strong whispers are a bit older but some of the most fun cards ive played with at the end of the day the best purchase if you plan on playing a lot and getting all of them is probably the one you have the least cards of so far
hearthstone,not_removed,classic are the most important if you are a new player
hearthstone,not_removed,classic decks every single time you can craft the gadget cards you want by disenchanting those cards classic packs will be a staple in almost every deck while mog are mostly gimmick or too expensive
hearthstone,not_removed,you need way more classic cards for almost every good deck than you do msg cards if you dont have a good collection of classic i would say almost all the commons and rares youre probably better off buying classic for now
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah the classic provide most of the base for your decks in fact druids have traditionally run about classic cards in most of their decks just because they were too good i would say if you dont have much of any of the sets classic is your best bet assuming you have cthun from your first whispers pack but msg is also strong and especially if you like the jade cards is worth getting some of those
hearthstone,not_removed,at that point its mostly epics i would say that youre likely to get but the rate isnt very good so youll probably only get a few new cards unless you have a lot of msg cards as well i would buy those
hearthstone,not_removed,gadgetzan packs
hearthstone,not_removed,go msg
hearthstone,not_removed,seems so odd that it took so long congrats man whats your average
hearthstone,not_removed,hey man grats
hearthstone,not_removed,grats i got my first recently on a lock must admit i had to make some risky plays and was rewarded
hearthstone,not_removed,the look on that man face
hearthstone,not_removed,actually not super long if you look only at arena wins i have less than a third of his total games but double his arena wins hit maybe or so times though
hearthstone,not_removed,great humble brag
hearthstone,not_removed,its definitely fixed youve just had some bad luck
hearthstone,not_removed,i have a and had a spectator quest today
hearthstone,not_removed,just bad luck
hearthstone,not_removed,cant speak on asian servers but im good
hearthstone,not_removed,a few more months probably if you ever want to play it at least buy one wing
hearthstone,not_removed,blackrock mountain the grand tournament and the league of explorers will most likely be rotating out in april
hearthstone,not_removed,what month will blackrock mountain not be rotating this one
hearthstone,not_removed,is it so hard to google it
hearthstone,not_removed,i believe ive read rotation will be april but im not completely positive on that
hearthstone,not_removed,also the next one
hearthstone,not_removed,when will blackrock mountain rotate out when the first expansion comes out ok but when does the first expansion come out
hearthstone,not_removed,april makes sense as that was when the standard rotation was introduced one year ago
hearthstone,not_removed,nobody but blizz knows look at past releases and try to find a pattern maybe thats what everyone is gonna do
hearthstone,not_removed,no fixed source but expect it around marchapril
hearthstone,not_removed,that is the most savage thing i have heard all day
hearthstone,not_removed,haha it was so by the wayly said and he didnt even pay him his full attention just brutal
hearthstone,not_removed,brutal
hearthstone,not_removed,add the link
hearthstone,not_removed,dude that is truly dirty
hearthstone,not_removed,hey there unfortunately your submission has been removed because it is low effort content see httpswwwredditcomrhearthstonewikiloweffortcontent for clarification on what is considered low effort content if youre not familiar with the subreddit rules you can read them httpswwwredditcomrhearthstoneaboutrulesrules have a question or think your post doesnt break the rules
hearthstone,not_removed,depending on the meta rogue may benefit from this card for an aggro stealth deck where shadow rager is ran with jungle panther to increase consistency of high attack stealth only serious reason i can think of
hearthstone,not_removed,freezing potion is even worse than shadow rager yet no one is complaining that mages got shafted and that this card is a big fu to mages not all cards are designed for competitive play and cards can exist purely for the sake of an inside joke people loved amgam rager despite it being a terrible card due to the joke and blizzard clearly designed this card for the same purpose reddit needs to get over how not all cards can be dr boom and that cards designed for other purposes can still make the game better as a whole and have their place magic the gathering has a lot of parallels to this and is a great read if you want to get an idea of some reasons for why bad cards should exist in the game
hearthstone,not_removed,it does feel like the designers deliberately gave rogues the shaft this expansion theyre still doing their penance for when miracle was dominant
hearthstone,not_removed,its a running gag
hearthstone,not_removed,i think its not a bad card
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont mind the card but i think most of reddit is freaking out because of the fact that rogue appears to have been shafted this expansion and printing this card is salt in the wound
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah your explanation is the better one about why reddit as a whole is mad i was trying to explain to op reasons for why blizzard created this card in the first place the whole reddit rage thing just seems completely misguided and is why i dont think blizzard will ever take it seriously since miracle rogue is in a far better position than actual dumpster decks like control paladin blizzard might take reddit slightly more seriously if we were complaining about how rogue only has one unique playstyle but instead reddit focuses on the rager and complains about how rogue is shafted despite having a top competitive deck ill believe that miracle rogue is dead when i see it
hearthstone,not_removed,yes also it wont all be released at once depending how quickly you accumulate gold you only need to have about gold now to have by the time the fourth wing is released
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah thats a very good point i already have though so i can spend now
hearthstone,not_removed,if you nolife it you can easily get the gold each week as they release even if you have zero gold after you bought the first wing
hearthstone,not_removed,you need to beat heroic for the cardback
hearthstone,not_removed,good rogue cards brode laughs in distance need to wait for few more expansions until our complaining exceeds okay shit stop here are some good cards threshold but i agree more toxin cards would be nice

hearthstone,not_removed,dude get on with the program was already posted
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah but mines shittier
hearthstone,not_removed,no arguments there thats why i reported it
hearthstone,not_removed,¯ツ¯
hearthstone,not_removed,tldr type in ¯ツ¯ for proper formatting actual reply for the ¯ツ¯ like you were trying for you need three backslashes so it should look like this when you type it out ¯ツ¯ which will turn out like this ¯ツ¯ the reason for this is that the underscore character this one is used to italicize words just like an asterisk does this guy since the face of the emoticon has an underscore on each side it naturally wants to italicize the face this guy ツ the backslash is reddits escape character basically a character used to say that you dont want to use a special character in order to format but rather you just want it to display so your first is just saying hey i dont want to italicize ツ so it keeps the underscore but gets rid of the backslash since its just an escape character after this you still want the arm so you have to add two more backslashes two not one since backslash is an escape character so you need an escape character for your escape character to displayconfusing i know anyways i guess thats my lesson for the day on reddit formatting lol caution probably very boring edit as to why you dont need to escape the second underscore read only if youre super bored or need to fall asleep edit the reason you only need an escape character for the first underscore and not the second is because the second underscore which doesnt have an escape character doesnt have another underscore with which to italicize reddits formatting works in that you need a special character to indicate how you want to format text then you put the text you want to format then you put the character again for example you would type italicize or italicize in order to get italicize since we put an escape character we have italicize and dont need to escape the second underscore since theres not another nonescaped underscore with which to italicize something in between them so technically you could have written ¯ツ¯ but you dont need to since theres not a second nonescaped underscore you would need to escape the second underscore if you planned on using another underscore in the same line but not if you used a line break aka pressed enter twice if you used an asterisk later though on the same line it would not work with the nonescaped underscore to italicize to show you this you can type italicize and it should not be italicized
hearthstone,not_removed,dammit i know i just forgot
hearthstone,not_removed,you should really reconsider playing freeze mage its not very good
hearthstone,not_removed,freeze mage doesnt really work without alex but bloodmage can be used in a variety of different decks tough choice really go with which deck you find more enjoyable to play
hearthstone,not_removed,why is that i see it a lot on tournament decklists is it because of the large amount of control warrior on the ladder
hearthstone,not_removed,awesome thanks and would you hold black knight or dust it im leaning toward holding
hearthstone,not_removed,its good in tournaments but yes on ladder it loses very easily against control warriors or decks that have a ton of healing
hearthstone,not_removed,if youre on the fence hold i regretted dusting my rag only to slowly save up for it later down the line when it started to be played
hearthstone,not_removed,ok the reason i liked freeze mage aside from the fact that it is fun to play is because it seems like it never is completely broken by changes to the game would you recommend a different deck i just dont want to get trapped creating something that turns out to suck when the next expansion comes
hearthstone,not_removed,by the time the next expansion comes youll have more dust anyways so your deck being obsolete shouldnt be too huge of a concern cards like bloodmage and alex will almost always be good either way so i wouldnt worry about that too much freeze mage is doable on ladder and probably isnt too bad as long as you can avoid the warriors near the top and the face shamans throughout its favoured against zoo and probably does ok against mid shaman if they dont draw doomhammer it is a really tough deck to learn though so expect to lose a lot with it in your first few games
hearthstone,not_removed,ok thanks yeah i feel like alex and bloodmage are solid neutral legendaries that will never be bad and best of all never get rotated out but would you recommend holding onto black knight and not dusting it i feel funny about dusting that one if it could be good
hearthstone,not_removed,blood mage can definitely be used in a few classes and alex is good in some dragon decks but personally i only have it in my freeze mage deck black knight is seeing some use in control decks or renolock especially against veklor but its a bit of a niche use
hearthstone,not_removed,ok thanks for the reply i think ill hold onto black knight then at least for the time being dusting and then having to recraft later down the line would be a dust loss which isnt worth it in my eyes
hearthstone,not_removed,im not sure if youre being sarcastic or i misunderstood the card and im going to look like a total fool but i dont think that combo will work that well i believe what will happen is your will get returned to your hand as the version as soon as it gets played basically backstabbing your own pyros but worse since it wont get revived by nzoth yeah it triggered the deathrattle but the minion didnt die it got returned to your hand
hearthstone,not_removed,its awful you play it and then it gets sent right back to your hand as a well have to see how it was actually coded to be sure theres another one sherazin whose deathrattle makes him go dormant where you have the same potentially horrible effect unless it duplicates him
hearthstone,not_removed,i think the description of pyros is missleading deathrattle is an effect that happen when a minions is destroyed so pyros has to be destroyed it just create a new minions in your hand which share pyros name but is considered by the game as a different minion the card doesnt return to your hand a new pyros is created but i think it has been described this way by blizzard to make it more understandable by players
hearthstone,not_removed,thats wrong at least based on based on pyros wording it should work the same
hearthstone,not_removed,like a quest that gives you a quest that gives you quest that gives you some game breakingly powerful card sounds good but super slow
hearthstone,not_removed,probably but we will have to wait and see for now
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think so considering it is asking the player to have a specific legendary card i would imagine an elemental quest though
hearthstone,not_removed,a bit like elise
hearthstone,not_removed,you only get the quest if you own a quest
hearthstone,not_removed,make it a gold the average quest reward is gold a reroll to get a possible extra gold or games isnt really
hearthstone,not_removed,yogg saron turns end
hearthstone,not_removed,top legend play right there
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for sharing that clip the stream crashed just before he placed it and when i got back it was all over
hearthstone,not_removed,classic toast
hearthstone,not_removed,its because he was not disguised
hearthstone,not_removed,new patch notes sap is now a mana card and will return to your hand after playing
hearthstone,not_removed,to be fair he played a sap
hearthstone,not_removed,welcome bro
hearthstone,not_removed,giving your opponent two cards is a big deal so its only suitable for mill decks or very fast decks neither of which are viable for druid
hearthstone,not_removed,because mulch does the same thing with a much less harsh drawback
hearthstone,not_removed,cause its not a consistent card to play
hearthstone,not_removed,giving your opponent two cards is a death wish against aggro and any other deck after or turns mulch is way better in that regard coldlight oracle is never played either except in the few decks where drawing your opponent cards wont matter mill decks have used both but those decks havent been top tier ever so
hearthstone,not_removed,as someone who experimented a lot with it its because its great against control decks but most of the decks on ladder empty their hand to go full aggro on you and killing their biggest minion just gives them their mortal strike two turns earlier
hearthstone,not_removed,ultimately its because removing enemy minion is not worth allowing them to draw cards in most cases
hearthstone,not_removed,in short because its very very bad see other posts for more on that
hearthstone,not_removed,except when their hand is full😈
hearthstone,not_removed,did you just say that mill isnt good with druid they are excellent for mill right now with the jade lotus my mill fatigue druid deck is doing exceptionally well right now
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks dude reallllly helpful
hearthstone,not_removed,viable probably wasnt the right word meant that mill druid isnt a top tier deck right now
hearthstone,not_removed,neither is deathrattle shaman id wager but still having a lot of fun with em d
hearthstone,not_removed,there was power creep
hearthstone,not_removed,ah one of the greatest rt animated adventures of all time

hearthstone,not_removed,on the turn when you traded golden monkeys you needed to instead trade in elise and play hallazeal and ysera awakens you would have gotten a ton of life then you could clean up reno with ysera go face with the golden monkey and the match is yours
hearthstone,not_removed,on the turn you traded the golden monkey i think it was better to not trade at all you could have dreamed his monkey and then sent every thing face damage and his health goes down to theres no way for his reno to get through your monkey then you play map and play another monkey and heal your health back to then on his turn his health is and he takes fatigue then his health is all he can do is play monkey and armor for so his total health is again then your turn again your health is and you take fatigue for your board is ysera monkey elise monkey you trade one of your monkeys into his monkey and then hit face with the rest damage his health is then on his turn he takes fatigue and he dies side note honestly tho this is a lot of math to do in a short time span the logic i was thinking is that since hes so far ahead on health the main way you win is if you can race him with face damage i didnt notice hallazeal at the time though that play is way simpler and easier to see the guaranteed win after
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe a drop what do i know though
hearthstone,not_removed,wailing soul into this would be game over straight to tier
hearthstone,not_removed,i think this is a litttller strong for a drop also maybe make it all silenced minions get
hearthstone,not_removed,wouldnt fix the real problem with priest in that it cant play a simple midrange game because of its ridiculous lack of strong early game minions it would strengthen a really gimmicky type of priest deck and would do nothing to help their arena game either
hearthstone,not_removed,if they create a card which said mana silence all creature in game and in both hands that will be amazing
hearthstone,not_removed,wailing soul has already been phased out and nobody cares about good wild decks it seems
hearthstone,not_removed,hyena from shredder

hearthstone,not_removed,golden millhouse manastorm
hearthstone,not_removed,a do you have dust or gold its a fairly major diference b how do you want to play hs standard constructed limited casual
hearthstone,not_removed,id start building towards a nzoth deck if i was you nzoth and sylvanas are the two cores but you dont really need a whole bunch of deathrattles to win with it if you had paladin murloc otk previously its pretty easy to sub in a deathrattle package instead of murlocs
hearthstone,not_removed,this just in i regret making nzoth and sylvanas
hearthstone,not_removed,dust dust i like to play standard mostly c
hearthstone,not_removed,i was actually thinking about that i have a lot of death raddle cards and i love rouge so is sylvanas really that core to have i hear her in every deck
hearthstone,not_removed,sounds like you should pick a deck you want to play in standard
hearthstone,not_removed,no one can tell you without know what is your current favorite class current legendaries play style deck types
hearthstone,not_removed,if you dont have sylvanas craft her shes the current boom tier card she is even run in non nzoth decks and because shes in classic she will be good for years to come
hearthstone,not_removed,good point im going to do this post but better latter
hearthstone,not_removed,yah good point fine its about time i craft her p also i just had a thought sylvanas gang up n zoth
hearthstone,not_removed,none of the top decks listed on tempostorm play sylvanas not one shes not close to boom tier stop telling people to craft her
hearthstone,not_removed,the reason the most recent meta snapshot doesnt include her in the top decks is because they are more aggressive decks nzoth decks run her and control decks in general run her while she may not be as must have as boom was she is probably the best legendary to craft if you dont have her i bet control decks will come back after this season ends
hearthstone,not_removed,too late
hearthstone,not_removed,so youve said that my suggestion is bad but you havent offered a superior alternative
hearthstone,not_removed,so why not wait and craft her then
hearthstone,not_removed,too late its not a mistake take a look here given you love rogue bloodmage thalanos might be the best legendary to craft
hearthstone,not_removed,maybe you can use her in a low tier deck crafting before picking a deck seems like a good move too
hearthstone,not_removed,op should pick a deck before crafting that should be obvious
hearthstone,not_removed,and i suggested nzoth why is that a terrible idea if you build it as a shell you could try to make it work in most classes
hearthstone,not_removed,most nzoth decks are well in excess of to craft and not particularly good right now
hearthstone,not_removed,
hearthstone,not_removed,i came here for the title i was disappointed
hearthstone,not_removed,just reacted to a video of twitch chat reacting to a guy who is reacting to an announcement of an announcement
hearthstone,not_removed,yo dawg
hearthstone,not_removed,nice pack congrats make sure you post on rhspulls as well they would love it
hearthstone,not_removed,meanwhile i got mayor noggenfogger
hearthstone,not_removed,i got hobart the weapon buffer guy last night hopefully theres still some luck less
hearthstone,not_removed,wow youre out of luck now im sorry to hear it got wasted on such a subpar pack when golden legendaries have a pity timer
hearthstone,not_removed,unless you were close to your pity timer thats still a great result
hearthstone,not_removed,different pity timers per expansion and kun definitely isnt a bad msog golden
hearthstone,not_removed,true i had gotten a legendary from a pack before so i guess its ok
hearthstone,not_removed,theres a lot in your post i dont agree with priest has never been more than mediocre and when the disparity of class strengths shifts between three different classes at the top it limits the evolving you are talking about rather than enhancing them the draft format by its nature gives less skilled players a chance regardless of op cards or not what op cards does however is reducing the impact of the drafting strategies you mentioned earlier if you dont get any weapons in a warrior draft youre pretty fucked same problem exists in paladin this is in my opinion a pretty large problem cause it makes the player not want to play his drafted deck tldr i disagree
hearthstone,not_removed,priest used to be right behind mage and pally back in nax warrior has been garbage until recently shaman is finally better than mediocre and druid used to be very strong pre gvg there has been a lot of fluctuation among the tier classes drafting only matter because of op cards and curve without the stronger cards there would be far less variance in the draft
hearthstone,not_removed,both druid and hunter was at the same level as priest at the time and this is many many years ago after gvg theres only been classes at the top
hearthstone,not_removed,whats more disturbing is that your opponent played a mage played recycle
hearthstone,not_removed,he got it from spellslinger lol one of my favorites tbh had in arena once it was completely bonkers
hearthstone,not_removed,it is the rarest of all the quests are you maybe a bit unlucky yes is it uncommon no i have personally had stretches without seeing it for about that long
hearthstone,not_removed,ive been playing for a year and a half i always reroll quests and i think ive gotten total dominance less than times ive actually gotten play a friend more than total dominance
hearthstone,not_removed,it happens very random for example this past week i had spectate quests and only gold quest
hearthstone,not_removed,it could be anything even a shifter zerus
hearthstone,not_removed,havent seen a post like this in half an hour thanks for reminding me
hearthstone,not_removed,can you please look if someone posted this already before shitposting or are you too mentally disabled to accomplish that
hearthstone,not_removed,and if they print elemental synergy cards only kill a tribe cards have been printed one of which was lamented as one of the worst cards ever the other hasnt been included in a deck for over years and only sees play via dark peddlar very very rarely odds are synergy is more likely
hearthstone,not_removed,theres two of them i can only think of hungry crab
hearthstone,not_removed,hemit nesingwary sp legendary from gvg which kills beasts
hearthstone,not_removed,sacrificial pact theres also that guy with battlecry silence a demon whos pretty irrelevant
hearthstone,not_removed,oh i guess him being legendary is probably why i forgot about him
hearthstone,not_removed,dragon priest
hearthstone,not_removed,tempo mage is still okay in wild dragon priest is degenerate with velens chosen midrange shaman is pretty good too and pretty cheap if you like that playstyle zoo is a lot better in wild too but it costs a bit more than in standard
hearthstone,not_removed,shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,the normal or reno variant
hearthstone,not_removed,normal midrange dragon priest
hearthstone,not_removed,wow this decks seems pretty fun to play with hows it doing on ladder
hearthstone,not_removed,so why is it called puppy monkey baby
hearthstone,not_removed,i think i dropped game from rank to rank i dont know if it will get you to legend but its competitive enough for me id say rank is its current ceiling unless the meta changes drastically with the nerfs e may have been more like
hearthstone,not_removed,it was originally a dragonmurlocbeast deck puppymonkeybaby is just more pop culturally appropriate

hearthstone,not_removed,not at all pavels doing well
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont regret it im getting at least pack right now
hearthstone,not_removed,thijs supporter no ragrets
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont regret it i mean what if thijs had insanely good draws and answers and everyone basically almost cydonia i would be a hypocrite to hold on him only when he wins i knew he would also lose too
hearthstone,not_removed,nope bandwagons are too loud for me
hearthstone,not_removed,not like thijs
hearthstone,not_removed,yes unlike most people who chose thijs because he was the only one they know i actually know many of the players because i watch hs streams far more than i actually play the game but since thijs is the one i watch the most i felt he was good enough to at least win a round or two if not the entire thing itself i regret not having analyzed the brackets thijs group probably had the toughest competition i also didnt even browse their dedklists to see how things may turn out if only i had not instalocked thijs i would have chosen amnesiac or drhippi amnesiacs pure arrogance is just reassuring and drhippi is just really good
hearthstone,not_removed,i wanted the packs but i kind of regret putting the curse on thijs in the process of trying to get them
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont feel that amnesiac is being arrogant but confident it calms the nerves a lot of the time to try to be confident and happy with how you played and part of that is vocalizing that
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah its like thundersnail where if you encourage too much you lose
hearthstone,not_removed,hes just focusing on civ because hes really into it right now waiting on the next expansion because the meta is meh
hearthstone,not_removed,i believe he said something like the meta was becoming very slow and uninteresting so hes choosing to avoid playing the game until the new expansion so he can play it like a new game
hearthstone,not_removed,because civ is awesome and i would totally buy it if i had the money
hearthstone,not_removed,nah hes too busy trying to make azeroth great again
hearthstone,not_removed,man that china legend rank compared to all the others
hearthstone,not_removed,now do it with priest
hearthstone,not_removed,grats what do you think on the difficulty and meta between different regions are they similar or the rumor is true that china is a bit more challenging
hearthstone,not_removed,holy crap congrats i have never hit legend being my highest rank but this is the first season i hit in both standard and wild that felt like an accomplishment this is amazing
hearthstone,not_removed,you are sick grand slum player
hearthstone,not_removed,thats amazing how long did that take you like how many hours per day also what decks did you play any favorites
hearthstone,not_removed,they are all with shaman doesnt count since no skill kappa wow this is actually quite the achievement time and dedication and getting that deck in the first place is quite painful if you didnt play regularly on every region before congratulations
hearthstone,not_removed,wait you can play on multiple servers do you use the same card collections
hearthstone,not_removed,congrats decklist any tips on regions and account
hearthstone,not_removed,yea i even played against guys with rank like
hearthstone,not_removed,great now do it with a copper shortsword
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks cant say anything about that the region i started with took much more time than the region i did last i dont think there is any difference between those its just the question about meta and at what time in month you try
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks just keep going youll hit legend soon
hearthstone,not_removed,it took me around games i think but i dont know exactly since i dont use any tracking software most of the time shaman and hunter but i also tried druid priest and rogue
hearthstone,not_removed,unfortunately your card collections dont carry over
hearthstone,not_removed,looks like midrange shaman from the screenshots but would have been an easy guess without the screenshots as well
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks i played with more than deck and switched cards in the list sometimes the best advice right now is just play shaman kappa and try to fill your collection with arena
hearthstone,not_removed,i do daylies on my three alts since accounts i like collecting things and i think its pretty cool to say i can duel anyone around the world
hearthstone,not_removed,do you count enjoyment as a waste of time if you do then all video games are a waste of time
hearthstone,not_removed,except no mans sky no one enjoyed that
hearthstone,not_removed,no thats pretty clearly a card deck
hearthstone,not_removed,why does it count axe as a drop s
hearthstone,not_removed,link doesnt work
hearthstone,not_removed,this thread could double as a psa on not drinking while youre pregnant
hearthstone,not_removed,this guys deck is crazy
hearthstone,not_removed,it means that when hearthstone started it leaned on warcraft to give it some brand awareness and try and tap into an existing customer loyalty base now that it is a formidable brand name in its own right it doesnt need the subtitle any more it can launch non warcraft adventures and expansions under the hearthstone brand
hearthstone,not_removed,rule after the outermost phase ends hearthstone does an aura update healthattack then does the death creation step looks for all mortally wounded or less healthpending destroy hit with a destroy effect entities and kills them removing them from play simultaneously then does an aura update other entities that have been removed from play cannot trigger be triggered or emit auras and do not take up space so it happens after all of this httphearthstonegamepediacomadvancedrulebookplayingaspell
hearthstone,not_removed,hearthstone pro tip
hearthstone,not_removed,are you just drafting completely blind if so use a tier list to help you out such as the lightforge tier list or use an overlay app like heartharena if you play on pc to help during your draft id also recommend watching good arena streamers like shadybunny adwctamerps ratsmah hafu kripp especially the first two normally go through drafts slowly and explain their picks and plays so you can get an idea of why they are picking and playing cards whenhow they are but in general arena is very tempo oriented if you dont draft a good curve and fall behind on board its usually very difficult to come back from overall though its just practice and getting the hang of how arena works
hearthstone,not_removed,arena is much more aggressive than other types of play generally speaking a okayish drop is way more valuable than a really good drop you need to hit the ground running in arena or you will just get plowed get heartharena it helps identify what you should take with each pick but dont trust it blindly if its telling you to take a slower card when a more aggressive early game card is available dont be afraid of taking that instead also class is important right now best arena classes are mage warlock priest hunter counter intuitive i know but early aggression hero power works well right now the jade classes got the least arena help in this expansion as their cards dont stand on their own as well as the other gangs
hearthstone,not_removed,yes but its nice to have different accounts ex i only play arena on eu and disenchant everything thats absolutely not necessary to craft a bunch of legendaries
hearthstone,not_removed,yes your american account will be intact
hearthstone,not_removed,how dare you call me dumb and in front of all these kind redditors
hearthstone,not_removed,kind redditors
hearthstone,not_removed,mana value
hearthstone,not_removed,does anyone know if this has been working this way for a while well misdirection is in the classic set so forever
hearthstone,not_removed,weapons are active on your turn they are not active on the enemys turn jeez its been a while but there is still a tutorial for this game right they dont just throw people in and expect em to know this stuff right
hearthstone,not_removed,thank god you posted this i really still wasnt getting it after the last posts about it
hearthstone,not_removed,the tutorial is with the mage class
hearthstone,not_removed,the opponent bans one deck so the greyed out deck is the deck that was banned to win the series you have to win once with each deck
hearthstone,not_removed,so its best of
hearthstone,not_removed,exactly the most common results are

hearthstone,not_removed,edit paragraph paragraphulate sure i already posted it by itself six hours ago buuuuuut nooooooo how could i be so eeeeeeeeeasilyyyy defeeateeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeed the ethereals roar echoed throughout the hall of explorers and the league hoisted the staff of origination back to its pedestal elise smiled dusted her hands and patted the explorers back thank you we couldnt have done it without you here as a token of my appreciation take this map it details the whereabouts of a legendary artifact the golden monkey i would very much like it for my museum once your adventures are over and what are its stats asked well if my research is correct its a four mana and imma stop you right there starseeker see ive been in contact with the cult of cthun and theyve offered me a four mana so im not sure what youre trying to pull here goodbye huffed out of the room slamming the door behind him three seconds later he wordlessly reentered the room took the map and slammed the door again then he left the room slammed the door three times for luck and went home to decorate his christmas tree the next day the old gods finally launched their assault on azeroth a cultist of cthun came knocking on door well met what what are you doing here did i miss something your minions think you are weak yes yes hail cthun are you here about that mana your nightmare begins at this the cultist struck upside the head and ran into his house cackling like a madwoman first she found collection she tossed every undead servant and robot she found into her portal to the wild frontier then she found every book of legends owned and tossed them into the fireplace their ashen dust nourished her and she used it as incense to open a portal to the void out stepped the lieutenant of cthun in all his golden glory millhouse manastorm millhouse what are you doing here asked the cultist well you see i was just spreading the word of our lord and saviour cthun by enticing the minions of yogg to waste their spells when i accidentally lost a whole bunch of my friends to the spells i let their enemies cast and i was thinking we should lay low and why should we do that i am here to spread the masters wishes and are you my master i think not why should i go with you because medivh is throwing a totally awesome party and i stole a ticket and we should crash it at this the cultist dashed into the portal with millhouse following her and she left her fellow minions behind one of them a dark aarakoa songa investigated the house to find her missing he taunted the unconscious man before songa saw the map was still clutching slowly songa picked it up and saw a map to buried treasure all he had to do was head to the temple unfortunately as songa flew there he realized that he was having a hard time finding it the temple should be in a giant purple area right next to the letter r but he couldnt find any words on the world anywhere he tried reading the map for further directions but all it talked about was shuffling itself into decks eventually he landed in gadgetzan where his cousin talin was hiding out hey songa what brings you here a search for treasure whats up i uh im in a bit of a pickle see i sort of kind of accidentally got in debt to a gang and you what im sorry what kind of treasure pure gold im listening so talin who was not geographically illiterate found the temple in about fifteen minutes there were dastardly traps and fiendish guardians all throughout fortunately they all predictably fell to talins midrange shaman there in the temple altar stood the golden monkey or at least where the golden monkey should be instead there lay a note from garrosh hellscream iou one golden monkey will return once i beat magni in this childrens card game i should be done in about three years heartbroken talin left the temple songa tried to follow but once again got completely lost and wandered into several more rooms before returning to gadgetzan in the kabals secret chamber kazakus asked talin where again his money was im sorry i swear just give me a little more time youll get it i promise excuse me mr kazakus sir will this be enough to cover his debt the dragon troll turned sharply to the right there stood songa alone the inner sanctum of the kabal was filled with silence in his hands pilfered from the golden temple lay a large fully golden frog statuette kazakus smiled you may have a future here you two
hearthstone,not_removed,glix was wondering why he ever left shattrath city when his keen eyes spotted the jade lotus courier trying to blend among the crowd that was gathered in front of the arena glix loathed the task he was given a mage of his power should not have to resort to such tricks yet he did not dare disobey his masters wishes he could still hear the words that kazakus spoke do not fail me glix should the exchange take place i will pluck every feather from your body the image of his predecessors mutilated body flashed before his eyes as he recalled how his master deals with failure not me he thought i am way better than that old fool a moment later he spotted the grimestreet informant making his way through the crowd towards the jade lotus courier he was certain now the deal was going to take place right here aya was a shrewd woman and her plan might have fooled others but not his master glix immediately started chanting it was a soothing and slow melody that shrouded him in a mystical veil one that could not be pierced by the gaze of lesser species the sketti exiles had used the same incantation to break free from terokk it rendered them completely invisible and immune to any form of magic for a short period of time with careful and calculated steps glix glided through the crowd until he found himself staring at the back of the lotus courier he reached under his robe and grabbed the potion of madness his master had given him he flung it on his target with one hand as he grabbed the small statue from his backpack with the other chaos ensued as the poor courier maddened by the effect of the potion started attacking anyone in his sight magical bolts flew right and left but glix was no longer there with the golden frog carefully tucked under his robe he was speeding towards his headquarters just in time he thought as he felt the effects of the enchantment fading away moments later he was standing in front of kazakus himself hands trembling he offered the small statue to his master it is done master it all happened as you predicted jade lotus and the grimestreet goons will not be making any alliances today
hearthstone,not_removed,golden monkey golden hex ughhh golden frog
hearthstone,not_removed,roses are red violets are blue mana hex is coming for you
hearthstone,not_removed,arrakoa disenchants his golden murloc to craft dr boom
hearthstone,not_removed,it was on that fateful night
hearthstone,not_removed,this card was originally supposed to be a shaman minion mana battlecry transform an enemy minion into a frog but it was deemed too weak for shaman so they modified it a bit and gave it to priest instead
hearthstone,not_removed,obviously golden hex
hearthstone,not_removed,its babel frog of course
hearthstone,not_removed,am i the only one that noticed that arakkoa is misspelled in the flavor text they must rely too much on their spelling correction and havent added warcraft races to it
hearthstone,not_removed,there once was an arrakoa named quinn some trouble he found himself in in search of funnel cake he did all it would take to get those tasty morsels in him one day in search of his sweets he walked far past the safe streets a croak he did hear the noise filled him with fear a frog he did find at his feet unlike its family of natural green this frogs body had a strange sheen gold was its coat sure to fetch a pretty note quinn snatched it before any others had seen desperately now he seeks a buyer his situation indeed quite dire for the gold frog was cursed no fate could be worse than to host the eternal croak choir
hearthstone,not_removed,it aint easy to spot at lotus spy even if hes taunting with a frog right in front of you
hearthstone,not_removed,kinda reminds me of the little mermaid but instead of stealing a voice with a golden shell its a golden frog or the embodiment of having a frog in your throat and silence is golden
hearthstone,not_removed,when an arrakoa shoves a golden frog toward you theres just no words
hearthstone,not_removed,it is a flute the arrakoa uses this to lure murlocs and then feed on them tasty tasty murloc jambes
hearthstone,not_removed,the golden frog has a dark and secret past fanfic
hearthstone,not_removed,that was his frog
hearthstone,not_removed,a failed transmutation attempt arakkoa are great enchanters but clearly not that good alchemists
hearthstone,not_removed,so this taunting golden frog walks into a shoe shop and asks for the finest feathery organic breathing offcurve shoes the shopkeeper a majestic arrakoa laughs at the request saying that there be no such thing in his shop the frog sneered a mighty grin went across his face as he raised his slippery hand and pointed at the arrakoa trembling by the realisation of what the frog meant the arrakoa silenced the frog but nothing happened the kabal songstealer slash shoe salesbird couldnt steal a ribbit from the frog and thus the golden frog got his new pair of shoes
hearthstone,not_removed,asking gamers to write a fanfic what could go wrong
hearthstone,not_removed,the night was humid
hearthstone,not_removed,well i dont know what an arrakoa actually is but i did see the book of mormon recently enough to have an idea of why it has a frog
hearthstone,not_removed,i promise you this golden frog will make your entire deck a legendary deckgolden monkey never heard about it
hearthstone,not_removed,something something golden yoggsaron
hearthstone,not_removed,clearly a foreshadowing of the future nerf to hex
hearthstone,not_removed,youre just gonna songsteal it nice try guy
hearthstone,not_removed,there once was a man from nantucket whose thumb was so long he could suck it he said with a grin as he wiped off his chin if my ear was a butt i could plug it golden frog

hearthstone,not_removed,beautiful
hearthstone,not_removed,im honestly surprised no one has done one of these for babbling book yet
hearthstone,not_removed,the end
hearthstone,not_removed,youre wrong obviously golden yogg
hearthstone,not_removed,theres a kharazan card that mentions ysera in its flavor text unless they fixed it in the patch
hearthstone,not_removed,go on
hearthstone,not_removed,spicy menagerie memes
hearthstone,not_removed,but why its not like i mentioned him in there though in retrospect i probably should have wait is he in charge of the gadgetzan writers award
hearthstone,not_removed,for paragraph version i posted it three hours before this thread went up edit eh it was pretty easy to do paragraphs here anyway
hearthstone,not_removed,tldr s golden frog is from the same temple as the he stole the map from you after helping and disenchant all your wild cards back when he was the card art is him offering the frog to in order to nullify s debt to the kabal and then kazzie hires them both
hearthstone,not_removed,i didnt read it either but im gonna guess it has something to do with hex and the golden monkey

hearthstone,not_removed,not the monkey the shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,le ugh
hearthstone,not_removed,the stars themselves outlining the future
hearthstone,not_removed,its never lethal when the opponent has knife juggler on the other side and you need to rely on leeroy
hearthstone,not_removed,you can only have one of each legendary card in a deck instead of the usual two they are usually more powerful but not always the expansions are really good but blackrock and league of explorers will be rotating out in the beginning of karazhan will stay for quite a while the cards in the expansions are definitely worth it blackrock mountain had a few good ones but its main focus was making a bunch of dragon cards league of explorers had reaalllyyyy good cards karazhan also had a lot of pretty good ones
hearthstone,not_removed,yes yes either are good
hearthstone,not_removed,greetings new player for legendary cards you dont get an extra card you can only have copy of a legendary card in your deck when you construct it prince malchezar allows you to have extra because of his effect the expansions are definitely worth it if you have money to drop on packs go for it however i recommend buying the expansions first you can get packs pretty easily with gold saved from quests or you can improve your arena skills and basically get packs for free
hearthstone,not_removed,u get pack for participating and get packs per win
hearthstone,not_removed,youll get packs
hearthstone,not_removed,i hate to beat the guy up but i really do think he played among the worst in the tourney a lot of really questionable calls
hearthstone,not_removed,ive said it before and ill say it again rngstone is silly to bet on just bet on the most handsomeguy
hearthstone,not_removed,it sounds like he was manipulating stats and harassing streamers no tracking is better than tainted tracking and if he really was engaging in such practices then the arena community has definitely gained from its removal
hearthstone,not_removed,thanks for posting op i wouldnt have known to check the front page otherwise
hearthstone,not_removed,the latest copy of the google sheet i have is from does anybody have a more recent copy
hearthstone,not_removed,is the original spreadsheet guy post still up doesnt seem to be linked in ratsmahs rebuttal
hearthstone,not_removed,no tracking is better than tainted tracking whats depressing is that this applies to so many things
hearthstone,not_removed,it doesnt say on the front page that the spreadsheet was removed though
hearthstone,not_removed,alt accounts jesus christ wouldnt have expected that not even unidan went that far
hearthstone,not_removed,the thread is here but the contents of the op have been deleted the thread had been removed
hearthstone,not_removed,i dont think he actually posted it was just some random user that noticed the wall of text on ratsmahs section
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i was just saying i wouldve never known about this if i hadnt come across ops post
hearthstone,not_removed,it was pretty obvious that he was vote manipulating if you check the comment votes on say the dispute he had with shadybunny yesterday or any earlier ones really shadybunny was obviously being the reasonable one and getting down voted to hell while his own inane posts got up voted
hearthstone,not_removed,it looked like sarcasm my bad
hearthstone,not_removed,i actually thought it was sarcasm too just the wording of your comment
hearthstone,not_removed,i understand vote manipulation and ik it was pretty obvious he had some shady stuff going on but alt accounts is real dedication
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah it does seem like it doesnt it its not though
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah it does seem like it doesnt it its not though
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah that is pretty crazy anyway i presume mods have access to hashes of ip addresses so they can easily identify sockpuppets beyond a shadow of a doubt
hearthstone,not_removed,yea ik mb then gave you an upvote
hearthstone,not_removed,cool i gave you one too
hearthstone,not_removed,whatever legendary you need to make the deck you want to play
hearthstone,not_removed,it really just depends on what deck you want to play yoggsaron is in a lot of decks so that could definitely be a good candidate
hearthstone,not_removed,well gruul is trash sees zero play so any legendary from the classic cards would be a ton more valuable for you sylvanas or ragnaros most likely
hearthstone,not_removed,rag sylvanas and tirion are probably the best option in the long run since they are in the classic set however yogg and nzoth are both really strong and popular really just depends on what you want to play

hearthstone,not_removed,credits go to the streamer who can be found at and the op ureloh brought to you by your friendly neighborhood bot happy new year
hearthstone,not_removed,they told us like a year ago that this update would be an expansion and they told us again just a few weeks ago
hearthstone,not_removed,there will be no adventures in the year of the mammoth only expansions
hearthstone,not_removed,they are not doing adventures anymore it was quite clear in both the announcement blog post which you should have read at least one of
hearthstone,not_removed,they already announced that you were not prepared
hearthstone,not_removed,if i recall correctly they said somewhere a little while ago about doing short single player stuff here and there just not for the big releases
hearthstone,not_removed,against freeze mage you have to be on the aggressive this is going to be difficult assuming youre playing some controlling variant of priest if they use a fireball on your onyx bishop keep in mind that thats damage not at your face save your entomb for archmage alextraza or emperor these are the only threatening minions theyll play against you save priest of the feast along with some cheap spells to get out of range after they alextraza you also dont be afraid to lose value on your board wipes excavated evil against just a loot hoarder may be the most value youll get out of it in that matchup this is a hard fight for priest youre definitely going to be unfavored in the matchup
hearthstone,not_removed,key point is identifying whether its a freeze mage or not notable cards would be novice acolyte or a very slow start once you know its freeze you can also start playing very slowly and not committing to the board much you wanna always be prepared for an alexstraza on turn so try saving shadow word death and flash heal try to remain above its a hard matchup for priest tbh but in standard the represent only approx of the matchups that also in higher levels and even in wild their numbers are dwindling due to everyone teching eater of secrets
hearthstone,not_removed,its all in the timing on pof wait until your at or lower and then pump your pof for cakes the mage will kill that and work you over for some time until youre about again then you hopefully can do the same thing and if everything played out correctly the mage should be too low on burn to finish out the game obviously pofshadow word death on alex will be probably the most important turn of that game so be preped for it playing pof earlier just to have something on board will be biggest misplay you can make its much better to just wait it out unless youre running some sick heal options other than pof
hearthstone,not_removed,thats what i already do i try to keep enough minions in hand in case of a board removal and bait the flamestrikes early with low value stuff even if ive controlled the game the entire time and have full health they just survive with ice block do face damage freeze my board and kill me next turn maybe im just getting really unlucky but i just want to concede when i see mage
hearthstone,not_removed,vs a priest freeze mage can just for for a full otk
hearthstone,not_removed,its naturally a tough match up no matter what version of priest you are playing on the opposite side warrior is an almost impossible match up for freeze its typically better to accept that their are a few match ups you just cant win and move on and work on getting better at the match ups you can win
hearthstone,not_removed,it could happen but they would really need the god hand if the priest isnt doing anything all game then i really dont know what to say priest is really shitty though so i wouldnt even be surprised if a mage did just cycle through all cards while also holding every good burn spell in hand
hearthstone,not_removed,reynad thinks someone his ghosting him in other news kripp is salty about something does something silly and kibler plays a dragon
hearthstone,not_removed,opponent takes a risk to be one step closer to victory renyad can only think the opponent is sniping him reynad realises sniping is not possible reynad concludes the other player is bad lul why is reynad such a sore loser he got outplayed and instead of applauding the audacity of the opponent critisizes the decision that made the victory as a bad play rofl
hearthstone,not_removed,why is this crap front page
hearthstone,not_removed,oh man im a fucking idiot better find a lame excuse about eu or asians being trash reynad puts the prehistoric theory of people with big foreheads having higher intelligence to rest
hearthstone,not_removed,so because of timezone differences his opponent doesnt affected by delay o
hearthstone,not_removed,one reason i cant watch reynad for too long if someone does anything not normal its automatically ghosting
hearthstone,not_removed,why this is important it wasnt funny it wasnt salty it wasnt nothing other than a waste of time
hearthstone,not_removed,he is embarrassed about being wrong but not man noodle enough to own up to it
hearthstone,not_removed,why is that dude streaming the dumpster in asian on delay he kept bullshitting about being in na and didnt play for a few days there yadayada id bet serious money that he had a fat losingstreak on na and is in the dumbster aswell but has too big ego to show it on he will say meh didnt play had no time time was top at the end
hearthstone,not_removed,reynads such a whiny kid
hearthstone,not_removed,what a massive bitch
hearthstone,not_removed,didnt see the game but maybe he tested for removal before playing it
hearthstone,not_removed,credits go to the streamer who can be found at and the op ukloricker brought to you by your friendly neighborhood bot happy new year
hearthstone,not_removed,his ego needs protection way more than his win rate no more delay please
hearthstone,not_removed,yes taking risks and making all in plays with rogue must mean youre a bad player cough edwin cough
hearthstone,not_removed,probably got to legend using shaman or agro warrior
hearthstone,not_removed,and noxious has his doomsayer get ancestors calld
hearthstone,not_removed,and lifecoach is cute while amaz is cringy for doing the same thing
hearthstone,not_removed,and reckful misses lethal
hearthstone,not_removed,to be fair that was a pretty bad play under most circumstances and post hoc results dont change that his opponent was either bad or more likely desperate
hearthstone,not_removed,it was a shit play
hearthstone,not_removed,well to be fair the play was very bad though
hearthstone,not_removed,a while back i got matched up against reynad and when i went back and found my match on his stream he called me a sniper he had a shadow flame and po in his card hand with a token on board i cleared the token with one of my minions because i was guaranteed to win next turn as long as he didnt wipe my board
hearthstone,not_removed,this is what drives me up the wall about some streamers any time the opponent takes a risk that wins them the game they are bad like no dude they just won its like in american football if the score is after you score a touchdown you can either kick the extra point and go into overtime or go for and win the game going for is risky kicking the point is safe but if you go for and win the last thing that your opponent could say about you is that you are bad
hearthstone,not_removed,to add to this the rogue could have gotten the read that a reynad didnt have swipewrathferal ragewhatever from previous turns reading your opponents hand and seeing what type of cards they use to do something is an important indicator of what they may or may not have
hearthstone,not_removed,narcissism honestly he cant accept that this game has tons of variance and the better player doesnt always win he cannot look at the bigger picture and just focuses on the losses i dont understand why he keeps playing this game when he clearly cannot accept that the game doesnt always reward the better players this is why i strongly prefer streamers like dog who basically never complain about snipers to the extent reynad does dog does get a little angry at times but he doesnt let it affect his mood and by extension the quality of his stream
hearthstone,not_removed,why wouldnt you gamble so you at least get some damage in case he has living roots in hand playing it bare feels like the worst option unless he had already played roots personally i would be greedy and hold it who am i kidding i would ghost reynad and post it on youtube
hearthstone,not_removed,im actually with reynad theres not really much gained from that play unless he thinks he has lethal next turn the extra card doesnt take the questing outside of spell damage range at least spells in a normal jade druid deck could snipe it and risks a critical damage piece maybe that other player has some very specific turn planned that he needed all his mana for but off hand it looked like a pretty bad play
hearthstone,not_removed,because watching salty man reynad get proved wrong is satisfying
hearthstone,not_removed,i mean reynad isnt wrong doing what the rogue did here was a very risky play
hearthstone,not_removed,im assuming reynoodle thought his opponent was ghosting because he thought they knew he had no removal but then he realized hes currently streaming on a minute delay so theres no way they could have been
hearthstone,not_removed,prior to this play his opponent had a tomb pillager and a swashbuckler this would have been an easy swipe play and so by coldblooding the questing his opponent plays around living roots something reynad might actually have reynad then think the guy is sniping which is silly because he just showed the prior turn he didnt have swipe
hearthstone,not_removed,that definitely looked like ghosting though obviously it turns out he was wrong but i would have thought the same thing
hearthstone,not_removed,it wasnt salty
hearthstone,not_removed,his standard excuse when losing games is that the opponent was ghosting which in this case he realized is absolutely impossible thats absolutely hilarious where is your sense of humor
hearthstone,not_removed,he showed his na rank on stream multiple times when he had rank one at the beginning of the month the fact that he quit showing it later in the season probably has more to do with not wanting to patronize every baseless claim he does not actually have the rank he claimed to have
hearthstone,not_removed,thats not a fair comparison the risk that the rogue in this video took was a completely unneccessary one with a huge downside there is nothing that you protect your questing adventurer from if you bump it up from to health if the druid has removal for it he can remove it if he doesnt have that removal he cant but if he does remove it you just wasted a card for free that you could have easily played on the following turn for guaranteed damage
hearthstone,not_removed,reynad invented aggro shaman
hearthstone,not_removed,and noxious has his doomsayer get ancestors calld hey grandpa nobody is playing ancestors call anymore dirty rat is the new thing
hearthstone,not_removed,what
hearthstone,not_removed,haha agree life coach does what amaz does but he sounds retarded while doing it people just follow what the crowd says
hearthstone,not_removed,that is the point reynad immediately jumps to the explanation that the player is dumb actually thats not it he jumped straight to this whole server is dumb
hearthstone,not_removed,what makes this a good play is that reynads opponent made the correct decision he probably did not have a tomb pillager to play and he needed to have something on board otherwise the druid can innervate a huge minion that might not be killed with evis or whatever damage you have in hand its not the best play at all ill give you that but in order to win a game you dont have to think about which plays worked for you in the past but more about which plays can you do to win the game
hearthstone,not_removed,i just googled post hoc thanks
hearthstone,not_removed,might not be there most competitive server but at legend i doubt he was bad
hearthstone,not_removed,but making a generally bad play is not a sign of being a bad player to determine whether the rogue player is bad we must see his hand
hearthstone,not_removed,reynad is delusional he thinks he is like a god of skill with bad draws i dont like his attitude when losing he should accept that there are thousands of people that are better than him at hs and millions of people who are more intelligent
hearthstone,not_removed,if you dont understand that one good outcome doesnt make it the correct play then why are you playing card games lol
hearthstone,not_removed,bad players make terrible plays all the time that reduce their chances of winning but work occasionally he didnt need to cold blood an inactive minion there he couldve just waited a turn and not wasted damage and a card a more accurate analogy is me playing someone in street fighter goofing around because shes awful and spamming meaty dps on her wake up just because i know shell hit a button obviously its not a good play or good risk just because it worked when i couldve just done normal fmp and been completely safe on block if she actually blocked excusing scrubbiness in a game full of high variance is a reddit thing to do
hearthstone,not_removed,this is what drives me up the wall about some streamers any time the opponent takes a risk that wins them the game they are bad like no dude they just won this reminds me of a couple months ago while playing pokémon on showdown i built a team with metagross venusaur etc all mons i like but built the metagross specifically to counter xerneas using high sp def to stand that devilish monster got matched with a highly ranked player that had friends watching the match as well i proceeded to win the game with some audacious switches and unorthodox questionable plays they eventually conceded and pmd me saying i was a bad player and only won because i was using a cteam a team that counters the current meta which i wasnt haha
hearthstone,not_removed,when you have a terrible hand you have to take higher risks which might have been the case here
hearthstone,not_removed,what i have learned over a lot of time playing videogames is that you should never assume your enemy is a bad player especially in cardgames where you cant see your opponents hand and a bad play from your point of view might still be the best he could do with his cards
hearthstone,not_removed,i didnt see the rest of the game but depending on what the rogue did he could have ruled out a lot of clears that reynad may have had based on play on previous turns and then just thrown down the questing cold blood as an ultimatum that said either you top deck an answer or i win off of this
hearthstone,not_removed,risky yes but not bad i havent watched the whole game but i guess by turn reynad had played some removal the other player decided to take a risk that reynad would not be able to remove with cards in hand that is not a bad play reynad is wrong
hearthstone,not_removed,i think you missed the joke here
hearthstone,not_removed,to be fair to the noodle it was pretty damn blatant these past few nights and it wasnt just eh maybe hes playing weird in a justincase fashion no it was some really dumb stuff like just playing a questing on turn or and not concealing it against a rogue in the mirror or not daggering up with extra mana after doing almost nothing because of harrison that was drawn a turn ago
hearthstone,not_removed,i feel like you are being a bit unfair here since that plays directly into wrath which from what you said wasnt ruled out
hearthstone,not_removed,thats not even true reynad used nourish to gain mana and after that he had only mana left so the only removal that couldve killed the tomb pillager with was mulch yeah he wouldve maybe dropped playing nourish and played swipe instead if he had it in his hand but that is entirely dependant on his hand for example if i had good or drops to follow up the nourish play then i wouldnt have played swipe the opponent couldnt be absolutely sure that reynad wasnt holding swipe the prior turn and the rogue didnt even play around reynad holding wrath or azure drake living roots either
hearthstone,not_removed,what if reynad was bluffing like mad and baiting out the questy guy cold blood
hearthstone,not_removed,thats called being a good player
hearthstone,not_removed,you protect it from living roots a tempo minion or a card draw wrath ping in a matchup where card draw is huge and if he does have to ping it with his face for whatever reason he takes an extra damage on top of that initial to think this incremental damage doesnt add up in a huge way is absurd especially when druid has very strong lifegain options but that are rather slow to play the rogue was simply trying to close the game out quickly before the druid set up big taunts or established strong board control which is far from a viable strategy especially when reynads hand count was low he simply had a game plan and stuck with it the almost guaranteed win if the druid doesnt have removal far outweighs the downside of losing when he does
hearthstone,not_removed,it was not unnecesary you dont know the rogues hand
hearthstone,not_removed,the risk that the rogue in this video took was a completely unneccessary one with a huge downside maybe that was the best he could do with a garbage hand any rogue players would know that sometime your hand is so fucking bad because half of your deck is filled with dead cards you need to play something on board to either buy some time until auctioneer or just hope the opponent cant deal with it
hearthstone,not_removed,back in my day we didnt need no dirty rat pullin out doomsayers n whatnot we got em in shredders or mind gamed em like decent folk
hearthstone,not_removed,i think hes referring to how some streamers not just in the hearthstone community are said to be overreacting and cringy while other streamers are applauded for showing genuine emotion when theyre doing pretty much the exact same thing
hearthstone,not_removed,the whole server is dumb thing isnt based on this player alone its been a longstanding opinion of his with this acting as confirmation in his eyes
hearthstone,not_removed,if he just needed something on board he wouldve played the adventurer without the cold blood only buffing up after reys biggie comes out the cold blood was a foolhardy bet that raynad had no removal by chance it worked but times overcommitting like this dont pay off and you end up losing two cards to one this is a similar mistake to what newbies make when they barf out their hand into a boardclear on the other hand its more reasonable to assume reynads opponent had a really bad draw and this was his hail mary we dont know what his hand was
hearthstone,not_removed,its not a good play though to paste what i posted above he should have absolutely cold blooded the swashbuckler to get the guaranteed damage to face both get punished by the same cards swipewrath and even if reynad hero powers the swashbuckler next turn cold blood effectively hits face twice which is just about the best outcome you can expect from putting it on the questing adventurer edit in fact putting it on swashbuckler is better against wrath because one wrath doesnt deal with both the questing adventurer and the cold blood reynad is totally justified to think it was a bad play here
hearthstone,not_removed,i swear ive heard lifecoach say thats just how you play rogue after playing a huge questing and hoping that the opponent doesnt have removal early in the game
hearthstone,not_removed,no to determine if hes a bad player we have to see him make many plays to determine if it was a bad play we have to see his hand
hearthstone,not_removed,funny thing is reynad has a rant video on that specific mentality
hearthstone,not_removed,right lol in blackjack hitting on a hard and getting a doesnt mean it was a good play it means you got lucky doing something bad but there is a calculated risk factor here his opponent could have seen no other lines to a winning game without that play so it made sense even if risky reynad doesnt know what is in his opponents hand
hearthstone,not_removed,this issue is why good hearthstone players are so careful to use the words correct and incorrect rather than good and bad when referring to plays there is often a correct play when it comes to maximizing win probability
hearthstone,not_removed,you just said you were trying to counter xerneas
hearthstone,not_removed,can confirm that throwing an unorthodox mon onto your team just to throw them off truly can do wonders
hearthstone,not_removed,it reminds me of civ games going for wonders or attacking superior forces is risky but if you are losing are in a bad position or suspect a snowball you gotta take risks or you might as well quit
hearthstone,not_removed,i thought of that before playing lol then i stopped caring and just played efficiently regardless of what the others do works in every game
hearthstone,not_removed,its not turn its turn why even say in allcaps that he is wrong if you cant even be arsed to watch the game
hearthstone,not_removed,yeah i saw that pretty bs honestly i thought he was just being salty cause i thought there was no way asian opponents would really go on twitchtv to snipe and then his opponent unleashed the most obvious sniping moves
hearthstone,not_removed,any play an opponent makes that plays around anything can be argued as ghosting from a streamers side its really easy to convince yourself of that when you can only see one side i hate this costant complaining from salty streamers like reynad that whenever an opponent makes any play hes somehow cheating or ghosting or sniping because clearly all his opponents cant possibly make a good play by themselves right only reynad can proof this fucking twitch clip
hearthstone,not_removed,living roots hero power feral rage etc it was a desperation play for sure
hearthstone,not_removed,i know youre exagerrating with but for certain streamers its definitely pretty common i wont venture a guess as to a certain percentage i do wish he wouldnt complain about it though you have the option to run a delay but often dont because of the chat experience you cant have it both ways pick one
hearthstone,not_removed,and if he does have to ping it with his face for whatever reason he takes an extra damage on top of that initial if the druid has wrath or swipe you dont get the extra damage at all but you can get that damage guaranteed if you play the card at a later stage of the game
hearthstone,not_removed,this is moronic reynad had already played a roots making the second one very unlikely especially given if he had both copies he likely wouldve played one to contest the the cold blood is damage plus a card it is completely idiotic to suggest that wasting damage a card is worth it just to prevent your opponent from cycling a wrath in fact playing into the damage wrath allows reynad to ping the and go into his mana turn cleanly it also makes a fairly bad swipe into a much better one takes an extra damage on top of the initial first of all he cold blooded an inactive minion so there was no initial secondly he takes because the druid heal for one a turn i really do wonder why people who are clearly not very advanced players are the loudest
hearthstone,not_removed,i think the reason for that is that people feel like amaz isnt genuine but just screeching like a harpy whenever something happens whereas lifecoach is such a weird dork that its just hard to believe hed be faking it
hearthstone,not_removed,and hes not wrong either asia is by far the weakest server
hearthstone,not_removed,thats what i am saying he had a really bad hand he thought how can i win this game and then came out with a play that won him the game is like bluffing your way out of a really bad hand if you lose you look like a fool if you win you are a hero high riskhigh reward is not always a foolish play if that is your best out
hearthstone,not_removed,your play is just a lower risklower reward play if you cold blood the swashurglar it is guaranteed that the cold blooded creature will die if you cold blood the qa if it dies you loose cold blood and most likely game if it survives you win game most of the times
hearthstone,not_removed,a questing is not a huge questing and dies to all druid removal a questing dies to the same things and he wasted cold blood that could have combod and did damage the next turn you only use the cold blood if you put it out of range of those removals or want to make it extremely painful to weapon down for weapon classes
hearthstone,not_removed,we will see about that if the ladder system changes
hearthstone,not_removed,it was a bad play though he should have absolutely cold blooded the swashbuckler to get the guaranteed damage to face both get punished by the same cards swipewrath and even if reynad hero powers the swashbuckler next turn cold blood effectively hits face twice which is just about the best outcome you can expect from putting it on the questing adventurer edit in fact putting it on swashbuckler is better against wrath because one wrath doesnt deal with both the questing adventurer and the cold blood reynad is totally justified to think it was a bad play here
hearthstone,not_removed,just the metagross the rest of the team wasnt even tier
hearthstone,not_removed,because he is wrong he got outplayed outskilled and outsmarted the opponent made a read and then a play that won the game now tell me please enlighten me and let me know what difference does it make if its turn or turn the fact that i didnt say the turn correctly does not change the situation a tiny bit
hearthstone,not_removed,ya but when people make plays that are bad of the time because they know you either have no answer for their play or the perfect answer for their would be play its usually not always because of ghosting specifically for streamers who get very large amounts of viewers this is much less relevant if you have a viewer stream
hearthstone,not_removed,there was some stupidly blatant shit the other night to be fair reynad had a harrison jones as reno mage which is not something you see every day these days and as soon as he drew it the rogue opponent stopped hero powering unless he was going to use a dagger hit even when he was floating like mana
hearthstone,not_removed,if what others have said about the game state is true he had a pretty strong no removal in hand read you would probably swipe pillager over mulching it youve seen living roots you would maybe wrath hero power pillager over mulch and would definitely feral rage pillager over mulch though i do think reynad is right about the bad thing for one thing you cold blood the over the questing and even though you have a pretty good no removal read there are so many removals in deck that him top decking it is actually good odds so youd only go for questing cold blood if your alternative was edwin or hero power pass
hearthstone,not_removed,sure but its still kind of arbitrary its the same as when people complain about say jimmy fallon plenty of people criticise him for being over the top and fake but to me he just seems like an enthusiastic and easily excitable dude
hearthstone,not_removed,but what difference does cold blood this turn vs next turn make barring the niche scenario where he somehow cant activate the combo its the exact same outcome to play it on either turn but playing it next turn doesnt get punished by removal there was no reward difference to playing it this turn or next turn in almost every case it was high risk low reward
hearthstone,not_removed,whether you cold blood the qa or swashbuckler they both die to the same cards wrathswipeferal rage as i said earlier cold blooding the buckler is actually better against wrathferal rage because it splits his threats putting it on qa allows reynad to deal with both threats in one card putting it on buckler forces reynad to hero power the buckler down in addition to dealing with qa if you cold blood the swashurglar it is guaranteed that the cold blooded creature will die this isnt a bad outcome though you deal to face and force reynad to spend mana for a hero power maybe i play too many mid range decks but in my experience if a single cold blood hits face twice you usually lose regardless
